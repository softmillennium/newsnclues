For Black August, Mireille Fanon Mendès-France sets the record straight on her father's revolutionary legacy.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Public gatherings this week in Jackson, Mississippi and New Orleans, Louisiana — featuring an especially distinctive guest — will honor the legacy of revolutionary psychiatrist Frantz Fanon (1925-1961). The Black Alliance for Peace, an African internationalist organization committed to peace and opposition to war and imperialism, and Cooperation Jackson, which is building a solidarity economy anchored by worker-owned co-ops in West Jackson, are co-hosting several Black August events with Fanon's eldest daughter. Mireille Fanon Mendès-France is a jurist, an educator, and an anti-racism expert who passionately shares her father's commitment to rebellion against colonialism in its many forms. She founded the Frantz Fanon Foundation in 2007 to connect his theoretical work to ongoing anti-colonialist struggles like those Black communities throughout the Deep South are facing, especially the kind of ongoing mass displacement that occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina 20 years ago. Kali Akuno of Cooperation Jackson told Truthout that Fanon Mendès-France has a great deal to share about her father's contributions in raising consciousness about what it takes to fight against fascism, “because that is what we are staring down.”

Fanon fought the Nazis in World War II with the Free French Forces. Later, he fought for independence against the reactionary colonial regime in Algeria, which, Akuno said, used Nazi tactics against the national liberation movement. “We are doing this consciousness raising in a period where they are deliberately erasing all oppositional history and knowledge, and they're doing it very intentionally under the color of law. If we don't recall the lessons of our earlier generations who fought against colonial erasure, who fought against white supremacy, then we're gonna lose this battle before it even begins.” Akuno explained that a backdrop to all this is the ongoing genocide in Palestine; Fanon Mendès-France is directly tied into the struggle of Arab and North African/Southwest Asian people. “There's many intersections that we're trying to get at this year, and she's one of the best people who encapsulates it all.” 

Shortly before her travels to the U.S., Mireille Fanon Mendès-France spoke to Truthout by phone about combating disinformation about her father's work, her eagerness to be in community in the U.S. with anti-colonial activists, and why defeatism is not an option. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Frances Madeson: The centenary of Frantz Fanon has inspired commemorative events all over the world — in Martinique, the Caribbean island where he was born on July 20, 1925, into French colonial dominance in the region; across Europe, where he studied psychiatry and began to write explicitly about the anti-Black racism he encountered there; in Africa, where he lived and was engaged during the bloody struggle for Algerian independence from colonial France; and in the United States, where he died prematurely from leukemia on December 6, 1961, at only 36 years old.

His main books — The Wretched of the Earth (1961) and Black Skin, White Masks (1952) — are still in print and have been translated into more than 25 languages. His singular contributions to anti-colonial psychiatry and humanism are widely studied and deeply embedded in the practices of a growing cadre of Fanonian psychoanalysts who deploy his insights in the service of fostering anti-colonial consciousness in the Palestine solidarity movement and beyond. One would think Frantz Fanon's legacy would be a settled matter. But is it?

Mireille Fanon Mendès-France: Unfortunately, no. The work of decolonial emancipation remains to be done. But before getting to these points, I would like to emphasize that this centenary has given rise to numerous events, particularly in Martinique. One was presented on March 15, 2025, by an organization founded by the Békés — who are descendants of former colonizers and enslavers who continue to control the island's economy. This association, Tous Créoles, hosted an exceptional conference on Frantz Fanon entitled “Fanon the Humanist.” 

Their aim was to demonstrate that the philosophy of Tous Créoles is in line with Frantz Fanon's by extracting certain quotes and taking them out of context, thereby reinforcing their positions: “I am not a slave to the slavery that dehumanized my fathers. … I, a man of color, want only one thing: that the instrument never dominate man.” The use of these quotes supports their argument. Likewise, “There is no Negro mission; there is no white burden. There is a struggle for the triumph of human dignity, for the disappearance of human humiliation, whatever the origin of that humiliation.” These quotes can be interpreted in any way one wishes if one remains on the surface, but above all, they can be used to demonstrate that Frantz Fanon was not in contradiction with the dominant colonial thinking, particularly that of the Békés, who for several years have been trying to reverse the burden of proof by demonstrating, through this kind of instrumentalization of Frantz Fanon's thinking, among other things, that they stand alongside the descendants of enslaved people. 

These Békés are trying to do what successive Israeli governments have tried to do with the Palestinian people, victims of an illegal occupation that constitutes a war crime and genocide. The Békés try to impose their own agenda by showing their credentials to those they despise, because their colonizer's unconscious has never abandoned the coloniality of power that led them to consider Black bodies as unimportant because they are commodifiable. Above all, they are trying to promote the myth propagated by the anti-Black (and anti-Arab and anti-Islamic) right wing of “living together,” which means that the dominated must accept the yoke of the dominant without ever questioning this ancestral domination rooted in the racist capitalist system. In twisting Fanon's thinking to a message that descendants of enslavers and the enslaved should live together in harmony without any reckoning, this is an instrumentalization of Fanonian thinking, and part of a disturbing tendency toward normalization of institutional racism, négrophobia, and colonialism which we see constantly since October 7, 2023. 

Why is there so much will to transform the thinking of Frantz Fanon to say things he did not say and to defend positions which are absolutely contradictory to his own? Why does Fanon become compatible with the most racist white thinking, which continues to enrich itself on the backs of Black people?

Let us not forget that Frantz Fanon was a man of rupture, no compromise with the enemy: as presented by the Békés, he becomes consensual, stripping him of his radicalism to make him acceptable to those who rejected him for decades, criticizing him for resigning from his position as chief physician at the Blida hospital and for committing himself intellectually, physically, politically, and in solidarity to the struggle for liberation of a people who had suffered under colonial rule for over a century.

In another event, organized by the Cercle Frantz Fanon, one of their speakers said that Fanon's ideas are no longer accurate or relevant because in Martinique, or in Guadeloupe, which are overseas French colonies, there is no more colonialism. As proof, he said, “Have you ever seen a colonizer giving monthly social services to the colonized people? Have you seen in a colonized country, one family having two or even three cars!?” What is the benefit for participants at a conference organized as part of the centenary celebrations to listen to such statements? It is a non-starter, and, above all, it closes the debate. Does Fanon get him down? What does this thinker say to him about his difficulty in understanding the current world, which is part of a colonization that has never been abandoned but is truly violent? Is the return to the future here?

Fortunately, there was another event, a conference sponsored by the Caribbean Philosophical Association (CPA), and the Frantz Fanon Foundation organized one plenary. The foundation has close ties and works with grassroots organizations fighting for their rights while questioning their practices in the light of leaders who have reflected on the nature of anti-colonialist engagement from a decolonial approach. The goal was for the panelists to share their thoughts so that CPA participants could step outside their intellectual positions and confront the difficult economic situation. The economic sector is under a stranglehold by the Békés, as it was under the period of enslavement and after abolition. 

In Martinique just last fall there was an economic riot: the Vie Chère protests against the high cost of living, during which 140 protesters were arrested and four were killed. Activists have filed a complaint against the high cost of living, aiming to put an end to decades of anti-competitive and abusive practices organized by the Békés with the full support of the government. This is a prime example of colonial power through economic capture, enriching a handful of actors at the expense of the “Non-Beings.” For the Frantz Fanon Foundation, it was also a question of reflecting, based on these struggles, on the role that a philosophical approach should play in the quest for radical change in the economic model of colonized territories.

I'm reluctant to share this with you, but since you're coming to the U.S., I think you should know: A KKK flyer was distributed in Cincinnati, Ohio, widely enough that a city councilman felt compelled to issue a dignified rebuttal in a Facebook post. In it, he entreats state politicians to stop fanning damaging flames of racism about his city. 

In the spirit of internationalism, you're set to meet with two Black-led organizations unapologetically resisting the rise of a neo-Confederate order in the U.S. — the Black Alliance for Peace and Cooperation Jackson. What are you hoping to build with them?

We have no choice but to build alliances between dominated victims of négrophobia; alliances based on ethical principles considering that the fight against institutional racism and for land and human dignity are essential if we want to change the world. But this is not enough; everyone agrees, including the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the World Bank. The essential principle on which we must agree is that no change will be possible within the racist, capitalist, and liberal system. This system has killed our ancestors and continues to spoil, kill, exclude, and commit genocide.

The poster you sent me, “Arm yourselves, white citizens of Cincinnati,” speaks loudly about this return to the future. We really need to be concerned and prepare ourselves. In the United States, will Black people have to endure the return of the KKK? Will those who claim to be in solidarity remain as silent as they were during the first six months of the genocide organized by the Israeli state with the complicit support of many members of the international community?

That is why meeting, exchanging ideas, sharing thoughts, and perhaps setting up an alert platform is part of the resistance struggle. If we do not resist and if we do not equip ourselves with the means to resist, we are, in a sense, dead. One might wonder if it is not too late, but in this fight, defeatism has no place. 

Kali Akuno told Truthout that one of his aims for your joint events is to link the legacy of resistance and sacrifice in Africa with the history of struggle and resistance that came out of Hurricane Katrina, which he says is downplayed. 

He was part of the New Day Collective's sustained resistance to the ideology permeating the Green Dot Plan, an actual development plan floated in 2006 with a nefarious map to indicate where the priorities for the city's recovery should be. Areas in the green dots would be left as open space in a bold land grab to create a “New” New Orleans — smaller, whiter and more affluent. From the heart of one of those green dots, their Fight Back Center was the epicenter of the struggle to save public housing throughout New Orleans for years. Yet, the center's sustained role has been erased in dominant media narratives and the city's militant history has not been widely celebrated in Katrina commemorations.

Akuno also says that in order to keep New Orleans from being further gentrified, a new struggle is going to have to be raised.

I agree with Kali; I'm also interested in discussing Fanon's thinking, his thinking in action, with people touched by the Katrina disaster. 

The trip is not just to make a declaration, or to pay tribute to Frantz Fanon, even if he helps us to continue the fight.

Are the outcomes of willful climate inaction — the terrifying wildfires, smoke-filled summer air, droughts, and floods and storms like Katrina — related to coloniality?

It is another way to kill the people, to maintain the permanent war against the people, to make their environment uninhabitable.

Looking to international institutions like the United Nations is not the solution. In fact, it's part of our problem. The UN is the perfect example of paradoxical thinking — something for the people, but they act against the people.

The best example is Haiti: the cholera the UN spread, the mass death it caused, and everything they've done with The Core Group [a political entity formed by a UN Security Council Resolution in 2004; its creation was originally proposed as a six-month interim transition support measure, yet it endures to this day].

Even as we're talking, there's a palpable dread of imminent mass death in Gaza because the U.S. and Israel are actively starving the people. How is the emancipation of Black people in the U.S. related to the liberation, then emancipation, of Palestinians?

What we have to understand is what was done against African people from the mid-15th century until now, is the same paradigm in Gaza — a continuation of the permanent war against people, authorized by the early papal bulls of the Doctrine of Discovery. You want something, first you kill the people: like it was done in the transatlantic slave trade. The powerful fight against the people, because for this system, the problem is the people.

If we want to get our emancipation, we have to try to invert the relation of power, because until now, the capitalist system has been stronger than the social movement. But maybe we have to think about how to be in solidarity with people under attack, how to be engaged a little bit differently — what does it mean to be engaged and in solidarity with people who are fighting?

            President Donald Trump escalated his campaign to purge cultural institutions of materials that conflict with his political directives on Tuesday, alleging museums were too focused on highlighting negative aspects of American history, including “how bad slavery was.”
    


            In a Truth Social post, Trump directed his attorneys to conduct a review of museums, comparing the effort to his crackdown on universities across the country.
    


            “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future,” Trump wrote.
    


            Trump's comments come days after the White House announced an unprecedented, sweeping review of the Smithsonian Institution, which runs the nation's major public museums. The initiative, a trio of top Trump aides wrote in a letter to Smithsonian Institution secretary Lonnie Bunch III last week, “aims to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.”
    


            The letter said the review would focus on public-facing content, the curatorial process to understand how work is selected for exhibits, current and future exhibition planning, the use of existing materials and collections and guidelines for narrative standards.
    


            Exhibits at the Smithsonian take years of planning and are heavily evaluated by teams of scholars and curatorial experts before they make their debut. Janet Marstine, a museum ethics expert, said that the demands laid out by the Trump administration “set the Smithsonian up for failure.”
    


            “Nobody could provide those kinds of materials in such a comprehensive way, in that short amount of time, and so it's just an impossible task,” she said. The White House has asked the Smithsonian to provide an array of materials, from internal emails and memos to digital copies of all placards and gallery labels currently on display.
    


            The Smithsonian declined to comment on Trump's latest remarks. A White House official, asked about the attorney review process Trump described, said the president “will explore all options and avenues to get the Woke out of the Smithsonian and hold them accountable.”
    


            Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order that put Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, in charge of stopping government spending on exhibits that don't align with the administration's agenda. He also tasked a former member of his legal team, attorney Lindsey Halligan, with helping to root out “improper ideology” at the Smithsonian.
    


            “Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to divisive narratives,” the executive order said.
    


            The Smithsonian began a review of its own in June, and has repeatedly stressed its commitment to being nonpartisan. The institution told CNN in July that it was committed to an “unbiased presentation of facts and history” and that it would “make any necessary changes to ensure our content meets our standards.”

			The White House has never explicitly endorsed the agreement with Mauritius, and concern is rising about the future of a crucial US base

In a recent meeting with a cross-party group of British MPs in Washington, I was struck by the outright defeatism on display over the Chagos Islands surrender. I was told that Sir Keir Starmer's shameful agreement in May to hand over the British Indian Ocean Territory to Chinese ally Mauritius was a done deal, and it was pointless to even discuss it. Several of the MPs agreed that the Labour Government's decision was absolutely awful, but the overriding feeling was that nothing could be done to stop it.

Thankfully, there is hope that the deal can still be torpedoed at the twelfth hour. As the Chagos agreement is a treaty that cedes sovereign British territory, legal experts note that it must be ratified first by Westminster. And it would surely be extremely difficult for the Prime Minister to defend the agreement in Parliament if Britain's closest friend and partner stepped in to oppose it.

The US President's upcoming state visit to London on September 17-19 has added a new sense of urgency, with growing concerns in the United States over the implications of the deal for the future of the vital Anglo-American military base at Diego Garcia, which is capable of hosting America's long-range B-2 bombers. Diego Garcia sits at the heart of the Indian Ocean, and will play an increasingly important role for the United States in combatting Communist China in the Indo-Pacific region, a huge strategic priority for the Trump administration.

A growing number of US policymakers fear that the Chagos deal will hand Beijing an unprecedented win at the expense of the United States and the United Kingdom, undermining the long-term future of Diego Garcia and significantly weakening the strategic position of the West in the region. Indeed, the Chagos issue is far from over in Washington, and major red flags are being raised in the US, despite a large-scale PR offensive waged by the Foreign Office earlier this year.

The stakes are incredibly high. There is a very real possibility that Mauritius could, a few years from now, break the agreement with the UK over Diego Garcia under pressure from Beijing, find a reason to end the lease with London, and cut an even more lucrative deal with Communist China. What if the Chinese offered Mauritius double or triple what the British Government is offering to pay? This would be a nightmare scenario for the US, resulting in the loss of an incredibly vital American base.

Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana has been a prominent opponent of the UK giving the Chagos Islands away, and other Members of Congress are now weighing in. In a highly significant development this month on Capitol Hill, the powerful Republican-led House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations directly raised the issue of the Chagos Islands deal between the UK and Mauritius, urging the US Secretary of State to engage further with the British Government on assurances that vital US strategic interests are protected.

In the “National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, 2026”, the Committee recognised “that with the growing challenge from the PRC the military facilities on the island of Diego Garcia are central to Anglo-American power projection and relative control of the Indian Ocean. Recognising the invaluable strategic importance and geographic relevance of Diego Garcia to the United States, the Committee encourages the Secretary of State to engage with His Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom to ensure our long-term access to the facilities and that they remain integral to allied security.”

Meanwhile in the UK, the full cost of the Chagos deal to the British taxpayer is only now seeing the light of day. As The Telegraph recently revealed, the total cost to the British taxpayer to lease the Diego Garcia military base from Mauritius will be almost £35bn if fulfilled, 10 times more than the Labour government originally claimed. This is one of the biggest deceptions by a British government in modern times, and also one of the most dangerous, with massive implications for US and British national security interests on the world stage.

In the weeks ahead, we can expect significantly increased scrutiny of the Starmer Government's Chagos Islands deal on Capitol Hill as well as from the administration, especially in advance of the upcoming presidential state visit to the UK next month.

Significantly, the US State Department backed the Chagos deal in a statement in May, but there has never been an official declaration issued by the White House. A last-minute intervention against the deal is not out of the question.

President Trump still has an opportunity to weigh in directly on the issue, and can and should send the Chagos deal to the depths of the Indian Ocean where it clearly belongs. By doing so, he would be defending vital American strategic interests, denying China a major long-term victory, and protecting a crucial military base at the heart of the US/UK Special Relationship

            Hundreds of different goods just got a lot more expensive to import into the United States, now that President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum has kicked in.
    


            Butter knives, baby strollers, spray deodorants and fire extinguishers, considered “derivative” steel and aluminum products, were previously excluded from the 50% tariff, though they were still subject to the higher country-specific tariffs Trump enacted over the last several months.
    


            However, on Friday, US Customs and Border Protection and a division of the US Commerce Department published notices informing US importers that 407 categories of goods containing steel and aluminum would immediately be subject to the 50% tariffs at 12:01 a.m. ET on Monday. The non-steel and non-aluminum components of the products face other applicable levies.
    


            The abrupt move leaves many US-based importers between a rock and a hard place, with goods they already paid for currently in transit. If they decide to accept the goods, the importers will have to pay considerably higher tariffs. But if they, for instance, tell cargo operators not to unload their orders at US ports to avoid paying tariffs, they'll likely lose money.
    


            “Today's action expands the reach of the steel and aluminum tariffs and shuts down avenues for circumvention – supporting the continued revitalization of the American steel and aluminum industries,” Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Jeffrey Kessler said in a statement on Tuesday.
    


            As is the case with any tariff in place, businesses may not pass on the entire tariff expense they've paid to consumers by raising prices. But the chances of businesses absorbing a tariff as high as 50% will likely be slimmer compared to goods tariffed at lower rates.
    


            In addition to the 50% tariff on copper-based goods that recently took effect, the levies “will likely ripple through the manufacturing supply chain, raising production costs across construction, automotive, and electronics sectors,” analysts at the Telsey Group said in a note on Tuesday.

            The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform intends to make public some files it subpoenaed related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, though it will first redact them to shield victims' IDs and other sensitive matters, a committee spokesperson said Tuesday.
    


            The panel is expected to start receiving materials from the Justice Department on Friday, though it appears the public release will come some time after that. The spokesperson said the committee would work with the Justice Department on the process.
    


            “The Committee intends to make the records public after thorough review to ensure all victims' identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted. The Committee will also consult with the DOJ to ensure any documents released do not negatively impact ongoing criminal cases and investigations,” the spokesperson said.
    


            Many Republicans have called for more transparency surrounding the case and the release of records related to the matter – and the issue has roiled the House.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson took steps to delay until September a vote of the full House to publicly release the DOJ's Epstein files. The Louisiana Republican has said he supports transparency in the case but wants to give the administration room to handle the matter.
    


            House Republicans are on track to be forced to take a major vote over the release of information related to Epstein when they return to DC next month.
    


            Earlier on Tuesday, the chair of the powerful House Rules Committee — whose panel has run into drama over Epstein — was staying mum on whether GOP leadership will try to kill that vote altogether.
    


            Rules Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx told reporters Tuesday that she believes the Epstein issue might be “resolved” before the House is forced to take that vote, pointing to the ongoing investigation by the Oversight Committee.
    


            “Chairman Comer has mentioned that he's getting the material that he's asked for from the Department of Justice. I'd really like to see this resolved, if possible, before we get back, as much information as possible to come out,” Foxx said.

US president says it's possible Russian leader does not want to make deal

Donald Trump has ruled out the deployment of American troops in Ukraine in his first interview since yesterday's White House meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.

“You have my assurance, and I'm president,” Trump told Fox News talkshow Fox & Friends in a phone interview on Tuesday, when pressed on whether US forces could be sent to defend against another Russian incursion.

The US president reiterated that Ukraine would not be admitted into Nato under his watch, but said that Kyiv would still receive security guarantees. These, he suggested, European allies would “front load”. Trump said France, Germany and the UK were among the countries considering sending their own troops to bolster Ukraine's defences.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is due to hold a news briefing shortly where she'll no doubt be asked about Ukraine. I'll bring you any relevant lines here, my colleague Shrai Popat will also be covering it in full over on our US politics blog:

I'm now handing the blog over to Lucy Campbell, but before I go, here is a quick roundup of today's headlines so far:

The US president, Donald Trump, has ruled out the deployment of American troops in Ukraine, but appeared to hint at possibility of US air security guarantees.

Trump today repeated his warning that Vladimir Putin would face a “rough situation” if he did not cooperate in the peace process, while Volodymyr Zelenskyy had to “show some flexibility”, PA reported. “I hope President Putin is going to be good and if he's not, that's going to be a rough situation,” Trump said. “And I hope that Zelensky, President Zelensky, will do what he has to do. He has to show some flexibility.”

Vladimir Putin has agreed to face-to-face talks with Zelenskyy, according to Trump and European leaders, and the Ukrainian president has welcomed the news, calling a “big step forward” towards securing a peace deal.

The “Coalition of the Willing” met virtually today to debrief after last night's talks at the White House, it emerged.

British prime minister Keir Starmer described the European leaders' talks at the White House as “good and constructive” and said they produced “real progress”.

The trilateral meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy, Putin ‘can bring breakthrough on path to peace,' Ukraine's foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said.

On the back of last night's meeting with Trump and European allies at the White House, Zelenskyy confirmed that the allies were “already working on the concrete content of the security guarantees.”

Geneva is emerging as a potential location for a peace summit between Putin and Zelenskyy, as first floated by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Speaking to reporters after his White House visit, Macron said the summit should be hosted by “a neutral country, maybe Switzerland – I'm pushing for Geneva – or another country.”

Military planners to meet in US to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, UK said. The UK prime minister's office released a short statement after the meeting of the Coalition of the Willing on Ukraine, co-chaired by Starmer and Macron.

Ukraine need to be open to discuss territorial changes, not join Nato, the Slovak PM, Robert Fico, said. Fico, who repeatedly clashed with Ukraine in the past and sought to block or delay some EU sanctions on Russia, insisted that “the first basic prerequisite for ending the conflict is the understanding that Ukraine cannot become a member state of Nato.”

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said the EU would continue targeting Russia's war economy and that the next sanctions package against Moscow should be ready by next month.

The military chiefs of staff of Nato's 32 member countries will hold a video meeting tomorrow to discuss developments concerning Ukraine, the head of the alliance's military committee has said.

Italian admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone posted that the military head of Nato's forces in Europe, US General Alexus Grynkewich, would give an update “on the current security environment” as “diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Ukraine progress”, AFP reports.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said the EU would continue targeting Russia's war economy and that the next sanctions package against Moscow should be ready by next month.

She was speaking after a virtual European Council summit of about the war in Ukraine, a day after an extraordinary meeting of Ukrainian and several EU leaders with U.S. president Donald Trump in Washington.

Kallas said “unity among EU leaders in today's virtual summit was palpable” and that she had placed the topics of Ukraine security and Russia sanctions at the top of the agenda for talks next week among EU foreign and defence ministers.

“[Vladimir] Putin cannot be trusted to honour any promise or commitment. Therefore, security guarantees must be strong and credible enough to deter Russia from re-grouping and re-attacking,” Kallas said in a post on X.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given Donald Trump a golf club belonging to a wounded serviceman during his visit to Washington this week, Kyiv said on Tuesday.

Trump, an avid golfer who owns several courses, accepted the gift and presented Zelenskyy with symbolic keys to the White House in return, the Ukrainian leader's office said.

The warm exchange marks a turnaround from February, when Zelenskyy left the White House early after a televised shouting match with Trump and US vice-president JD Vance. Since then, Zelenskyy has sought to repair ties, praising Trump's efforts to secure peace.

“The president of Ukraine presented the president of the United States with a golf club,” Zelenskyy's office said. The club belonged to Kostiantyn Kartavtsev, a soldier who “had lost a leg in the first months of Russia's full-scale invasion while saving his brothers-in-arms”, it added. Zelenskyy also showed Trump a video of Kartavtsev.

Later on Tuesday, Ukrainian veteran organisation United by Golf published a video of Trump holding the club and thanking Kartavtsev. “I just watched your swing. I know a lot about golf and your swing is great,” Trump said. “You're an amazing person, and you just keep playing golf and doing all of the other things. Your country is a great country. We're trying to bring it back to health.”

Zelenskyy also brought a letter for Melania Trump from his wife, Olena, thanking the US first lady for writing to Vladimir Putin and urging him to save children's lives.

The EU has dropped its calls for a “ceasefire” in Ukraine and is instead demanding that Russia “stop the killing”, in a semantic shift that aims to grab the ear of US President Donald Trump, according to AFP.

European Commission spokesperson Arianna Podestà told reporters: “The message for us is: stop the killing. Anything that stops the killing is welcome.”

Her remarks echoed EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, who stood alongside Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Brussels on Sunday. “The effect must be stop the killing,” she said. “That's the most important part. Whether we call it a ceasefire or a peace deal, stop the killing.”

European sources said Trump now disliked the term “ceasefire”, and the intention was to avoid antagonising the US president on a matter of form as high-stakes negotiations on Ukraine and European security were under way.

Yet at the White House summit on Monday, European leaders made clear their basic demands had not changed.

“I can't imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire, so let's work on that and let's try to put pressure on Russia,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

French President Emmanuel Macron summed it up by saying that “a truce, a ceasefire or at least, to stop the killings” was “a necessity”.

Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan and US secretary of state Marco Rubio discussed potential steps to end the Ukraine war in a phone call on Tuesday, a Turkish foreign ministry source said.

The source said the two also discussed the outcomes of talks between the U.S. and Russian presidents in Alaska and a meeting in Washington involving European leaders, Ukraine and the US, according to Reuters.

Fidan and Rubio also discussed ceasefire efforts in Gaza and the latest situation in Syria, the source said, adding Fidan had called for an immediate truce in Gaza and unhindered access of humanitarian aid.

Donald Trump has ruled out the deployment of American troops in Ukraine in his first interview since yesterday's White House meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.

“You have my assurance, and I'm president,” Trump told Fox News talkshow Fox & Friends in a phone interview on Tuesday, when pressed on whether US forces could be sent to defend against another Russian incursion.

The US president reiterated that Ukraine would not be admitted into Nato under his watch, but said that Kyiv would still receive security guarantees. These, he suggested, European allies would “front load”. Trump said France, Germany and the UK were among the countries considering sending their own troops to bolster Ukraine's defences.

Vladimir Putin suggested holding a possible meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, in Moscow, according to two sources familiar with a phone call between US president Donald Trump and Putin.

“Putin mentioned Moscow” during their call on Monday, one of the sources told AFP, adding that Zelensky had said “no” in response.

What security guarantees might Ukraine get in return for a peace deal?

As western leaders meet, four key questions remain about the steps they could take to prevent any future Russian aggression:

What security guarantees might Ukraine get?

How might the US contribute?

What does Russia say?

What does history tell us?

Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding breaks down each one in this explainer:

I'm handing the blog over to Matthew Pearce, who will guide you through the late afternoon in Europe.

Slovak prime minister Robert Fico, who repeatedly clashed with Ukraine in the past and sought to block or delay some EU sanctions on Russia, also spoke in the last few minutes.

In a three-minute video posted on his social media channels, recorded after his participation in the European Council meeting on Ukraine, he insisted that “the first basic prerequisite for ending the conflict is the understanding that Ukraine cannot become a member state of Nato.”

He noted that he expressed this view before, and faced heavy criticism.

He also said:

“Equally important is the factual understanding that without a discussion about territorial changes in Ukraine, no progress can be made,” he said.

He added that he was disappointed that the EU “had to wait for Donald Trump to show us the path towards peace,” praising the US president's initiative as “enormous personal success.”

Fico also rejected the suggestion that EU countries could take part in buying €100bn-worth of military equipment for Ukraine, saying it sounded “like a bad joke.”

He said he could not imagine a siutation in which Slovakia spends money on US weapons to send them to Ukraine for free.

Unsuprisingly, he's also “sceptical” about the idea of further sanctions against Russia.

But he said he hoped for peace “as soon as possible” and was ready to support Ukraine's ambitions to join the European Union instead.

We are just getting a line from Reuters that a meeting between Nato military leaders on Ukraine is provisionally expected to take place tomorrow.

We will bring you a confirmation once we have it.

European Council president António Costa told Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the EU was united in its “unwavering support for Ukraine” when the pair spoke on the phone this afternoon.

The former Portuguese prime minister added the bloc was also committed to maintaining pressure on Russia to get it to discuss and agree to ending the war in Ukraine.

“Our top priorities are to stop the killing, advance the exchange of prisoners, and secure the return of the thousands of children abducted by Russia,” he said.

He added:

“We will work together with the United States on concrete and essential security guarantees. Together with President Zelenskyy and the US, we will prepare the next steps to achieve a just and lasting peace.

We must continue to support the Ukrainian people and move forward with the enlargement process. Ukraine's future also lies in the prosperity and stability that EU membership can provide.”

The UK prime minister's office has just released a short statement after the meeting of the Coalition of the Willing on Ukraine, co-chaired by Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron.

It looks like the focus was on planning the next steps on security guarantees and potential sanctions to push Putin's Russia even further.

The statement said the participating countries agreed on a meeting of planning teams with their US counterparts “in the coming days to further strengthen plans to deliver robust security guarantees and prepare for the deployment of a reassurance force if the hostilities ended.”

The leaders also talked about “how further pressure – including through sanctions – could be placed on Putin until he showed he was ready to take serious action to end his illegal invasion.”

The coalition gathered over 30 international leaders, No10 said.

Russia has resumed grain shipments to Syria from within occupied Crimea, transporting stolen grain from Ukraine's occupied territories, reported Kateryna Yaresko, a journalist with the Ukrainian SeaKrime project that tracks Russia's illegal shipping activity.

Moscow's grain theft from occupied territories began in 2014 when Russia first invaded Ukraine and continued after the full-scale invasion launched in February 2022.

Russian forces have seized millions of tons of Ukrainian grain from occupied areas, with at least 180,000 tons looted through the port of Mariupol alone, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said in October 2024.

Russia is now conducting its third grain shipment in the past month from occupied Ukrainian territories to Syria, according to the investigation.

The Comoros-flagged bulk carrier Damas Wave, listed in databases under its former name Golden Yara, operates regular routes between occupied Feodosia in Crimea and Syria's Tartous port, carrying grain shipments.

The vessel departed the Crimean port for Syria for the third time on August 15 or 16, loaded with cargo, journalist Kateryna Yaresko reports.

"Regular bilateral trade relations between Russian occupiers and Syria are now underway, with stolen Ukrainian grain shipments to Syria resuming," Yaresko wrote on her X social media page.

As Reuters previously reported, Russia suspended grain exports to Syria in 2024 due to uncertainty following Bashar al-Assad's regime collapse. However, wheat deliveries resumed in April 2025.

In 2023, beyond the Crimean port, Russia also moved stolen grain by truck through temporarily occupied Mariupol, shipping it to Russia.

Russian forces compel farmers in temporarily occupied territories to sell grain at fixed prices significantly below market rates.

In April 2025, Ukraine's security service seized a foreign vessel loaded with approximately 5,000 tons of wheat, allegedly involved in transporting stolen Ukrainian grain from Russian-occupied territories.

Earlier investigations by The Kyiv Independent revealed how Russia systematically exports stolen Ukrainian coal from occupied territories through Mariupol port to global markets.

According to sources cited by Bloomberg, European leaders urged U.S. President Donald Trump to pressure Orban into dropping his opposition to Ukraine's EU accession talks.



U.S. President Donald Trump said on Aug. 19 that U.S. soldiers will not be on the ground in Ukraine to ensure security guarantees are upheld, deflecting the responsibility to European allies. 



The European Union's 19th package of sanctions against Russia is expected to be ready in September, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas announced on Aug. 19, as the EU ramps up its pressure on Moscow in hopes that it will push Russia to end its war in Ukraine.

NATO military leaders are scheduled to meet virtually on Aug. 20 to discuss the alliance's support for Ukraine as European leaders continue negotiations with Kyiv and Washington on security agreements for the embattled country.

The Kyiv Independent's deputy chief editor, Toma Istomina, sits down with Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania's former foreign minister, to discuss why the White House meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and European leaders brought little progress in stopping Russia's war. 



Russia launched a wave of missile and drone attacks against Ukrainian cities late on Aug. 17, mere hours before President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet for peace talks with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. 

In the Oval Office, Zelensky said Ukraine wants to end the war and welcomed Trump's signal of openness to trilateral negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "We are ready for trilateral talks. As president said, it's a good signal about trilateral," Zelensky told reporters.



Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has blocked or delayed military aid to Ukraine, maintained ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and echoed Kremlin narratives.

According to Russian authorities, the remains belong to Ukrainian servicemembers killed in action in Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Kursk regions.

Over the objections of several local officials, an immigration jail has opened at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.

Despite local opposition, the Trump administration has opened what's expected to be the largest immigration jail in the country, on the grounds of the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas. In addition to Fort Bliss, the Trump administration also plans to detain immigrants on military bases in New Jersey and Indiana.

On August 18, Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), whose district includes most of El Paso and part of Fort Bliss, was the first federal lawmaker to conduct an oversight tour of the jail, which is expected to eventually hold about 5,000 people. 

At a press conference held outside the jail, Escobar told reporters that she did not speak with any of the approximately 1,000 people detained at the “massive tent city.” The jail, known as Camp East Montana, contains “a very highly sophisticated medical unit,” hard floors, and walls that don't reach the ceiling.

However, Escobar said she remains concerned about conditions at the privately-run jail. For-profit lock-ups, she said, “far too frequently are operating with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Advocates have raised concerns about how the area's punishing climate — extreme heat and sandstorms — will affect people held at the base. 

“People detained there will almost certainly have their basic rights violated while caged in tents under the brutal West Texas sun, with extreme heat that puts their lives at risk,” said Savannah Kumar, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Texas. “This is not just dangerous — it's cruel. We will continue to monitor the operation of Fort Bliss so that this human and civil rights catastrophe is neither hidden from the public nor ignored by those in power.”

This is not the first time immigrants have been held at the military base. Under President Joe Biden, immigrant children were detained at Fort Bliss in a shelter for unaccompanied minors run by Health and Human Services. Whistleblowers said the children were held in crowded tents filled with sand and dust, and supervised by people who did not speak Spanish, did not interact with them, and had no experience in childcare. The whistleblowers' attorneys said that “the conditions they witnessed caused physical, mental and emotional harm affecting dozens of children.” 

The contract for building and operating the jail, reportedly valued at more than a billion dollars, went to the Acquisition Logistics Company. 

The Richmonder reported that the company's headquarters is listed as a residential house in Richmond, Virginia. Their investigation also revealed that, prior to the Fort Bliss deal, the company had received just over $48 million in federal contract and grant funding since it was founded in 2008, with the majority of its funding coming from contracts with the Department of Defense. The company's lackluster website states, “Site maintenance in progress.” 

The construction of the new jail faced widespread opposition from human rights groups and local elected officials. El Paso County Commissioner Jackie Butler introduced a resolution opposing the facility, which passed unanimously.

“The people of El Paso deserve transparency when a billion-dollar, taxpayer-funded facility is placed in their backyard,” Butler said. “We don't know who will staff this facility. We don't know how detainees will be treated. And we don't know how our local law enforcement, infrastructure, and community services will be affected. That's unacceptable.”

Escobar said that money spent on the jail could have funded services that would benefit the El Paso community. 

“If it was spent on access to child care, if it was spent on universal pre-K, if it was spent on health care,” she said. “There is a tremendous amount of good that money could do for El Paso but it is instead being used to fund mass deportation by the Trump administration.”

Goal of European leaders at White House meeting was to try to push the Russian leader into a corner



The mood in the White House on Monday was strikingly upbeat.

Nato's ever-cheerful secretary general, Mark Rutte, set the tone as he addressed Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the gathered European leaders. “Let's make the best out of today,” he said with a smile, before repeatedly thanking the US president for his attention to the war in Ukraine.

That ritual of praise and gratitude continued throughout the day, as Zelenskyy and European leaders hailed supposed breakthroughs and spoke of progress on issues that remain far from clear.

Much of what unfolded at the White House looked less like serious planning to end the conflict than a performance for an audience of one: persuading Trump that Russia was the obstacle to peace.

When the US president suggested that Putin was ready for a meeting with Zelenskyy, other leaders quickly echoed the claim until it acquired the ring of truth.

Rutte even told Fox News Putin had agreed to meet Zelenskyy, a claim Moscow has conspicuously declined to confirm, instead saying that any such meeting would need to be “prepared extremely carefully”.

The conversation in Washington soon moved to security guarantees.

European leaders made clear they were prepared to go further than before in pledging protection for Ukraine – from article 5-style mutual defence commitments to talk of a British-backed “reassurance force” under a settlement.

But those ambitious pledges were as much about perception as policy.

Moscow has made clear that Nato troops in Ukraine are a red line, and Putin shows little interest in meeting Zelenskyy. Putin insists Zelensky is not a legitimate leader and has said that any meeting with him would only take place to sign a final peace deal.

Yet European leaders continue to push both ideas, which some observers view as a tactic to make Putin appear the one unwilling to budge.

“Most of their [European] optimistic statements aren't true beliefs, but meant to influence Trump. Europeans hype up expectations to create a reality in which Putin disappoints,” Janis Kluge, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, wrote on X.

“Europeans (hopefully) know that Putin will never agree to Nato troops in Ukraine. They know that Putin doesn't want to meet Zelenskyy. But they pretend all that is a realistic possibility to make Putin look as bad as he really is, to undermine Putin's own narratives,” Kluge added.

Putin, who has himself shown little desire to compromise on his maximalist demands, has also tried to frame the other side as the obstacle to peace.

In remarks after his Alaska summit with Trump, the Russian president warned that Kyiv and European capitals should not “throw a wrench in the works” by pursuing back-room dealings that could derail the “agreements” he reached with Trump.

There remains widespread confusion over what exactly Trump proposed and what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the Alaska summit.

Trump's team has presented Putin's core concession as agreeing to US and European security guarantees for Ukraine – though even that remains murky.

Moscow is reported to have floated a different idea: that China, Russia's ally, act as one of the guarantors of Ukraine's security, reviving a proposal first tabled by Russian negotiators during talks in Turkey in spring 2022.

For now, Europe's tactic seems to have paid off: Trump has temporarily refrained from attacking Zelenskyy or demanding that Ukraine hand over territory on the spot.

Putin, meanwhile, is being forced to now tread carefully in response to Trump's push for a Zelenskyy meeting. The Kremlin is expected to intensify pressure on Kyiv to accept Russian terms, framing it as groundwork for talks.

“That way Moscow can deflect claims Putin won't meet Zelenskyy, while signalling that any talks depend on Kyiv's willingness to concede,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre.

But Europe's far-reaching promises, designed in part to draw a reaction from Putin, may prove unrealistic once Ukraine needs clarity about what support it can truly expect.

“Security guarantees come in lots of shapes and sizes. But let's be clear: there's not going to be a US or European commitment to go to war with Russia if it reinvades Ukraine,” said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at Rand, a nonprofit global policy thinktank.

“This conversation is becoming divorced from reality,” Charap added.

            A $25 million pink diamond that was stolen in an elaborate heist in Dubai has been recovered by police just a few hours later.
    


            The “exceptionally” rare diamond was stolen from a jeweler by thieves posing as intermediaries for a prospective buyer, Dubai Police said in a statement Monday.
    


            Weighing 21.25 carats, the large diamond “boasts exceptional clarity, symmetry, and polish,” and has a unique purity rating, said police.
    


            Its rarity made it an attractive target for the gang, which police said had worked for more than a year to take the stone.
    


            After tracking the diamond's arrival in Dubai from Europe, the gang devised a “sophisticated plan,” in order to steal it. The thieves passed themselves off as wealthy dealers by renting luxury cars and holding meetings in high-end hotels. They even went as far as to hire a diamond expert to authenticate the stone, said police.
    


            “Eventually, the gang lured the merchant to a villa under the pretext of introducing him to the ‘buyer,'” reads the police statement. “Once the diamond was brought out, they nabbed it and fled.”
    


            Nonetheless, police quickly identified three suspects, tracked them down, and arrested them, recovering the diamond before it could be smuggled out of Dubai.

            The jeweler said the speed of the authorities' response was “astonishing.”
    


            “To my surprise, the very next morning, they called to say the suspects had been arrested and the diamond recovered,” he said in the police statement, before urging others in the diamond trade to follow official safety guidelines set by Dubai authorities.
    


            Dubai has become a global hub for the diamond trade in recent years, partly thanks to its minimal tax demands and convenient location between producer countries in Africa and major sales markets such as India.

Globally, the International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world.



            Aubrey Plaza is opening up about her life after the death of her husband, Jeff Baena.



            The “White Lotus” star is a guest on the latest episode of her friend and former “Parks and Recreation” costar Amy Poehler's podcast, “Good Hang.”



            Baena, a writer and director, died by suicide in January. He was 47.
    


            “On behalf of all the people who feel like they know you, and the people who do know you, how are you feeling today?” Poehler asked Plaza.
    


            “In this very, very present moment, I feel happy to be with you,” Plaza responded.
    


            “I'm here and I'm functioning,” she continued. “I feel really grateful to be moving through the world. I think I'm okay, but it's like a daily struggle, obviously.”
    


            Baena was well known in Hollywood for several projects, including co-writing the 2004 film, “I Heart Huckabees.
    


            He and Plaza worked together on the 2014 horror-comedy, “Life After Beth,” the 2021 comedy series, “Cinema Toast,” and the 2022 film, “Spin Me Round.”
    


            On the podcast, Plaza compared her grief to the recent film “The Gorge,” which stars Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy, among others.
    


            “It's like [an] alien movie or something with Miles Teller,” Plaza said. “In the movie, there's like a cliff on one side and there's a cliff on the other side, then there's gorge in between and it's filled with all these like monster people that are trying to get them.”
    


            “I swear when I watched it, I was like that feels like what my grief is like,” she added.
    


            Her grief, Plaza explained, feels like “a giant ocean of awfulness, that's like right there and I can see it.”
    


            “Sometimes I just want to dive into it and just like be in it,” she said. “Then sometimes I just look at it, and sometimes I try to get away from it. But, it's always there.”
    


            Plaza and Baena began dating in 2011 and she revealed in 2021 on social media that they had married.

Broadcaster says family wants ‘to wait a bit longer', after film about singer's final years pulled from Monday's listings

The BBC has revealed it delayed an hour-long documentary about Ozzy Osbourne at the last minute at the request of his family.

The film about the musician's final years was suddenly pulled from listings on Monday, with the corporation making no comment about the decision. Its scheduled screening was less than a month after Osbourne's death. It was also less than three weeks after his wife, Sharon, and their children appeared before crowds in his home city of Birmingham.

In a new statement, the corporation suggested the delay had come after a request from the musician's family. “Our sympathies are with the Osbourne family at this difficult time,” a BBC spokesperson said. “We are respecting the family's wishes to wait a bit longer before airing this very special film. The new [broadcast] date will be confirmed shortly.”

The BBC had recently stated that the film would go ahead. Clare Sillery, head of commissioning for BBC Documentaries, said earlier this month that the film, Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home, captured “family moments, humour, reflection and shows the enduring spirit that made Ozzy a global icon. We hope it brings comfort and joy to Ozzy's fans and viewers as they remember and celebrate his extraordinary life”.

The programme is not the only documentary in the offing about the life of the late star. Paramount+ has also made a feature-length film, Ozzy Osbourne: No Escape From Now, about his struggles since a serious fall in LA in 2019. It had been slated to run later this year.

The BBC's documentary had already been completely overhauled as Osbourne's health deteriorated. It was originally envisaged as a much wider, 10-part series called Home to Roost, which followed Ozzy and Sharon's attempt to restart their lives back in the UK.

It has now been re-edited into a one-off film, showing Osbourne's battling attempts to become strong enough to perform and his struggles with ill-health. Osbourne died last month, aged 76, just weeks after performing from a throne on stage at Villa Park. The singer had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2019.

The BBC film includes interviews with Osbourne family members, including Sharon, Kelly and Jack. It had been due to air on BBC One on Monday night, but was removed from the schedule earlier in the day. The broadcaster initially stated it had been “moved in the schedules” and replaced it with an episode of Fake Or Fortune?

Ukrainian long-range drones destroyed two Russian ammunition depots in occupied Luhansk Oblast, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on Aug. 19.

The strikes hit warehouses in the village of Bilokurakyne, located on a key railway line supplying Russian forces on the Pokrovsk front, where Moscow is focusing its primary offensive efforts.

According to the SBU, the drones hit the sites at least seven times, sparking a massive fire later confirmed by FIRMS, a NASA public satellite service that tracks real-time fire activity.

"The destruction of enemy ammunition directly helps our soldiers, who are bravely holding back Russian assaults," SBU said, adding that operations to "demilitarize" Russian depots would continue.

Bilokurakyne lies about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory and remains under Russian occupation. Moscow currently controls nearly all of Luhansk Oblast.

Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian logistics hubs in occupied areas and inside Russia to weaken Moscow's front-line capacity. 

On July 2, Ukraine struck a Russian ammunition depot in occupied Khartsyzk, Donetsk Oblast, and on May 17, an attack on a depot near Perevalne in occupied Crimea caused an explosion and fire.

Russia has resumed grain shipments to Syria from within occupied Crimea, transporting stolen grain from Ukraine's occupied territories, reported Kateryna Yaresko, a journalist with the Ukrainian SeaKrime project that tracks Russia's illegal shipping activity.

NATO military leaders are scheduled to meet virtually on Aug. 20 to discuss the alliance's support for Ukraine as European leaders continue negotiations with Kyiv and Washington on security agreements for the embattled country.

The Kyiv Independent's deputy chief editor, Toma Istomina, sits down with Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania's former foreign minister, to discuss why the White House meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and European leaders brought little progress in stopping Russia's war. 



Russia launched a wave of missile and drone attacks against Ukrainian cities late on Aug. 17, mere hours before President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet for peace talks with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. 

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Aug. 19 that U.S. soldiers will not be on the ground in Ukraine to ensure security guarantees are upheld, deflecting the responsibility to European allies. 

In the Oval Office, Zelensky said Ukraine wants to end the war and welcomed Trump's signal of openness to trilateral negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "We are ready for trilateral talks. As president said, it's a good signal about trilateral," Zelensky told reporters.



Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has blocked or delayed military aid to Ukraine, maintained ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and echoed Kremlin narratives.

According to Russian authorities, the remains belong to Ukrainian servicemembers killed in action in Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Kursk regions. 

The strikes hit warehouses in the village of Bilokurakyne, located on a key railway line supplying Russian forces on the Pokrovsk front, where Moscow is focusing its primary offensive efforts.



Five people were killed and 11 injured on Aug. 17, followed by eight killed and 35 injured on Aug. 18, and at least eight killed and 53 injured on Aug. 19.

The refinery is the second-largest owned by Lukoil and a key producer of petroleum products in Russia's Southern Federal District.

MOSCOW, August 19. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has dismissed as childish the European leaders' allegations that Russia launched an unprovoked attack on Ukraine.

"[There is] a clear understanding by both [US] President Donald] Trump and his team that this conflict has a reason. And that the talk that some presidents and prime ministers from Europe are indulging in about Russia attacking Ukraine without provocation is all childish. I can't find another word," Lavrov said in an interview with the Rossiya-24 TV channel.

"The main thing is that they continue to say this," Lavrov noted. "And they continue, as their meeting in Washington with President Trump, where Vladimir Zelensky was also summoned, to demand an immediate ceasefire. At least some of them, such as Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, continue to say that it is necessary to put pressure on Russia with sanctions. None of these gentlemen even mentioned the phrase 'human rights.'"

MOSCOW, August 19. /TASS/. Moscow does not exclude any formats of working on the Ukrainian settlement, including bilateral or trilateral ones, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with the Rossiya-24 TV channel.

"We do not reject any working formats - neither bilateral, nor trilateral, the president has repeatedly mentioned this," the top Russian diplomat said. He added that it is important that any format be used not for the sake of media hype but for gradual preparations for summits, step by step, beginning with the expert level. "We will always support such a serious approach," the Russian foreign minister noted.

Lavrov also emphasized that any interaction involving top figures must be extremely thoroughly planned.

US President Donald Trump held a meeting with Vladimir Zelensky and several European leaders on resolving the Ukraine conflict in the White House on August 18. The talks involved Finnish President Alexander Stubb, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

The White House hosted such a large number of top leaders simultaneously for the first time in history. This unprecedented lineup of participants, which underscores the importance of the issue under discussion, was also highlighted by the US president.

In addition, Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the meeting. According to the US leader, they discussed, among other things, the prospects for a meeting between Putin and Zelensky, followed by trilateral talks. Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov said that the leaders of Russia and the United States spoke in favor of continuing direct talks between Moscow and Kiev, including the possibility of elevating their level.

Tropical storm and surge watches were issued for much of the Outer Banks.The Associated Press

Holly Andrzejewski hadn't yet welcomed her and her family's first guests to the Atlantic Inn on Hatteras Island when she had to start rescheduling them, as Hurricane Erin neared North Carolina's Outer Banks on Tuesday and threatened to whip up wild waves and tropical force winds.

Although the storm is expected to stay offshore, evacuations were ordered on such barrier islands along the Carolina coast as Hatteras as authorities warned the storm could churn up dangerous rip currents from Florida to the New England coast.

Andrzejewski and her husband purchased the bed-and-breakfast, known as the oldest inn on the island, less than a week ago. By Monday they had brought in all the outdoor furniture and made sure their daughter and her boyfriend, who are the innkeepers, had generators, extra water and flashlights as they stayed behind to keep an eye on the property.

“It's just one of those things where you know this is always a possibility and it could happen, and you just make the best out of it. Otherwise you wouldn't live at the beach,” said Andrzejewski, who will also remain on the island, at her home about a 15-minute drive away.

Erin lashed part of the Caribbean with rain and wind Monday. Forecasters are confident it will curl north and away from the eastern U.S., but tropical storm and surge watches were issued for much of the Outer Banks.

Hurricanes are growing more intense along Atlantic seaboard, study finds

Officials at the Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, North Carolina, reported to the National Weather Service rescuing at least 60 swimmers from rip currents Monday.

By Tuesday morning, Erin had lost some strength from previous days and dropped to a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 kilometres an hour, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It was about 1,070 km southwest of Bermuda and 1,150 km south-southeast of Cape Hatteras and was moving northwest at a slower 11 km/h.

But Erin's tropical storm winds could be felt for 320 kilometres. Forecasters expect it will grow larger as it moves through the Atlantic.

“We're concerned about those structures right along the beach,” the hurricane centre's Richard Pasch said.

A tropical storm warning remained in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands, where government services were suspended, some ports were closed and residents were ordered to stay home.

On North Carolina's Outer Banks, coastal flooding was expected to begin Tuesday and continue through Thursday.

The evacuations on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke came at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that jut into the Atlantic Ocean and are increasingly vulnerable to storm surges.

A year ago, Hurricane Ernesto stayed hundreds of miles offshore yet still produced high surf and swells that caused coastal damage.

This time there are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway. Some routes could be impassible for days.

Hurricane Erin neared North Carolina's Outer Banks on Tuesday and threatened to whip up wild waves and tropical force winds.

This is the first evacuation for Ocracoke since Hurricane Dorian in 2019 caused the most damage in the island's recorded history.

Tommy Hutcherson, who owns the community's only grocery store, said the island has mostly bounced back. He's optimistic this storm won't be as destructive.

“But you just never know. I felt the same way about Dorian and we really got smacked,” he said.

Scientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to climate change. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures, and warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.

Bermuda will experience the most severe threat Thursday evening, said Phil Rogers, director of the Bermuda Weather Service. By then, waters could swell up to seven metres.

“Surfers, swimmers and boaters must resist the temptation to go out. The waters will be very dangerous and lives will be placed at risk,” acting Minister of National Security Jache Adams said.

Editor's note: This item has been updated to include a statement from Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.

Talks between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin could be held in Hungary, Reuters reported on Aug. 19, citing a U.S. administration source.

The meeting would mark the first encounter between Zelensky and Putin since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The two leaders last met in Paris in December 2019 as part of Normandy Format talks mediated by France and Germany. 

In April, Hungary's parliament voted to approve the country's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), potentially allowing Putin to visit the country despite his arrest warrant issued in 2023 over the abduction of Ukrainian children.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose government is widely seen as authoritarian, has blocked or delayed military aid to Ukraine, maintained ties with Putin, and echoed Kremlin narratives.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Aug. 18, after a meeting with Zelensky and European allies, that preparations were underway for a face-to-face summit. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who joined the talks, said the meeting could take place within two weeks.

Russian authorities have not yet officially announced that they have agreed to such a meeting.  

French President Emmanuel Macron, who was also present during the White House talks, said on Aug 19 that the summit should be held in Europe, adding that he favored Geneva as a neutral venue.

"It will be a neutral country, so perhaps Switzerland, I'm advocating for Geneva or another country. The last time there were bilateral discussions was in Istanbul," Macron told French broadcaster LCI.

Switzerland's long-standing neutrality has made it a preferred host for international negotiations, where parties can meet without the perception of bias.

Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said the country is willing to host the summit, emphasizing the country's experience in organizing such events, Swissinfo reported.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also proposed Turkey as a possible venue in July. Ukrainian and Russian delegations previously held three rounds of direct peace talks in the country.

Zelensky has repeatedly voiced readiness for direct negotiations. On Aug. 18, he said he was prepared to discuss territorial issues with Putin personally. 

The Russian president has so far avoided meeting Zelensky despite claiming openness to talks.

Russia has resumed grain shipments to Syria from within occupied Crimea, transporting stolen grain from Ukraine's occupied territories, reported Kateryna Yaresko, a journalist with the Ukrainian SeaKrime project that tracks Russia's illegal shipping activity.

Ukrainian drones struck an oil refinery in Russia's Volgograd Oblast overnight on Aug. 19, regional governor Andrei Bocharov said. 

The refinery, Russian oil company Lukoil's second-largest, is a major producer of petroleum products in Russia's Southern Federal District. According to Bocharov, a fire broke out at the site following the attack.

Residents told Russian pro-government media outlet Shot that they heard between four and 10 explosions, with drones flying at low altitude and bright flashes visible in the night sky.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed 13 Ukrainian drones were shot down over the region.

Lukoil's Volgograd refinery, which has an annual capacity of 14.8 million tons, had already been forced to halt production after earlier strikes on Aug. 13-14. Reuters reported on Aug. 18 that the damaged units together accounted for the plant's entire refining capacity.

Volgograd Oblast, along the lower Volga River, is roughly 470 miles (290 kilometers) from Ukraine-controlled territory and shares a border with Kazakhstan to the southeast.

The extent of the damage is not yet known. Ukraine has not commented on the attack.

Ukraine has repeatedly used long-range drones to strike industrial and military targets deep inside Russia, focusing in particular on oil infrastructure that fuels Moscow's war effort. 

At least three Russian refineries suspended or cut operations this month due to such attacks, including Rosneft's Saratov facility and refineries in Ryazan and Novokuibyshevsk.

The strikes have contributed to soaring fuel prices in Russia, with the Moscow Times reporting on Aug. 18 that wholesale gasoline reached "historic highs" following the shutdowns.

PARIS, August 19. /TASS/. French President Emmanuel Macron suggested Geneva as a possible location for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky.

In an interview with TF1, the French leader rejected the idea of Paris hosting such a meeting, "as in 2019." The situation is currently "at a different stage," and "a neutral country" should be chosen, he said in response to a TV reporter's question. "Potentially, Switzerland, I'd favor Geneva. Or that could be a different country. Last time, bilateral meetings were held in Turkey, in Istanbul," he recalled.

The Washington meeting between European leaders, US President Donald Trump, and Zelensky discussed the possibility of holding a Russia-Ukraine summit that could be followed by trilateral talks with the United States and a broader multilateral meeting, the French head of state added. At a news conference last night, Macron said Turkey and other European countries, "whose security depends on the outcome of the conflict," should take part in these talks.

Trump held a multilateral meeting on resolving the Ukraine conflict in Washington on Monday. The talks involved Zelensky, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Ahead of the meeting, Trump emphasized that the White House would host a record-high gathering of European leaders for the first time.

The one-on-one between Trump and Zelensky lasted for about an hour, after which the US leader met with the European leaders and Zelensky. In addition, Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin to brief him on the talks. Their conversation lasted around 40 minutes, Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov noted.

A decade ago, planners in Beijing unveiled Made in China 2025, an ambitious scheme to take leadership of the industries of the future. The plan identified ten sectors for investment, including energy, semiconductors, industrial automation, and high-tech materials. It aimed to upgrade China's manufacturing in these sectors and others, reduce the country's dependence on imports and foreign firms, and improve the competitiveness of Chinese companies in global markets. The overarching goal was to transform China into a technological leader and turn China's national champion firms into global ones. The government backed this vision with enormous financial support, spending one to two percent of GDP each year on direct and indirect subsidies, cheap credit, and tax breaks.

China has been wildly successful in these efforts. It not only leads the world in electric vehicles and clean technology power generation; it is also dominant in drones, industrial automation, and other electronics products. Its lock on rare-earth magnets produced a quick trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. Chinese firms are on track to master the more sophisticated technological goods produced by the United States, Europe, and other parts of Asia.

And yet China's model still has many skeptics. Lavish funding, they point out, has led to waste and corruption. It has created industries in which dozens of competitors manufacture similar products and struggle to make a profit. The resulting deflation makes companies wary of hiring new staff or raising wages, leading to lower consumer confidence and weaker growth. China's economy, which once looked poised to overtake the United States' as the world's biggest, is mired in a slowdown and may never match the American one in total output.

These problems are not trivial. But it is a serious error to think they are big enough to derail China's technological momentum. Beijing's industrial policy succeeded not simply because planners picked the right sectors and subsidized them. It worked because the state built out the deep infrastructure needed to become a resilient technological powerhouse. It created an innovation ecosystem centered on powerful electricity and digital networks, and it established a massive workforce with advanced manufacturing knowledge. Call it an all-of-the-above technology strategy. This approach has enabled China to develop new technologies and scale them up faster than any other country. Its model is unlikely to be pushed off course by sluggish economic growth or U.S. sanctions.

China's industrial and technological strength is now a permanent feature of the world economy. The United States should compete with China to keep its overall technological leadership and sustain the industries needed for broad-based prosperity and national security. But American policymakers must recognize that their current playbook—export controls, tariffs, and scattershot industrial policy—is ineffective. Simply trying to slow China down will not work. Washington must instead focus on building up its own systems of industrial strength by making patient, long-term investments not just in select, key industries but in energy, information, and transportation infrastructure. If it doesn't, the United States will face more deindustrialization and lose its technological leadership.

The notoriously difficult Nürburgring racetrack is nicknamed the Green Hell for its twisting, 13-mile course through the mountains in western Germany. It is a track that tests even the steeliest drivers and the most advanced vehicles. The cars that have typically performed best are designed by celebrated German companies such as BMW, Porsche, and Mercedes, or by long-established manufacturers in Italy, Japan, and South Korea.

But in June 2025, the course saw a new speed record for electric vehicles, and the car that set it was not made by the typical champions. It was set by Xiaomi, a Chinese company better known for its moderately priced smartphones and rice cookers. It produced its first car only a year before. But Xiaomi nonetheless made the third-fastest car—electric or otherwise—ever to race through the Green Hell.

Xiaomi's triumph on the racetrack was a symbol of China's surprisingly swift rise to clean energy dominance. China made nearly three-quarters of the world's electric vehicles in 2024 and accounted for 40 percent of global EV exports. It has a lock on the solar supply chain. Chinese companies make most of the world's batteries, both for EVs and for other uses. And the country produces 60 percent of the electrolyzers used to extract hydrogen from water, which is the most effective way to produce clean hydrogen-based power.



The standard explanation for China's technological success is that the central government targeted various industries for support; provided hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, tax breaks, and low-interest loans to get these sectors going; and helped Chinese firms steal or copy technology from other states. This is part of what took place. But that story misses the bigger picture. China succeeded not only because it subsidized particular industries but also because it invested in the deep infrastructure—underlying physical systems and human expertise—that enables innovation and efficient production.

Some of this infrastructure consists of transportation systems, such as roads, railways, and ports. Over the last 30 years, China has built a national expressway network twice the length of the American interstate system, a high-speed train network with more miles of track than the rest of the world combined, and a formidable network of ports, the largest of which, in Shanghai, moves more cargo in some years than all U.S. ports put together.

But if China had stopped there, it would not have reached today's technological heights. Other infrastructure systems have proved crucial. One is China's digital network. In its infancy, the Internet was widely thought to corrode authoritarian regimes because it removed their monopoly on information and made it easier for ordinary people to organize across large distances. In 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared that controlling the Internet was like “trying to nail Jell-O to a wall.” But China's leadership concluded the opposite. They bet that high-quality data infrastructure would strengthen the government by enabling it to better monitor and manage public opinion, as well as track people's movements, while hugely benefiting the country's industrial sectors and creating a high-tech ecosystem.

So China nailed Jell-O to the wall. It built a domestic Internet that rapidly connected virtually the entire population while blocking what its people could see from abroad. The gamble paid off. Thanks to Beijing's early and aggressive promotion of mobile phones, Chinese firms helped pioneer the mobile Internet. Top platforms such as Byte-Dance, Alibaba, and Tencent became world-class innovators. Huawei became the world's leading producer of 5G equipment. The Chinese population now uses smartphones constantly, and the Communist Party remains very much in charge.

The next key infrastructure system behind China's prowess is its electric grid. Over the past quarter century, China has led the world in building power plants, adding the equivalent of the United Kingdom's total supply every year. It now generates more electricity each year than the United States and the European Union combined. The country has invested heavily in ultrahigh voltage transmission lines, which can carry electricity efficiently over long distances, and in all types of battery storage. This abundant power supply has enabled the rapid growth of electricity-reliant transport systems, namely high-speed rail and electric vehicles.

China has overcome the obstacles that long prevented electricity from becoming the world's main energy and supplanting the direct combustion of fossil fuels: that it was hard to move, hard to store, and ineffective at fueling transport. As a result, China is well on its way to becoming the world's first economy powered mainly by electricity. Electricity accounts for 21 percent of energy use in the world as a whole and 22 percent of energy use in the United States. In China, electricity is nearly 30 percent of energy use, more than in any other large country except Japan. And this share is growing fast: about six percent a year, compared with 2.6 percent for the world as a whole and 0.6 percent for the United States.

China's electrification did not arise out of a master plan. Instead, it was the product of technocratic responses to discrete issues such as power shortages in industrial zones and the need to free up rail capacity for purposes other than moving coal. Now, however, rapid electrification serves a clear strategic purpose. It is a motor of industrial innovation—“powering the future,” as Damien Ma and Lizzi Lee put it in a July Foreign Affairs article. And the government is keenly aware that abundant, cheap electricity provides the country with a crucial edge in the power-intensive industries of the future, most obviously artificial intelligence. Beijing thus strives to ensure that its electricity system remains the biggest and best in the world.



China's most subtle piece of deep infrastructure is its more than 70-million-person industrial workforce—the largest in the world. Thanks to the country's intense buildup of complex manufacturing supply chains, Chinese factory managers, engineers, and workers have decades of “process knowledge”—hands-on knowledge, gained from experience—about how to make things and how to make them better. This process knowledge enables iterative innovation, or constantly tweaking products so that they can be made more efficiently, at better quality, and with lower costs. It also enables scaling: Chinese factories can rally a large, experienced workforce behind making almost any new product. Finally, and most important, process knowledge allows China to create entire new industries. A factory worker in Shenzhen might assemble iPhones one year and Huawei Mate phones the next and then move on to build drones for DJI or electric vehicle batteries for CATL.

Process knowledge in the Chinese workforce may be Beijing's greatest economic asset. But it is hard to quantify. That is one reason why the rest of the world has persistently underestimated China's capabilities. Some analysts believe that China is the country that assembles most of the world's smartphones and other electronics because its workforce costs are low. In reality, the country remains the world's leader because its workforce has proved its worth in sophistication, scale, and speed.

Analysts also miss the red-hot ambition of China's entrepreneurs. The country is full of businesspeople with the optimism, the daring, or the foolishness to try disrupting sectors. Xiaomi's legendary founder, Lei Jun, gambled on EVs in 2021, announcing that his company, then valued at $80 billion, would invest $10 billion in them and that it would be his “last major entrepreneurial project.” On the German racetrack, it paid off. Lei was able to plug into an electronics ecosystem, battery partners, and an experienced workforce to make high-speed EVs in just a few years' time.

To see why American companies often struggle to do the same, compare Xiaomi's experience with that of Apple. In 2014, the computing giant considered developing electric vehicles. It was hardly a crazy idea. Apple had a market capitalization of $600 billion and a cash hoard of $40 billion, giving it far deeper pockets than Xiaomi. By conventional measures, it also had greater technological sophistication. But the United States does not have the energy system or the manufacturing capacity of China, so there was no easy infrastructure for Apple to tap into. As a result, in 2024, the company's board pulled the plug on a decade of EV development. That same year, Xiaomi expanded its manufacturing capacity and repeatedly raised its delivery target. Meanwhile, the American EV champion, Tesla, faces declining sales in all of its top markets, including China. Chinese buyers now believe that domestic brands are more innovative than Tesla, and more in tune with fast-changing consumer tastes.

It is a mistake to underestimate China. But the country does face serious economic challenges, many of which arise at least in part from the very industrial policies that have led to its triumphs. China's technocrats have steered resources not just into high-productivity infrastructure but also into state-owned enterprises that contribute little to the country's vibrant tech ecosystem, rack up huge debts, and drag down the economy's efficiency. The politically driven constraints on some of the country's most creative entrepreneurs, such as Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, and Zhang Yiming, the co-founder of Byte-Dance—who were humiliated when Beijing expanded its power over the consumer Internet—have chilled private-sector confidence.

Unregulated subsidies, meanwhile, have led to widespread graft. A prime example is China's semiconductor industry, which has received over $100 billion in direct state industrial policy support since 2014. Some of the projects funded by this money were outright frauds. Other projects were legitimate, but both businesspeople and government officials stole from them. More than a dozen senior chip industry figures have been jailed for corruption since 2022, including the head of Tsinghua Unigroup (which operates several important chipmakers) and the chief of China's national integrated circuit fund. Two sitting ministers of industry and information technology were fired for graft.

China's subsidies may also, at times, suppress innovation. Generous manufacturing spending helps promote the tech ecosystem, but it also enables less efficient firms to stay in business far longer than they would in a more market-driven economy. That lowers profits for everyone, as companies continually cut their prices to maintain market share. This, in turn, means that manufacturing companies cannot spend as much on research and development. In fact, they need to be cautious about hiring new staff or raising wages.



The solar industry is a case in point. Owning the solar supply chain is a strategic triumph for the state, but companies producing solar modules mostly sell undifferentiated products, fighting for minuscule profits while cutting prices to the bone. The same is true for manufacturers of EVs, smartphones, and many other products, with too many companies making similar products at paper-thin margins. China's tech sectors are global success stories, but the companies in them are often miserable.

If China is too generous with tech and manufacturing businesses, then it is not generous enough with those providing services. Beijing chronically overregulates service sectors, cracking down on Internet companies that the government sees as engaging in monopolistic practices or threatening political or social instability. It tightly controls finance, health care, and education. As a result, job growth in these sectors has been weak, which means job growth in China as a whole has greatly suffered. Even in this industry-centric country, services employ about 60 percent of the urban workforce and have accounted for all net job creation in the past decade. With jobs hard to come by, wages rising little or at all, and the price of houses—which are most Chinese people's main asset—falling, Chinese consumers have become reluctant to spend. Private businesses, seeing weak demand, have in turn become even more reluctant to hire or raise wages.

China's current model, then, virtually guarantees slower economic growth. Thanks to the vicious circle Beijing has created, the economy now routinely struggles to reach its annual growth target of five percent and is constantly battling deflation. Meanwhile, because domestic demand is sluggish, more and more of the output of China's prodigiously productive manufacturing sector will need to be exported, leading to ever larger trade surpluses. China's trade surplus is already almost a trillion dollars, more than double the figure of just five years earlier.



The risks for Beijing are obvious. Slower growth means that the economy could become less dynamic, and tech firms could lose the ability or drive to keep innovating. Ever-rising trade surpluses could trigger much more severe and coordinated protectionism from the rest of the world, with dozens of countries joining the United States in erecting tariff barriers to Chinese imports.

But Beijing is likely to overcome these risks, just as it has overcome many challenges in the past. It has begun to recognize that subsidies are too high and has started withdrawing them. Smaller and less efficient players will exit the market. Consolidation is already visible in the electric vehicle sector, in which the number of companies has fallen from 57 to 49 since 2022. A third of EV producers now sell at least 10,000 cars a month, up from less than a quarter of producers three years ago. As for protectionism, most countries will find that there are simply no cost-effective alternatives to the products China exports. There are also ways to evade tariff barriers, such as by shipping goods through third countries or by setting up assembly plants in other states (as the Chinese car manufacturer BYD is doing in Brazil and Hungary).

Chinese officials, for their part, seem to believe that the costs of lower growth, deflation, and irritated trade partners are worth paying. “We must recognize the fundamental importance of the real economy . . . and never deindustrialize,” said Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2020, a year in which China's manufacturers met the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic by surging the production of medical equipment and consumer goods. The message was clear: Beijing's main goal is not fast growth but self-sufficiency and technological progress.

Washington has not stood idly by as China's tech and manufacturing sectors progress. Alarmed by the ambitions of Made in China 2025, the first Trump administration breathed life into some of the most moribund offices inside the Department of Commerce, summoning a powerful bureaucratic apparatus to choke off China's access to critical materials. U.S. officials realized that China was highly dependent on Western technology inputs, such as leading-edge semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. They thus gambled that a full blockade of these technologies would severely slow China's technological engine. This was a bipartisan proposition: when U.S. President Joe Biden came into office, in 2021, he maintained his predecessor's restrictions. In fact, the Biden administration tightened export controls on advanced chips, especially those essential for artificial intelligence, and on semiconductor equipment.

And yet the success of these controls has been mixed at best. In 2018, two big Chinese tech companies, ZTE and Fujian Jinhua, nearly collapsed after being cut off from American technology. But more capable businesses, aided by Washington lawyers and lobbyists, have been able to bounce back. (Trump recently lifted restrictions on leading-edge AI chips made by Nvidia, allowing the company to again sell its products to China.) Huawei was clearly battered after the Commerce Department sanctioned it in 2019. But by 2025, the firm announced that its previous year's revenues had recovered to 2019 levels. It is still recognizably the same company, one that excels at making 5G equipment and handsets. Except now, it is also one of China's leading semiconductor innovators, after it invested billions in replacing American chips.

Other companies have done an even better job of weathering U.S. restrictions. SMIC, one of China's most important chip foundries, has doubled its revenues since it was sanctioned in 2020. It still lags far behind the industry-leading TSMC in profitability, but it has made certain technological breakthroughs, learning to produce seven-nanometer chips—a technological breakthrough that was considered unlikely after its sanctions. Similarly, restrictions on AI technology did little to prevent the rise of DeepSeek, which has produced an AI reasoning model matched by only a few other firms, all in Silicon Valley.



DeepSeek's success is not hard to understand. Chinese AI firms may not have access to the same leading-edge chips that American ones do, but they do have plentiful access to excellent talent, mature chips, as well as pools of data. They also have a near-unlimited supply of cheap electricity—something their U.S. competitors lack. As a result, according to global technical benchmarks, Chinese large language models are, at most, six months behind American leaders, a gap that is steadily shrinking. Far from blocking China's progress, U.S. tech restrictions have triggered a Sputnik moment in China. Its companies are bigger, meaner, and significantly less dependent on U.S. companies than they were just a decade earlier.

Some American officials realize that the United States cannot win just by attacking China's industries. The Biden administration's economic planners, for instance, created an industrial policy designed to help the United States advance its own strategic sectors. The country passed the CHIPS Act, which beefed up semiconductor production, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which subsidized clean technologies. But despite earmarking hundreds of billions of dollars, these endeavors have mostly foundered.

The reason for these failures is simple. The United States has not built up enough deep infrastructure of its own. Toward the beginning of his term, Biden unveiled an ambitious proposal to deliver Internet service to almost every American. But this “Internet for All” plan had not connected anyone before he left office. There is still no national network of EV charging stations, even though Congress earmarked billions to create one. And Washington has failed to dismantle the bureaucratic and regulatory barriers to building electric transmission systems, which make it hard for energy companies to take advantage of the tax credits the Inflation Reduction Act created for solar and wind projects.



Now, those credits are poised to disappear. Trump's July budget reconciliation bill phases out his predecessor's solar and wind subsidies for most projects that haven't begun by the end of 2026. The CHIPS Act remains on the books, but the president has derided the law as “horrible” and “ridiculous.” Trump's tariffs, meanwhile, have caused deep uncertainty among manufacturers, who are pausing investments while scrambling to maintain their supply chains. The White House claims that the tariffs will force manufacturers to make their goods on American soil once the restrictions take full effect. But the administration's analysis is faulty. Manufacturers depend on imports for many of their inputs, and they have proved reluctant to make big investment decisions based on Trump's wavering pronouncements. In fact, the country shed over 10,000 manufacturing jobs between April and July alone, just after Trump announced his plan to impose high tariffs on virtually every country.

Trump, of course, is hardly unique in his failure to deliver. American politicians love to celebrate whenever a new mine or semiconductor facility opens. But the U.S. industrial sector continues to shrink amid product delays, layoffs, and falling production quality. Real manufacturing output, which had risen steadily until the 2008 financial crisis, plunged then and has never recovered. This shriveling is happening even in defense manufacturing. Despite an influx of cash, almost every class of U.S. naval ship under construction is behind schedule, some by as much as three years. Producers of artillery shells are only slowly ramping up manufacturing, even though Washington has depleted its stockpiles to help Ukraine. And U.S. efforts to wean its military off Chinese rare-earth minerals have faltered.

The United States does retain its advantage over China in several critical areas: software, biotech, and AI, as well as in its university-driven innovation ecosystem. But these institutions face an uncertain future. Since returning to office, Trump has set about defunding scientific research and depriving the country of skilled labor. Government agencies are now scrutinizing top universities, including Harvard and Columbia, and yanking government grants and threatening to revoke universities' tax-exempt status over exaggerated charges of anti-Semitism. The White House has slashed funding for the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Meanwhile, Trump's hostility toward immigrants has driven researchers who would come to the United States to look for positions at companies and universities elsewhere. Aggressive deportations are hurting America's construction industry. The country simply has not set up its innovation ecosystem well for the years ahead.

The United States can, and should, reverse Trump's spending cuts and immigration restrictions as soon as is feasible. But competing effectively against China requires more than just removing self-imposed restraints. Washington's failings extend across administrations for a reason: American officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, have not taken China's competence seriously. “China doesn't innovate—it steals,” wrote Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton on social media in April, epitomizing how Americans trivialize Chinese accomplishments. Too many U.S. leaders continue to believe that a more exquisite export control regime will halt China's technological momentum. They are sending lawyers into an engineering fight. They need to realize that no matter how hard the United States squeezes, it will not break China's industrial and technological system.

What Washington should do is strengthen its own capacity. That means starting the hard work of building up the United States' deep infrastructure. Washington should not try to replicate Beijing's massive and often wasteful investments in all systems. But it should do better than Biden's ad-hoc, sector-by-sector approach. And it must abandon Trump's strategy of hoping that the tariff cudgel will force a reshoring of industry, and his focus on old heavy industries such as steel.

Instead, policymakers must start to think in ecosystem terms, as China has. The United States has long-standing strengths in entrepreneurship and finance, so state-led investments in modern deep infrastructure are likely to have big payoffs, just as investments in railroads and highways did in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Large-scale infrastructure projects can stimulate demand for different technologies and create the process knowledge needed to build them, which are crucial first steps in rebuilding the manufacturing base. A top priority should be building a bigger and better electricity system that makes use of nuclear power, natural gas, and renewable energy sources. To maximize its use of renewables, the United States should invest in building more battery storage and high-voltage transmission lines.



The United States will also need to find ways to reduce cost structures throughout its industries. Because it is a rich country with high wages and labor and environmental standards, it will never be able to compete with China or India in terms of availability of low-cost labor, and it should not try. But to be serious about rebuilding industry, Washington must display a commitment to making its markets attractive for capital-intensive sectors. Eliminating Trump's ruinous tariffs, which will make American manufacturing prohibitively expensive, is essential, as is providing abundant, cheap energy. Yet so is permitting reform that eliminates the excessive regulatory costs of new construction, ample government funding for basic research and development, and liberal immigration policies that enable companies to source the best talent from anywhere in the world. The last is not strictly a cost measure, but it is essential to rebuilding U.S. process knowledge. Much of that knowledge now exists abroad, and the United States must be willing to import it.

Above all, Washington should not underestimate what it is up against. Beijing has made achieving technological supremacy a top political priority. The subsidies it used to push technological progress produced plenty of waste, but that was a side-effect of achieving leadership in the industries of the future. To compete, the United States must also make a commitment to leading in these industries, and it must be more willing to accept mistakes and some waste as the price of success.

China's model has worked because its policymakers have gotten a lot of things right and have given Chinese entrepreneurs the conditions for success. The country may have problems, but it will continue to be effective. And the longer it succeeds, the more the United States and its allies will deindustrialize under pressure from Chinese firms in energy, industrial goods, and perhaps even artificial intelligence. If the United States is to compete effectively, its policymakers must spend less time worrying about how to weaken their rival and more time figuring out how to make their country the best and most vigorous version of itself.

 Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman

   

When Washington announced a “framework deal” with China in June, it marked a silent shifting of gears in the global political economy. This was not the beginning of U.S. President Donald Trump's imagined epoch of “liberation” under unilateral American greatness or a return to the Biden administration's dream of managed great-power rivalry. Instead, it was the true opening of the age of weaponized interdependence, in which the United States is discovering what it is like to have others do unto it as it has eagerly done unto others.

This new era will be shaped by weapons of economic and technological coercion—sanctions, supply chain attacks, and export measures—that repurpose the many points of control in the infrastructure that underpins the interdependent global economy. For over two decades, the United States has unilaterally weaponized these chokepoints in finance, information flows, and technology for strategic advantage. But market exchange has become hopelessly entangled with national security, and the United States must now defend its interests in a world in which other powers can leverage chokepoints of their own.

That is why the Trump administration had to make a deal with China. Administration officials now acknowledge that they made concessions on semiconductor export controls in return for China's easing restrictions on rare-earth minerals that were crippling the United States' auto industry. U.S. companies that provide chip design software, such as Synopsys and Cadence, can once again sell their technology in China. This concession will help the Chinese semiconductor industry wriggle out of the bind it found itself in when the Biden administration started limiting China's ability to build advanced semiconductors. And the U.S. firm Nvidia can again sell H20 chips for training artificial intelligence to Chinese customers.

In a little-noticed speech in June, Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted at the administration's reasoning. China had “cornered the market” for rare earths, putting the United States and the world in a “crunch,” he said. The administration had come to realize “that our industrial capability is deeply dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China, who can hold it over our head,” shifting the “nature of geopolitics,” in “one of the great challenges of the new century.”

Although Rubio emphasized self-reliance as a solution, the administration's rush to make a deal demonstrates the limits of going it alone. The United States is ratcheting back its own threats to persuade adversaries not to cripple vital parts of the U.S. economy. Other powers, too, are struggling to figure out how to advance their interests in a world in which economic power and national security are merging, and economic and technological integration have turned from a promise to a threat.

Washington had to remake its national security state after other countries developed the atomic bomb; in a similar way, it will have to rebuild its economic security state for a world in which adversaries and allies can also weaponize interdependence. In short, economic weapons are proliferating just as nuclear weapons did, creating new dilemmas for the United States and other powers. China has adapted to this new world with remarkable speed; other powers, such as European countries, have struggled. All will have to update their strategic thinking about how their own doctrines and capabilities intersect with the doctrines and capabilities of other powers, and how businesses, which have their own interests and capabilities, will respond.

The problem for the United States is that the Trump administration is gutting the very resources that it needs to advance U.S. interests and protect against countermoves. In the nuclear age, the United States made historic investments in the institutions, infrastructure, and weapons systems that would propel it to long-term advantage. Now, the Trump administration seems to be actively undermining those sources of strength. As the administration goes blow for blow with the Chinese, it is ripping apart the systems of expertise necessary to navigate the complex tradeoffs that it faces. Every administration is forced to build the plane as it flies, but this is the first one to pull random parts from the engine at 30,000 feet.

As China rapidly adapts to the new realities of weaponized interdependence, it is building its own alternative “stack” of mutually reinforcing high-tech industries centered on the energy economy. Europe is floundering at the moment, but over time, it may also create its own alternative suite of technologies. The United States, uniquely, is flinging its institutional and technological advantages away. A failure by Washington to meet the changes in the international system will not only harm U.S. national interests but also threaten the long-term health of U.S. firms and the livelihoods of American citizens.

Weaponized interdependence is an unanticipated byproduct of the grand era of globalization that is drawing to a close. After the Cold War ended, businesses built an interdependent global economy on top of U.S.-centered infrastructure. The United States' technological platforms—the Internet, e-commerce, and, later, social media—wove the world's communications systems together. Global financial systems also combined thanks to dollar clearing, in which businesses directly or indirectly use U.S. dollars for international deals; correspondent banks that implement such transactions; and the SWIFT financial messaging network. U.S.-centered semiconductor manufacturing was spun out into a myriad of specialized processes across Europe and Asia, but key intellectual property, such as semiconductor software design, remained in the hands of a few U.S. companies. Each of these systems could be understood as its own “stack,” interconnected complexes of related technologies and services that came to reinforce one another, so that, for example, buying into the open Internet increasingly meant buying into U.S. platforms and e-commerce systems, too. At a time when geopolitics seemed the stuff of antiquated Cold War thrillers, few worried about becoming dependent on economic infrastructure provided by other countries.

That was a mistake for Washington's adversaries and, eventually, for its allies, too. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the United States began using these systems to pursue terrorists and their backers. Over two decades of cumulative experimentation, U.S. authorities expanded their ambitions and reach. The United States graduated from exploiting financial chokepoints against terrorists to deploying sanctions to target banks and, in time, to cutting entire countries, such as Iran, out of the global financial system. The Internet was transformed into a global surveillance apparatus, allowing the United States to demand that platforms and search companies, which were regulated by U.S. authorities, hand over crucial strategic information on their worldwide users.

The infrastructure of economic interdependence was turned against both the United States' enemies and its friends. When the first Trump administration pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which the United States and other major countries, including in Europe, had negotiated with Iran in 2015 to limit its nuclear program, the United States threatened to sanction Europeans who continued to do business with the Islamic Republic. European governments found themselves largely unable to protect their own companies against U.S. power.

This was the context in which we first wrote about weaponized interdependence in 2019. By that point, many of the most important economic networks underpinning globalization—communications, finance, production—had become so highly centralized that a small number of key firms and economic actors effectively controlled them. Governments that could assert authority over these firms, most notably the U.S. government, could tap them for information about their adversaries or exclude rivals from access to these vital points in the global economy. Over two decades, the United States had built institutions to assert and direct this authority in response to a series of particular crises.

Some of Trump's senior officials happened on our academic research and, to our amazement, liked what they saw. According to the historian Chris Miller's 2022 book, Chip War, when the administration wanted to squeeze the Chinese telecommunications manufacturer Huawei harder, one senior official seized on the idea of weaponized interdependence as a playbook to strengthen export controls against semiconductors, describing the concept as a “beautiful thing.”



Our primary purpose, however, was to expose the ugly underbelly of such weaponization. The world that globalization made was not the flat landscape of peaceful market competition that its advocates had promised. Instead, it was riddled with hierarchy, power relations, and strategic vulnerabilities.

Moreover, it was fundamentally unstable. American actions would invite reactions by targets and counteractions by the United States. The biggest powers could play offense, looking for vulnerabilities that they, too, could exploit. Smaller powers might seek to use less accountable or transparent channels of exchange, effectively building dark spaces into the global economy. The more the United States turned interconnections against its adversaries, the more likely it was that these adversaries—and even allies—would disconnect, hide, or retaliate. As others weaponized interdependence, the connecting fabric of the global economy would be rewoven according to a new logic, creating a world based more on offense and defense than on common commercial interest.

U.S. President Joe Biden also used weaponization as an everyday tool of statecraft. His administration took Trump's semiconductor export controls to a new level, deploying them first against Russia, in order to weaken Moscow's weapons program, and then against China, denying Beijing access to the high-end semiconductors it needed to efficiently train artificial intelligence systems. According to The Washington Post, a document drafted by Biden administration officials intended to limit the use of sanctions to urgent national security problems inexorably shriveled from 40 pages to eight pages of toothless recommendations. One former official complained of a “relentless, never-ending, you-must-sanction-everybody-and-their-sister . . . system” that was “out of control.”

Similar worries plagued export controls. Policy experts warned that technology restrictions encouraged China to escape the grasp of the United States and develop its own ecosystem of advanced technologies. That did not stop the Biden administration, which in its final weeks announced an extraordinarily ambitious scheme to divide the entire world into three parts: the United States and a few of its closest friends as a chosen elite, the large majority of countries in the middle, and a small number of bitter adversaries at the bottom of the heap. Through export controls, the United States and its close partners would retain access to both the semiconductors used to train powerful AI and the most recent “weights”—the mathematical engines that drive frontier models—while denying them to U.S. adversaries and forcing most countries to sign up to general restrictions. If this worked, it would ensure a long-term American advantage in AI.

Although the Trump administration abandoned this grand technocratic master plan, it certainly has not abandoned the goal of U.S. dominance and control of chokepoints. The problem for the United States is that others are not sitting idly by. Instead, they are building the economic and institutional means to resist.

The weapons of interdependence have been proliferating for several years and are now being deployed to counter U.S. power. As China and the European Union began to understand their risks, they, too, tried to shore up their own vulnerabilities and perhaps take advantage of the vulnerabilities of others. For these great powers, as for the United States, simply identifying key economic chokepoints is not enough. It is also necessary to build the state apparatus that can gather sufficient information to grasp the immediate benefits and risks and then put that information to use. China's approach is coming to fruition as it presses on the United States' vulnerabilities to force it to the negotiating table. By contrast, Europe's internal institutional weaknesses force it to vacillate, putting it in a dangerous position vis-à-vis the United States and China.

For China, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's 2013 exposure of U.S. surveillance practices demonstrated both the reach of the United States and the mechanics of the new era. Previously, Beijing had viewed technological independence as an important long-term goal. After Snowden, it saw dependence on U.S. technology as an urgent short-term threat. As our work with the political scientists Yeling Tan and Mark Dallas has shown, articles in Chinese state media began to trumpet the crucial role of “information security” and “data sovereignty” to China's national security.

The real wake-up call came when the first Trump administration threatened to cut off ZTE, a major Chinese telecommunications company, from access to U.S. technology and then weaponized export controls against Huawei, which the administration had come to see as an urgent threat to U.S. tech dominance and national security. Chinese state media began to focus on the risks posed by “chokepoints” and the need for “self-reliance.”



These fears translated into policy actions as the Chinese Communist Party developed a “whole-of-nation system” to secure China's technological independence, calling for “breakthroughs in major ‘chokepoint' technologies and products.” China also began to think about how it could better exploit its advantages in rare-earth mining and processing, where it had gained a stranglehold as U.S. and other companies fell out of the market. China's power in this sector comes not from a simple monopoly over the minerals, which the country doesn't fully possess, but from its domination of the economic and technological ecosystem necessary to extract and process them. Notably, these critical minerals are used for a variety of high-tech industrial purposes, including producing the specialized magnets that are crucial to cars, planes, and other sophisticated technologies.

China had already threatened to cut back its rare-earth supply to Japan during a 2010 territorial dispute, but it lacked the means to exploit this chokepoint systematically. After it woke up to the threat of the United States' exploitation of chokepoints, China stole a page from the American playbook. In 2020, Beijing put in place an export control law that repurposed the basic elements of the U.S. system. This was followed in 2024 by new regulations restricting the export of dual-use items. In short order, China built a bureaucratic apparatus to turn chokepoints into practical leverage. China also realized that in a world of weaponized interdependence, power comes not from possessing substitutable commodities but from controlling the technological stack. Just as the United States restricted the export of chip manufacturing equipment and software, China forbade the export of equipment necessary to process rare earths. These complex regulatory systems provide China not only with greater control but also with crucial information about who is buying what, allowing it to target other countries' pain points with greater finesse.

This is why American and European manufacturers found themselves in a bind this June. China did not use its new export control system simply to retaliate against Trump but to squeeze Europe and discourage it from siding with the United States. German car manufacturers such as Mercedes and BMW worried as much as their U.S. competitors that their production lines would grind to a halt without specialized magnets. When the United States and China first reached a provisional deal, Trump announced on Truth Social that “FULL MAGNETS, AND ANY NECESSARY RARE EARTHS, WILL BE SUPPLIED, UP FRONT, BY CHINA,” recognizing the urgency of the threat to the U.S. economy. China's long-term problem is that its state is too powerful and too willing to intervene in the domestic economy for purely political purposes, hampering investment and potentially strangling innovation. Still, in the short term, it has built the critical capacity to reimpose controls as it deems necessary to resist further U.S. demands.

Whether Europe can withstand pressure from Beijing—and, for that matter, from Washington—remains an open question. Europe has many of the capacities of a geoeconomic superpower but lacks the institutional machinery to make use of them. The SWIFT system, after all, is based in Belgium, as is Euroclear, the settlement infrastructure for many euro-based assets. European companies—including the Dutch semiconductor lithography giant ASML, the German enterprise software firm SAP, and the Swedish 5G provider Ericsson—occupy key chokepoints in technology stacks. The European single market is by some measures the second largest in the world, potentially allowing it to squeeze companies that want to sell goods to European businesses and consumers.

But that would require Europe to build its own comprehensive suite of institutions and independent stack of technologies. That is unlikely to happen in the short to medium term, unless the nascent “EuroStack” project, which aims to secure Europe from foreign interference by building an independent information technology base, really takes off. Even though Europe woke up to the danger of weaponized interdependence during the first Trump administration, it quickly fell back asleep.

In fairness, the EU's weaknesses also reflect its unique circumstances: it depends on an outside military patron. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has heightened Europe's short-term dependence on the United States, even as European countries struggle to bolster their defensive capacities. The Biden administration put a friendly gloss on economic coercion, coordinating with European governments such as the Netherlands to limit exports of ASML's machinery to China. At the same time, the United States provided Europe with the detailed intelligence that it needed to wield financial sanctions and export controls against Russia, obviating the need for Europe to develop its own abilities.

Europe's lassitude is heightened by internal divisions. When China imposed a series of export restrictions on Lithuania to punish it for its political support of Taiwan in 2021, German companies pressed the Lithuanian government to de-escalate. Again and again, Europe's response to the threat of Chinese economic coercion has been kneecapped by European companies desperate to maintain their access to Chinese markets. At the same time, measures to increase economic security are repeatedly watered down by EU member states or qualified by trade missions to Beijing, which are full of senior officials eager to make deals.



Most profoundly, Europe finds it nearly impossible to act coherently on economic security because its countries jealously retain individual control over national security, whereas the EU as a whole manages trade and key aspects of market regulation. There are many highly competent officials scattered throughout the European Commission's trade directorate and the national capitals of member states but few ways for them to coordinate on large-scale actions combining economic instruments with national security objectives.

The result is that Europe has a profusion of economic security goals but lacks the means to achieve them. Although European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned of “the risk of weaponization of interdependencies,” and her commission has prepared a genuinely sophisticated strategy for European economic security, it doesn't have the bureaucratic tools to deliver results. It has no equivalent of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is capable of gathering information and targeting measures against opponents, or of China's new export control machinery.

One immediate test is whether Europe will use its purported big bazooka, the “anti-coercion instrument,” or let it rust into obsolescence. This complex legal mechanism—which allows the EU to respond to coercion through a broad set of tools, including limiting market access, foreign direct investment, and public procurement—is supposed to allow Brussels to retaliate against allies and adversaries. The instrument was conceived as a response to the threat of Trump's first administration and hastily retrofitted to provide a means of pushing back against China.

From the beginning, however, European officials made it clear that they hoped they would never have to actually use the anti-coercion instrument, believing that its mere existence would be a sufficient deterrent. That has turned out to be a grave misjudgment. The anti-coercion instrument is encumbered with legalistic safeguards intended to ensure that the European Commission will not deploy it without sufficient approval from EU member states. Those safeguards make other powers such as China and the United States doubt that it will ever be used against them. Its lengthy deployment process will give them the opportunity they need to disarm any enforcement action, using threats and promises to mobilize internal opposition against it. As with earlier European efforts to block sanctions, China and the United States can usually bet on the EACO principle that “Europe Always Chickens Out” in geoeconomic confrontations. Europe lacks the information, institutional clout, and internal agreement to do much else.

The anti-coercion instrument is the exact opposite of the “Doomsday Machine” in the film Dr. Strangelove, the classic Cold War satire. That machine was a disaster because it automatically launched nuclear missiles in response to an attack but was kept a closely guarded secret until an attack was launched. In contrast, European officials talk incessantly about their doomsday device, but Europe's adversaries feel sure that it will never be deployed; that certainty encourages them to coerce European companies and countries at their leisure.

Europe is hampered by structural weaknesses, but the United States' difficulties largely result from its own choices. After decades of slowly building the complex machinery of economic warfare, the United States is ripping it apart.

This is in part an unintended consequence of domestic politics. The second Trump administration imposed a hiring freeze across the federal government, hitting many institutions including the Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which oversees OFAC, and leaving key positions unfilled and departments understaffed. Initial budget proposals anticipate an overall reduction in funding for the office, even as the number of sanctions-related programs has continued to rise. Although U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has expressed support for his department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which is chiefly responsible for export controls, the agency lost over a dozen employees as part of the government's sweeping force reductions. OFAC and the BIS were never as all-seeing as their reputations suggested and sometimes made mistakes. Nonetheless, they provided Washington with an extraordinary edge. Other countries had no equivalent to OFAC's maps of global finance or the detailed understanding of semiconductor supply chains developed by key officials on Biden's National Security Council.

Such institutional decay is the inevitable consequence of Trumpism. In Trump's eyes, all institutional restraints on his power are illegitimate. This has led to a large overhaul of the apparatus that has served to direct economic security decisions over the last decades. As the journalist Nahal Toosi has documented in Politico, the National Security Council, which is supposed to coordinate security policy across the federal government and agencies, has cut its staff by more than half. The State Department has been decimated by job cuts, while the traditional interagency process through which policy gets made and communicated has virtually disappeared, leaving officials in the dark over what is expected of them and allowing adventurous officials to fill the vacuum with their own uncoordinated initiatives. Instead, policy is centered on Trump himself and whoever has last talked to him in the uncontrolled cavalcade of visitors streaming through the Oval Office. As personalism replaces bureaucratic decision-making, short-term profit trumps long-term national interest.

This is leading to pushback from allies—and from U.S. courts. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently warned that “the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony.” U.S. federal courts, which have long been exceedingly deferential to the executive when it comes to national security issues, may be having second thoughts. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade issued a striking decision, holding that the United States had overstepped its authority when it invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act—the legal bedrock for much of U.S. coercive power—to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico. That decision has been appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but the judgment is likely just the first of many challenges. Notably, the trade case resulted from a complaint filed by conservative and libertarian lawyers.

The Trump administration's assault on state institutions is weakening the material sources of American power. Across core sectors—finance, technology, and energy—the administration is making the United States less central than it used to be. Trump and his allies are aggressively pushing cryptocurrencies, which are more opaque and less accountable than the traditional greenback, and forswearing enforcement actions against cryptocurrency platforms that enable sanctions evasion and money laundering. In April, the U.S. government lifted sanctions against Tornado Cash, a service that had laundered hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stolen cryptocurrency for North Korea, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. And the bipartisan American love affair with stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency, is pushing China and Europe to accelerate their efforts to develop alternative payment systems.



In some instances, the Trump administration has reversed Biden's policies and promoted the diffusion of previously controlled technology. In a remarkable deal with the United Arab Emirates, the Trump administration agreed to facilitate the massive expansion of data centers in the region using advanced U.S. semiconductors despite continued relations between the UAE and China and warnings from policy experts that the United States should not depend on the Middle East for AI.

Most recently, the spending bill that Trump and his congressional allies pushed through earlier this summer effectively cedes control of next-generation energy technology to China by doubling down on the carbon economy. Even as Washington works to counteract Chinese influence over critical minerals, it is eliminating measures aimed at minimizing U.S. dependence on Chinese supply chains in the crucial areas of renewable energy and battery development and radically defunding its investment in science. The result is that the United States will face the unenviable choice between relying on Chinese energy technology or trying its best to make do with the moribund technologies of an earlier age.

One might have expected that the United States would respond to the age of weaponized interdependence as it responded to the earlier era of nuclear proliferation: by recalibrating its long-term strategy, building the institutional capabilities necessary to make good policy, and strengthening its global position. Instead, it is placing its bets on short-term dealmaking, gutting institutional capacity to analyze information and coordinate policy, and poisoning the economic and technological hubs that it still controls.

This does not just affect Washington's ability to coerce others; it also undermines the attractiveness of key U.S. economic platforms. The use of weaponized interdependence always exploited the advantages of the “American stack”: the mutually reinforcing suite of institutional and technological relationships that drew others into the United States' orbit. When used wisely, weaponization advanced slowly and within boundaries that others could tolerate.

Now, however, the United States is spiraling into a rapid and uncontrollable drawdown of its assets, pursuing short-term goals at the expense of long-term objectives. It is increasingly using its tools in a haphazard way that invites miscalculations and unanticipated consequences. And it is doing so in a world in which other countries are not only developing their own capacities to punish the United States but also building technological stacks that may be more appealing to the world than the United States'. If China leaps ahead on energy technology, as seems likely, other countries are going to be pulled into its orbit. Dark warnings from the United States about the risks of dependence on China will ring hollow to countries that are all too aware of how willing the United States is to weaponize interdependence for its own selfish purposes.

In the first decades of the nuclear age, American policymakers faced enormous uncertainty about how to achieve stability and peace. That led them to make major investments in institutions and strategic doctrines that could prevent nightmare scenarios. Washington, now entering a similar moment in the age of weaponized interdependence, finds itself in a particularly precarious position.

The current U.S. administration recognizes that the United States is not only able to exploit others' economic vulnerabilities but also deeply vulnerable itself. Addressing these problems, however, would require the administration to act counter to Trump's deepest instincts.

The main problem is that as national security and economic policy merge, governments have to deal with excruciatingly complex phenomena that are not under their control: global supply chains, international financial flows, and emerging technological systems. Nuclear doctrines focused on predicting a single adversary's responses; today, when geopolitics is shaped in large part by weaponized interdependence, governments must navigate a terrain with many more players, figuring out how to redirect private-sector supply chains in directions that do not hurt themselves while anticipating the responses of a multitude of governmental and nongovernmental actors.

Making the United States capable of holding its own in the age of weaponized interdependence will require more than just halting the rapid, unscheduled disassembly of the bureaucratic structures that constrain seat-of-the-pants policymaking and self-dealing. Successful strategy in an age of weaponized interdependence requires building up these very institutions to make them more flexible and more capable of developing the deep expertise that is needed to understand an enormously complex world in which Washington's adversaries now hold many of the cards. That may be a difficult sell for a political system that has come to see expertise as a dirty word, but it is vitally necessary to preserve the national interest.



Washington has focused more on thinking about how best to use these weapons than on when they ought not be used. Other countries have been willing to rely on U.S. technological and financial infrastructure despite the risks because they perceived the United States as a government whose self-interest was constrained, at least to some extent, by the rule of law and a willingness to consider the interests of its allies. That calculus has shifted, likely irreversibly, as the second Trump administration has made it clear that it views the countries that the United States has historically been closest to less as allies than as vassal states. Without clear and enforceable limits on U.S. coercion, the most dominant U.S.-based multinational firms, such as Google and J. P. Morgan, will find themselves trapped in the no man's land of a new war zone, taking incoming fire from all sides. As countries work to insulate themselves from U.S. coercion (and American infrastructure), global markets are experiencing deep fragmentation and fracturing. There is “a growing acceptance of fragmentation” in the global economy, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has warned, and “maybe even more troubling—I think there's a growing sense that ours may not be the best fragment to be associated with.”

That, in turn, suggests a deeper lesson. The United States benefited from its ability to weaponize interdependence over the last quarter century. It enjoyed the advantages of an international economy based on multilateral institutions and a technological regime built around its self-image as a liberal power, even while acting in unilateral and sometimes illiberal ways to secure its interests as it saw fit. Just a year ago, some American intellectuals and policymakers hoped that this system could survive into the indefinite future, so that unilateral U.S. coercive strength and liberal values would continue to go hand in hand.

That now seems extremely unlikely. The United States is faced with a choice: a world in which aggressive American coercion and U.S. hegemonic decline reinforce each other or one in which Washington realigns itself with other liberal-minded countries by forswearing the abuse of its unilateral powers. Not too long ago, American officials and many intellectuals perceived the age of weaponized interdependence and the age of American hegemony as one and the same. Such assumptions now seem outdated, as other countries gain these weapons, too. As during the nuclear era, the United States needs to turn away from unilateralism, toward détente and arms control, and, perhaps in the very long term, toward rebuilding an interdependent global economy on more robust foundations. A failure to do so will put both American security and American prosperity at risk.

MOSCOW, August 19. /TASS/. President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Donald Trump of the United States have held a phone call that lasted about 40 minutes, Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov told reporters.

The US leader briefed his Russia counterpart on his talks with Vladimir Zelensky and a number of European leaders.

TASS has gathered the key information about the telephone conversation.

US President Donald Trump briefed Putin on his talks with Vladimir Zdelensky and the leaders of some European countries, which had just concluded.

The conversation between the Russian and US leaders, which was frank and constructive, lasted about 40 minutes.

The Russian leader reiterated the importance of Trump's personal efforts to find a long-term solution to the Ukraine crisis.

The parties also discussed their recent meeting in Alaska: "Our president warmly thanked his American counterpart for his hospitality and the good organization of the Alaska summit, as well as for the progress towards a peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis that had been achieved there."

Putin and Trump spoke in favor of continuing direct talks between the delegations of Russia and Ukraine: "They discussed the idea of considering the possibility of increasing the level of the Russian and Ukrainian representatives involved in the direct talks."

The two leaders "agreed to maintain close contact on the Ukraine crisis and other pressing issues on the international and bilateral agenda."

Let's be clear, there is no “guarantee” from Russian dictator Vladimir Putin that will ensure he does not invade Ukraine again.

Ukrainian officials well remember in 1994 former Russian leader Boris Yeltsin pledging that Russia would respect Ukraine's national boundaries in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear arsenal. Since then, Ukraine has been invaded by Russian forces twice, in 2014 and in 2022, while it was subject to Russian political warfare from 2005 to 2013, corrupting the country's business, political and security elites.

Already, Russia is trying to throw a spanner into the progress that was made at Monday's talks in the White House. Russia's Foreign Ministry said that it would reject “any scenarios” involving Nato troops in Ukraine, threatening, in a now predictable way, “uncontrolled escalation” with “unpredictable consequences”. So much for Western boots on the ground – even if the Americans are involved, as Trump suggested would be possible yesterday.

The Foreign Ministry also seemed determined to drive a wedge between the US and UK, claiming that Britain was undermining talks. The level of mind games and psychological warfare emanating from Moscow has been extraordinary. It's generally known as reflexive control, a theory of psychological manipulation whereby your target does your bidding while all the while believing himself to be in control of his actions. The Russians clearly believe that it has an effect.

Having hooked Trump on the idea of a deal, the Kremlin is now trying to dictate terms, and will steadily try to unpick Western red lines to isolate Ukraine from its allies and the US from Europe. Russia's negotiation tactics are to divide and conquer. That process started at the Alaska summit, when Putin ran circles around Donald Trump. Despite rolling out the red carpet for the Russian dictator, Trump again ended up repeating Putin's talking points, as if it was Ukraine's fault for being invaded and Russia the victim. It's apt that George Orwell's Animal Farm, that cautionary allegorical novel about the corruption of power and truth in Soviet Russia, was published 80 years ago this week.

It's clear what Putin wants; more strategically valuable Ukrainian land and with it at least three cities that it would take years for Russian troops to conquer, if at all, and which could be used as a potentially strategic springboard should there be another round of the war. If Ukraine accepts, millions would have to be evacuated. They will not want to live under Russian brutal occupation, with its lawless brutality and rapacious secret police. Putin will refuse Nato troops. He will build up his forces again.

Putin has studied Western leadership and considers it to be short-termist, weak and unwilling to stand up to protect what it believes in. Western deterrence no longer deters. Putin believes he has strategic patience, and can wear down Ukraine and the West over time. How many of the Western leaders who were negotiating in Washington will be in place in five years?

Should any peace deal hold, Russia would undoubtedly do what it is now trying to do in Georgia and Moldova, using Kremlin-friendly oligarchs and leaders to undermine the independence of those states and bring them gradually into Moscow's orbit. While we don't see political, economic and information conflict as a form of war, Russian military doctrine does. Conflict is about the use of military and non-military tactics to bend an adversary to your will.

In such a case, the Ukraine conflict would not have ended but merely moved to a new phase.

I have many Ukrainian friends. Almost all have lost someone close. Others daily pray for the relatives on the frontlines. Ukraine's army, like Russia's, is tired. It is easy to be brave with someone else's life. For their sake, I hope there is at the very least a ceasefire, preferably a lasting peace. It will take years to rebuild the mental and physical damage of this war.

But despite the bonhomie and faux positivity at the White House, it remains difficult to see a road to lasting peace. Any final deal, Trump has said, will rest with talks between Putin and Zelensky, which he now says he is going to arrange. Putin has thus far only shown himself willing to accept a deal that leaves Ukraine vulnerable to Russia's predatory gaze and its murderous army. He refuses to see Zelensky as an equal and Ukraine as a nation.

Up till now at least, Ukrainians have reluctantly said, better no peace than a bad peace. On their behalf, Zelensky now faces a dilemma that may save his nation – or condemn it to future destruction.

            Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro announced on Monday the deployment of 4.5 million militiamen throughout the country, assuring that “no empire will touch the sacred soil of Venezuela,” after the United States doubled the reward for information leading to his arrest and increased the number of troops sailing around Latin America and the Caribbean.
    


            Last week, the US government confirmed to CNN that it had ordered naval movements in the region to contain the threat from drug trafficking groups. On Monday, Reuters reported that three US Navy destroyers and some 4,000 military personnel would arrive at the edge of Venezuela's territorial waters within the next 36 hours.
    


            On Tuesday, however, a US Department of Defense official said there are currently no US ships in the area and nor have the ships received orders to head there. Venezuelan territory has almost 2,500 miles of coastline.
    


            “This week I am going to activate a special plan to guarantee coverage with more than 4.5 million militiamen throughout the national territory. Militias prepared, activated, and armed,” Maduro said during a televised meeting with the country's governors and mayors.
    


            The president described the “extravagant, bizarre and outlandish” US threats as “rotten rehashes,” without specifying what he was referring to.
    


            “We defend our seas, our skies, and our lands. We liberated them. We guard and patrol them. No empire will touch the sacred soil of Venezuela, nor should it touch the sacred soil of South America,” he emphasized in his speech.
    


            White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked Tuesday about a possible troop deployment to Venezuela following reports of the military buildup. “President (Donald) Trump has been very clear and consistent. He's prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice,” she said.
    


            She also reiterated the US government's position that Maduro “is not a legitimate president.” Washington and Caracas have not had formal bilateral diplomatic relations since 2019.
    


            The Venezuelan government rejected Washington's accusation of drug trafficking, saying in a statement that the US was resorting to “threats and defamation.”
    


            The Venezuelan Militia, which was created in 2005 by the late President Hugo Chávez and formally established in 2010, is part of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB) and has as its vision the “incorporation of the organized people” to guarantee the “comprehensive defense of the nation.”
    


Trump doubles reward to $50 million for arrest of Venezuela's president to face US drug charges



            Maduro said he will move forward with a plan to activate peasant and worker militias “in all factories and workplaces in the country.”
    


            “Missiles and rifles for the working class, to defend our homeland,” he said.
    


            The Venezuelan Ministry of Defense says on its website that the FANB “is made up of around 95,000 to 150,000 active combatants” and “a growing National Militia made up of hundreds of thousands of people capable of serving as reservists.”
    


            The Global Fire Power website, which specializes in military analyses and uses official statistics or makes estimates when they are not available, ranks Venezuela 50th in military power in the 2025 ranking, among 145 countries. The United States ranks first, Russia second, and China third.
    


            A few weeks ago, the Trump administration doubled the reward to $50 million for information leading to the arrest of Maduro, whom it described as “one of the world's largest drug traffickers,” head of the Cartel of the Suns, and a threat to US national security.
    


            The Venezuelan government and other institutions in the country rejected the announcement, and several Chavista figures have dismissed the allegations. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello has said that the Cartel de los Soles is an “invention” of the US, and the Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López has ‘categorically' rejected Washington's “ridiculous” accusations.

Anti-corruption protests rocked the Serbian capital of Belgrade as student-led demonstrators clashed with supporters of President Aleksandar Vucic and his political party, demanding new elections.

Violent clashes between anti-government protesters and Serbian security forces have intensified over the last week, with protesters setting fire to an office building belonging to the ruling party in Novi Sad.

"You will see the full determination of the Serbian state. We will use everything at our disposal to restore law, peace and order," President Vucic said in an address to the nation Saturday night.

SERBIA ROCKED BY ANTI-CORRUPTION PROTESTS AFTER CONSTRUCTION TRAGEDY

Tens of thousands of college students have been marching and protesting since December, demanding justice and accountability after the deaths of 16 people in the collapse of a railway station in the Serbian town of Novi Sad. The canopy at the railway station collapsed Nov. 1 after renovations led by two Chinese companies.

The government is accused of not implementing student demands, including the release of all documentation related to the reconstruction of the train station. In his speech, Vucic said that justice must be served for all those responsible for the 16 victims of the Novi Sad rail station collapse.

Critics have called out the heavy-handed response used against protesters. Alan Berset, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, said in a post on X that he was concerned with the rising violence.

SERBIA, CAUGHT BETWEEN EUROPE AND RUSSIA, COULD MOVE ONE STEP CLOSER TO NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH KOSOVO

"I call for calm and respect of the right to peaceful assembly. Serbian authorities must uphold Council of Europe standards. The rule of law and respect for human rights must prevail," Berset said.

Serbia's foreign minister, Marko Djuric, responded to the criticism in a statement to Fox News Digital. "We respect and protect peaceful protest—it is part of our democratic fabric. But when demonstrations turn into physical attacks and attempts to destabilize the country, the government has both the right and the duty to respond."

"This is by far the biggest threat Vucic has faced in the last 13 years, and it is very unlikely that Vucic will weather the storm without elections," Helena Ivanov, senior fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital.

"The country is not functioning, and the situation is dangerously escalating. The only way out of the problem is to hold free and fair elections as soon as possible. "Everything else will further destabilize the situation, which could have devastating consequences," Ivanov added.

The government is accused of not fulfilling one of the original student demands, including the release of all documentation related to the reconstruction of the train station.

What originally started as spontaneous protests voicing dissatisfaction with the government's failed response to the railway catastrophe transformed into a movement opposing widespread corruption and the erosion of the rule of law under Vucic.

One of the largest protests in Serbia's history took place on March 15, with nearly 350,000 people gathered in Slavija Square in central Belgrade.

Serbia's then-Prime Minister Milos Vucevic announced his resignation in January amid the nationwide protests, making him the most senior government member to step down.

"Serbian students put forward several demands, the first and most important being the release of documentation regarding the reconstruction of the Novi Sad train station, where the collapse of the canopy killed 16 people. To this day, no one has been held accountable," Filip Ubović, a student from the University of Belgrade and protest participant on the ground in Belgrade, told Fox News Digital.

Ubovic said the protests were originally aimed at influencing the institutions responsible for upholding the rule of law, and not directly against the ruling party. As the government failed to hold any officials accountable for the tragedy or release any information on the canopy collapse, the protesters realized that it was time to demand elections.

A U.S. appeals court has temporarily blocked the transfer of federal forest land in Arizona to a pair of international companies that plan to mine one of the largest copper deposits in North America. 

The transfer was scheduled for Tuesday. But a panel of judges with the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals issued a temporary injunction late Monday in response to last-minute appeals by a Native American tribe and environmentalists.

The land includes Oak Flat — an area used for centuries for religious ceremonies, prayer and gathering of medicinal plants by the San Carlos Apache people and other Native American tribes.

The fight over Oak Flat has spanned two decades, with the latest legal wrangling centered on a required environmental review that was released by the U.S. Forest Service earlier this summer and an appraisal of the land to be mined by Resolution Copper about 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Phoenix. 

Before the land exchange can happen, the plaintiffs argued that the federal government must prepare a comprehensive review that covers “every aspect of the planned mine and all related infrastructure.” They said the government failed to consider the potential for a dam breach, pipeline failure and if there was an emergency plan for a tailings storage area.

As for the appraisal, they said it doesn't account for the value of the copper deposits that are at least 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) below the surface.

The appeals court plans to hear arguments on the merits of the case later this year.




Opponents of the mine consider the court action a victory, saying prayers are paying off.

“This injunction comes in a desperate time of asking for miracles, all over the country and all over the world,” Wendsler Nosie Sr. of the group Apache Stronghold said in a statement shared on social media.

Nosie, a former tribal chairman, described the land and water at Oak Flat as precious.

Apache Stronghold, the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other plaintiffs having been fighting for years to save what tribal members call Chi'chil Bildagoteel. The area is dotted with oak groves and traditional plants the Apaches consider essential to their religion. 

“We will continue praying that the court understands the grave injustice of trading our sacred grounds to foreign mining companies that seek to destroy Chí'chil Biłdagoteel to extract copper that will be exported overseas,” Tribal Chairman Terry Rambler said in statement.

Resolution Copper — a subsidiary of international mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP — estimates the mine will generate $1 billion a year for Arizona's economy and create thousands of jobs. The project has support in the nearby community of Superior.

Resolution Copper has said the project underwent an extensive review by the U.S. Forest Service that has included consultation with tribes that have ancestral ties to the land. 

“The collaborative process has directly led to major changes to the mining plan to preserve and reduce potential impacts on tribal, social, environmental and cultural interests,” the company stated.

The Forest Service has argued in court filings that it has no discretion because the land exchange was mandated by Congress when language was included in a must-pass national defense spending bill that was signed into law in 2014 by then-President Barack Obama.

There have been unsuccessful legislative attempts in the years since to withdraw the Oak Flat area from mining activity.

Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang joins ‘Fox News Live' to explain how a potential peace deal between Ukraine and Russia could be viewed in Asia, particularly by China and North Korea.

North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un called for the rapid buildup of his nation's nuclear arsenal on Tuesday, reacting to joint military operations by the U.S. and South Korea.

Kim called the military exercises an "obvious expression of their will to provoke war," according to North Korean state media. The U.S. and South Korea began their annual military drills, dubbed Ulchi Freedom Shield, this week and operations will continue sporadically through September.

The North Korean leader argued the drills show the intent by the U.S. and South Korea to "remain most hostile and confrontational," and that North Korea must therefore "rapidly expand" its nuclear arsenal.

"Through this move, North Korea is demonstrating its refusal to accept denuclearization and the will to irreversibly upgrade nuclear weapons," Hong Min, a North Korea analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told Reuters.

The rise in tensions comes just days after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung announced plans to end some military activities along its border with North Korea, as well as restore a 2018 military agreement with its neighbor.

The agreement ended some military activities at the border between the two countries, including creating buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent fighting. It also ended military drills near the border and removed some guard posts along the Demilitarized Zone.

The deal was signed at an inter-Korean summit in 2018, but it eventually fell apart as cross-border tensions ensued.

South Korea also dismantled its speakers along the border that had broadcast anti-North Korea messaging for years, a move Pyongyang reciprocated.

Lee said his government would continue to make "gradual steps to restore the September 19 Military Agreement."

"I hope that North Korea will reciprocate our efforts to restore trust and revive dialogue," he added.

Microphones picked up conversations that U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders had as they gathered for talks at the White House.

LONDON (AP) — Behold the power of the humble hot mic.

The magnifier of sound, a descendant of 150-year-old technology, on Monday added to its long history of cutting through the most scripted political spectacles when it captured more than two minutes of U.S. President Donald Trump and eight European leaders chit-chatting around a White House news conference on their talks to end Russia's war in Ukraine. The standout quote came from Trump himself to French President Emmanuel Macron even before anyone sat down. The American president, reflecting his comments after meeting in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin: “I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand, as crazy as it sounds.”

How politics and diplomacy sound when the principals think no one is listening can reveal much about the character, humor and humanity of our leaders — for better and sometimes for worse. As public figures, they've long known what the rest of us are increasingly learning in the age of CCTV, Coldplay kiss cams and social media: In public, no one can realistically expect privacy.

“Whenever I hear about a hot mic moment, my first reaction is that this is what they really think, that it's not gone through the external communications filter,” said Bill McGowan, founder and CEO of Clarity Media Group in New York. “That's why people love it so much: There is nothing more authentic than what people say on a hot mic.”




Hot mics, often leavened with video, have bedeviled aspiring and actual leaders long before social media. During a sound check for his weekly radio address in 1984, U.S. President Ronald Reagan famously joked about attacking the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.

“My fellow Americans,” Reagan quipped, not realizing the practice run was being recorded. “I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.” The Soviet Union didn't find it funny and condemned it given the consequential subject at hand.

Putin, too, has fallen prey to the perils of a live mic. In 2006, he was quoted in Russian media joking about Israel's president, who had been charged with and later was convicted of rape. The Kremlin said Putin was not joking about rape and his meaning had been lost in translation.

Sometimes a hot mic moment involves no words at all. Presidential candidate Al Gore was widely parodied for issuing exasperated and very audible sighs during his debate with George W. Bush in 2000. In others, the words uttered for all to hear are profane.

Bush was caught telling running mate Dick Cheney that a reporter for The New York Times was a “major-league a--hole.” 

“This is a big f———- deal,” then-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden famously said, loudly enough to be picked up on a microphone, as President Barack Obama prepared to sign his signature Affordable Care Act in 2010.

Obama was caught on camera in South Korea telling Dmitri Medvedev, then the Russian president, that he'll have “more flexibility” to resolve sensitive issues — “particularly with missile defense” — after the 2012 presidential election, his last. Republican Mitt Romney, Obama's rival that year, called the exchange “bowing to the Kremlin.”

“Sometimes it's the unguarded moments that are the most revealing of all,” Romney said in a statement, dubbing the incident “hot mic diplomacy.”

Live mics have picked up name-calling and gossip aplenty even in the most mannerly circles. 

In 2022, Jacinda Ardern, then New Zealand's prime minister, known for her skill at debating and calm, measured responses, was caught on a hot mic tossing an aside in which she referred to a rival politician as “such an arrogant pr—-” during Parliament Question Time.

In 2005, Jacques Chirac, then president of France, was recorded airing his distaste for British food during a visit to Russia. Speaking to Putin and Gerhard Schroder, he was heard saying that worse food could only be found in Finland, according to widely reported accounts. 

Britain's King Charles III chose to deal with his hot mic moment with humor. In 2022, shortly after his coronation, Charles lost his patience with a leaky pen while signing a document on a live feed. He can be heard grousing: “Oh, God, I hate this!” and muttering, “I can't bear this bloody thing … every stinking time.” 

It wasn't the first pen that had troubled him. The British ability to poke fun at oneself, he said in a speech the next year, is well known: “Just as well, you may say, given some of the vicissitudes I have faced with frustratingly failing fountain pens this past year.”

The American president is famously uncontrolled in public with a penchant for “saying it like it is,” sometimes with profanity. That makes him popular among some supporters.

But even he had trouble putting a lid on comments he made before he was a candidate to “Access Hollywood” in tapes that jeopardized his campaign in the final stretch of the 2016 presidential race. Trump did not appear to know the microphone was recording.

Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News and aired just two days before his debate with Hillary Clinton. The celebrity businessman boasted “when you're a star, they let you do it,” in a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show.

With major supporters balking, Trump issued an apology “if anyone was offended,” and his campaign dismissed the comments as “locker room banter.” 

On Monday, though, the chatter on both ends of the East Room press conference gave observers a glimpse of the diplomatic game. 

Dismissed unceremoniously from the White House in March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now sat at the table with Trump and seven of his European peers: Macron, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Finland's President Alexander Stubb, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Trump complimented Macron's tan. He said Stubb is a good golfer. He asked if anyone wanted to ask the press questions when the White House pool was admitted to the room — before it galloped inside. The European leaders smiled at the shouting and shuffling.

Stubb asked Trump if he's “been through this every day?”

Trump replied, “All the time.”

Meloni said she doesn't want to talk to the Italian press. But Trump, she noted, is game. 

“He loves it. He loves it, eh?” she said.

Rhode Island Assistant Attorney General Devon Flanagan was arrested in an incident that is now being reviewed by her boss, Attorney General Peter Neronha.

Flanagan's Aug. 14 arrest was captured in body cam footage that the Newport Police Department released to the public. In the video, Flanagan is heard repeatedly telling officers that she is “an AG.” After Flanagan is handcuffed and placed into the back of a police car, she criticizes the arresting officer for not reciting her Miranda rights.

“You're going to regret this,” Flanagan says. “You're going to regret it.”

Clarke Cook House Restaurant asked Flanagan and her friend Veronica Hannan to leave the establishment, but was allegedly rebuffed by the women. When police arrived, the pair spoke to the officer in slurred speech. Flanagan encouraged officers to turn off their body cameras before her arrest.

The Washington Examiner reached Neronha's office for comment.

Neronha's office told ABC 6 News that it is reviewing the arrest of the employee who has worked there for seven years. Flanagan works under the Appellate Unit of the Criminal Division.

Police charged Flanagan with trespassing, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is deploying three Aegis guided-missile destroyers to the waters off Venezuela as part of President Donald Trump's effort to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels, according to a U.S. official briefed on the planning.

The USS Gravely, the USS Jason Dunham and the USS Sampson are expected to arrive soon, said the official, who was not authorized to comment and spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. 

A Defense Department official confirmed that the military assets have been assigned to the region in support of counter narcotics efforts. The official, who was not authorized to comment about military planning, said the vessels would be deployed “over the course of several months.”

The deployment of U.S. destroyers and personnel comes as Trump has pushed for using the U.S. military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into American communities and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities.

Trump has also pressed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically being more aggressive in pursuit of Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Trump and others of intervention by the U.S. military.

Trump in February designated Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, MS-13 in El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations. His Republican administration has also stepped up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members.




The designation is normally reserved for groups like al-Qaida or the Islamic State group that use violence for political ends — not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels.

But the Trump administration argues the international connections and operations of the groups — including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory — warrant the designation.

Venezuela's Communication Ministry didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.

On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said the U.S. had increased its threats against Venezuela and announced he was going to order the deployment of more than 4.5 million militia members around the country. The militias were created by then-President Hugo Chávez to incorporate volunteers who could assist the armed forces in the defense of external and domestic attacks.

“The empire has gone mad and has renewed its threats to Venezuela's peace and tranquility,” Maduro said at an event in Caracas, without mentioning any specific action.

Earlier this month, the Trump government announced it was doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.

Maduro was indicted in a New York federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. Back then, the U.S. offered a $15 million reward for his arrest.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem slams Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson during a visit to Illinois on Aug. 8, 2025.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) invoked President Franklin Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II as the Trump administration was set to open a massive detention center at Fort Bliss in Texas on Monday.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) torched the comparison, with a top official left wondering why an organization with such a name "care[s] more about illegal aliens than U.S. citizens," in comments to Fox News Digital.

"Comparisons of illegal alien detention centers to internment camps used during World War II are deranged and lazy. The ACLU's smears against our brave ICE law enforcement are no doubt contributing to the more than 1,000% increase in assaults against them," Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

"[The ACLU] should change their name. The facts are ICE is targeting the worst of the worst—including murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, and rapists. 70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges in the U.S. — that doesn't even include known or suspected terrorists, foreign gang members, convictions for violent crimes in foreign countries, or INTERPOL notices."

BIDEN TEAM LEFT THOUSANDS OF MIGRANT KIDS WITH UNVETTED SPONSORS, RECORDS REVEAL

On Sunday, before Fort Bliss' "Camp East Montana" center was to open at the historically pivotal military base near the U.S.–Mexico and New Mexico borders, the ACLU's regional affiliates released a joint statement calling the move "another shameful chapter" in the base's history.

"The renewed use of this base to detain immigrants and stage deportations comes as the Trump administration continues to misuse military resources to deport long-standing residents and other immigrants," the release read, calling the president's mass-deportation agenda "dystopian."

"President Trump's use of Fort Bliss for the nation's largest immigrant detention site is cruel and a reminder of a shameful detention legacy," added Sarah Mehta, a top official in the ACLU's Equality Division – who also called on Congress to stop DHS' agenda.

"Thousands of people, including our neighbors and loved ones, will be torn from their communities while this administration enlists the military to rubberstamp its abusive agenda."

Fort Bliss — named after the son-in-law of Mexican-American War hero and later President Zachary Taylor — also held a small number of German and Italian immigrants during World War II.

UNION BOSS COMPARES ICE TO AL PACINO MOBSTER AS MORE DEMS PILE ON IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

In 1942, Roosevelt initiated an executive order targeting Americans descended from countries representing the Axis powers. The Democrat ushered in the incarceration of about 120,000 Japanese-Americans and smaller numbers of Italian and German descendants.

While Fort Bliss was not a main "internment camp," it did hold small numbers of interred U.S. citizens, including as many as 70 "Issei," or first-generation Japanese-Americans living along the Pacific Coast.

After the war, German scientist Wernher von Braun – a former Untersturmführer in the S.S. -- and other former Axis power-players worked there with the Americans to develop what eventually became the U.S. Space Program, now run by NASA.

Considered a 38,000-soldier "megabase," it has also been a crucial staging ground for the War on Terror.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, toured Fort Bliss' new detention facility last week and told El Paso's NBC affiliate that the people who will be held there are already on their way out of the U.S.

"These are people under final orders of deportation ... They have no legal right to be here," Cornyn said.

El Paso's member of Congress, Democrat Veronica Escobar, disagreed.

Escobar argued the $1 billion price tag would "enrich" private contractors and siphon funds from other needs in her district.

As many as 5,000 detainees will be held at Fort Bliss, according to reports.

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks says Illinois public schools shouldn't be allowed to 'play therapist' on children after failing math and reading scores.

Starting in the 2027–2028 school year, Illinois will be the first state to force annual mental health screenings on all public school kids in grades 3-12. Gov. J.B. Pritzker says it's about catching issues like anxiety and depression early to boost kids' well-being and keep them on track academically and socially. It sounds noble, but I'm not sold. This plan raises red flags that could spell more trouble than solutions.

First off, the idea of shifting mental healthcare from reactive to preventive sounds great on paper. Who doesn't want to stop problems before they spiral? But let's be real: Illinois schools are already dropping the ball on the basics. According to Wirepoints, only 39% of students—1.1 million kids—read at grade level. Math scores are even worse. If schools can't teach kids to read and write properly, why should we trust them to play therapist? I'd argue that building confidence through real academic success—pushing kids to excel, not just pass—does more for their mental health than any questionnaire ever could.

Mental health is deeply personal. No two kids are alike, and a one-size-fits-all tablet quiz can't capture that. Schools aren't therapy offices. They're not equipped to dig into the root of a kid's struggles…

Then there's the screening itself. They're using tablets that ask everything from your mood to your home life. The state says these will be "age-appropriate," but kids, especially young ones, aren't exactly known for nuance. 

ILLINOIS GOV JB PRITZKER LAMBASTED FOR NEW ‘DISASTROUS POLICY' REQUIRING MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS FOR KIDS

A third-grader might check "sad" because they lost their favorite pencil, or a teen might exaggerate home issues out of frustration. Misinterpretations could lead to overreactions—think a parent getting a knock from DCFS over a kid's bad day. 

The state promises privacy and follow-ups by professionals, but with thousands of kids screened, who's ensuring every case is handled right? One slip-up, and families could face real consequences. Another slip-up: a school could let a child slip through the cracks. 

A true psychologist must investigate these issues to get to the root of the problem and that takes time. We're asking teachers and staff to add to their workload and that is not feasible. Also, there has been a shortage of mental health professionals in this country. Look at the Uvalde, Texas, shooting in 2022—mental health professionals were in short supply then, and the American Psychological Association reported a nationwide shortage of school psychologists as recently as 2024.

Illinois schools are already stretched thin with counselors; who's handling the fallout when a kid is flagged? Teachers? They're not trained for this, and piling on more work isn't fair or feasible.

The data angle is another red flag. These screenings will churn out sensitive info—moods, behaviors, maybe family dynamics. In today's world, information is power, and this data could be sliced up by race, gender or income to spotlight disparities. The state's push for health equity, as seen in its Beacon Portal, suggests they'll use this to argue certain groups need more help.

The problem with disparities is that race and other immutable characteristics are always blamed — it is never based on the individual but on the group. This could spiral into a mess that leaves the mental health issues of the individual student unsolved. Parents already worry about schools overstepping; handing over this kind of data doesn't build trust.

Mental health is deeply personal. No two kids are alike, and a one-size-fits-all tablet quiz can't capture that. Schools aren't therapy offices. They're not equipped to dig into the root of a kid's struggles, and with professional shortages, many kids flagged by screenings might not get the help they need. 

Here's a better way: use the state's budget to boost academic programs that build kids' confidence alongside targeted mental health support for those who need it. That respects families, eases the burden on overworked schools, and avoids the risk of sensitive data being mishandled or misused. Illinois can't afford to get this wrong. Do you trust a system that's failing at education to handle your kid's mental health?

Hundreds of people may have been exposed to rabies while staying in bat-infested cabins in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park.

The potentially affected visitors reportedly came from 38 states and seven countries, according to Wyoming Public Media (WPM), which noted that employees were also being contacted over possible exposure.

"Grand Teton National Park staff are working closely with the NPS Office of Health and Safety, Wyoming Department of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Grand Teton Lodge Company to address potential guest exposures to bats in the Jackson Lake Lodge," Grand Teton National Park spokesperson Emily Davis told Fox News Digital.

Davis added that the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH) is leading the response and contacting individuals who stayed in the affected rooms between May 15 and July 27 "to see if they meet the risk criteria for receiving rabies prevention treatment."

The bat-infested cabins were found at Jackson Lake Lodge and may have impacted at least 200 guests, according to WPM. The outlet describes the lodge as "cottage-style hotel rooms." 

Following eight reports of run-ins with bats since June, the cabins were closed on July 27, WPM reported.

Rabies vaccines are done in a series and can range in cost, even going up to $16,000, according to the Jackson Hole News&Guide.

None of the bats found in some of the Jackson Lake Lodge cabins had tested positive for rabies as of Friday, according to the Associated Press. However, Wyoming State Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist told the AP that the bats tested represented only a small sample of what could be dozens colonizing the attic.

"What we're really concerned about is people who saw bats in their rooms and people who might have had direct contact with a bat," Harrist told the AP.

Forensics expert Joseph Scott Morgan joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the death of New York City designer Martha Nolan-O'Slatarra. 

Funeral arrangements have been announced for 33-year-old fashion designer Martha Nolan, a native of Ireland who launched a summerwear brand called East x East in New York before police found her dead aboard a 54-foot yacht in Montauk earlier this month.

A funeral Mass is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday local time at the Cathedral of the Assumption in Carlow, Ireland, followed immediately by her burial at St. Mary's Cemetery.

In lieu of flowers, her family is asking for donations in her honor to be made to the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust, a donor-funded charity that brings the remains of Irish nationals home for burial.

Her family was reportedly seeking a second autopsy before her remains were returned home.

Her official cause of death could not be determined after a preliminary investigation and autopsy, according to Suffolk County police. Authorities said they found no signs of violence and are expected to be awaiting the results of a toxicology report.

Arthur Aidala, a high-profile New York attorney hired by her family, said relatives met with homicide detectives and that a "deep, deep" investigation was underway to determine what happened to her before she died.

Aidala is disputing some reports that suggest a drug overdose is expected in Nolan's death, calling them premature and speculative. He urged patience as the family awaits more information and investigators continue to probe the incident.

Town of East Hampton police arrived at the Montauk Yacht Club around midnight on Aug. 5 in response to a report of an unconscious woman on a Sea Ray Sundancer 540 docked there, named the Ripple. When officers arrived, good Samaritans were attempting CPR, according to authorities. But first responders pronounced Nolan dead at the scene.

County homicide detectives took over the investigation later that morning.

Nolan was the founder of East x East, a boutique fashion company focused on beachwear and sunglasses. It also offered a Montauk-themed hoodie, emblazoned with the slogan, "I only love you in Montauk."

The yacht owner was reportedly an investor in Nolan's business. At the time of her death, she was also going through a divorce from her husband, Sam Ryan.

﻿Does Trump know he's blowing up the GOP's future?

For all the talk of a new, lasting multiracial coalition that helped elect President Donald Trump, there are clues that this support may be wavering, particularly among Latino voters. Polls show the president's approval rating with this group has plummeted since the last election, and a third of Latinos who voted for him say they are unlikely to back a Republican candidate in the next one.

This collapse happened for a few reasons. Latino voters are souring not only on the president generally, but also on his handling of key issues like immigration and the economy — the very topics that boosted his support with them initially. And curiously, this decline in support for the president isn't translating into a surge for Democrats. Instead, many Latino voters express dissatisfaction with both parties.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

This shifting dynamic suggests that both parties have been operating on flawed assumptions over the last few years. Democrats made the mistake of treating Latinos as a monolithic group, focusing on social justice issues while failing to address economic concerns that were pushing these voters toward the GOP.

Now, Republicans may be poised to make a similar mistake. They have largely viewed these voters as Republicans-in-waiting, banking on a rightward drift that they assume extends to the most extreme parts of the conservative social agenda. This approach risks alienating a large segment of the Latino electorate. Ultimately, both parties are learning a crucial lesson: Demographics aren't destiny, and they need a more nuanced understanding of this diverse and rapidly changing group of voters.

Over the last decade, Trump has remade the American electorate with the help of Latino voters. Back in 2016, his highly racialized and polarizing election victory resulted in one of the worst performances with Latino voters in modern history, winning fewer than three in 10 Hispanic and Latino voters, well below average for Republican candidates.

But splits began to develop among Latino communities in the US over the next few years. Working-class, non-college educated, and male Latinos, as well as those from Florida and the Southwest, began to drift away from Democrats, particularly at the national level. They were more intrigued by Republican pitches centered around the economy, small business growth, and affordability.

At the same time, Democrats were hesitant to admit they had an issue with the Latino population, quibbling over messaging and campaign investments while missing the plot. By the time of the 2020 election, Trump had managed to not just recover his party's losses in 2016, but expand on them, shrinking the Democratic advantage with Latinos by nearly 20 points.

Democrats, it turns out, misread Latino voters' priorities and beliefs, gradually losing support from the peak they had from 2012 to 2016 (when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton enjoyed 40-point margins). The party largely approached Latinos as “voters of color,” marginalized minorities who could be mobilized through appeals to identity, immigrant solidarity, and social justice.

For some time, this worked, but Latinos weren't behaving like a monolithic group. Instead, Latinos would fracture and become more dissimilar during this time, with various kinds of evangelicals, border residents, naturalized immigrants, and working-class Latinos remaining or becoming more conservative as the Democratic Party and its white, college-educated base became more progressive.

Particularly on issues like crime, immigration and the border, and gender roles and identity, the liberal positions that Democrats took — or were portrayed to take — were out of step with the views of many conservative and moderate Latinos from 2020 to 2024.

In 2021, the Pew Research Center found that the most liberal, educated, and politically engaged Democrats exerted outsized influence on their party. By the 2024 election, this created an opening for Republicans, as Latino voters expressed greater openness to Trump and the GOP's stances on the economy, immigration, and abortion. By then, their votes had begun to follow some of their beliefs.

As Democrats stumbled, Republicans stuck to a different approach: treating Latinos as a new kind of white voter. They doubled down on a hawkish and xenophobic immigration message that seemed to resonate with a large minority of Latinos, spoke of the border as an issue of crime and public safety, and talked nonstop about prices and affordability to exploit the lack of trust in Democrats' stewardship of the economy.

Republicans sought to make the old Reagan line, that “Hispanics are conservatives, [but] they just don't know it yet,” come true by hammering home the idea that Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party were too radical and out of touch.

This approach worked. Latinos concerned with immigration and the economy shifted to Republicans, and Trump posted a double-digit boost in support among Latinos, shrinking the Democratic advantage another 20 points.

An array of data suggests that this advantage is looking more short-lived, largely because Republicans aren't taking into account the nuances of Latino voters. The GOP still did not win a majority of Latinos last year — and much of the boost was from disaffected Democrats or more moderate, disengaged Latinos who don't have the same strong ideological leanings as the primarily white MAGA base.

Latino voters are rapidly changing, existing as both a racial minority and an assimilating, formerly immigrant generation. 

The most recent evidence for this divergence comes from two research projects undertaken by the Democratic-aligned Equis Research group. In the spring, they tracked growing dissatisfaction among Latino voters with Trump's handling of the economy, cost of living, and immigration. Even among what Equis calls “Biden defectors,” those former Democrats who switched to supporting Trump in 2024, a slight majority were beginning to turn on Trump's economic policies.

This dynamic extended to immigration, where an overwhelming majority of all Latino voters thought the administration's actions were “going too far and targeting the types of immigrants who strengthen our nation.” Some 36 percent of Trump-voting Latinos said the same thing, and a majority of Biden defectors, some 64 percent, felt the same way.

This suggests some degree of remaining immigrant solidarity among these swingier, evolving segments of the Latino electorate and disapproval over how mass deportations and aggressive anti-immigrant policies will affect law-abiding immigrants and their families.

Nearly two-thirds of Latinos in Equis' polling believe that the Trump administration's actions “will make it difficult for hardworking Latinos to feel safe, by increasing racial profiling and harassing all Latinos regardless of immigration status.” In other words, there is a limit to what various kinds of Latino voters are willing to stomach.

The same dynamic is becoming clearer with regards to the economy, where Latino voters, and new Trump voters specifically, are unhappy with the state of the economy. Biden defectors, Equis finds, are net negative on Trump's economic policies: -6 percent of support in May and -8 percent in July.

Whether this dynamic not only hurts the GOP but also helps Democrats is unclear. Although many Latino voters still believe Republicans favor the wealthy over the working class, this long-standing sentiment is no longer pushing them toward the Democratic Party. Instead, they increasingly distrust both parties on this question.

But together, these signs suggest that the GOP is going too far with their policy and ideological mission in Trump's second term, turning off the new converts they won to their coalition over the last 10 years.

The two major parties are making errors with Latino voters. Both have to moderate their policy and ideological approaches while bringing more nuance to how they campaign.

Latinos do have some things that bind them together, and they are not just like white voters who can ignore discrimination and scapegoating and uprooting of their extended community's lives (as immigration enforcement is showing). At the same time, they need to be talked to with more nuance.

Democrats tried to do this in 2024, moderating on immigration, dropping the usage of the term “Latinx,” and investing in hyper-specific, hyper-local campaigning with various kinds of Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans, and others. But there was only so much campaigning they could do when facing a wave of anti-Biden, anti-incumbent electoral sentiment.

Republicans, meanwhile, toned down immigration talk and zeroed in on subgroups of the Latino electorate in battleground states in 2020. They appealed to religious and ideological conservatives — Cuban, South American, and Puerto Rican communities in Florida, as well as border communities in Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. Some of this nuanced campaigning did carry over to 2024, but it focused more on young and male Latinos in general. And 2024 saw a return to a kind of dog-whistle, racialized, and anti-immigrant scapegoating, which helped the anti-incumbent tide.

Latino voters are rapidly changing, existing as both a racial minority and an assimilating, formerly immigrant generation. Both parties will have to find a middle ground to recover or build up their coalitions. There is no such thing as a Latino voter, but rather, various kinds of Latino voters. Each must be approached differently.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un condemned South Korean-U.S. military drills and vowed a rapid expansion of his nuclear forces to counter rivals, state media said Tuesday, as he inspected his most advanced warship being fitted with nuclear-capable systems.

Kim's visit to the western port of Nampo on Monday came as the South Korean and U.S. militaries kicked off their annual large-scale summertime exercise to bolster readiness against growing North Korean threats. The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, which the allies describe as defensive, will mobilize 21,000 troops, including 18,000 South Koreans, for computer-simulated command post operations and field training. 

North Korea has long denounced the allies' joint drills as invasion rehearsals and Kim has often used them to justify his own military displays and testing activities aimed at expanding his nuclear weapons program.

The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war, divided by the Demilitarized Zone into North Korea and South Korea.

While inspecting the warship Choe Hyon, a 5,000-ton-class destroyer first unveiled in April, Kim said the allies' joint military drills show hostility and their supposed “will to ignite a war,” the North's Korean Central News Agency said. He claimed that the exercises have grown more provocative than before by incorporating a “nuclear element,” requiring the North to respond with “proactive and overwhelming” countermeasures. 

“The security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day and the prevailing situation requires us to make a radical and swift change in the existing military theory and practice and rapid expansion of nuclearization,” KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying, using the initials of North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Kang Yu-jung, spokesperson for South Korea's new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, who wants to improve ties with the North, said Seoul has “always regarded the Ulchi exercises as defensive” but offered no further comment on Kim's remarks. South Korea's Defense Ministry said it had no immediate new assessments to share regarding the North Korean warship's capabilities.




South Korean and U.S. military officials say Ulchi Freedom Shield will focus on countering North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile threat and will include training to deter North Korean nuclear use and respond to its missile attacks. The exercise will also incorporate lessons from recent conflicts, including Russia's war in Ukraine and the clash between Israel and Iran, and address threats from drones, GPS jamming and cyberattacks. 

Kim has hailed the development of his naval destroyer, Choe Hyon, as a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military. State media said the destroyer, which is being prepared to enter active duty next year, is designed to handle various weapons systems, including antiair and anti-naval weapons, as well as nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. 

The North unveiled a second destroyer of the same class in May, but the vessel was damaged during a botched launching ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin, prompting an angry reaction from Kim, who called the failure “criminal.” The North has said the new destroyer, named Kang Kon, was relaunched in June after repair, but some outside experts have questioned whether the ship is fully operational.

During Monday's visit to Nampo, Kim also reviewed North Korean efforts to complete a third destroyer by October, KCNA said. While inspecting Choe Hyon, Kim expressed satisfaction with the progress of the warship's weapons tests and its integrated operations system, saying the navy's modernization and move toward nuclear-capable capabilities are proceeding as planned. He instructed officials to carry out performance tests in October, KCNA said.

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened in recent years as Kim accelerated his military nuclear program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. His government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Washington and Seoul to revive negotiations aimed at winding down his nuclear and missile programs, which derailed in 2019 following a collapsed summit with U.S. President Donald Trump during his first term. 

In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South's efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks.

The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between the Koreas, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes. But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea's launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume front-line military activities and propaganda campaigns. The step came after North Korea had already declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.

Acting I.C.E. director Todd Lyons discusses the recent arrest of a criminal illegal immigrant in Rhode Island, the work behind the 'Speedway Slammer,' the attempts to recruit new agents, and more on the 'Big Weekend Show.'

A Maine reserve police officer arrested by ICE for allegedly trying to buy a firearm illegally has agreed to leave the country, the agency said.

Jon Luke Evans, a reserve officer with the Old Orchard Beach Police Department, and a Jamaican national, was arrested on July 25 with help from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), according to ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO).

Evans was taken into custody after a firearm purchase attempt raised concerns tied to his immigration status.

A judge has now granted Evans voluntary departure, giving him the ability to leave the U.S. at his own expense rather than face deportation. 

Reports by federal authorities claim he legally entered the United States through Miami International Airport on Sept. 24, 2023. Evans was reportedly under a visa that required his departure by Oct. 1, 2023, but he failed to leave as required and has been in the U.S. unlawfully since.

ICE officials are now investigating how he was hired by the local police agency and if he was given a department-issued weapon. 

"This case raises serious concerns," said Patricia H. Hyde, acting field office director for ERO Boston. "We will continue working to ensure that individuals who violate immigration laws and pose potential threats to public safety are held accountable."

Police Chief Elise Chard says they were told by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country and that proper documentation was submitted via the Department of Homeland Security's E-Verify program.

"The town reiterates its ongoing commitment to meeting all state and federal laws regarding employment," Chard said in a statement. "We will continue to rely on the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form and the E-Verify database to confirm employment eligibility."

            It was the best day Ukraine has had in a very long time. But it's still hard to see how the war unleashed by Russia's brutal invasion ends any time soon.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House on Monday and, unlike last time, there wasn't a blow-up in the Oval Office.
    


            President Donald Trump offered tantalizing glimpses of how he could approach presidential greatness by saving Ukraine, securing Europe and genuinely deserving the Nobel Peace Prize.
    


            A phalanx of European leaders who came to support Zelensky were impressive and unusually unified despite their wide ideological divergences. They took turns in on-camera remarks to try to invest Trump with a political and emotional rationale for standing with Ukraine.
    


            A historic day echoed great political gatherings that ended World War II and built the modern world. This is how the West is supposed to work, with an American president leading powerful Europeans who share common goals.
    


            But is it too good to last?
    


            It is a measure of the fracture in the transatlantic alliance and Trump's brittle temperament that avoiding disasters is seen as serious progress, especially after the president's concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin at their unctuous summit in Alaska last week.
    


            Everyone at the remarkable meetings in the White House, Trump included, was ostentatiously doing everything to stress possibilities and to avoid specific discussions of issues that could blow the day apart.
    


            By evening, Trump was posting on social media about a potential three-way summit he'd host soon that would also include Zelensky and Putin that could be preceded by a one-on-one between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said such a meeting could happen within two weeks, suggesting accelerating diplomatic momentum.
    


            Finnish President Alexander Stubb told Trump that “in the past two weeks, we've probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three and a half years.” For once, this wasn't a foreign leader indulging in self-abasement to ingratiate themselves with a US president who craves adulation.
    


            It was the truth.
    


            Monday's meetings were the most compelling sign yet that the president really means it when he says he wants to stop the killing in Ukraine. He may deserve more credit than he gets for his energy and commitment so far.
    


            But the day also served to expose the questions that will become increasingly evident in the coming weeks that could scupper Trump's push for peace and shatter Western unity — in a way that would delight Putin.
    


            There was a lot of happy talk over the need to give Ukraine security guarantees after any peace deal. Trump even signaled he'd send support from the US military. But no one has yet explained how this would work — and, more importantly, what Russia would stomach as part of a deal.
    


            Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni raised one proposal for a set of guarantees by Western nations modeled on NATO's Article 5 mutual defense pledge. This would be outside formal alliance structures but might work the same way. But, despite Trump's assurance after Alaska that Putin is open to security guarantees for Ukraine, this is a long shot. The Russian leader is fighting a war to crush his neighbor's NATO aspirations. Why would he accept an arrangement that would offer pseudo-alliance status to Ukraine?
    


            And how strong would such guarantees be anyway? Would European nations who put troops into a Ukraine “reassurance force' really fight a war against Russia, to save Ukraine from a new Russian invasion? The subtext of the current war has been the anxiety of both the Biden and Trump administrations over potentially being dragged into a war with nuclear-armed Russia.
    


            And how would Trump's MAGA base view such a new foreign commitment?
    


            Then there's the issue of territory.
    


            The buzzword in the president's nascent peace process is “land swaps” — to create a new demarcation between an expanded Russia and a newly diminished Ukraine. Trump even gave Zelensky a map, for which he was suitably grateful, as if he doesn't already realize the tough choices ahead over land soaked in Ukrainian blood.
    


            According to officials briefed on Trump's summit with Putin, the Russian leader seeks to capture land through negotiations that his troops have failed to seize, including in the economic and industrial powerhouse region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine. This area is also the line of steel, concrete and heavily defended cities that Ukraine has built to hold Russia at bay and that it would need to deter future attacks.
    


            The term “land swap” is the kind of phrase that conceals its true meaning. Ukraine would, under the Russian plan, essentially be engaging in bargaining for different parts of its own territory. Putin would get valuable strategic areas and offer, other less critical districts he's already seized elsewhere inside Ukraine. It doesn't seem much of a deal.
    


            Land swaps create epochal upheaval and seed future feuds — as the Middle East shows. In this case, they would mean telling thousands of Ukrainians they have must leave home or become Russians. And Zelensky would have to explain to parents of fallen young Ukrainians why they died for territory to be given to Putin.
    


            There are some formulations that could withhold official recognition over disputed areas to postpone the critical decisions on sovereignty and freeze the war in place. This would create a situation like the one between North and South Korea or in the divided Germany during the Cold War. But these are still choices that may be impossible for Zelensky to sell to his people.
    


            This explains why Monday's discussions were surreal.
    


            “I think everybody is in a happy mood, and I think that is better than not being in a happy mood, I suppose,” former Trump first-term national security adviser John Bolton told CNN's Anderson Cooper. “I think the focus on meetings underscores the lack of substance on all this.”
    


            Every major peace effort looks hopeless at the start. Sometimes the only way to push past intractable issues is to create an inner impetus. So Trump's rush to hold summits may make sense. Perhaps he can quickly drive everyone so far along the road to peace, it will be impossible to go back.
    


            But, at some point, impossible gaps must be bridged.
    


            “I don't think what we are living through at this moment, where everybody seems a party to fantasy diplomacy, — I don't think it is sustainable,” the Wilson Center's Michael Kimmage, author of the book “Collisions: The Origins of the War in Ukraine and the New Global Instability,” told Richard Quest on CNN International.
    


            When Trump returned to office, many supporters of Ukraine feared he'd leave it to its fate. The president still balks at the kind of massive US military aid packages that saved the country after Putin's vicious invasion in 2022.
    


            But Trump has now invested significant personal credibility and political capital into his push to end a war he now admits is far more complex than he'd understood when he vowed to quiet the guns within 24 hours. Underscoring the point, air raid sirens wailed over Kyiv while the diplomacy got going in the White House.
    


            On Monday, Trump mostly restrained his temper in an Oval Office press event with Zelensky when reporters from conservative networks seemed to be goading him into an outburst. Then, he played the traditional convening role of a US president surrounded by transatlantic allies. He often treats friends like foes, but seems to have genuine respect for allied leaders. For once, he was squarely in the internationalist tradition of presidents like Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan or George H.W. Bush.
    


            “We're all working for the same goal, very simple goal — we want to stop the killing, get this settled,” Trump said.
    


            Several jarring moments, however, fueled concerns about Trump's true loyalties in the peace process. He was caught on a hot mic telling French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin “wants to make a deal for me.” This shows a dangerous naivete about a Russian leader who launched a murderous unprovoked war and is bent on reviving a myth of Russian greatness.
    


            Trump then suspended talks with European leaders to go off to speak to Putin on the phone.
    


            This kind of behavior was exactly why Trump's European counterparts rushed across the Atlantic at a weekend's notice. Suspicion lingers about his capabilities and his commitment to Western security.
    


            Still, no one else can position himself between Zelensky and the leaders of Europe and Putin. If there's ever a peace deal, it will probably be because Trump wielded his charisma and America's power.
    


            It's a highly unorthodox approach that may not work.
    


            Kimmage, for example, warned that Trump's strategy could shatter over its inner contradictions. Trump is “trying to be all things to all people, he is meeting with Putin and welcoming him with open arms and seeming to come to some agreement. He is speaking about security commitments to Ukraine; he is praising European leaders for supporting Ukraine.”
    


            “There are no details to what is happening. It's all promises, and the promises on the surface contradict each other.”
    


            “You just wonder how long President Trump can juggle all these balls.”
    


            Thousands of lives depend on the answer.

President Donald Trump on Monday vowed more changes to the way elections are conducted in the U.S., but based on the Constitution there is little to nothing he can do on his own.

Relying on false information and conspiracy theories that he's regularly used to explain away his 2020 election loss, Trump pledged on his social media site that he would do away with both mail voting — which remains popular and is used by about one-third of all voters — and voting machines — some form of which are used in almost all of the country's thousands of election jurisdictions. These are the same systems that enabled Trump to win the 2024 election and Republicans to gain control of Congress.

Trump's post marks an escalation even in his normally overheated election rhetoric. He issued a wide-ranging executive order earlier this year that, among other changes, would have required documented proof-of-citizenship before registering to vote. His Monday post promised another election executive order to “help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm elections.”

The same post also pushed falsehoods about voting. He claimed the U.S. is the only country to use mail voting, when it's actually used by dozens, including Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Similar complaints to Trump's, when aired on conservative and conservative-leaning networks such as Newsmax and Fox News, have led to multimillion dollar defamation settlements, including one announced Monday, because they are full of false information and the outlets have not been able to present any evidence to support them. 




Trump's post came after the president told Fox News that Russian President Vladimir Putin, in their Friday meeting in Alaska, echoed his grievances about mail voting and the 2020 election. Trump continued his attack on mail voting and voting machines in the Oval Office on Monday, during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The announcement signals yet another way that Trump intends to stack the cards in his favor in the 2026 midterm elections, after he already has directed his attorney general to investigate a Democratic fundraising platform and urged states to redraw their congressional districts to help the GOP maintain its majority in the House of Representatives.

Here's a breakdown of Trump's latest election post and why Congress is the one entity that can implement national election rules.

Trump for years has promoted false information about voting, and Monday was no exception.

He claimed there is “MASSIVE FRAUD” due to mail voting, when in fact voting fraud in the U.S. is rare. As an example, an Associated Press review after the 2020 election found fewer than 475 cases of potential fraud in the six battleground states where he disputed his loss, far too few to tip that election to Trump.

Washington and Oregon, which conduct elections entirely by mail, have sued to challenge Trump's earlier executive order — which sought to require that all ballots must be received by Election Day and not just postmarked by then. The states argue that the president has no such authority, and they are seeking a declaration from a federal judge in Seattle that their postmark deadlines do not conflict with federal law setting the date of U.S. elections.

Trump also alleged that voting machines are more expensive than “Watermark Paper.” That's a little-used system that has gained favor and investments among some voting conspiracy theorists who believe it would help prevent fraudulent ballots from being introduced into the vote count. Watermarks would not provide a way to count ballots, so they would not on their own replace vote tabulating machines. 

While some jurisdictions still have voters use electronic ballot-marking devices to cast their votes, the vast majority of voters in the U.S. already vote on paper ballots, creating an auditable record of votes that provides an extra safeguard for election security.

In his post, Trump also claimed that states “are merely an ‘agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes” and must do what the federal government “as represented by the President of the United States” tells them to do.

Election lawyers said that's a misrepresentation of the U.S. Constitution. It also flies in the face of what had been a core Republican Party value of prioritizing states' rights.

Unlike in most countries, elections in the U.S. are run by the states. But it gets more complicated — each state then allows smaller jurisdictions, such as counties, cities or townships, to run their own elections. Election officials estimate there are as many as 10,000 different election jurisdictions across the country. 

A frequent complaint of Trump and other election conspiracy theorists is that the U.S. doesn't run its election like France, which hand counts presidential ballots and usually has a national result on election night. But that's because France is only running that single election, and every jurisdiction has the same ballot with no other races.

A ballot in the U.S. might contain dozens of races, from president on down to city council and including state and local ballot measures.

The Constitution makes the states the entities that determine the “time, place and manner” of elections, but does allow Congress to “make” or “alter” rules for federal elections.

Congress can change the way states run congressional and presidential elections but has no say in the way a state runs its own elections. The president is not mentioned at all in the Constitution's list of entities with powers over elections.

“The president has very limited to zero authority over things related to the conduct of elections,” said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Parts of Trump's earlier executive order on elections were swiftly blocked by the courts, on the grounds that Congress, and not the president, sets federal election rules. 

It's unclear what Trump plans to do now, but the only path to change federal election rules is through Congress.

Although Republicans control Congress, it's unclear that even his party would want to eliminate voting machines nationwide, possibly delaying vote tallies in their own races by weeks or months. Even if they did, legislation would likely be unable to pass because Democrats could filibuster it in the U.S. Senate.

Mail voting had bipartisan support before Trump turned against it during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, but it's still widely used in Republican-leaning states, including several he won last November — Arizona, Florida and Utah. It's also how members of the military stationed overseas cast their ballots, and fully eliminating it would disenfranchise those GOP-leaning voters.

The main significance of Trump's Monday statement is that it signals his continuing obsession with trying to change how elections are run. 

“These kinds of claims could provide a kind of excuse for him to try to meddle,” Hasen said. “Very concerned about that.”

Gen. David Allvin, the Air Force's chief of staff, announced that he would be retiring two years short of his four-year term.

In a statement, the Air Force said its top commander would retire “on or about Nov. 1.” His retirement will be accompanied by a “formal retirement ceremony with full honors” sometime in the fall. A person familiar with the matter told the Washington Post that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth informed Allvin last week that he was being asked to retire, as the Trump administration wanted to take the Pentagon in a different direction. In return, Allvin would be allowed to announce the decision.

The person speaking with the outlet said, “It was certainly not his choice.”

Despite the pressure under which he left, Allvin thanked President Donald Trump and Hegseth in his retirement announcement.

“I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve as the 23rd Air Force chief of staff, and I'm thankful for Secretary Meink, Secretary Hegseth, and President Trump's faith in me to lead our service,” Allvin said in a statement. “More than anything, I'm proud to have been part of the team of Airmen who live out our core values of integrity, service, and excellence every day as we prepare to defend this great nation.”

Other Air Force figures celebrated his service in reaction.

“The Air Force is fortunate to have leaders like General Dave Allvin. During his tenure, the Air Force has undertaken transformational initiatives that will enable Airmen to answer their nation's call for decades to come,” Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink, a Trump appointee confirmed in May, said. “General Allvin has been instrumental in my onboarding as the department's 27th Secretary, and I'm forever grateful for his partnership as well as his decades of exemplary service to our nation.”

Another person familiar with the matter told the Washington Post that they were surprised that the forced retirement took as long as it did. Among the main areas of contention was dissatisfaction with his oversight over a possible security crisis involving China.

Two people familiar with the matter told the outlet that Gen. Thomas Bussiere, Trump's July nominee for vice chief of staff of the Air Force, is a likely replacement. In June, he headed the Air Force Global Strike Command and oversaw parts of Operation Midnight Hammer.

Allvin's effective dismissal is the latest of several high-profile shake-ups in the military. During his first administration, the military was a key target of Trump's ire, where he clashed with several of its heads. During his second administration, Trump has fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chief of naval operations, the commandant of the Coast Guard, and the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, along with other generals and admirals.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump hope that their critical meeting with European leaders at the White House could lead to three-party talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to his war on Ukraine.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday he's begun arrangements for a face-to-face meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a pathway to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while affirming that the U.S. would back European security guarantees aimed at preventing Moscow from reinvading its neighbor once the current conflict ends.

Details of the security guarantees and Trump's efforts to arrange peace talks were still evolving as an extended meeting among Trump, Zelenskyy and other European leaders wrapped up at the White House.

But as they emerged from their talks, the leaders expressed guarded optimism that Trump could be finding momentum in his quest to fulfill his campaign promise of ending the grinding war.

The “most important” outcome of the meeting was the “U.S. commitment to work with us on providing security guarantees,” French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters.

Trump said he would forge ahead with arrangements for a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin. He spoke by phone with Putin during Monday's talks with Zelenskyy and the leaders of Britain, Finland, France, Germany and Italy as well as the president of the European Commission and head of NATO.

The developments come amid a significant measure of trepidation on the continent that Trump is pressing Ukraine to make concessions that will only further embolden Putin after the U.S. leader hosted the Russian president for an Alaska summit last week.






“I called President Putin, and began the arrangements for a meeting, at a location to be determined, between President Putin and President Zelenskyy,” Trump said in a social media post. “After that meeting takes place, we will have a Trilat, which would be the two Presidents, plus myself. Again, this was a very good, early step for a War that has been going on for almost four years.” 

It was not clear if Putin has fully signed on to such talks.

Russia state news agency Tass cited Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov saying Putin and Trump “spoke in favor” of continuing direct talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations. Ushakov said they also discussed “the idea of raising the level of the direct Russian-Ukrainian negotiations.”

Zelenskyy told reporters following the White House meeting that if Russia does “not demonstrate a will to meet, then we will ask the United States to act accordingly.”

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in an appearance on Fox News that “if Russia is not playing ball” on direct talks with Ukraine, “the United States plus Europe will do more when it comes to tariffs and sanctions” on Moscow.

Zelenskyy previously had said he wanted Russia to agree to a ceasefire before any meeting between himself and Putin, but he said Monday that if the Ukrainians started setting conditions, the Russians would do the same.

“That's why I believe that we must meet without any conditions, and think about what development there can be of this path to the end of war,” Zelenskyy said.

Earlier, Trump said during talks with Zelenskyy and the European leaders that a potential ceasefire and who gets Ukrainian territory seized by Russia should be hashed out during a face-to-face meeting between the warring countries' two leaders.

“We're going to let the president go over and talk to the president and we'll see how that works out,” Trump said. 

That was a shift from comments Trump made soon after meeting Putin last week in which he appeared to tilt toward Putin's demands that Ukraine make concessions over land seized by Russia, which now controls roughly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory.



Trump stopped short of committing U.S. troops to a collective effort to bolster Ukraine's security. He said instead that there would be a “NATO-like” security presence and that all those details would be hashed out with EU leaders.

Zelenskyy said deep U.S. involvement in the emerging security guarantees is crucial.

“It is important that the United States make a clear signal, namely that they will be among the countries that will help to coordinate and also will participate in security guarantees for Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said.

Speaking Monday before the White House meetings took place, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova rejected the idea of a possible NATO peacekeeping force in Ukraine. She said such a scenario could lead to further escalation and “unpredictable consequences.”

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on an extraordinary show of diplomatic force at the White House today, with a visit by Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.

Trump's engagement with Zelenskyy had a strikingly different feel to their last Oval Office meeting in February. It was a disastrous moment that led to Trump abruptly ending talks with the Ukrainian delegation, and temporarily pausing some aid for Kyiv, after he and Vice President JD Vance complained that Zelenskyy had shown insufficient gratitude for U.S. military assistance.

At the start of Monday's meeting, Zelenskyy presented a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Trump's wife, Melania.






Zelenskyy faced criticism during his February meeting from a conservative journalist for appearing in the Oval Office in a long-sleeve T-shirt. This time he appeared in a dark jacket and buttoned shirt. Zelenskyy has said his typically less formal attire since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022 is to show solidarity with Ukrainian soldiers.

European leaders arrived in Washington looking to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. 

Ahead of Monday's meeting, Trump suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. 

Zelenskyy in his own post late Sunday, responded, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.”



European leaders suggested forging a temporary ceasefire is not off the table. Following his meeting with Putin on Friday, Trump dropped his demand for an immediate ceasefire and said he would look to secure a final peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine — a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin.

German and French leaders on Monday praised Trump for opening a path to peace, but they urged the U.S. president to push Russia for an immediate ceasefire.

“I would like to see a ceasefire from the next meeting, which should be a trilateral meeting,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Trump, for his part, reiterated that a broader, war-ending peace agreement between the two countries is “very attainable,” but “all of us would obviously prefer the immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace.”

The National Hurricane Center in Miami says Hurricane Erin is still expected to churn up dangerous waves and rip currents and could bring tropical force winds to North Carolina's Outer Banks.

Hurricane Erin was creating potentially deadly water conditions all along the East Coast days before the largest waves are expected, even as the strength of the storm weakened on Tuesday.

Erin lost some strength and dropped to a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

It was about 650 miles (1,050 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda and 690 miles (1,105 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Forecasters said Erin was moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph).

Although the weather center was confident Erin would not make direct landfall in the United States, authorities have warned that water conditions along the East Coast remain dangerous. Officials on a few islands along North Carolina's Outer Banks issued evacuation orders and warned that some roads could be swamped by waves of 15 feet (4.6 meters).

Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the southeast Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, the weather center said.

Here is what to know about Hurricane Erin:




Warnings about rip currents have been posted from Bermuda and Florida to the New England coast. The biggest threat is along the barrier islands of North Carolina's Outer Banks where evacuations have been ordered.

Nantucket was closest to Erin's anticipated path in New England and was likely to see the strongest winds, gusting about 25 to 35 mph (40 to 55 kph) at peak with waves potentially reaching a height of 10-13 feet (3-4 meters).

Some towns in New Jersey have closed beaches altogether, Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday.

In North Carolina on Monday, at least 60 people were rescued from rip currents in Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, officials said. 

Bermuda won't feel the full intensity of the storm until Thursday evening, and the island's services will remain open in the meantime, acting Minister of National Security Jache Adams said. But storm surge, which could reach up to 24 feet (7.3 meters) by Thursday, would make waters too dangerous to swim, surf or boat in, Adams said. 

Already this year, there have been at least 27 people killed from rip currents in U.S. waters, according to the National Weather Service. About 100 people drown from rip currents along U.S. beaches each year, according to the United States Lifesaving Association. And more than 80% of beach rescues annually involve rip currents.

Forecasters say Erin will turn northeast — and away — from the eastern U.S. Still, the storm is expected to bring tropical storm force winds, dangerous waves and rip currents to North Carolina's coast, said Dave Roberts of the National Hurricane Center. Coastal flooding in North Carolina is expected to begin Tuesday.

Evacuations were ordered on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island. The orders come at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that juts far into the Atlantic Ocean.

There are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway running along the barrier islands, the National Weather Service said. Some routes could be impassible for several days.

Storm surge is the level at which seawater rises above its normal level.

Much like the way a storm's sustained winds do not include the potential for even stronger gusts, storm surge doesn't include the wave height above the mean water level.

Surge is also the amount above what the normal tide is at a time, so a 15-foot storm surge at high tide can be far more devastating than the same surge at low tide.

A year ago, Hurricane Ernesto stayed hundreds of miles offshore from the U.S. Eastern Seaboard yet still produced high surf and swells that caused coastal damage.

Erin's strength has fluctuated significantly over the past week.

The most common way to measure a hurricane's strength is the Saffir-Simpson Scale that assigns a category from 1 to 5 based on a storm's sustained wind speed at its center, with 5 being the strongest.

Erin reached a dangerous Category 5 status late last week with 160 mph (260 kph) winds before weakening. It dropped to a Category 2 hurricane on Tuesday.

Although Erin is the first Atlantic hurricane of the year, there have been four tropical storms this hurricane season already. Tropical Storm Chantal made the first U.S. landfall of the season in early July, and its remnants caused flooding in North Carolina that killed an 83-year-old woman when her car was swept off a rural road.

And, at least 132 people were killed in floodwaters that overwhelmed Texas Hill Country on the Fourth of July.

Just over a week later, flash floods inundated New York City and parts of New Jersey, claiming two lives.

Databricks has just entered an exclusive club. 

The data analytics software vendor said Tuesday that it's raising a funding round that values the company at over $100 billion. That would make Databricks just the fourth private company to eclipse the $100 billion mark, following SpaceX, ByteDance and OpenAI, according to data from CB Insights.

Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi told CNBC's Brian Sullivan that the total round will exceed $1 billion. The company was last valued by private investors at $62 billion in a $10 billion financing round late last year. 

In June, Databricks executives told investors the company was forecasting $3.7 billion in annualized revenue by July, with 50% year-over-year growth. 

Snowflake, one of Databricks' top rivals, is expected to generate $4.5 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January, representing annual growth of 25%, according to LSEG. Snowflake currently has a market cap of about $65 billion. Other competitors include cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft, which are also Databricks partners.

Ghodsi said he heard from a lot of interested investors following Figma's IPO late last month. Shares of the design software company more than tripled in their New York Stock Exchange debut, a sign that public investors are seeking out tech offerings after in extended lull in the IPO market. 

"My phone was blowing up," Ghodsi said on Tuesday. "So yes, there's definitely been a big push from outside." 

Figma shares have since retreated from their initial $115.50 closing price. The stock is trading at about $70, still more than double the $33 IPO price.

Ghodsi said the round will help Databricks invest in products that clients can tap when using artificial intelligence models.

Founded in 2013 and based in San Francisco, Databricks ranked third on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list. As of June, the company employed 8,000 people. Existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Insight Partners Thrive Capital and WCM Investment Management are buying shares, a spokesperson said.

The Trump administration has quietly expanded its 50% steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 additional product categories, vastly increasing the reach and impact of this arm of its trade agenda.

The new tariffs, which took effect Monday, expand the scope of the levies that President Donald Trump previously announced on the valuable commodities. The tariff list now covers products such as fire extinguishers, machinery, construction materials and specialty chemicals that either contain, or are contained in, aluminum or steel.

"Auto parts, chemicals, plastics, furniture components—basically, if it's shiny, metallic, or remotely related to steel or aluminum, it's probably on the list," Brian Baldwin, vice president of customs at Kuehne + Nagel International AG wrote on LinkedIn of the expanded list.

"This isn't just another tariff—it's a strategic shift in how steel and aluminum derivatives are regulated," he wrote.

The levies extend to 407 new product categories, the Department of Commerce said Tuesday.

"Today's action expands the reach of the steel and aluminum tariffs and shuts down avenues for circumvention – supporting the continued revitalization of the American steel and aluminum industries," Jeffrey Kessler, the Commerce Department's under secretary for industry and security, said in a statement.

The release from the agency links out to a list that identifies the newly included product types only by the specific customs codes that apply to them, not by what the products are actually called.

For example, the Commerce Department identifies the product category of fire extinguishers only as "8424.10.0000," a 10-digit code buried among hundreds of other 10-digit codes.

This format makes it very difficult for the public to get a full picture of all the products that are affected by Monday's expanded tariffs.

But experts say the impact will be enormous.

"By my count, the steel and aluminum tariffs now affect at least $320 billion of imports based on 2024's general customs value of imports," Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, wrote on LinkedIn.

"This will add more inflationary cost-push pressures to already climbing prices that domestic producers are charging as picked up by July's PPI data," he continued.

Trump has repeatedly relied on sector-specific tariffs to enact his sweeping trade agenda.

In June, Trump announced that he was doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% for most countries, creating widespread uncertainty for businesses and U.S. trading partners reliant on the valuable commodities.

The White House said that the tariffs on additional products should "not come as a surprise."

"The President called for a new steel and aluminum product inclusions process in February," White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement.

"[The Bureau of Industry and Security] established the new product inclusions process in April, and companies submitted requests for product inclusions in mid-May," he said.

"Thus, it has been clear for many months that new products could be treated as steel and aluminum derivatives."

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Intel must give the U.S. government an equity stake in the company in return for CHIPS Act funds.

"We should get an equity stake for our money," Lutnick said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it."

Shares of the struggling chipmaker climbed 7% Tuesday, continuing to rally on recent reports that the Trump administration is weighing different ways to get involved with the company.

Bloomberg reported Monday that the White House was discussing a 10% stake in Intel, in a deal that could see the U.S. government become the chipmaker's largest shareholder.

Intel and SoftBank announced on Monday that the Japanese conglomerate will make a $2 billion investment in the chipmaker. The investment, equal to about 2% of Intel, makes SoftBank the fifth-biggest shareholder, according to FactSet.

Lutnick said any potential arrangement wouldn't provide the government with voting or governance rights in Intel.

"It's not governance, we're just converting what was a grant under Biden into equity for the Trump administration, for the American people," Lutnick said. "Non-voting."

Intel declined to comment.

Lutnick also suggested that President Donald Trump could seek out similar deals with other CHIPS recipients.

Intel said last fall that it had finalized a nearly $8 billion grant from the law to build its factories. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was awarded $6.6 billion under the legislation to boost chip fabrication at its Arizona facilities.

Trump has called for more reshoring of U.S. manufacturing to reduce the country's reliance on companies like Samsung and TSMC to manufacture chips.

Intel has been spending billions near Columbus, Ohio, to build a series of chip factories that the company previously called the "Silicon Heartland." Intel has said that the factory complex would be able to produce the most advanced chips, including AI chips.

But in July, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a memo to employees that there would be "no more blank checks," and that it was slowing down the construction of its Ohio factory complex, depending on market conditions. 

The first factory is now scheduled to start operations in 2030.

The Ohio factory was one of the most public projects funded by the CHIPS and Science Act, which became law in 2022. The law committed the U.S. government to fund chip development and research and was estimated to cost about $53 billion.

"The Biden administration literally was giving Intel for free, and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies just giving them money for free," Lutnick said. "Donald Trump turns that into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money. If we're going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.' "

Intel has struggled to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom in advanced semiconductors and has spent heavily to stand up a manufacturing business that's yet to secure a significant customer. Intel tapped Lip-Bu Tan to be its CEO in March after his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was ousted in December.

Tan met with Trump at the White House last week after the president called for his resignation, alleging he had ties to China.

Apple has reportedly boosted iPhone production in India as the country faces pressure from the White House over its Russian oil purchases.

"We have planned to up the tariffs on India," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Tuesday. "These are secondary tariffs for buying the sanctioned Russian oil."

Bessent accused India of "profiteering" by purchasing cheap Russian oil and reselling it during the Ukraine war, "which is unacceptable."

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump hiked tariffs on India to 50%. The president said in July that he would impose secondary tariffs "at about 100%" on Russia's trading partners if a peace deal isn't reached with Ukraine by September.

His comments came as Bloomberg reported that technology giant Apple has reportedly upped production at five of its factories in India as it readies for the launch of its new iPhone 17 models.

The expansion includes some new plants and factories belonging to the Tata Group and contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn Technology, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter. Apple is also looking to create a new iPhone 17e in India next year, according to the report.

In recent years, Apple has shifted more production to India as it looks to reduce its reliance on China, especially in the wake of recent trade tensions.

Data from Canalys in May estimated that iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. grew 76% in May as trade restrictions loomed.

At the same time, Apple has committed to investing over $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years to improve American manufacturing production.

That includes a $100 billion spending expansion this month, which included a $2.5 billion investment to expand iPhone glass maker Corning's production.

This commitment to building in the U.S. should put Apple in the clear on India-related tariffs.

Nvidia said Tuesday that it is evaluating several products following a report that the company is working on a new artificial intelligence chip for China that is more powerful than the currently available H20.

The new product, tentatively called the B30A, is expected to be based on Nvidia's Blackwell chip architecture, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the company's plans. Nvidia hopes to deliver sample units to Chinese clients for testing as soon as next month, according to Reuters.

"We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow," the company told CNBC in a statement. "Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use."

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and said he wouldn't be surprised if Huang wants to sell a new chip to China.

"I'm sure he's pitching the president all the time," Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "I've listened to him pitch the president, and the president listens to our great technology companies, and he'll decide how he wants to play it."

Earlier this month, Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their sales in China, in exchange for permission to resume selling chips in the region.

The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns. Nvidia built its China-specific H20 chip after the Biden administration implemented export controls on AI chips in 2023, while AMD developed the MI308 chip for the Chinese market.

President Donald Trump said last week that he originally requested a 20% cut of Nvidia's sales, but that Huang negotiated the number down to 15%.

Trump suggested at the time that he would be open to Nvidia selling a significantly scaled-down version of its advanced Blackwell chip in China.

"It's possible I'd make a deal" on a "somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell" processor, Trump said. "In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it."

Shares of Viking Therapeutics plunged Tuesday after the company released midstage trial data on its obesity pill that disappointed investors. 

The biotech company's stock price dropped to about $23.80 as of Tuesday morning, from $42.09 at Monday's close, a roughly 43% plunge. Viking's market cap now sits at about $2.69 billion, down from more than $4 billion on Monday.

The results could be a blow to Viking, which was once seen as a hot M&A target as pharmaceutical companies scramble to join the booming market for obesity and diabetes drugs. It could reinforce the dominance of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in the space, especially as they develop pills for weight loss that could enter the market years ahead of the tablet formulation of Viking's drug, VK2735. 

Jared Holz, Mizuho health care equity strategist, said in an email Tuesday that the data "probably shutters hope for [Viking] to be a bigtime player in the oral obesity market over the near to medium term."

The race to develop a more convenient obesity pill has been fraught, as companies such as Pfizer have had to scrap previous contenders and bring forward new ones. 

Viking's once-daily pill helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their weight at around three months. The company also said that weight loss didn't plateau, which means patients could lose even more in a longer-term study.

It's difficult to directly compare the pill's phase two trial data with the results of oral drugs further along in development, including treatments developed by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

Holz added that the results on Viking's pill "look inferior" to those of Eli Lilly's oral drug "on almost all metrics." The highest dose of Eli Lilly's daily pill helped patients lose 12.4% of their body weight, or 11.2% regardless of discontinuations, at 72 weeks in a phase three trial.

Holz pointed to the high rate of patients who discontinued Viking's drug for any reason over 13 weeks, which was around 28%. Meanwhile, around a quarter of people discontinued Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, for any reason over 72 weeks.

That's "a much longer trial and therefore [Lilly] looks far better head-to-head," Holz said. 

Viking said the most common reasons for patients to discontinue treatment were gastrointestinal side effects, the majority of which were mild to moderate in severity and observed earlier in treatment.  But around 58% of patients reported experiencing nausea and 26% experienced vomiting, compared with 48% and 10%, respectively, among those who took a placebo.

Those side effect rates over a shorter trial period appear to be worse than those seen in trials on Eli Lilly's pill and the oral version of Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy. 

Viking's treatment works by imitating two naturally produced gut hormones called GLP-1 and GIP.

GLP-1 helps reduce food intake and appetite. GIP, which also suppresses appetite, may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.

Eli Lilly's pill and the oral version of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy both target GLP-1, but the latter has dietary restrictions.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday accused India of profiteering from cheap Russian oil imports during the war in Ukraine, describing the practice as "arbitrage" and condemning it as unacceptable.

"They are just profiteering. They are reselling," Bessent told CNBC's "Squawk Box" in an interview. "This is what I would call the Indian arbitrage — buying cheap Russian oil, reselling it as product."

"They've made $16 billion in excess profits — some of the richest families in India," Bessent said.

India buys Russian oil at a discount due to sanctions, refines it into gasoline and diesel, and then sells the product back to regions that have sanctioned Moscow such as Europe, said Matt Smith, an oil market analyst at Kpler.

India's imports of Russian oil have surged since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Before the attack, India imported a minuscule amount of Russian crude.

India is now Russia's biggest customer importing 1.5 million barrels per day in July, according to data from Kpler. China is the second-largest buyer of Russian oil, importing about 1 million bpd last month.

President Donald Trump earlier this month ordered an additional 25% tariff on India's exports to the U.S. to punish New Delhi for buying Russian oil. The tariffs take effect next week.

Trump is threatening what he calls "secondary tariffs" on Russian oil buyers like India to pressure the Kremlin to reach a negotiated settlement with Ukraine. So far, however, the U.S. has spared China from secondary tariffs over its imports of Russian crude.

When asked about China's imports, Bessent suggested that Beijing's imports were less egregious in the eyes of the Trump administration because it was also a major buyer before Russia invaded Ukraine.

But India actually started purchasing Russian oil in a major way at the behest of the U.S., said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy and a former advisor to President George W. Bush.

The Biden administration had asked India to accept Russian crude as other countries imposed bans in order to prevent a major oil price spike after the invasion of Ukraine that would result in high gasoline prices in the U.S., McNally told CNBC.

"India played a key role in the price cap sanction mechanism designed by the U.S. and its European allies to ensure Russian oil still flowed while trying to crimp the revenue Moscow earned," McNally said.CNBC has reached out to the Indian Embassy in the U.S. for comment.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday he will begin interviewing candidates for Federal Reserve chair as soon as the White House whittles down what has suddenly become a crowded field.

In a CNBC "Squawk Box" interview, Bessent confirmed the race to replace current Chair Jerome Powell is between 11 candidates, an array that includes past and present central bank officials as well as economists, a White House advisor and a few Wall Street market experts.

"In terms of the interview process, we've announced 11 very strong candidates. I'm going to be meeting with them probably right after Labor Day, and to start bringing down the list to present to President Trump," he said. "It's an incredible group."

That list is believed to include current Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, White House economist Kevin Hassett and former Governor Kevin Warsh. Strategists Rick Rieder of BlackRock and David Zervos of Jefferies also are part of the group, as well as economist Marc Sumerlin, former Governor Larry Lindsey and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.

Though Powell's term does not end until May 2026, the White House is keen to get the process moving as it pushes an urgent need for interest rate cuts.

Bessent repeated the administration's desire for easing, saying it would help the moribund U.S. housing market. Sales and new building have been weak, with low inventory pushing prices higher.

"If we keep constraining home building, then what kind of inflation does that create one or two years out?" he said. "So a big cut here could facilitate a boom or a pickup in home building, which will keep prices down one two years down the road."

The Fed does not have a policy meeting again until Sept. 16-17, where it is widely expected to approve its first quarter percentage point reduction since December 2024. Bessent said he was not concerned about a producer price index reading for July that showed the largest monthly increase in three years, as he attributed much it to a rise in portfolio fees tied to higher stock market values.

Before then, Powell on Friday will give what is likely his final keynote address at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. That speech could focus on a review the central bank does every five years of its policy, but Powell also may choose to tip the Fed's hand on the September vote.

Jeff Wang got a big promotion last month. There were lots of tears, but not the happy kind.

The 39-year-old was unexpectedly named interim CEO of artificial intelligence coding startup Windsurf. The company had been in discussions with OpenAI about a potential acquisition that would have resulted in a handsome payday for many employees. But the talks fell apart and, on July 11, several founders and top researchers instead left to join Google as part of a $2.4 billion licensing deal.  

As one of the highest-ranking executives remaining at Windsurf, Wang was elevated to the top job, at least for the time being. His first order of business, he told CNBC, was to break the news at a tense all-hands meeting at the startup's Silicon Valley headquarters.

"It was a very, very challenging day," Wang said. "People were crying. It was very, very emotional. I was spending half the time calming down people, because they have families and they got nothing."

Windsurf is part of a growing crop of AI startups whose founders and top researchers have been poached by megacaps like Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon through high-priced talent grabs that are helping the biggest companies skirt regulatory scrutiny. While the deals often produce big payouts for founders and AI leaders, they can leave investors, other employees and the remaining company in limbo.

Samir Kumar, a general partner at Touring Capital, said that what's left is something resembling a zombie company.

"There's a big question of what their future prospects are," Kumar said. "Frankly, you hollowed out the organization." 

The headline-grabbing deal came in June, when Meta rocked the tech industry by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in data labeling startup Scale AI. As part of the agreement, Meta took a 49% stake in the company, hired its CEO Alexandr Wang to lead a new superintelligence lab and said it would deepen the work it does with Scale.

A month later, Scale cut 200 full-time employees, or 14% of its staff. Meta's investment had doubled Scale's valuation from $14 billion last year. But that number only exists on paper.

Microsoft used a similar playbook in March 2024, when it hired Inflection AI's co-founders and other staffers. Amazon has completed two such deals in the last year, nabbing the founders and top talent away from Adept in June 2024, and from Covariant two months later. Google inked a $2.7 billion licensing deal with Character.AI and hired its founders last August.

For Silicon Valley venture investors, long the lifeblood of risky tech startups, the system isn't functioning as intended. Companies that would otherwise be on the path to a potential initial public offering or lucrative acquisition are getting pulled apart, with the bulk of the cash ending up in the pockets of the founders and their leading engineers.

"The money doesn't flow as straightforwardly as it would in just a pure M&A transaction," said Rob Toews, partner at Radical Ventures. 

The Scale deal was the exception as far as venture returns go, as Meta's hefty cash investment resulted in big gains for early investors, most notably Accel.

Scale spokesperson Joe Osborne said the company is very much alive.

"Comparing Scale to these companies overlooks major differences in our revenue performance, company size, and deal structure," Osborne said in a statement. He said Scale has more than 1,000 employees and generated close to $1 billion in revenue last year.

"Meta's investment benefited our investors and employees, kept us independent, and positioned us for long-term success," Osborne said.

VCs say one way to try and keep founders and early employees from bailing is through secondary offerings, allowing them to sell a piece of their ownership to investors so they can buy a house, repay debt or just lock in some gains.

But secondary sales can't compete with the kinds of offers coming from deep-pocketed tech companies that are flinging open their wallets to win the AI battle. Tech investors and startup employees who spoke to CNBC said it's a trend that threatens to thwart innovation as founders abandon their ambitious projects to work for the biggest companies in the world.

"This is not business as usual," said Tom Chavez, co-founder of the startup studio Superset. "This is a disruption."

It's a moment that began after the launch in late 2022 of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which ushered in the generative AI boom. At the time, the tech giants were limited in their ability to expand through mergers and acquisitions.

The Federal Trade Commission, then led by Lina Khan, was seeking to block a number of notable tech acquisitions, including Microsoft's $69 billion agreement to buy Activision Blizzard (a deal that eventually closed) and Nvidia's $40 billion bid for Arm (a deal that collapsed). It even tried, unsuccessfully, to stop Meta from completing a much smaller deal — the $400 million purchase of virtual reality studio Within.

Meanwhile, regulators in Europe were able to block Amazon's planned $1.34 billion acquisition of iRobot last year, shortly after convincing Adobe to walk away from a $20 billion purchase of Figma. In 2022, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority pressured Meta into selling Giphy, which it had bought for $400 million.

The transition from the Biden administration and Khan's FTC to a second Trump presidency has led to some regulatory loosening, but antitrust concerns remain.

Tech companies, convinced of their need to bulk up in AI, have found a workaround.

"This is now a new playbook that companies are going to run," said Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures. "If it's not cracked down upon, I don't really blame them."

Murphy added that companies are getting more explicit in saying, "Let's just buy exactly what we want and leave the rest behind." He described the process as "a bit soulless."

Maintaining a minority stake means the acquirer could avoid triggering an FTC rule that would require a premerger review.

"They're coming as close as possible to just getting under a majority stake of a company," said J.B. Branch, an advocate for consumer rights at nonprofit Public Citizen. "They're doing just about everything they can do without sort of tripping any alarms."

Regulators aren't completely in the dark.

The FTC last year opened probes into Microsoft's Inflection deal and Amazon's hiring of Adept employees. An FTC spokesperson declined to comment on the status of ongoing investigations or potential probes.

At Windsurf, the sudden departure of co-founders Varun Mohan and Douglas Chen left employees reeling. Wang was among them.

Many staffers at the all-hands meeting had been expecting to hear an announcement about a deal with OpenAI, and some even started filming the session, Wang said. The companies had been in talks about a potential acquisition since the spring.

Those discussions fell apart after Windsurf began pushing for a deal that looked less like a conventional acquisition and more like Meta's investment in Scale, according to a person familiar with the talks. OpenAI wasn't interested, said the person, who asked not to be named because the talks were confidential.

OpenAI's exclusivity period for the potential acquisition expired on May 1, according to another person familiar with the discussions who also asked not to be named because the talks were confidential. Mounting antitrust concerns over Microsoft's role in the deal, and debates over whether the tech giant would have access to Windsurf's intellectual property, also stalled the talks, the person said.

Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI and has pumped billions of dollars into the startup.

Wang said he wasn't told why negotiations with OpenAI had ended.

The Google news broke on a Friday. Wang's life changed in a hurry. He said he spent roughly 12 straight hours on the phone with investors, potential buyers and panicked customers. Employees were also barraged with incoming calls from recruiters, he said.  

At around 5 p.m., Wang received emails and text messages from the team at Cognition, another AI coding startup that's best known for its software-building agent called Devin. After a 9 p.m. phone call stretched past midnight, Windsurf's future began to take shape. 

The following Monday, Cognition announced it was buying Windsurf's intellectual property, product, trademark, brand and talent.

Terms weren't disclosed, but according to TechCrunch, the price was $250 million, or less than 10% the amount that OpenAI was reportedly in talks to pay.

"There's definitely more motivation now to win than before," Wang said. "You just got abandoned, now it's time to prove to the world that you're still here."

Three weeks after Cognition's announced purchase, that company's CEO, Scott Wu, had more news to share. His startup was offering buyouts to Windsurf staffers who weren't sold on their new employer.

"Cognition has an extreme performance culture, and we're upfront about this in hiring so there are no surprises later," Wu wrote in a post on X.

Windsurf employees who chose to accept the buyout would receive an additional nine months of pay and health care, Wang said. Some underperforming employees were let go, but would receive the same benefits, he added. 

"You cannot just have employees that came to try to ride a rocket ship," Wang said. "You kind of need everybody to be all in."

For now, Windsurf will continue to exist separately within Cognition, but Wang said he doesn't know what his job will be in the future as the teams integrate more deeply.

"We're both CEOs of each entity," he said. "I'm actually not sure when the entities combine, what the role is going to be."

That sort of uncertainty isn't unique to Windsurf.

When Google inked its deal with Character.AI, the search giant's big win was its hiring of co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, who had worked at Google in the past.

At Character, Shazeer and De Freitas wanted to do two things at once: build a foundational AI lab and an AI consumer company. A former Character employee, who was at the company when the deal took place, said he thought the agreement could be beneficial to the startup, because it would allow the company to focus solely on the consumer business.  

But many Character employees were drawn to the company because of the founders. Within a month of their exit, up to 10% of the remaining workforce departed, said the former employee, who asked not to be named because the details were confidential.

Dominic Perella, Character's legal chief who served as the company's interim CEO after the Google deal, said his company is far from gutted. Besides Shazeer and De Freitas, only a couple dozen researchers left, or about 25% of the company, with 70 employees still remaining, Perella said.

Perella added that the entire product team is still on board, as the company focuses on shipping new features to users rather than training AI models. Consumers use the app to create virtual characters, including for companionship, paying monthly subscriptions along the way.

Character said it now has about 20 million monthly active users, and that, as of June, paid subscribers were up 250% from a year earlier.

"That's quite different from what you think of when you think of an acquihire," Perella said.

Perella also said the company set up an escrow account with some of the cash from Google, and will distribute those funds to employees through July of next year, giving them some liquidity from the deal. And, he said, investors and staffers still have the opportunity to profit.

"The company didn't leave investors or employees high and dry," he said.

In June, 10 months after the deal was announced, Character named former Meta executive Karandeep Anand as CEO. Anand had been serving as an advisor to the company since the prior summer.

Anand said he views his role as helping Character become the social consumer app of the AI era, comparing it to what Instagram did for mobile and YouTube for the web.

"A founder CEO versus someone who comes in, who takes care of the company – that's my job," Anand told CNBC in an interview. "To prove that I can do this better than anyone else."

A Google spokesperson said in a statement that the company doesn't agree with the characterization that Character or Windsurf are zombie companies.

Inflection employees learned about their company's deal with Microsoft at a last-minute all-hands meeting in March 2024. Inflection co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman sent a Slack message instructing staffers to gather at a hotel in Mountain View, California, early the next morning, according to a former employee. 

That's where Suleyman, who previously co-founded the AI research lab DeepMind, announced the transaction. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also made an appearance to answer employees' questions, said the person, who asked not to be named due to the private nature of the discussions. 

Most of Inflection's existing employees moved to Microsoft, the person said. But Inflection continued to operate as a stand-alone company, bringing on a new CEO and staff.

Microsoft reportedly paid Inflection around $650 million, according to reports from The Information and Reuters. That capital was used to help pay the startup's investors and license its technology in a nonexclusive capacity.

The prior year, Inflection was valued at $4 billion in a $1.3 billion investment that included capital from Microsoft and Inflection co-founder Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member.

Still, Hoffman said after the sale to Microsoft that the deal was positive for "everyone involved in Inflection AI." Hoffman is also a partner at venture capital firm Greylock, which was an early investor in Inflection. 

"This agreement with Microsoft means that all of Inflection's investors will have a good outcome today, and I anticipate good future upside," Hoffman wrote in a post on LinkedIn.

In March, Inflection named longtime tech executive Sean White as CEO. Since losing Suleyman and most of its staff to Microsoft, the company has hired 50 employees and is now focused on building enterprise AI products, according to its website, which says its first offering called Pi is an "empathetic and conversational chatbot."

Microsoft and Inflection declined to comment.

Covariant, founded in Berkeley, California, developed AI systems for warehouse robots. Launched in 2020, its backers included leading AI researcher Fei-Fei Li, Meta chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, and AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton.    

The startup had also signed up roughly a dozen customers eager to use its software, including a sportswear giant and one of the leading meal kit companies, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named in order to discuss private information.

On a Friday afternoon last August, everything changed. Some of Covariant's employees were asked to join an emergency town hall meeting where executives tearfully announced that three of the company's co-founders and roughly 25% of its approximately 120 workers were joining Amazon. As part of the agreement, Amazon bought a nonexclusive license for Covariant's core technology.

Everyone on the call was told they would not be moving to Amazon, according to three former employees, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the matter.

Those who were joining included co-founder Pieter Abbeel, who was tapped to help lead Amazon's recently created advanced AI lab in San Francisco. The other two co-founders, Peter Chen and Rocky Duan, would be put to work at Amazon building foundation models for the company's more than 1 million robots in its warehouses.

Remaining staffers were offered far less attractive options. They could either leave Covariant immediately or stay on for about a month and a half, at which point they'd be able to receive a severance payment, the former employees said. 

A "skeleton crew" of about 10% to 15% of Covariant's workforce is still there, one ex-employee said, calling it a ghost company. Covariant hasn't published any business updates to its site since the Amazon deal was announced last year.

While Covariant's founders walked away with substantial payouts, rank-and-file employees were left with far less than they expected to earn when they joined, the former employees added.

In a whistleblower complaint filed in January with the FTC, Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, a former Covariant employee claimed that the transaction was "deliberately and unlawfully structured" by Amazon to dodge antitrust scrutiny.

The company had reportedly been valued at $625 million in a 2023 funding round. Amazon spent more than $400 million to license Covariant's technology and bring on senior technical talent at the company, according to the whistleblower complaint, which was viewed by CNBC. That figure includes a final $20 million licensing payment, set to be paid out one year after the deal date, which requires "zombie Covariant staying on life support" until that point, the complaint said.

The transaction terms handicapped Covariant's ability to seek out future deals, according to the complaint, which was previously reported on by The Washington Post.

Ted Stinson, Covariant's current CEO and operating chief at the time, said the company had a "decent shot" at landing one or two licensing deals with its remaining technology, according to a transcript of a recorded conversation cited in the complaint.

"But they'll be single-digit millions, maybe double-digit millions," Stinson said. "I mean they'll be a fraction of what Amazon paid is my best guess."

Stinson didn't respond to a request for comment.

John Tye, an attorney for the former employee and a former State Department whistleblower, said the Covariant deal and other transactions like it deserve stronger government scrutiny.

"It's not just a technical, legal matter," Tye said in an interview. "It affects consumers who use these products. Monopolies are not typically good for the American public."

Similar to Covariant, San Francisco startup Adept has provided few updates on its work building agentic software since its co-founders and much of its research talent were hired away by Amazon. Less than a year after taking over as CEO of Adept, Zach Brock left for OpenAI, and several employees, including the former product head, have departed for competitors like Anthropic.

Covariant and Adept didn't respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

Amazon spokesperson Alexandra Miller said Covariant and Adept continue to serve customers independently. She said that because Amazon's licensing deal with Covariant isn't exclusive, "Covariant is free to license its technology to other companies."

Nexstar Media has agreed to buy smaller rival Tegna for $3.54 billion, creating a local-TV powerhouse that seeks to compete better with Big Tech and national media for advertising dollars.

Tuesday's deal will expand Nexstar's presence in nine of the top 10 U.S. markets, covering 80% of TV households in the country. That could provide the company, already the largest operator of regional U.S. TV stations, with greater leverage in talks with advertisers and pay-TV distributors.

Nexstar owns or has partnered with others for over 200 stations, while Tegna owns 64. Their deal is the latest in a fast-consolidating U.S. media industry, which is hoping for looser antitrust regulation under President Donald Trump.

Deal-making in the sector has also gathered steam as cable TV operators scramble to adapt to shifting consumer habits driven by cord-cutting and the rapid expansion of streaming.

"The initiatives being pursued by the Trump administration offer local broadcasters the opportunity to expand reach, level the playing field, and compete more effectively with the Big Tech and legacy Big Media companies," Nexstar CEO Perry Sook said.

Nexstar's offer price of $22 per share represents a premium of nearly 44% to Tegna's closing price on Aug. 8, before reports of a deal emerged. The deal is valued at $6.2 billion, including debt and other transaction expenses.

Shares of Tegna climbed more than 3% to $20.85 premarket, adding on to the near 21% gain the stock has seen this month on the expectations of a takeover.

The deal, which is expected to close by the second half of 2026, will boost Nexstar's reach by expanding its presence in key markets such as Atlanta, Phoenix and Seattle and would generate annual net savings of about $300 million.

If Tegna terminates the merger to accept a better offer, it must pay Nexstar $120 million, and if the deal falls through as a result of not securing regulatory approval, Nexstar will pay Tegna $125 million, a regulatory filing with the SEC showed.

Best Buy is launching a third-party marketplace, as it tries to bulk up the variety of merchandise it offers and reverse slower sales.

Starting on Tuesday, shoppers who go to Best Buy's website and app will see products and brands that weren't available there before, including more tech-related accessories like custom video game controllers and some nontech items including seasonal decor and sports collectibles.

The company's online marketplace riffs off those of other retailers, such as Amazon and Walmart, by relying on third-party sellers to stock, sell and ship inventory and taking a cut of their sales in the form of a commission.

"Everything we do is really centered around the customer and their technology needs, and we do see customers actually doing a lot of consumer electronics transactions through marketplaces," Chief Customer, Product and Fulfillment Officer Jason Bonfig said. "And as a result of that, we need to make adjustments to be where the customer's at."

He said Best Buy noticed gaps in its assortment that the new platform will help it fill. For instance, Bonfig said the company didn't carry batteries for some older cameras or cases for older smartphones. And it didn't offer some items that complement Best Buy purchases, such as furniture that goes around a big-screen TV or cookware to use with a new kitchen appliance.

Along with adding those items, the marketplace makes it possible for smaller vendors with innovative products to sell on Best Buy's website when they're not yet big enough to make or distribute the volume needed for its stores, he added.

Best Buy's marketplace launches at a time when its business could use a boost. Its annual sales have declined over the past three years as the company contends with a sluggish housing market, selective consumer spending and a decline in device replacements after a spike in tech purchases during the Covid pandemic.

The company cut its sales outlook in May and said it expects full-year revenue to range from $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion. That would be similar to Best Buy's annual revenue of $41.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year, but below the numbers it posted in the years leading up to and during the pandemic.

Best Buy will share its most recent earnings results and sales forecast on Aug. 28.

Tariffs have complicated the backdrop for Best Buy, too, since the higher duties have added costs for consumer electronics vendors and distracted them from other priorities like research and development that leads to new and innovative products, said Jonathan Matuszewski, a retail analyst at Jefferies. He said Best Buy tends to win sales instead of big-box or online competitors when there's a leap forward in technology.

With the platform's launch, Best Buy joins other retailers that have jumped on the trend of introducing or expanding third-party marketplaces. Lowe's and Nordstrom started marketplaces last year. Ulta Beauty plans to launch its own later this year. And Target said it will expand its existing marketplace, Target Plus.

On Best Buy's earnings call in May, CEO Corie Barry described the third-party marketplace as one of the company's strategic priorities for the year. She said that new profit stream "is even more important in this environment" and will provide greater flexibility with the range of items and price points.

Plus, she said the marketplace supports the company's growing advertising business. Sellers can buy ads for their products, including by paying for better placement in search results.

Marketplaces and the advertising opportunities that come with them tend drive higher profits for retailers, said Justin MacFarlane, a managing director for the global retail group of AlixPartners. Sellers buy, stock and ship products instead of the retailer, and take on both the expense of buying inventory and the risk that they may have to mark down unwanted items, he said.

Yet the business model comes with risks, too, he said. For instance, sellers may not have the same standards as a retailer and it could anger a retailer's customers if they send products in torn boxes, with missing pieces or days later than expected. And he said retailers can flood their websites with so many different categories, brands and products that they overwhelm customers with choices that seem irrelevant to their company's identity.

"You get addicted to the growth and more is more until it's not," he said.

At launch, Best Buy's marketplace will have about 500 sellers, Bonfig said. He said the company vetted applicants and whittled them down to the ones who can provide a high-quality customer experience. The sellers must match Best Buy's return policy, he added.

Customers can return purchases either directly to the seller or to Best Buy stores, he said.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nicholas Gilpin, a 38-year-old stay-at-home dad and entrepreneur from Fair Oaks, California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I never planned to be a stay-at-home dad.

When I was an information technology consultant at KPMG, there were some weeks when I worked almost 100 hours across all seven days.

Now, I spend those hours with my sons — a very different environment. Almost three years since becoming a full-time stay-at-home dad, I'm glad to invest this time I can't get back with my sons.

At KPMG, the burnout was relentless. I managed million-dollar technology implementations and worked nonstop. In late 2021, I joined Crossfuze, a consulting company, as a project manager and worked there for a little over a year.

In 2022, my wife and I were expecting our first child, and her pregnancy needed more attention from us both. She was also working full-time as a case manager at a health insurance company, but needed to take time off before the birth to keep up with doctor's visits.

Supporting my wife and keeping up with client demands became too much. We felt it made sense for me to take a break from working, so two weeks before my first son was born, I clocked out of the corporate world and clocked in as a full-time dad.

We'd spent years trying to have children, and the months of visits to the doctor's offices took an immense emotional and mental toll on both my wife and me. So, when our first son was born through IVF, and our second two years later naturally, it was a gift we didn't want to take for granted.

At Crossfuze, I was making $135,000 a year before my son was born. That loss of salary didn't play a large part in my transition to being a full-time dad, though. We'd always planned for one of us to stay home with the kids. Ultimately, we saw having a parent home as more valuable than maintaining two full-time incomes.

We didn't want to outsource parenting. We don't know what a day care or babysitter might be teaching our kids, and the time spent driving them to and from those programs may negate the benefit of sending them there in the first place.

I'm with my boys every hour of the day, and sometimes, we sleep in the same room throughout the night. My first son is almost 3 years old now, so he requires much more attention and play time, while my other son, almost 6 months old now, spends more time with his mom.

I take care of 70 to 80% of the daytime responsibilities, and my wife takes care of our family when she's not working. She's the most active with our boys in the evenings and weekends.

Thankfully, my wife and I worked hard early in our careers, and she can support us through her private mental health counseling practice. We also bought a duplex and rented out half of it to help cover our mortgage.

We've really had to get intentional about what matters most. Personally, I don't buy anything unless it's essential — supplements, a gym membership, and basic toiletries. We rarely go out to eat, and I cook nearly all of our meals at home. My mom has also helped provide essentials for our boys, and my wife's parents have contributed financially since our youngest was born.

We're making it work — but every dollar has a job.

A part of me wants to rebuild my career to support my family more financially. Society's expectation for fathers has always hinged on them being providers. While this era of parents is evolving away from stereotypical parenting roles, I still feel a sense of guilt for not providing as much while our sons grow up.

I have to remind myself that I'm doing enough for my family through the hours of spending time with them, potty training, going on walks around the neighborhood, playing in the backyard, and making them breakfast.

This has been my biggest challenge when trying to have it all as a dad.

I spent most of my adult life connecting with clients, working on projects, and advancing my career. I've invested heavily in my skills throughout my career and obtained my MBA.

When it's just my sons and me during the week, I lack the adult conversations I was used to. It can feel isolating, and like I'm regressing in my career or missing out on the latest tech advancements.

A month after my first son was born, ChatGPT was released to the public. Seeing the way AI has been implemented to outsource work, code, and handle menial tasks around the office makes me feel like I'm missing out on a major tech advancement in my field.

But staying home has also given me the space to build my own business and work on the book I'm writing, "Thriving Dad," during my sons' naps or after their bedtimes.

AI models have leveled the playing field for entrepreneurs like me as I try to rebuild my career a couple of hours at a time, since 100% of my day is invested in my boys.

I use ChatGPT as a personal assistant to help manage all the tasks and coding I want to get done during the day, and chip away at the business I want to sculpt.

Balancing my time between childcare, spending time with my wife, and rebuilding my career is a challenge.

I find spending time with my sons incredibly rewarding. I grew up without a father in my life, and I consider the time I spend with my sons to be unfulfilled time I didn't have with my father. In a way, I'm kind of winging it.

Time is invaluable when children are young, and I want to pour this experience into my sons while I stay home.

While it's difficult to pinpoint the most rewarding experience of being a dad, recently, my oldest said, "I love you, daddy," for the first time. That hit me hard.

Seeing these milestones for both of them and seeing parts of myself in them, I am immensely grateful to give them what I couldn't have and what I needed as a child. When I look at my boys, I see a lot of love every single day.

JPMorgan has always been big on tech — an initiative on full display at its new Manhattan headquarters.

America's biggest bank by assets has been promising that its new office tower at 270 Park Avenue will be loaded with "intelligent technology" since it announced the project in 2022. New details of the $3 billion project obtained by Business Insider reveal just how tech-forward the building will be.

The 14,000 employees who will be housed at the New York tower will be able to activate coffee machines using QR codes and swipe into the building using biometric palm scanners. Want to preorder food from the dining hall, host a guest, or find a specific conference room? There's an app for that, which JPMorgan is asking employees to download to "boost your work efficiency."

The details, gleaned from internal communications shared with Business Insider, offer a glimpse of what it's like to work at the bank behemoth, which earlier this year called back all of its more than 300,000 employees to the office five days a week. JPMorgan has also been spending billions on tech at the direction of CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been seeking to protect the bank from payment apps and other financial startups.

"We have to compete with the best in AI and technology," Jamie Dimon said at the bank's 2024 Investor Day.

With some employees' move-in set to start this year and continue into 2026, here's the lowdown on how the bank plans to use tech to keep workers happy and efficient as it calls them back to the office five days a week.

Even the way you enter the building will be leveled up using tech. One option to get past the turnstiles — besides your physical or mobile JPM badge — is "biometric authentication," which employees can already enroll in, according to employee communications shared on an internal bank portal.

The bank showed a photo of a scanner that reads your palm. It said the biometric authentication will allow employees to "breeze from the lobby" to other parts of the building "by waving your hand!"

It touted how easy it will be to get where you want to go.

"After passing through the turnstiles, you can take an elevator to The Exchange on 14. From there, you can go up to your floor or take the escalator down to 13 for a bite to eat," the bank said, adding, "If you're a trader, you can take an elevator directly to the trading floors from the lobby."

The bank has a mobile app they call "Work at JPMC" to help employees with the move and to sign up for things like bike storage. It also has maps of the office to help people figure out what is where, and stores a digital version of your work badge.

"You can pre-order from several offerings in The Exchange, as well as coffee bars throughout the building, using the Work at JPMC mobile app."

The communications, which come just weeks after a tragic shooting at another Park Avenue office tower, suggest the bank plans to lean on tech to bolster building security.

One example: primary bathrooms on each floor will have emergency locks that, when activated, alert building security, according to the portal.

Under its emergency information, the bank says "primary bathrooms on each floor are equipped with an emergency lock that, when used, will alert building security. Security will assess the situation and respond, as appropriate."

The internal portal reveals just how much coffee is part of the JPM work culture. In addition to having four cafes in the building and "work cafes" on every floor, break rooms will have coffee machines "powered by QR codes" — symbols that open up apps or webpages when viewed through one's phone camera.

Being in an office building all day can take its toll on the body and the mind. The communications reviewed by Business Insider show that JPMorgan will use tech to try and make the office experience more natural.

In addition to windows that will allow 30% more daylight than a typical office building, the bank said the tower will have "circadian lighting and design elements" that incorporate nature and "help reduce sensory overload."

If you wanted a signal that we've truly entered the AI era and left mobile behind, this is it: iPhones are no longer Foxconn's most important business.

For investors and industry watchers, this is a pivotal moment. The company best known as Apple's factory floor has become an AI-first manufacturer. If Foxconn was once the backbone of the smartphone era, it's now building the infrastructure of the AI age.

For the first time, Foxconn's Cloud & Networking Products division has overtaken Smart Consumer Electronics, which runs the iPhone assembly operation. In the second quarter of 2025, Cloud & Networking revenue jumped 47% year-over-year to NT$731.8 billion, eclipsing the NT$634.5 billion generated from Smart Consumer Electronics, according to Barclays research.

More than half of that cloud revenue now comes from AI servers, which grew more than 60% in the second quarter alone. The company expects AI server revenue to soar 170% year-over-year in the third quarter, fueled by growing demand from hyperscale cloud providers.

"The company has grown from its legacy business of building smartphones or assembling computers for the likes of Apple to being a critical player in not only AI servers but also in emerging new product categories such as EVs and humanoid robots," Barclays analysts Jiong Shao, Lian Xiu Duan, and Xinyao Song, wrote in a note to investors on Monday.

This surge marks a tectonic shift: Apple, long Foxconn's most important customer, is no longer its primary growth driver. Instead, Foxconn is rapidly positioning itself as an AI infrastructure heavyweight. The firm has increased its market share in AI servers, including specialized ASIC variants, and is working closely with partners such as Nvidia on next-gen server architectures and humanoid robotics integration.

Geographically, Foxconn is hedging against geopolitical and tariff risks by expanding AI server production in the US, including in Texas, Wisconsin, and planned operations in California and Ohio. Mexico remains a primary base, but the growing US footprint reflects strategic repositioning for North American customers, including the big cloud providers.

Beyond AI servers, Foxconn is diversifying into electric vehicles, semiconductors, and healthcare robotics. Yet it's the server business that has seized the spotlight, now representing 41% of total revenue and expected to grow over 70% for the full fiscal year, according to Barclays research.

Meanwhile, Foxconn expects no growth in its iPhone-heavy consumer electronics business.

On the face of it, talks on Monday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders went well.

The U.S. and Ukrainian leaders were pictured looking jovial and smiling together — a far cry from the extraordinary shouting match and public humiliation inflicted on Zelenskyy during his last trip to the White House in February.

Monday's talks, which involved a raft of European leaders, appeared to make progress toward ending the protracted war between Russia and Ukraine, with Trump saying a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy would be arranged, followed by a trilateral meeting that he would join.

The most significant development result for Kyiv and Europe, however, was Trump's statement that security guarantees for Ukraine would be "provided" by European countries in "coordination with the U.S."

Describing that as a "major step forward," Zelenskyy said later that the package of security guarantees for Ukraine — highly coveted by Kyiv's leadership and seen as a deterrent to future Russian aggression — will include a massive purchase of American weapons, with financing reportedly supported by Europe. The agreement would be "formalized on paper within the next week to 10 days," he said.

As for what the security guarantees could include, the detail is still scant. Trump commented at a post-talks press conference that Europe would "take a lot of the burden" for these, but said the U.S. would help and would make it "very secure."

In any case, security guarantees likely mean that Europe, and the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" of countries offering to oversee a peace deal, is on the hook to fulfill what they've previously promised.        

French President Emmanuel Macron hinted Tuesday that the "first security guarantee we are working on — and it is the most important — is a strong Ukrainian army, composed of several hundred thousand men, well equipped, with defense systems and higher standards."

"The second is to have reassurance forces, the British, the French, the Germans, the Turks, and others ready to carry out these operations — not on the front line, not in a provocative way, but reassurance operations in the air, at sea, and on land. The goal is to send a strategic signal: peace in Ukraine is also our concern," he told French broadcaster TF1-LCI, in comments translated by NBC News.

Jaroslava Barbieri, research fellow at Chatham House, told CNBC Tuesday that the overall mood from the talks on Monday was one of "cautious optimism," but there are many unknowns.

"However, we have to say that the Kremlin's maximalist demands on Ukraine have not changed and so there's still a number of uncertainties about the security guarantees, the details, who is going to be doing what, if there are any troop deployments then where will they be stationed and for how long, which countries will be contributing?" she asked.

European leaders have voiced misgivings over the lack of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine before a peace deal is negotiated, but they seem willing to acquiesce, for now, with the end goal of peace and Ukraine and Europe's security in mind.

Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania's former foreign minister, told CNBC Tuesday that Europe still appeared to be struggling to be heard, saying the bloc had not yet found its strength and "ability to create leverage."

"What came out of the meeting yesterday was that Europe was asking the U.S. yesterday to continue its assistance, to ask for a ceasefire, to assist any stationing of troops, and then some of the leaders were even saying, 'Well, some of the Ukrainian territories might be lost, but that's a reality.' Well, that doesn't sound like Europe finding it's strength," he said.

"It's more like Europe agreeing that, 'we are in a very weak position and we have to please President Trump as much as we can and we have nothing to put on the table'," he noted. 

What's more, it's unclear whether the Kremlin will even agree to direct talks with Zelenskyy. Putin's presidential aide Yuri Ushakov stated Monday that Trump and Putin had discussed "that it would be necessary to study the possibility of raising the level of representatives of the Ukrainian and Russian sides," but that no firm decision was made.

The proposed future summits between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy would keep a process towards a possible resolution of the conflict alive, but it would still follow the Russian script of a no-ceasefire scenario, Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, cautioned.

"Putin may already set difficult conditions for a meeting with Zelenskyy. And in a meeting with Zelenskyy, Putin's major goal may be to pin the blame for any failure on Zelenskyy instead of agreeing to a truce or a final deal. The outcome remains very uncertain," he noted.

The Trump administration is discussing taking a 10% stake in Intel, according to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday, in a deal that could see the U.S. government become the chipmaker's largest stakeholder.

As part of a potential deal, the government is also considering converting some or all of Intel's grants from the 2022 U.S. CHIPS and Science Act into equity in the company, the report said, citing a White House official and other people familiar with the matter.

At the embattled chipmaker's current market value, a 10% stake would be worth roughly $10.4 billion. Meanwhile, Intel has been awarded about $10.9 billion in CHIPS Act grants, including $7.9 billion to support its domestic investment plans and $3 billion to further its semiconductor manufacturing for national security.

The report noted, however, that it remains unclear if the idea has gained traction broadly within the administration or whether officials have broached the possibility with affected companies.

It added that the exact size of the stake remains in flux, and it remains unclear whether the White House will actually proceed with the plan. Intel and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's queries regarding the report. 

Intel, once a dominant force in the U.S. chip industry, has fallen behind global competitors in advanced chip manufacturing. Reviving the former U.S. chip champion has become a national priority in Washington, with reports about a potential government stake in the company first circulating last week.

The company has been the largest recipient of the 2022 CHIPS Act, passed with bipartisan support under the Biden administration, as part of efforts by Washington to revitalize U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.

The bill allocated $39 billion in grants for American semiconductor projects, with funding committed to many of the world's chipmakers such as TSMC and Samsung, as well as American chip companies such as Nvidia, Micron and GlobalFoundries. 

U.S. President Donald Trump, though supporting the general goals of the CHIPS Act, has been a vocal critic of the bill and even called for its repeal earlier this year. While republican lawmakers in Washington have been reluctant to act on that call, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in June that the administration was renegotiating some of the bill's grants. 

If Intel's CHIPS Act funds were to be converted into a potential government stake in the company, it could decrease the total amount of capital infused into the company as part of any deal by Washington. 

However, it would serve as the latest example of the Trump administration's interest in building government-backed national champions in strategic industries.

Intel has struggled to gain an advantage in the artificial intelligence boom and has yet to capture a significant customer for its manufacturing business despite spending heavily on it. 

Some analysts have argued that government intervention is essential for the struggling chipmaker and for the sake of U.S. national security. Others contend that Intel's problems are deeper than funding, and that it's unclear if the government can steer it in the right direction. 

Analysts have also noted that Trump may be able to use the threat of tariffs and regulation to sway companies to buy Intel chips or provide indirect assistance.

On Tuesday, SoftBank announced a $2 billion investment in Intel, which, according to LSEG, would make it the fifth-largest shareholder. Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group, said: "This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role."

Intel investors had initially welcomed news of a potential government investment, which resulted in a share rally of nearly 9% on Aug. 14. Shares of Intel fell over 3% on Monday on the Bloomberg report, but rebounded by more than 5% in overnight trading on the trading platform Robinhood following news of the Softbank investment.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who was appointed in March 2025, met with Trump at the White House last week, after the U.S. president had called for his ousting due to his past ties to China. 

After the meeting, Trump had changed his tune on the Intel chief, saying he had "an amazing story." It's unclear if a potential government stake in the company had been discussed at the time.

European soccer is a bigger business than ever, with clubs in the continent's five top leagues raking in 20.4 billion euros ($23.7 billion) in revenue in the 2023-2024 season — and American investors have been eyeing a piece of that pie.

U.S. investors now own, fully or in part, the majority of soccer teams in England's Premier League. That now includes four of the traditional Big Six clubs, with Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal all attracting U.S. investment.

Rapid growth in revenues has been the key attraction.

In the 1996-97 season, when the Premier League was established in England, revenues across the five biggest European leagues totaled 2.5 billion euros, according to Deloitte analysis.

In 2023-24, that figure ballooned by 750%.

That growth has led to sharp increases in valuations for Europe's biggest soccer teams. The Glazer family, which also owns the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bought Manchester United for £790 million ($1.07 billion) in 2005. In 2024, a minority stake sale to billionaire Jim Ratcliffe pegged the club at around £5 billion, or the biggest valuation in world soccer.

Kieran Maguire, associate professor in football finance at the University of Liverpool, told CNBC on Wednesday that the rising levels of U.S. ownership in European soccer have been driven by higher wealth aggregation Stateside.

"It's actually a bit of a no brainer … what else you can do with your cash? You can only have so many helicopters, you can only have so many super yachts."

According to Maguire, the small number of top professional sports teams available to purchase has also contributed to rising demand, with investors unable to meet the multi-billion dollar price tags attached to NFL or NBA teams in the U.S. looking to European soccer as an alternative.

More than 36 of clubs in Europe's five biggest leagues now have private equity, venture capital or private debt participation through majority or minority stakes, including a majority of clubs in the Premier League, according to PitchBook research.

The data shows a sharp increase in M&A deal activity in European soccer clubs, from just 66.7 million euros in 2018 to almost 2.2 billion euros in 2024.

Many private equity investors in soccer have looked to the multi-club ownership model to boost their investments. Speaking to CNBC, PitchBook Senior EMEA Private Capital Analyst Nicolas Moura said many U.S. investors want to "build a variety of different football clubs," and that the model can have marketing and financial benefits.

But the increasing prevalence of multi-club ownership has risked the ire of regulators, with Moura saying that European soccer body UEFA is "starting to crack down on clubs."

This summer, England's Crystal Palace was barred from participating in UEFA's Europa League competition due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules. American businessman John Textor owns a stake in the English club as well as in France's Lyon, which also qualified for the competition.

Moura says the decision — which Crystal Palace labelled as an "injustice" — could become more of an issue as more clubs involved in multi-club structures move into Europe's top divisions.

The growth of soccer revenues has slowed in recent years, with Deloitte saying it sees income "plateauing" in the 2025-26 season on the back of slowing growth in the value of sports media rights.

That has left commercial revenue — up 6% in the 2023-24 season, per Deloitte — as a main driver, as clubs clinched new sponsorship deals and looked to utilize stadiums for non-soccer events.

Moura says lots of U.S. private equity investors are "looking to do their stands, their entire stadiums" in a bid to diversify away from broadcast income.

The search for growth in commercial and match day revenues could see more clubs holding regular matches overseas. Spain's La Liga will take its first regular season game abroad this season, as current champions Barcelona prepare to play Villareal in Miami. Italy's Serie A is also considering an international game, with the country's governing body approving plans for a match in Australia. Until now, games in domestic leagues have not been allowed to be played outside of their home country, with global governing body FIFA considering a formal change to its rules on overseas matches.   

Maguire says Premier League clubs will eventually look to hold games overseas to compete with rival European leagues, and that the money generated will mean games "will be sold to the fan base … effectively as a fait accompli."

The Premier League has not publicly entertained the idea of taking regular season games out of England, with CEO Richard Masters telling CNBC the league is "very different" from American peers when it comes to international games.

 Bitcoin and altcoins continue to sell-off, but Solana's fundamentals and accelerating institutional traction hint at a price recovery to $200. 

Key takeaways:

Solana's DeFi dominance and growing fees sustain network demand, boosting investors' long-term confidence.

Institutional investors' interest in SOL futures, ETP exposure and staking yield add to SOL's resilience.

Solana's native token SOL (SOL) dropped 15.5% since reaching $209.80 on Thursday, its highest price in more than six months. The pullback raised concerns that a double top formation might signal a bearish reversal. Yet, four key indicators suggest the opposit, and Solana may soon retest the $200 level, contradicting short-term trader pessimism.

Solana has consolidated its role as the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem, recording $111.5 billion in 30-day volumes. While Ethereum remains dominant, Solana outpaced the combined Ethereum layer-2 networks, which generated $93.1 billion. BNB Chain trailed with $60 billion, according to DefiLlama.

The total value locked (TVL) on Solana reached $12.1 billion this week, up 20% in two months, further securing its vice-leadership position over BNB Chain at $7.8 billion. Several decentralized applications (DApps) such as Kamino, Jito, Jupiter, Sanctum, Raydium, and Marinade each surpassed $2 billion in TVL. Sustained activity reinforces SOL demand, as transaction fees are essential to maintaining native staking yields.

Network fees highlight this dynamic. Solana generated $35.6 million over 30 days, a 22% increase from the prior month. Ethereum led with $41.4 million but declined 7% in the same period. Solana's advantage comes from its low fees and frictionless user experience, eliminating reliance on bridges and complex layer-2 solutions.

Solana ranking third in network fees is notable, considering Ethereum maintains a far larger smart contract deposit base. Solana's success is not easily replicable, since validators demand higher hardware capacity and capital commitment, making the network more robust than competitors.

Open interest on SOL futures climbed to $10.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion two months ago. This now exceeds XRP futures, despite XRP having an 81% larger market capitalization. The growth signals rising institutional participation, a positive factor for long-term adoption.

Further evidence of institutional demand comes from $2.8 billion in Solana exchange-traded futures and products (ETF / ETP). The 7.3% native staking yield could drive strong demand once Solana spot ETFs launch in the United States. Bloomberg analysts project a 90% or greater likelihood of US Securities and Exchange Commission approval by year-end.

The retracement from $209.80 sparked fears of a bearish double top. However, Solana's leadership in DEX volumes, TVL expansion, accelerating fee growth, and mounting institutional exposure collectively argue otherwise. Rather than confirming a bearish shift, these drivers support a renewed push toward $200, validating the hypothesis that traders may have turned bearish too soon.

Wyoming's launch of the Frontier Stable Token (FRNT) is being hailed as a milestone for crypto, but some experts warn it raises new concerns about privacy and centralization.

FRNT, a stablecoin backed by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills and built on Avalanche, launched on mainnet Tuesday, Aug. 19, at the SALT Wyoming Blockchain Symposium. The token can now be spent anywhere Visa is accepted, making it the first U.S. state-backed stablecoin available to consumers.

FRNT initially supports seven blockchains – Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and Solana.

While the launch marks a big step for crypto adoption, it has raised concerns about a domino effect that could result in a wave of government-issued digital dollars. 

This concern has already reached Congress, where lawmakers are considering restrictions on federal digital currency plans through the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Passed by the House in July, the bill would ban the federal government from creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and using it for monetary policy. 

“The scary part is whether D.C. and the Fed take this as a green light to roll out their own fully controlled coin,” Kadan Stadelmann, CTO at Komodo, told The Defiant. “A federal CBDC would be surveillance on steroids. That's the nightmare scenario, a coin you can't spend without permission.”

He added that while FRNT demonstrates progress in mainstream adoption, it risks blurring the line between decentralized crypto and government-issued “digital cash,” noting that if this happens, “we didn't win – they did.”

Stablecoins have already grown into a $276 billion market, up from approximately $5 billion in 2020, per DefiLlama. Tether's USDT leads by circulation, followed by Circle's USDC.

Meanwhile, investment firm Keyrock projects that the stablecoin sector could capture up to $1 trillion in annual payment volume by 2030. 

“This cuts both ways. On the one hand, it's great for visibility and it gives crypto some much-needed regulatory legitimacy,” Stadelmann said. “On the other hand, a government stablecoin is the polar opposite of decentralization. It's literally the state putting its stamp on-chain. Good for adoption, bad for the core Web3 values a lot of us fight for.”

He also noted that while FRNT pushes another crypto use case to millions of people, it's not entirely new: “We've been swiping crypto cards for years. This is only different because it's the government's crypto card,” Stadelmann said. 

Not all experts see downsides. Mike Cahill, Initial Contributor at Pyth Network, told The Defiant the move accelerates mainstream adoption in a way private issuers alone could not. 

“This is significant because it's the first time where a state isn't just pushing to regulate crypto; it's issuing it,” Cahill said. “A government-backed stablecoin bridges the gap between decentralized finance and the existing financial system. It's a major validation point for the fact that stablecoins are set to be the foundation for the future of our financial infrastructure.”

Experts say stablecoins are becoming increasingly appealing to both individuals and institutions due to their yield-bearing potential, often offering better returns than traditional banks. For context, around 21% of U.S. business bank deposits (approximately $3.85 trillion) don't earn any interest, as The Defiant previously reported. 

Jack O'Holleran, the co-founder and CEO of SKALE Labs, emphasized that Wyoming's launch will be a very bullish signal for stablecoins.

“Wyoming just created the first real competition for Circle and Tether, who never thought they'd have to compete with government entities for business,” O'Holleran said. “More quality stablecoins with actual rigor in how they're backed and how their reserves are put together will drive mass adoption. Competition forces better products.”

He explained that if larger states like California or New York get the same idea, that could result in intense competition. “Government backing hits differently than corporate backing. People understand what that means,” O'Holleran said. “Wyoming might be small, but this is going to force other states to ask if they should be doing this too.”

The launch of FRNT comes just one month after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act, which was subsequently signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump. The bill sets out rules for the issuance and governance of stablecoins.

In the summer of 2022, NFT (non-fungible token) platform OpenSea saw a former employee charged with pursuing a digital asset insider trading ploy. The former Product Manager was arrested and charged with wire fraud and money laundering.

As outlined by the US Department of Justice, the defendant utilized insider information to benefit financially. Effectively, the individual in question knew which NFTs were to be featured in advance and thus purchased them before the promotion. The individual apparently purchased these NFTs and then sold them later for 2 to 5 times the initial value.

At the time, US Attorney Damian Williams commented on the allegations, explaining that while NFTs may be new, the type of crime was not.

An OpenSea spokesperson shared a comment with CI explaining that when they learned of the apparent transgression, they initiated an investigation and then asked the individual to leave the company. The activities in question were said to be “in violation of [their] employee policies and in direct conflict with [their] core values and principles.”

In May 2023, the individual was convicted by a jury and sentenced to three months in prison, which was subsequently satisfied by the time already served. In recent days, the case against the defendant was heard by an appellate court, and the individual was found innocent of all charges.

On July 31, 2025, the US Court of Appeals vacated the conviction, finding the information the individual misappropriated from OpenSea could not sustain the wire fraud charge because it had no economic value to the company.  To a non-legal observer, this appears odd.

Did the individual use inside information illicitly? Did they benefit financially from this information?  It seems obvious to most, but the court saw otherwise.

CI connected with Philip Moustakis, Partner at the global law firm of Seward & Kissel. Before joining the firm, Moustakis was an attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Enforcement Division and a founding member of the SEC's Cyber Unit. We asked Moustakis about the case and his opinion on the court's decision.

Philip Moustakis: No. It appears to be a case where there was no crime. Here, the Second Circuit found the jury could have convicted Chastain for unethical behavior, rather than conduct that meets all the elements of the wire fraud statute.

Philip Moustakis: In short, the Court found that advance knowledge of which NFTs would be featured on the site did not have commercial value to OpenSea and thus did not qualify as traditional property under the wire fraud statute. The Court did not find that NFTs themselves are not traditional property, and one could imagine facts and circumstances, for example, a case involving theft of NFTs that would satisfy the statute.

Philip Moustakis: In my view, the vast majority of NFTs are art or collectibles, not securities.

A few NFTs may theoretically check all the boxes of the Howey test for an investment contract, but proving any of the NFTs involved here were securities would have added to the prosecution's burden.

Philip Moustakis: No. The conduct alleged was unseemly, at least, and posed reputational and other risks to the company.

Philip Moustakis: In my view, the technology is somewhat beside the point—one can imagine similar conduct in a business that sells physical art or collectibles—but the case stands for the proposition that not all unethical or distasteful business conduct is a crime.

SkyBridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci's investment management firm, plans to tokenize $300 million worth of its hedge funds on the Avalanche AVAX$22.68 network.

The firm is bringing its Digital Macro Master Fund and Legion Strategies on-chain in partnership with tokenization provider Tokeny and its parent, Apex Group, which manages more than $3.5 trillion in assets, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday. Apex acquired Tokeny earlier this year.

The initiative uses the ERC-3643 token standard with operational support from Apex's Digital 3.0 platform, which handles issuance, administration, and distribution.

SkyBridge's decision underlines the growing appeal of using blockchain rails to transfer and record ownership of traditional financial instruments like bonds, funds and stocks, a process often dubbed tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Global banks and asset managers are exploring this technology to cut settlement times, increase transparency and keep markets open around the clock.

Securitization firm VERT Capital announced to tokenize $1 billion of debt and receivables on XDC network and debuted a tokenized credit platform on XRP Ledger, while tokenization specialist Securitize also offers tokens of various funds by Hamilton Lane, Apollo and KKR.

The tokenized RWA market has doubled over the past year, surpassing $26 billion, per RWA.xyz data,  and is projected to grow into a trillion-dollar market by 2030, according to reports by McKinsey, Ripple, BCG and others.

"We look forward to bringing our hedge funds into the digital, on-chain era, improving transparency, liquidity, and accessibility for our investors, and demonstrating how traditional finance and blockchain can work together to create smarter, more efficient investment solutions," SkyBridge Capital founder and CEO Anthony Scaramucci said in a statement.

Avalanche increasingly aims to position itself as a hub for tokenized assets. Bergen County in New Jersey uses the network to digitize property deeds of $240 billion in real estate, combating fraud and cutting processing time.

 (Nasdaq: SBET), one of the world's largest corporate holders of Ether (ETH), has reported the expansion of its Ethereum reserves for the week ending August 17.

The company at an average price of $4,648, lifting its total ETH balance to 740,760. Since launching its treasury strategy on June 2, SharpLink has rapidly built one of the largest corporate Ethereum treasuries worldwide.

NEW: SharpLink acquired 143,593 ETH at ~$4,648, bringing total holdings to 740,760 ETHKey highlights for the week ending Aug 17, 2025:→ Raised $537M through ATM and direct offerings→ Added 143,593 ETH at ~$4,648 avg. price→ Staking rewards: 1,388 ETH since June 2 launch… — SharpLink (SBET) (@SharpLinkGaming) 

The company has earned 1,388 ETH in staking rewards since the strategy began, showing its commitment to maximizing yield from its holdings.

“SharpLink is aligning itself with Ethereum's future as a global financial infrastructure, while giving investors direct exposure to its growth,” the company said.Capital Raise Fuels Aggressive Expansion

SharpLink's weekly activity was backed by robust fundraising. The company secured $146.5 million through its at-the-market (ATM) facility and closed a $390 million registered direct offering on August 11.

In total, nearly $537 million in net proceeds were raised over the week of August 10–15, reinforcing its liquidity position.

The company notes that over $84 million in cash remains on hand, yet to be deployed for additional ETH acquisitions. This liquidity buffer ensures flexibility for further purchases should market conditions create attractive entry points.ETH Concentration Metric Shows Treasury Growth

To increase transparency, SharpLink introduced a new performance measure known as ETH Concentration, which tracks the number of ETH held per 1,000 assumed diluted shares outstanding. 

For the week ending August 17, this figure rose to 3.87, up nearly 94% since the start of its treasury program in June.

The company explained that ETH Concentration provides investors with a clearer view of yield performance and shareholder exposure to Ethereum. 

Unlike traditional treasury stock calculations, this metric excludes factors such as equity award vesting and debt convertibility, offering a more direct link between ETH holdings and investor value.Strategic Bet on Ethereum's Future

By making ETH its primary treasury reserve asset, SharpLink joins a growing movement of companies looking beyond Bitcoin and positioning for Ethereum's role in decentralized finance, smart contracts, and next-generation financial infrastructure.

“SharpLink is charting a new course—building scalable, secure, and transparent solutions that challenge outdated models,” the company states. With deep ties in sports media, gaming, and technology, SharpLink continues to leverage its Ethereum strategy as both a financial and technological shift.

As ETH integration deepens across industries, SharpLink's aggressive accumulation indicates a bold conviction: Ethereum will not just power decentralized finance but reshape the backbone of digital capital markets.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Bitcoin fell to $113,770, triggering a 10% altcoin market decline as key $112,500 support looms as critical technical threshold.

- Macroeconomic uncertainty from Fed policy and inflation concerns, plus SEC delays on crypto ETF approvals, deepened bearish sentiment across risk assets.

- Ethereum's $3,900 support retest and altcoins like Solana ($189) highlight market fragility, while token unlocks in KAITO/MURA/MOCA add supply-side pressures.

- Analysts remain divided: some see potential recovery above $117,000, while others warn of deeper pullbacks if Bitcoin fails to stabilize key levels.

Bitcoin's recent price action has drawn attention as the cryptocurrency fell to a daily low of $113,770, with market sentiment turning increasingly bearish. The broader cryptocurrency market has mirrored this downturn, experiencing a 10% decline in altcoin values as Bitcoin struggled to hold key technical levels [1]. Analysts are closely monitoring the $112,500 support zone, which is seen as critical in determining the direction of the next few trading sessions. A break below this level could signal further downward pressure, particularly on altcoins like Solana, which have already shown signs of weakness [1].

The broader macroeconomic environment continues to weigh on the market. The upcoming Jackson Hole symposium and Federal Reserve policy announcements are expected to play a pivotal role in shaping investor sentiment. Inflationary concerns and ongoing tariff discussions have already contributed to a negative trend in risk assets, with the crypto market being no exception [1]. Altcoins, which tend to be more sensitive to macroeconomic shifts than Bitcoin, have been especially hard hit.

Regulatory uncertainty is another factor clouding the outlook. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed decisions on ETF applications for cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP, adding to the sense of uncertainty among traders. This lack of regulatory clarity has kept many investors on the sidelines. For example, Solana closed below $189, showing signs of vulnerability after reaching $160 earlier in the year [1].

Despite the bearish tone, some analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Michael Poppe, for instance, is hopeful for a potential recovery if Bitcoin continues to trade above $117,000 [1]. A sustained close above this level could indicate a strengthening trend and potentially lead to renewed interest in altcoins. However, the broader market remains divided, with some fearing a deeper pullback should Bitcoin fail to reclaim key support levels.

Ethereum is emerging as a key indicator for the altcoin market. Technical analysis suggests that the asset may retest the $3,900 support level before mounting a potential 100% rally to new highs, assuming it can overcome resistance at $4,400 [7]. The outcome of this liquidity battle could determine whether altcoins follow a similar trajectory or continue to underperform Bitcoin. 

Meanwhile, WLD and Fartcoin have also attracted attention. Ali Martinez has shared a chart for WLD, predicting a potential breakout from a triangular formation, which could see the price targeting $0.50. Previous stops have been identified at $0.78 and $0.62 [1]. On the other hand, Altcoin Sherpa is more optimistic, anticipating a bounce in Ethereum within a green box on the chart and noting that billions of dollars are still flowing into the market [1]. For Fartcoin, the analyst suggests that a local bottom may have been reached, but a further drop to $0.77 is still possible if the current base breaks.

Investors are also keeping an eye on token unlock schedules, which can influence circulating supply and price stability. Coins like KAITO, MURA, and MOCA are facing increased supply pressures as new tokens enter the market [8]. This dynamic adds another layer of complexity to altcoin performance, as traders attempt to balance fundamental value with tokenomics.

As Bitcoin continues to consolidate and test key support levels, the broader crypto market remains in a transitional phase. The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoin can regain upward momentum or if the altcoin market faces further volatility. With macroeconomic conditions remaining uncertain, market participants are closely watching for signs of stabilization in both Bitcoin's price and the broader crypto ecosystem.

Cryptocurrencies continued their slide on Tuesday with bitcoin BTC$113,587.17 sinking below $114,000 as investors are turning cautious that Federal Reserve Chair Powell's Friday Jackson Hold speech may come with a hawkish surprise.

BTC dropped to $113,700 during the early hours of the U.S. session, its weakest price in almost two weeks and pulling back 9% from its Thursday record high above $124,000.

Ether (ETH) slid 3.5% over the past 24 hours below $4,200. Major altcoins weren't spared either: Chainlink LINK$24.04, Avalanche AVAX$22.82, Toncoin TON$3.2179, Ethena ENA$0.6371 and Aptos APT$4.3629 declined 4%-6% in a day.

The crypto pullback occurred alongside with traditional markets turning risk-off, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes down 0.9% and 0.4%, respectively, in the morning.

A check of crypto treasury companies shows that bubble continuing to deflate, with  BTC accumulator KindlyMD (NAKA) lower by another 14% on Tuesday. ETH-focused names Bitmine Immersion (BNMR) and Sharplink Gaming (SBET) are down 10% and 8%, respectively.

Since soaring as high as $124 in late May in wake of its transition to an ether treasury strategy company, SBET — to pick one — has now crumbled by about 85% to its current $18.60.

The grandaddy of the group — Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) was down 5.7% on Tuesday, now lower by 20% over the past month and off 37% from a record high hit late last year. Shares, of course, remain up more than 20-fold since Saylor began purchasing BTC about five years ago. Being the first mover has its advantages.

Investors, who previously saw a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve as a given, are now weighing the odds that Fed Chair Jerome Powell might argue for holding rates steady during his Friday keynote address at the Kansas City Fed's Economic Symposium.

Despite recent signs of a weakening job market and slowing economy, last week's far hotter-than-expected PPI report reignited concerns of inflation reaccelerating.

Economists at Bank of America said in a report that they see the Fed holding rates in September.

"With inflation essentially stuck over the past year, the tariff pass-through that we still expect, and the labor supply story keeping the unemployment rate historically low, we still think there is a strong case for the Fed to remain on hold," the analysts said.

Market participants put a 85% likelihood of 25 basis point cut next month, down from as high as 98% at one point last week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

 Bitcoin gets new "plunge protection" amid an ongoing sell-off and more liquidations for those hoping they had bought the dip. 

Key points:

Bitcoin selling pressure increases as US stocks dip at the Wall Street open.

BTC price almost hits $113,500 as over $100 million in longs gets liquidated in an hour.

ETF flows are now key as onchain fundamentals start “weakening.”

Bitcoin (BTC) fell to near two-week lows at Tuesday's Wall Street open as US selling pressure surged.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping beneath $114,000.

Bitcoin and altcoins fell with US stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite Index down 1.2% at the time of writing.

Long BTC positions, subject to an ongoing squeeze, added another $116 million to their liquidation tally in an hour.

Data from CoinGlass also showed bids lining up around the $112,000 mark — already a point of interest for market participants.

“TLDR: The $107k - $110k range is coming into focus,” Keith Alan, cofounder of trading resource Material Indicators, summarized in part of his latest post on X.

Alan flagged the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) at $110,950 as a potential support barrier, with the 50-day counterpart at $115,875 now important to reclaim.

On exchange order books, Material Indicators identified a $25 million band of liquidity at $105,000 — “plunge protection” against a deeper market rout.

“This bid liquidity does not look like it aims to get filled. It was placed to heard liquidity upward. If it fails to accomplish that and price reverts, I expect it to get rugged or moved before it gets filled,” it commented alongside a chart of liquidity and whale order volume.

In the latest edition of its Market Pulse updates, onchain analytics firm Glassnode meanwhile highlighted a growing divergence between institutional demand and price action.

Investment vehicles, notably the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), were seeing inflows despite “weakening” onchain signals such as volume.

“With profit-taking on the rise, the sustainability of institutional flows and renewed buyer conviction in both spot and futures will determine whether this contraction stabilizes into fresh upward momentum or extends into deeper consolidation,” it reported.

The ETFs recorded a net outflow of $121 million on Monday, per data from UK investment firm Farside Investors. The largest ETF offering, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), saw its first outflows since Aug. 5.

Oops, something went wrong

Outflows from U.S. ETFs tracking Ethereum's spot price hit $197 million on Monday—the second-highest figure ever for daily withdrawals.

The sell-offs come as the queue for unstaking ETH also surged to new records, with $3.9 billion worth of withdrawals now pending.

BRN Head of Research Timothy Misir warned both factors are "pressuring near-term sentiment."

In a note to investors, he argued $4,400 is now a crucial support level for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, Ethereum is flat compared to yesterday, trading at $4,203.84, according to price aggregator CoinGecko.

The outflows come days after ETH failed to secure a fresh all-time high above $4,891.70, which was set back in November 2021. It peaked around $4,776.32 on Thursday, August 14.

All signs point to investors taking profits off the table after Ethereum surged by 66% in the space of a year, attracting a slew of institutional interest.

Ethereum ETFs hold 5.08% of this digital asset's supply, but Misir believes the portion of Ethereum sitting in ETFs could overtake the 6.38% worth of Bitcoin held in ETFs "if the current inflow pace is sustained."

Bitcoin funds weren't immune from these outflows on Monday, but suffered a less modest draw of $122 million by comparison.

Despite BTC also retracing from an all-time high of $124,457.12 last Thursday, Misir argued that whales are continuing to accumulate—with 20,061 BTC added to wallets holding at least 10,000 coins over the past six days.

The pullback happened as Donald Trump invited European leaders to the White House to discuss the war in Ukraine, days after a much-anticipated summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin resulted in no deal being reached.

"Crypto remains sensitive to these signals," Misir wrote, adding that the prospect of further negotiations could bolster risk appetite among investors.

Bitcoin Jumps to New All-Time High Price as Ethereum Nears Record

For now, he argues that Bitcoin enjoys "structural support" in the $115,000 range—and a break above $121,000 would pave the way for a retest of the zone between $123,000 and $127,000.

"Geopolitical developments around U.S.–Ukraine–Russia trilateral talks now inject additional two-way risk: a ceasefire could catalyze BTC's push above $120K, while escalation risks argue for caution. Defensive positioning and selective accumulation remain the prudent approach," Misir wrote.

Figure Technology's IPO is set to take place on Nasdaq, and it's stirring the crypto space into a frenzy. This isn't just a big step for the company, but a potential turning point for the entire crypto payroll landscape. With a financial comeback under its belt, there are questions about blockchain innovation's future amid the ongoing regulatory dance. Let's unpack how this IPO might reshape crypto payroll, usher in financial inclusion, and spark a new breed of startups in the crypto realm.

Figure Technology is carving out its niche as a frontrunner in blockchain lending, recently filing for an IPO on Nasdaq with the ticker “FIGR.” The financial figures are striking, with revenues nearing $191 million—a 22% climb from last year—and a leap from $13 million in losses to $29 million in profit.

Co-founded by Mike Cagney, a significant player in fintech, Figure operates on the Provenance blockchain. They provide cutting-edge lending services and asset tokenization for institutional clients. With more than $16 billion in blockchain-based loans and $50 billion in on-chain transactions, Figure's journey highlights the growing interest from institutions in blockchain tech.

Cagney believes blockchain can remove financial middlemen, cut costs, and boost transparency in markets that are usually hard to navigate. As the crypto industry bounces back, driven by favorable regulations, Figure's IPO might clear a path for other fintech companies to explore public markets.

While the IPO is exciting, the regulatory landscape is both a hurdle and an opportunity for the crypto world. Ambiguous regulations, enforcement-heavy methods, and patchy oversight can cloud the innovation scene and create uncertainty for newcomers. This is particularly true for firms like Figure, which face the SEC's tough stance treating crypto assets as securities.

But there is a silver lining—recent moves toward clearer regulations could allow innovation to flourish while keeping investors safe. As regulators start to clarify their guidelines and bring in crypto-savvy officials, the chance for a more balanced approach may emerge, potentially spurring R&D in the sector.

Figure's unique take on crypto payroll shows how blockchain can drive financial inclusion. With crypto-backed loans free from the usual credit checks, and trading without fees, Figure is lowering the hurdles for people who are underserved to access financial services. This is part of a wider trend in fintech, where digital advancements are making financial services more available.

The notion of crypto payroll is gaining traction, and it could provide easier access to financial services for the unbanked. Integrating blockchain payments into payroll not only streamlines processes but can also instill trust and transparency among users.

The rise of blockchain is shaking up traditional financial services, and Figure Technology is leading the way. With blockchain enabling real-time interbank transactions and collaborations with major payment networks, Figure is setting new standards in payment systems. This mirrors a growing trend in fintech where startups are increasingly incorporating crypto and blockchain to enhance their services.

As the crypto world grows, the intersection of crypto and HR is capturing attention. Tools and platforms that support crypto payroll are becoming more popular, with startups looking at the potential of digital banking tailored to the crypto industry.

Figure Technology's IPO isn't just a win for the company; it's a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. With clearer regulations and new solutions like crypto payroll on the rise, financial inclusion and the growth of digital banking startups are on the horizon.

For smaller fintech startups, Figure's success is a playbook for leveraging blockchain tech to improve operations and attract investment. By proactively addressing regulatory issues and forming smart partnerships, these startups can position themselves competitively in a bustling market.

In short, Figure Technology's story showcases blockchain's ability to reshape financial services, drive innovation, and broaden access to financial resources. As the crypto landscape evolves, opportunities await those willing to embrace the changing tides of this vibrant industry.

SharpLink bought $667M of Ethereum near record highs, lifting its holdings to $3.2B, while its stock dropped 12% as investors weighed the risks.

SharpLink (SBET) snapped up a whopping $667 million of Ethereum (ETH-USD) at sky-high prices, pushing its holdings to $3.2 billion, even as its shares slid 12% on the news. The sports betting platform made the purchase just as ETH traded near record highs of $4,700, showing it's willing to pay top dollar to keep building its crypto war chest.





SharpLink disclosed in a U.S. SEC filing that it bought 143,593 Ethereum at an average of $4,648 each, totaling $667.4 million. The purchase boosted its total stash to 740,760 ETH, worth around $3.2 billion at current market prices.

What's interesting is that rather than waiting for a dip, SharpLink added at the top end of ETH's trading range. This signals confidence in Ethereum's long-term value.

The company isn't leaving its crypto pile idle. SharpLink reported that “substantially all of the ETH Holdings were deployed in staking, including through liquid staking,” as of August 17. Staking allows the company to earn rewards while helping run Ethereum's proof-of-stake network.

So far, those rewards amount to 1,388 ETH, worth more than $5.8 million. Still, SharpLink warned in its filing that staking rules may be subject to regulatory changes, which could impact this strategy.

Despite the bullish crypto move, SharpLink's stock didn't benefit. Shares tumbled 12% on Friday and closed Monday at $20.10, down 13.5% over the past five days, according to TradingView.

Part of the decline ties back to SharpLink's recent $103 million net loss in Q2 2025, much of it related to accounting for liquid staked Ethereum (LsETH). Investors seem uneasy about the balance between big crypto bets and actual profitability.

SharpLink's ETH purchase comes as institutions are scooping up the token at record pace. Ethereum ETFs alone saw $3.7 billion in inflows between Aug. 5 and last Thursday, reflecting heavy demand.

Its main rival, BitMine (BMNR) , announced an even bigger buy of 373,000 ETH. This lifted its holdings to 1.52 million ETH worth about $6.6 billion. “The new ETH purchase made BitMine the second-largest crypto treasury in the world behind only Michael Saylor's Strategy,” BitMine board chair Thomas Lee said.

Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) remains king of corporate crypto reserves, though its focus is Bitcoin rather than Ether. The firm recently added $51.4 million in BTC, bringing its total holdings to 629,376 BTC, valued near $72.7 billion.

That leaves Strategy on top overall, but SharpLink and BitMine are racing for dominance in Ethereum.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is sitting at $4,189.50.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

SharpLink Gaming, the Nasdaq-listed affiliate marketing and gaming software firm-turned Ethereum treasury company, said on Tuesday that it spent another $667 million on ether.

The company said it has purchased another 143,593 ETH at an average price of $4,648 per ether ($667.4 million) — bringing its total holdings to 740,760 (nearly $3.2 billion at current prices). Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin serves as SharpLink's chairman of the board.

SharpLink is the number two Ethereum treasury company when ranked by holdings; BitMine Immersion Tech is the leading ETH treasury with over 1.5 million ether, according to The Block Data Dashboard. The cumulative amount of ether held by ETH treasuries is about $10.4 billion amid the recent craze in digital asset treasuries, or DATs, according to The Block's data.

After Bitcoin treasury Strategy, BitMine claims to be the number two DAT globally. The company aims to hold up to 5% of ETH's supply.

ETH was changing hands at $4,238.062 as of 10:35 a.m. ET, according to The Block Price Page.



SharpLink also said it raised $537 million during the week ending Aug. 17 and has $84 million in cash it has not yet deployed. The company's stock dipped last week after SharpLink disclosed a $103 million net loss for the second quarter.



For the quarter, the company reported a 98% increase in "ETH Concentration," a measure of how much ETH the company holds per every 1,000 potential shares, which includes actual shares plus all the possible shares from warrants, options, RSUs, pre-funded warrants, and so on. "Nearly 100%" of the company's ETH has been staked, the firm also said.

As of Aug. 17, SharpLink had generated rewards of 1,388 ETH to date.

"Ethereum is the trust layer for the decentralized economy, and SharpLink's aggressive accumulation, staking and strategic management of ETH set it apart from any other public company in the market," Lubin said last week. "SharpLink is actively compounding value for our fellow stockholders through yield generation and intelligent capital deployment."

Investor sentiment has shifted again, as Ethereum ETF flows dwindled after weeks of frenzy. However, Remittix (RTX) is at the center stage after its rocket past the $20 million mark in its ongoing ICO. 

With its token priced at $0.0969 and a wallet beta launch planned in Q3, Remittix is solidly on its path to becoming one of the best crypto presales of 2025, connecting payments in the real world with blockchain technology.

The second-largest blockchain on the planet by market cap, Ethereum, is valued at $4,328.22, declining 4.5% in the last 24 hours. The price has cooled off, although volume surged to $54.53 billion, rising a whopping 116.04%, which means both retail and institutional investors are still interested.

Its market cap stands at $522.17 billion today, and its relevance to decentralized finance and the broader Layer 1 ecosystem has strengthened. In spite of that, though, recent deceleration of ETF inflows has investors questioning near-term momentum, with attention turned to new altcoins that aim to solve real-world financial problems.

Remittix (RTX) aims to be among the most innovative future crypto projects of the year. The project has made its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing on BitMart after reaching the milestone of more than $20 million raised and selling more than 608 million tokens. 

The listing is expected to introduce stronger liquidity, wider global accessibility, and easier access for new investors who would like to buy the RTX token.

Practical success supports the success of the presale. Remittix will launch its beta wallet during Q3, aimed at real-time crypto-to-fiat exchange between 30+ currencies. With over 40 cryptos being supported on launch and real-time FX conversion, the wallet will make Remittix one of the top-ranking cryptos under $1 that offers real adoption rather than speculation.

Why Remittix Is Gaining Global Attention:

In contrast to hype-based launches or meme tokens, Remittix is positioned towards solving real use cases. It seeks to enable low gas fee cryptotransfers straight into bank accounts for freelancers, remitters, and global businesses to use. This commitment to genuine adoption already made RTX among the leading DeFi projects in 2025.

By combining decentralized exchange benefits with centralized exchange ease of access, Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi platform poised to thrive in the long term. Its utility-oriented model, deflationary tokenomics, and global remittance application make it translate into comparisons to XRP and Stellar, but with added emphasis on speed and convenience.

With the momentum growing and milestones coming along, Remittix is making waves among currently live crypto presales. Investors seeking the next popular altcoin 2025 with real utility find in RTX's presale and upcoming wallet launch a unique entry point prior to big listings spreading its adoption.

The search for the Best Altcoins To Buy Now, XRP Price has dominated the conversation in 2025. XRP continues to be sought after worldwide, and new players like Remittix are popularizing due to their useful applications.

With the long-term prospects of growth in XRP and Remittix's increasing presale popularity, investors are weighing the possibilities in both tried-and-true and new digital currencies.

XRP is priced at $3.07, experiencing a small dip by 1.29% in the past 24 hours. The decline notwithstanding, the token boasts a huge market cap of $182.73 billion. Its activity has risen significantly, with trading volume in a day touching $7.81 billion — a 133% increase that reflects growing interest in traders.

XRP is still among the top cryptos under $5 in consideration of its use in cross-border payments. Its use in the financial settlement keeps it relevant, although new entrants are providing stiff competition. Investors who consider Best Altcoins To Buy Now, XRP Price patterns are increasingly considering presales such as Remittix for early access.



Remittix (RTX) is soon to become a standout on the top crypto presale of 2025. Over $20 million have been locked up already with more than 608 million sold out tokens priced each at $0.0969. Reaching the milestone prompted its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing, with BitMart making announcements of listing the token.

This action boosts liquidity and makes RTX more liquid, besides opening doors for mass acceptance. Besides the exchange listing, Remittix is preparing for its Q3 beta wallet launch, enabling users to send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in more than 30 nations.

As a Remittix DeFi project, RTX is working to simplify payments by bridging crypto and everyday banking. It stands apart from speculative meme coins because it is built for utility — with real-time crypto-to-fiat transfers, support for 40+ digital assets, and low-gas-fee crypto transactions. All of these capabilities put RTX on the next big altcoin 2025 run.

Some of the most striking aspects of the project are:

By tackling the $19 trillion payments economy, Remittix is gaining traction as one of the best new altcoins with practical application. As a means of investment for those considering early stage investing in crypto, RTX offers sound use cases coupled with strong presale adoption.



The discussion on Best Altcoins To Buy Now, XRP Price contains a shift in investor strategies. XRP is still one of the best crypto to buy now because it already has a footing in payments, while Remittix is a fresh crypto token launch intended for adoption.

Fact checked

By Sam Cooling

The combined crypto market cap is down 0.5% on the day, slipping to $3.95 trillion as major caps like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are down 0.5%, 0.9%, and 0.7%, respectively. With the discounts on offer across the market, many are wondering which is the best Solana meme coin to buy on the dip.

Altcoins such as PUMP and VIRTUALS have also taken sizeable hits, with Pump.fun's native token down over 10% and AI powerhouse Virtuals Protocol down 3%.



(COINGECKO)

As we enter yet another day of red across the crypto market, traders and analysts are scrambling to put together a fresh piece of technical analysis to suit their agendas.

However, the simple fact of the matter is that aside from outliers such as LIGHT or API3, which are up overnight, 70% and 78% respectively, the entire crypto market is undergoing a correction.

Multiple analysts believe that BTC will drop between $95,000 and $105,000, while technical analysis is indicating that ETH may drop as low as $2,900. Whether the two leading cryptocurrencies drop that low, this ongoing dip is presenting some incredible buying opportunities.

Many have been trying to time the perfect bottom for Pump.fun's PUMP token, and while it did pump over 60% to $0.0041 from the end of July into August, it has since begun to drop once more.

PUMP is down over 21% in the past seven days, essentially frontrunning the market-wide dip that began just a few days after the Pump.fun token crashed.

As for Solana meme coins, PUMP is directly responsible for many of them due to many launches taking place on the Pump.fun platform, and they are suffering greatly.

Tokens such as CHILLHOUSE, MOODENG, and AURA have been down between 15% and 25% in the last seven days. Whenever a market-wide correction occurs, meme coins are often the biggest victims, and this time is no different.

DefiLlama data also supports the narrative that Solana's on-chain ecosystem has taken a hit over the past week, with TVL (total-value locked) down 3.25% on Solana in the last 24 hours alone.

To put it into context, just yesterday, TVL on SOL was at $11.4 billion, and today it is sitting at $10.35 billion, a daily loss of $1 billion.



(SOURCE)

However, there is optimism that Q4 will prove a bountiful period across crypto. While meme coins tend to go down faster than your average altcoin, they also reverse the hardest. For this reason, traders should ask themselves, “What is the best Solana meme coin to buy before Q4?”

Snorter Bot (SNORT) might just represent the best play when seeking the next blue-chip meme coin, as it has the added benefit of still being in presale and thus not a victim of the ongoing market volatility.



While there is no telling how low Solana meme coins may go during this correction, Snorter Bot (SNORT) can still be in the presale phase and not at the mercy of volatile price swings.

It is also the perfect investment. On the surface, SNORT seems like just another meme coin. However, it is packed with utility, and it could quickly become a cash-generating monster.

The increasing demand for SNORT is attributed to traders recognizing it as an essential tool as the bull market progresses. Snorter Bot is a multi-chain-ready Telegram trading bot that offers SNORT holders industry-leading trading fees of just 0.85%. From day one, this rate has been more competitive than that of other trading bots, such as Trojan, BONKBot, and Banana Gun.

Since its initial coin offering (ICO) went live, Snorter Bot has raised over $3.2M in just over three months, demonstrating strong investor interest in a project combining meme coin appeal and utility.

Snorter Bot features built-in MEV (miner-extractable value) protection, an innovative sniper tool, and a copy-trade function. These features enable users to follow their favorite wallets and influencers while also allowing them to acquire low-cost tokens during the hottest new launches.

SNORT is quickly becoming traders' answer to the best crypto to buy right now for both the short and long term due to its market-leading trading bot and meme coin virality of its token.

Initially, SNORT will only be available on Solana; however, the bot has been designed with multi-chain capabilities. It is anticipated that it will soon expand to other notable chains such as Base and Ethereum.

Investors seeking passive income on their SNORT presale bag can stake their tokens for an impressive 137% APY. This offers traders a perfect passive income opportunity while they wait for the Snorter Bot ICO to conclude.

Just under 24 hours are remaining until the SNORT presale moves onto its next price stage, meaning that once the timer hits zero, its current price of $0.1017 will be gone for good.

Oops, something went wrong

Jimmy "MrBeast" Donaldson‘s philanthropic initiative to bring clean water to millions of people worldwide is getting a boost from the cryptocurrency community.

Donaldson on Aug. 1 announced #TeamWater, a fundraising campaign to raise $40 million during the month to "provide 2 million people with life-changing access to clean water for decades" in partnership with fellow YouTuber Mark Rober and non-profit WaterAid.

Moments after Donaldson's announcement, a memecoin called TeamWater went live on the Layer 1 blockchain Solana, promising to donate 90% of all fees generated to the initiative. #TeamWater's dashboard shows the project has raised $257,000 for the campaign.

Don't Miss:

The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.

Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

But the cryptocurrency community's support for #TeamWater did not end  with the eponymous memecoin. On Aug. 6, leading non-fungible token platform OpenSea launched a charitable NFT mint to support the cause together with Ethereum Layer 2 Abstract, Web3 gaming platform Yield Guild Games and others. Over 22,000 NFT collectors banded together during the event, which concluded on Aug. 11, ultimately raising $230,000 for the project.

Ranked by communities, the TeamWater memecoin and OpenSea mint are the second and fourth-largest donors to the #TeamWater initiative, according to the project's dashboard. In first place are users of the streaming platform Kick with nearly $11 million raised at last look.

Recent actions by the cryptocurrency community in support of #TeamWater highlight the utility of blockchain technology and digital collectibles beyond speculation, as well as their growing role in aid and philanthropic efforts.

As the #TeamWater campaign team points out, the World Health Organization and UNICEF estimate that one in 10 people do not have access to clean water close to their homes. The team also highlights the United Nations' projection that 4.5 billion people will face water scarcity by 2040.

#TeamWater says tackling this problem will have significant implications for the welfare of women and children, healthcare and climate resistance.

The #TeamWater initiative follows the success of #TeamTrees and #TeamSeas, initiatives also led by Donaldson and Rober, which raised $50 million combined to plant 20 million trees and remove 30 million pounds of waste from waterbodies worldwide.

"We've seen the power of the internet when it rallies behind a cause, from planting millions of trees to removing millions of pounds of trash from the ocean," Donaldson and Rober said in a joint statement. "Now, we're taking on clean water, because no one should have to live without it."

The #TeamWater campaign is slated to end Aug. 31 and has so far raised $30.4 million with two weeks to spare. Beyond the cryptocurrency community, the project has received donations from YouTube, TikTok, Citadel CEO Ken Griffin and OnlyFans star Sophie Rain.

SoFi Partners with Lightspark to Power Blockchain-Enabled International Money Transfers

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI) announced its upcoming international money transfer service, enabling members to send funds abroad directly from the SoFi app with lower fees and faster delivery compared to traditional remittance service providers. Lightspark, a leading enterprise infrastructure provider that uses the Bitcoin Lightning Network, will enable the technology via Universal Money Address (UMA), to send and receive money seamlessly, with access to an open global network for payments. SoFi will be one of the first US-banks to offer a blockchain-powered remittances service.


“For many SoFi members who regularly send money to loved ones internationally, the ability to quickly transfer money at low cost isn't just a convenience, it's a meaningful improvement to their everyday financial lives,” said Anthony Noto, SoFi CEO. “By embedding this directly into SoFi's app, we're unlocking the value of blockchain technology, to give members faster, smarter, and more inclusive access to their money.”




“SoFi is one of the most innovative and forward-thinking financial platforms in the US today," said David Marcus, CEO and co-founder of Lightspark. "Digital banks are embracing UMA because it's fast, cheap, and secure, and it uses the only open payments network that exists, Bitcoin. UMA on SoFi means customers can move dollars instantly, any time, globally, and we're excited to see the demand via SoFi's waitlist, proving that people are ready for the future of payments.”




SoFi's international money transfer service will launch later this year. SoFi will be one of the lowest cost platforms to transfer money internationally, with the total costs being below the current national average. To ensure full transparency, exchange rate and fees will be displayed up front, before members hit send. The service will be available 24/7 directly on the SoFi app, without needing to use a third-party app.




How it Works



SoFi's new international money transfer service, powered by UMA, converts U.S. dollars to Bitcoin in real-time and routes funds across borders using the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The funds are then instantly converted back into local currency and delivered directly to the recipient's bank account in the destination country's local currency.




Lightspark powers a global network of partner banks and financial platforms. This gives senders and recipients a seamless and secure transfer experience with a financial platform they know and trust.




At launch, SoFi's international transfer service will first be available in Mexico with more countries to be added shortly after launch. This phased approach ensures speed, security, and consistency for members from day one, with even more countries to follow.




SoFi's international money transfers will be available through SoFi Checking & Savings later this year. SoFi Checking and Savings is offered through SoFi Bank, N.A. Member FDIC. Members can sign up to join a waitlist to receive access to SoFi self-serve international money transfers later this year.

Katten and CRC-Oyster teamed up to launch a three-part webinar
series on "Crypto in Focus: Regulation, Risk and the Road
Ahead." Part 1, "Digital Assets Regulatory Updates,"
brought together Katten Partners Dan Davis, Co-Chair of Financial Markets and
Regulation, Susan Light, Co-Chair of Broker-Dealer
Regulation, with CRC-Oyster Managing Directors Jeff Gearhart and Dan Garrett, to discuss the changing
legislative, regulatory and market environment for digital assets
and cryptocurrencies in the United States. The session focused on
significant new laws, regulatory initiatives and the practical
implications for market participants, retail investors and service
providers.

The GENIUS Act marks a notable milestone as the first federal
legislation specifically addressing digital assets, with a focus on
payment stablecoins.1 Signed into law by President
Donald Trump, the GENIUS Act establishes a regulatory perimeter for
payment stablecoins, including federal and state registration
pathways, reserve requirements and business limitations for
issuers. It also recognizes the utility of payment stablecoins as
collateral and for fund transfers, aiming to provide greater
regulatory clarity and stability in this segment of the market.

The Clarity Act, which passed the House and is pending in the
Senate, seeks to address the broader market structure for digital
assets. The bill proposes clearer delineation of regulatory
authority between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and introduces new
registration categories for entities involved in spot digital asset
activities. If enacted, the Clarity Act would grant the CFTC
primary oversight of spot digital asset markets, filling a current
regulatory gap.

Federal regulatory bodies have significantly increased their
engagement with crypto. The White House has issued multiple
executive orders and established task forces to coordinate policy
across agencies.2 The SEC, CFTC, as well as banking
regulators are all actively developing guidance and seeking
industry input.3

The SEC has established a Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner
Hester Peirce, and has issued new guidance on digital asset
activities.4 Recent public statements from SEC
leadership emphasize a commitment to ensuring US leadership in
digital asset innovation and to providing timely guidance on best
practices for distribution, custody and trading.5 The
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), while reliant on
SEC rulemaking, is also engaging with market participants and
focusing on core regulatory concerns such as accurate public
communications, supervision, anti-money laundering and
recordkeeping.6

The CFTC continues to issue guidance and grant exemptive
relief,7 including recent requests for comment on
leveraged spot digital asset products.8 The agency is
exploring ways to provide additional clarity and facilitate the
development of new products within its existing authorities.

Traditional financial institutions and service providers are
increasingly seeking to integrate digital assets into their
business models, while decentralized finance (DeFi) and
international entities are exploring entry into the US market.
There is a strong emphasis on education and collaboration, as firms
work to understand the regulatory environment and prepare for
forthcoming changes.

Key infrastructure providers, such as the Depository Trust &
Clearing Corporation (DTCC), are developing standards and protocols
to support blockchain interoperability and certification, which is
expected to enhance comfort and participation among larger market
participants.9 Industry partnerships and workshops are
underway to test and refine new products and services.

A notable shift has occurred in regulatory engagement, with
agencies now more open to dialogue and collaboration with industry
participants. Law firms and consultants are facilitating these
interactions, helping clients navigate complex and evolving
requirements.10 While regulatory frameworks are still
under development, there is a clear trend toward increased
transparency, engagement and the establishment of best
practices.

Despite the progress, several challenges remain. Key regulatory
definitions and requirements, such as those related to possession
and control of digital assets, are still being clarified.
FINRA's ability to approve new business models is limited by
the current absence of a comprehensive regulatory framework from
the SEC. Firms must continue to exercise diligence in areas such as
customer communications, supervision, anti-money laundering and
recordkeeping.

The US digital asset regulation is undergoing rapid
transformation, with significant legislative and regulatory
initiatives underway. Market participants should anticipate
continued developments and increased regulatory clarity in the near
term. Engagement with regulators, industry collaboration and
adherence to evolving best practices will be critical for firms
seeking to participate in this dynamic sector. Future webinars and
industry updates are planned to provide ongoing guidance as the
regulatory environment continues to evolve.

08/19 update below. This post was originally published on August 18

Bitcoin—alongside other major cryptocurrencies ethereum and XRP—have fallen sharply, raising fears of a crypto market crash after it bubbled up to an all-time high of $4.2 trillion this month (just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk breaks his silence on crypto).

The bitcoin price has plunged from an all-time high of $124,000 per bitcoin just last week, dropping around 10% to $114,000, while ethereum and Ripple's XRP have seen similar declines despite U.S. president Donald Trump dropping a surprise $12.2 trillion crypto bombshell.

Bitcoin and crypto's decline, coming just as JPMorgan makes a game-changing Federal Reserve flip, follows Wall Street giants issuing a warning that the recently passed Genius Act stablecoin bill could trigger a $6.6 trillion flood of account withdrawals.

U.S. banking groups that count Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan and Bank of America as members have urged Congress to close a loophole in the recently passed Genius Act stablecoin bill that allows issuers of the dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies to offer yields via affiliates, warning it could trigger huge account deposit flight that would undermine the banking system.

08/19 update: The bitcoin price and crypto market has swung wildly as fears swirl a widespread crypto market crash could be gathering pace.

The bitcoin price dropped towards $113,000 before bouncing back to around $115,000, dragging down the wider crypto market that's seen $250 billion in value wiped out since last week.

“Cryptocurrencies traded sharply lower,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. 

“Bitcoin continued to pull back away from Thursday's all-time high just below $124,500. Ethereum came under heavier selling pressure, dropping over 5%. These losses highlight the continued volatility within the crypto sector. The bigger question is whether this is simply a round of profit-taking following the sharp rally over the first two weeks of August, or if it is the beginning of a deeper and more protracted sell-off.”

The closely-watched crypto fear and greed index has swung from a reading of 68 last week to just 56, its lowest reading since the bitcoin price dropped to under $112,000 at the beginning of August and putting it on the verge of “fear” territory.

This week, the three-day Jackson Hole economic policy symposium begins in Wyoming, with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's Friday speech topping the agenda as traders brace for what's widely expected to be a Fed interest rate cut in September.

“Markets are shoring up their focus on upcoming commentary from the Fed chair at the Jackson Hole Symposium," Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in emailed comments. “Fed reserve timelines and geopolitical developments are shaping flows across equities, FX, and crypto.”

Last week, Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, mirroring a surprise 2024 interest rate cut that powered a bitcoin price boom into the November election.

“If Powell signals a slower path to easing at Jackson Hole, markets could reprice aggressively, tightening financial conditions and putting pressure on crypto prices in the near term,” Carolane de Palmas, market analyst at Activtrades, said in emailed comments.

“While bitcoin is often framed as ‘digital gold,' its short-term performance is still highly sensitive to liquidity cycles. Traders need to recognize that Fed policy directly shapes dollar liquidity, and by extension, influences the flows into and out of bitcoin. If the Fed looks more cautious on rate cuts, we could see reduced momentum in the crypto space through the fall. But there's a second layer here—beyond just liquidity. The symbolism of Jackson Hole matters. This is where Powell sets the tone for policy direction, and any hint that rate cuts are still firmly on the table could restore confidence in the crypto rally. On the flip side, if the Fed appears hesitant because of tariff-driven inflation concerns, bitcoin could remain trapped in consolidation until a clearer macro catalyst emerges. In the next quarter, bitcoin's path will be closely tied to Fed expectations.”

In April, a Treasury Department report estimated that stablecoins could trigger up to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, depending on whether they can offer interest or yield, with the stablecoin market expected to grow to $2 trillion by 2028, up from $280 billion today.

"Congress must protect the flow of credit to American businesses and families and the stability of the most important financial market by closing the stablecoin payment of interest loophole," the report, posted to the Bank Policy Institute website, and addressed to lawmakers, read.

“Banks power the economy by turning deposits into loans. Incentivizing a shift from bank deposits and money market funds to stablecoins would end up increasing lending costs and reducing loans to businesses and consumer households.”

The plea to lawmakers was also signed by the American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America and the Financial Services Forum.

Stablecoin adoption wars are heating up following the passage of the Genius Act that laid down rules of the road for the crypto-based dollars.

Tether's USDT remains the dominant stablecoin but is facing a tidal wave of competition from all angles, including Wall Street giants themselves, technology companies such as Facebook's Meta, as well as financial technology companies like PayPal and Stripe.

Earlier this year, David Sacks, a technology investor and U.S. president Donald Trump's crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he hosts with three other investors that he hopes that eventually the rules will swing in favor of stablecoin issuers, allowing them to directly offer interest to stablecoin holders.

Trump's sons Eric and Don Jr have publicly said their World Liberty Financial crypto project is a direct challenge to Wall Street following their claims of being “de-banked” in the aftermath of Trump's 2020 election loss. “Honestly, I would love to see some of the big banks go extinct, because, honestly, they deserve it," Eric Trump said in May.

The bitcoin price and crypto market's latest downturn, coming as just as traders celebrated a fresh all-time high, have raised fears the market could see further declines in coming weeks.

“The crypto market continued its decline on Monday after a pause over the weekend,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro's chief market analyst, said in emailed comments.

“The total capitalisation fell back to $3.88 trillion, reaching its lowest level in more than two weeks. As expected, altcoins are falling the hardest, with ethereum and XRP losing about 5% in the last 24 hours, twice as much as bitcoin. Bitcoin fell to $115,000, the lowest level in the last 11 days. It is now testing the 50-day moving average, which has been the bullish trend line since April. A consolidation below it will sharply increase the chances of a deeper correction, and a failure below $112,000—the area of recent lows—will confirm the correction, opening the potential for a decline to $105,000-107,000.”

Cardano, Shiba Inu have both seen renewed momentum in recent sessions. While Cardano's ADA and the Shiba Inu Coin are in the green, the real buzz in the crypto space is around the fast-moving Remittix presale.



The cross-border payments project has now raised over $19.3 million, bringing it close to a major $20 million  milestone that will trigger its first centralized exchange listing reveal.





Cardano is trading at $0.8804, up 11.58% in 24 hours, with a market cap of $31.35 billion. Its trading volume surged 103.06% to $2.52 billion, showing strong market interest.

Meanwhile, Shiba Inu Price has climbed 5.79% to $0.00001384. The SHIB market cap now sits at $8.15 billion, while trading volume has risen 36.23% to $335.42 million. The uptick adds to recent Shiba Inu News pointing toward steady retail participation.



Both Cardano and SHIB are benefiting from the broader interest in top crypto under $1 assets and low cap crypto gems with high growth potential.



Remittix (RTX) is quickly positioning itself as one of the best crypto project 2025 contenders. Priced at $0.0944 per token, the project has sold over 599 million RTX, raising $19.3 million + so far.

When the presale hits $20 million , Remittix will announce its first CEX listing, a key move to improve liquidity and accessibility. This is alongside a 50% token bonus still live for early participants and a $250,000 RTX Giveaway for the community.

Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi project aimed at solving a $19 trillion real-world payments problem. Its platform will allow users to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, with low gas fees and real-time FX conversion.

A major update came with the announcement of its beta wallet launch planned for Q3 2025. This mobile-first wallet will integrate crypto staking, fiat withdrawals and support for 40+ cryptocurrencies, giving RTX a clear real-world utility edge over many upcoming crypto projects.



Why Remittix Is Gaining Attention

With momentum building and whales reportedly buying RTX, the $20 million target is within reach. Hitting it will mean the first centralized exchange reveal and the end of the 40% bonus period.

For investors tracking the next big altcoin 2025 or crypto solving real world problems, Remittix is shaping up as a serious contender. As Cardano, Shiba Inu and other established coins show signs of life, this new altcoin to watch is making its own headlines.

Can interoperability survive the rise of branded rails?

Fintech powerhouse Stripe is secretly building a high-performance blockchain called ‘Tempo', and Circle just announced its own stablecoin-centric chain, ‘Arc'. Stablecoins promise to make cryptocurrencies mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments.

Paradoxically, the same move could undercut what the technology set out to achieve. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. With the US's Genius Act now law, the next 12–18 months will most likely determine the outcome.

We've seen this before with the internet. Even when a technology has a decentralising force, economies of scale in complementary resources, brand or distribution inevitably drive concentration. The underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, but massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us.

Crypto as the antidote?

Crypto's reason for existence was to break free from centralised intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. Inspired by bitcoin, entrepreneurs have applied the same principles to other digital platforms, including finance, marketplaces and social media. Progress towards decentralisation is mixed: while bitcoin allows anyone to be their own bank, most rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer greater privacy and data controls have stayed niche.

In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Legacy infrastructure is siloed and incumbents have tremendous power over what we can access – and on what terms. Markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in – the most salient example is China's introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the Ant Group and Tencent oligopoly.

Crypto is a market-driven solution to this. It provides neutral and decentralised cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, as well as truly open financial rails. But as the technology has matured, two problems have emerged.

1. Stablecoins' centralising force

The first problem is that cryptocurrencies are volatile and therefore expensive for payments and financial contracts. To address this, the market has focused on fiat-backed stablecoins. This inevitably leads to centralisation because issuance requires a regulated entity to be accountable. While distributed governance is possible, it is difficult to get right – Libra being the most prominent example. Even Circle's Centre Consortium, with only two members, was dissolved and converted into a revenue-sharing agreement.

Distributed ownership of a stablecoin ecosystem makes sense and is similar to what made Visa scale in the 1970s. Banks have tried for years to come together in response to crypto. To date, no joint project has delivered anything tangible. The reason is obvious: until the situation is dire, competitors are unlikely to collaborate.

To date, the only working model for stablecoin governance is the centralised one. This is long-term problematic, and issuers have already started expanding their offerings to limit openness. Circle announced its own rails with Arc and payment network with the Circle Payments Network, placing it at the centre of how payments are executed – from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every transaction, to price and liquidity discovery, and collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from what allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate for decades.

2. From open rails to closed loops?

The second problem crypto has run into is deeply tied to its roots: decentralisation is expensive. The economic consequence is that you can only afford it where it truly matters. To date, among networks at scale, that's been true only for the base layers of bitcoin, ethereum and solana. At most, that yields a few thousand transactions per second combined – a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you add financial services.

As a result, most transactions no longer occur on the base layers (L1s) but on a sprawling ecosystem of high-throughput scaling solutions (L2s). While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns with economic theory: participants are willing to pay a premium for decentralisation and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily accept more centralisation to gain lower costs and faster speeds.

This trade-off is broader than a user's decision to be their own bank. When building products, companies care deeply that the underlying network is decentralised. Essentially, they are willing to pay for neutrality to reduce the risk of expropriation – something that has repeatedly played out in digital platforms.

To fully grasp what fast, low-cost L2s will do to competition, look no further than what the internet did to news and media: as the cost of distributing content fell to zero, business models evolved drastically, and massive aggregators (Google, Facebook, Spotify) emerged. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience and allow builders to deliver better experiences, they are the obvious layer where value will be created – and appropriated.

Furthermore, as money movement is commoditised, competition will shift to value-added services where new and legacy financial institutions have an advantage. Any regulated player can now use the technology to scale a truly global product. Once it reaches scale, it can also degrade interoperability and appropriate more of the value.

Whoever controls the last mile wins

So what's the most likely scenario? Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been, it's safe to assume that payments will gravitate towards a couple of permissionless blockchains. Yet most activity will take place not on their base layers, but on branded scaling layers.

Players that control distribution – whether on the consumer, merchant or institutional side – have an advantage as they own the interface between the blockchain and the real world across identity, compliance, creditworthiness and more. That's where friction persists – and where economies of scale will decide winners and losers.

To counterbalance this, Circle is trying to both commoditise the rails – by issuing on multiple networks and placing itself in the middle with its cross-chain transfer protocol – and move activity to its network. Similarly, fintechs like Stripe are attempting to migrate volume to networks and assets they control. In doing so, they may use stablecoins as a loss leader and issue domestic stablecoins to expand their advantage to foreign exchange markets and local use cases. Real-world assets and applications that are exclusive to these branded networks may help them retain volume and develop reward and loyalty programmes to increase customer lock-in.

As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different. The good news is that it will be far more useful. And while that may come with more centralisation, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure than under the status quo.

It is also possible that, because crypto allows for new market design, the ultimate solution will be something the internet could not achieve because it lacked built-in monetisation mechanisms. Regardless, if centralisation materialises, developers will undo it and the cycle will repeat.

The UK's Information Commissioner's Office has reprimanded the South Yorkshire Police (SYP) after the force deleted over 96,000 pieces of body-worn video (BWV) evidence.

At the end of each shift, officers' BWV footage was uploaded and stored to a central hub which could be accessed and managed, along with all of SYP's digital evidence, via a secure system.

Following an upgrade in May 2023, the secure system began to struggle processing BWV data and a local drive workaround was put in place.

In August 2023, SYP identified that its BWV file storage was very low, and further investigation found that 96,174 pieces of original footage had been deleted from its system.

The following month, it was found the deletion had taken place on 26 July 2023 and included the loss of data relating to 126 criminal cases. It's been said only three of the cases were impacted by the loss.

Of those three cases, SYP states one may have progressed to the first court hearing if BWV had been available. However, as there was no additional independent evidence to prove the offence, progression to prosecution stage was already uncertain.

Prior to the deletion, 95,033 pieces of BWV footage had been copied to a new system that SYP was implementing but, due to poor record keeping, SYP remain unable to confirm the exact number of files deleted without copies made.

The ICO‘s investigation found that SYP ultimately did not have the appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to keep evidence secure.

This includes poor record keeping, not identifying the security risk in relation to transferring personal data between IT systems, and delaying the formulation of IT backup policies and not escalating to senior management when flaws were discovered.

“This incident highlights the importance of having detailed policies and procedures in place to mitigate against the loss of evidence,” said Sally Anne Poole, head of investigations at the ICO.

“People rightly have high expectations that our police forces and services, which protect us, also protect the personal information they hold.

“There is a lot to be learned from this incident and I encourage police forces and services and other organisation using this type of technology to check and make improvements where they find potential flaws”.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

A new nonprofit organization, supported by industry leaders including Coinbase, Uniswap Labs, and others, launched Tuesday with a shared mission — to educate U.S. policymakers on the rapidly evolving landscape of emerging technologies like crypto and artificial intelligence.

The American Innovation Project (AIP) debuted on Tuesday, committed to helping foster  "dialogue on the policy and technology issues shaping the future of the U.S. economy," according to a statement.

"Our mission is simple, but urgent: we must equip America's leaders with the knowledge, context, and tools they need as they consider timely rules and regulations that meet the moment and account for a rapidly evolving technological landscape,” said Kristin Smith, AIP president and president of Solana Policy Institute, in the statement. “The American Innovation Project was established to foster dialogues regardless of partisan affiliation, so we can bridge divides and work together to move our country forward."

The launch comes amid significant regulatory momentum in Washington. Over the past year, lawmakers and regulators have been steadfast in drafting regulatory frameworks for crypto. Last month, President Donald signed into law a bill to create a federal framework for stablecoins, and the House of Representatives passed a bill to regulate the crypto industry at large. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also embarked on "Project Crypto" to update the agency's rules when it comes to crypto distributions, custody, and trading, among other areas.

AIP said it will host several events, from roundtables to workshops.

"These events will connect policymakers, industry innovators, and subject-matter experts, and be focused on translating complex, emerging technological trends — from artificial intelligence to blockchain infrastructure — into actionable understanding," the organization said.

Several crypto-focused entities are backing AIP, including Kraken, Coinbase, the National Cryptocurrency Association, Paradigm, the Solana Policy Institute, and the Digital Currency Group (DCG). The organization received seed funding from the Cedar Innovation Foundation as well as $1 million from Digital Currency Group, according to the statement.

“The future of the U.S. economy will be shaped by the choices we make today in developing emerging technologies,” said Mark Murphy, president of DCG, in a statement.

U.S. Cuts Antarctica's Only Research Icebreaker Ship under Trump Budget Squeeze

The National Science Foundation will stop operating the Nathaniel B. Palmer icebreaker and slash polar science funding by 70 percent, devastating Antarctic research

Many ships have tried to reach the floating tongue of Thwaites Glacier—a 130-kilometer-wide conveyor belt of ice that slides off West Antarctica's coast and splinters into the sea. Thwaites is rapidly destabilizing, and precise mapping of the seafloor and ocean currents surrounding it are urgently needed to know how much damage the crumbling glacier and resulting sea-level rise could do to coasts worldwide. Only one vessel—the U.S. research icebreaker Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP)—has successfully penetrated the area's phalanx of sea ice and billion-metric-ton icebergs to reach a critical location on Thwaites, widely considered the world's most dangerous glacier. The NBP has made about 200 research cruises to Antarctica in the past 30 years, in many cases reaching places never before visited. But if the Trump administration has its way, this will all come to an end in October.

The NBP's expeditions along remote parts of the Antarctic coast have gathered voluminous data that are critical to U.S. interests. If the Thwaites Glacier were to implode, it could raise the average global sea level by 65 centimeters, and it could potentially trigger wider Antarctic ice sheet collapse that could raise global sea level by more than three meters. Marine science shows that a disproportionate brunt of that rise would inundate the Gulf of Mexico and eastern U.S. coasts. Frequent measurements in Antarctica's remote locations are needed to project how quickly this might happen. Expeditions also monitor marine ecosystems that are rapidly shifting as a result of climate change and affecting the large commercial fisheries in surrounding waters.

Yet Antarctic science experts and officials told me that the administration is imposing such severe budget cuts on the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) that the organization has no realistic option but to terminate its lease for the NBP after 30 years. The U.S. is “losing the only research [icebreaker it has] in the Southern Hemisphere,” says Michael Jackson, the NSF's former section head for Antarctic sciences, who left in December. A replacement vessel—if one is even funded—“will probably take 10 years to build,” he says.

This latest move caps what feels like a major U.S. retreat from Antarctica, says Theodore Scambos, a polar glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. For 27 years, the U.S. had operated two research icebreakers in the region. But in 2024 NSF dropped its lease for the smaller of the two craft because of budget shortfalls. That and the impending loss of the NBP marks “a general decline of America in the science and exploration fields,” Scambos says. “And I hate that.”

This loss will have widespread consequences, according to a wide range of scientists, logistics experts, former NSF officials and former diplomats interviewed for this story. It will hamstring U.S. influence in the Antarctic at a time when geopolitical competition and resource exploitation are intensifying in the region. It will also undermine scientists' ability to monitor rapid changes in Thwaites and other remote areas—at the very moment climate impacts on the continent are accelerating.

Researchers first learned of the NBP's situation on May 30, when the Trump administration released its full fiscal year 2026 budget request for NSF to Congress. The termination was buried in a single sentence on page 102 of the 222-page document. The budget request also stipulated a 70 percent funding cut for polar science research projects overall. “None of us saw that coming,” says Patricia Yager, a polar marine biologist at the University of Georgia, who called the move “shocking.” In response to a request for comment from Scientific American, an NSF spokesperson confirmed via e-mail that NSF had proposed terminating the lease of the NBP in Trump's 2026 fiscal year budget request but provided little additional information.

Although the U.S. Coast Guard has three icebreakers—Polar Star, Healy and the newly commissioned Storis, a former commercial icebreaker—none can fill NBP's role. Healy is continually committed to Arctic duties; sending it to Antarctica and back to do even a single day of scientific work would require 60 days of travel. Storis, which has a troubled history, will also be used in the Arctic. And Polar Star is simply not equipped for the kind of research the NBP does.

“The Palmer is the most amazing research tool that we have; there's nothing like it anywhere in the world,” Yager says. It can plow through meter-thick sea ice at three knots with little more than gentle side-to-side rocking. And it can remain at sea for 65 days, a vital capability given that a round trip to Thwaites takes nearly two weeks from the nearest port. Waiting for vast rafts of sea ice and icebergs to shift and open a passage can add many more days.

When the NBP is in Antarctic waters, it continuously collects data. Multibeam sonar captures a three-dimensional map of the seafloor, revealing features such as undersea canyons that influence the stability of coastal glaciers. Another sonar system traces sediment layers below the seafloor, which can provide important records of past climate periods. Even in rough seas and high winds, the ship's dynamic positioning system allows it to hover within a few feet of its intended location while technicians do the delicate work of collecting sediment cores or piloting remote-operated submersibles on the seafloor.

The NBP can carry and launch two helicopters, which proved decisive during a 2010 cruise, allowing researchers to leapfrog over impassable sea ice and install instruments for monitoring crustal movements and glacial retreat as far as 200 kilometers away.

The impending loss of the NBP means five Antarctic missions, slated for October 2025 through April 2026, now hang in limbo. The NSF is scrambling for ways to salvage at least some of them. For example, the agency might send the University of Alaska Fairbanks's Arctic research vessel Sikuliaq all the way down to Antarctica in January to perform a major ecological survey that has been conducted annually since 1999. The survey covers 2,000 kilometers along the Antarctic Peninsula's coast and out past the lip of the continental shelf. It measures the abundance of krill and phytoplankton—which anchor the region's ecosystem—and monitors deep ocean currents. In recent decades this survey has revealed important changes in ocean mixing that have caused the winter sea ice season in this relatively temperate section of Antarctica to shorten by roughly 100 days a year.

But the Sikuliaq is already in high demand in the Arctic, for up to a dozen expeditions per year. And compared with the NBP, it has fewer berths for scientists, can spend fewer days at sea and has more limited ice-breaking capabilities—effectively excluding it from Thwaites and other heavily iced sections of the Antarctic coastline.

A few other countries have research icebreakers, including the U.K., Germany, Australia, South Korea and China. It is possible that a couple U.S. researchers could occasionally find ride-along spots. But that may not advance U.S. research priorities, Scambos says: “You're not going to get somebody else's icebreaker to bring you and 20 of your colleagues and undertake a major mission that has U.S. research interest behind it.” The NSF spokesperson stated that the agency “has started the process to identify vessels and partnerships to continue support of marine science.”

A new icebreaker that would eventually replace the NBP is in early design stages, but it would take a decade to build. The work on this new Antarctic research vessel has been moving slowly for a variety of reasons, even prior to the start of the current Trump administration. The NSF spokesperson stated that the agency “has paused source selection activities” for the next stage of development.

Since the 1950s the U.S. has maintained a larger scientific presence on the Antarctic continent than any other nation, by way of research stations, ships, remote air transport and exploratory teams that drive vehicles in long traverses across the ice sheet. For now, NSF plans to try to keep operating the three U.S. land bases in Antarctica—the Palmer, McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott South Pole stations—because the harsh environment would cause them to rapidly deteriorate if they were not staffed.

But spending an ensuing decade without a research icebreaker could have major geopolitical consequences. Antarctica is Earth's largest remaining territory not unilaterally controlled by any particular nation. The U.S. has long backed the Antarctic Treaty, under which nations set aside any territorial land claims they've made and reserve the continent for scientific research. If international commitment to the treaty ever faltered, however, nations might pursue territorial claims on the continent, and those claims would be bolstered by having maintained research stations, communications hubs, deep water ports and air transport and driving routes. “Operations and logistics are 100 percent necessary for U.S. national security interests,” says William Muntean III, a former senior adviser for Antarctic affairs and a deputy representative for the U.S. State Department to the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

The scientific research conducted there is a fundamental part of that equation. “In the Antarctic Treaty System,” Muntean says, “knowledge is what equals power.” That's because the rules of play for Antarctica and its surrounding seas are constantly negotiated and monitored by more than two dozen countries with research stations there—and any negotiations become especially heated when it comes to resource extraction. For years commercial vessels have plied the coastal seas for Antarctic toothfish (sold in restaurants as “sea bass”) and krill. The U.S. and a handful of other countries have sought to establish several marine protected areas around the continent where fishing would be prohibited, but they have encountered resistance from Russia and China. Negotiations often hinge on data collected from research vessels, such as those that document changes in ecosystems. In this way, Muntean says, “knowing what is actually happening in Antarctica gives a country the ability to then influence” what happens.

Right now the NBP remains moored at the main pier in Punta Arenas in southern Chile—its standard departure point for Antarctica. The ship's fate is on hold until early September, when Congress returns from recess. “The budget request is always just a policy document,” says Alexandra Isern, a former assistant director of the NSF. In the NSF's pending request, she says, the Trump administration is putting “a line in the sand” for what it wants.

Funding bills that were sitting in Congress before recess add confusion. Senate bill 2354, which passed out of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies in mid-July, appears to restore full funding to the NSF. The corresponding House bill restores roughly two thirds of the proposed cuts. Isern says “members [of Congress] are big supporters of the Antarctic program,” but neither of those bills mentions the NBP or the new icebreaker intended to replace it. Jackson fears that Congress will cave to pressure from the Trump administration and neither the NBP nor the other polar research funding will be saved.

In the meantime, polar researchers across the U.S. continue to prepare for science missions that may or may not happen. Some have already shipped their scientific gear south to Chile in case their cruise happens after all. Others will have to do so in the coming weeks, before Congress returns.

Amid the uncertainty, Oscar Schofield, a biological oceanographer at Rutgers University, sees a clear message. The administration is already stripping climate data from government websites, preparing to halt EPA regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and quietly discussing plans to scuttle a state-of-the-art NASA satellite that monitors carbon dioxide—allowing the spacecraft to burn up in the atmosphere. Canceling the NBP, he says, looks like “a political decision of not wanting to support climate change research.”

In this decision, Schofield sees an important lever of soft power being abandoned. “Since World War II,” he says, “there was always a strong belief that if the U.S. had the strongest scientists and the strongest engineers, it would serve national security.” Those generational investments, he says, are now being undone.

Using dirt as a construction material could help make one of the biggest carbon-emitting sectors significantly greener.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Building a new home isn't cheap—financially or environmentally. 

While many countries need to build fast to address the ongoing housing crisis, all of that building would come with a major environmental toll. A 2022 estimate by MIT Climate states that constructing a single house creates 15 to 100 tons of CO2, and a lot of that carbon comes from concrete, which requires high temperatures powered by fossil fuels to create. While valiant efforts have been made to clean up concrete and cement production, the industry is still one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters globally. 

This unfortunate truth has inspired some engineers to think outside the box in order to help close the gap between needed housing and environmental sustainability. Recycled timber is a popular alternative building material, as trees naturally sequester carbon, so you're basically building with atmospheric carbon. Another route is industrial-scale 3D printing, which requires less labor and also produces less waste. Granted, most 3D-printed homes still rely on some form of concrete mix (including cement, sand, gravel, and aggregates). But now, companies are trying to 3D-build with a different kind of extruded material—local soil. 

In July, the Japanese architectural firm Lib Work announced the successful construction of the “Lib Earth House Model B,” which is a 1,000 square-foot home constructed entirely from soil—no concrete required. Lib Work claims that the Model B (built in Yamaga, Kumamoto Prefecture) is five times stronger than the previous model, which was constructed earlier this year. The company also used a novel approach to the construction by integrating generative AI into the design process. According to Archinect, Lib Work is the world's first fully automated home construction system. 

“We have succeeded in developing a sustainable earthen wall made entirely from earth and natural materials, without using any cement,” according to the company's website, translated from Japanese. “This is not just a house, but a challenge to rethink the very way we live.”

Of course, this house features more than just walls made of soil. An in-wall condensation detection system constantly monitors for deterioration, and the home is fully off the grid, relying on solar panels and a Tesla Powerwall battery for energy. The home is also fully remote controlled through a smartphone app. 

Lib Work isn't the first architecture company to investigate ways to use soil as a building material. In 2021, for example, Mario Cucinella Architects in Bologna, Italy, partnered with the 3D-printer manufacturer WASP (which also worked with Lib Work on the Model B) to create a clay-based construction material derived from local soil. Although the drying process took longer than other quick-dry concrete products, the material allowed for increased flexibility in terms of construction location. 

Building affordable housing and limiting greenhouse gas emissions will require innovative solutions—from broader city planning to home construction. Increased housing density can help keep utility bills low and limit reliance on cars, while sustainable materials can build homes without adding to humanity's growing CO2 budget. With entire neighborhoods being constructed using 3D-printing in the U.S. and around the world, homes like the Model B could a win-win solution for communities and the climate.

Forest age transitions are critical in shaping the global carbon balance, yet their influence on carbon stocks and fluxes remains poorly quantified. Here we analyse global forest age dynamics from 2010 to 2020 using the Global Age Mapping Integration v2.0 dataset, alongside satellite-derived aboveground carbon (AGC) and atmospheric inversion-derived net CO2 flux data. We reveal widespread declines in forest age across the Amazon, Congo Basin, Southeast Asia and parts of Siberia, primarily driven by stand-replacing disturbances such as fire and harvest, leading to the replacement of older forests by younger stands. Meanwhile, forests in China, Europe and North America experienced net ageing. Globally, stand replacement resulted in substantial AGC losses, with old forests (>200 years, ~98.0 MgC ha−1) transitioning to younger, carbon-poor stands (<20 years, ~43.5 MgC ha−1), leading to a net AGC loss of ~0.14 PgC per year. Despite this, regions with high rates of young stands replacing old forests exhibited a temporary strengthening of the carbon sink, driven by the rapid regrowth of these young stands. Crucially, these young forests do not compensate for the long-term carbon storage of old forests. Our findings underscore the importance of protecting old forests while optimizing forest management strategies to maximize carbon gains and enhance climate mitigation.

Key international initiatives, such as the Forest and Land Use Declaration at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26)1, the EU's Nature Restoration Law2, and the Regulation on Deforestation-Free Products3, highlight the critical role of forests in global climate mitigation. In this study, forests encompass natural forests, managed stands and planted tree cover (for example, agroforestry, tree crop and plantations), characterized by at least 5 metres height4. Forests are essential to Earth's carbon cycle, acting as carbon sinks by absorbing about −3.5 ± 0.4 (where − denotes a net carbon gain) petagrams of carbon annually (PgC per year) in the 2010s5. Effectively managing and conserving these forests is crucial for mitigating climate change, especially given the decline in forest resilience under climate change6.

Several processes, including deforestation, degradation, afforestation, natural disturbances, management practices and regrowth, influence the distribution of forest ages worldwide7. These factors, in turn, affect the forests' capacity to sequester carbon8. European forests, for instance, have consistently acted as carbon sinks9 due to their recovery from extensive clear-cutting after World War II10. Their growth exceeds harvest removals and natural mortality9,11, although the European carbon sink has shown a recent decline12. In regions such as the Amazon Basin, old forests were once ‘hotspots' of younger forests, shaped substantially by ancient civilization activities13. Recent regional transformations have created a diverse mosaic of forest age classes (Fig. 1a,b). Complex interactions between stand-replacement events, regrowth following disturbances, afforestation and the natural ageing of established forests drive shifts in forest age distributions. These factors collectively contribute to ecological transformations in forest landscapes. Yet the implications of these changes on the global carbon cycle remain unresolved14.

a,b, Average forest age for 2010 and 2020 at a one-degree pixel resolution (a) and the total area of each forest age class for 2010 (blue) and 2020 (green) (b). The total area represents the median values across the 20 ensemble members, with error bars in b indicating the 5% and 95% quantiles of the total area across the ensemble. c, The forest age difference map between 2020 and 2010, relative to the expected 10-year ageing. This map was calculated by subtracting ten years from the difference between 2020 and 2010. A value of zero indicates that forests have aged as expected over the decade, consistent with the gradual maturation of undisturbed forests. Positive values indicate slower-than-expected ageing or ageing stagnation, potentially due to disturbances. By contrast, negative values reflect forests becoming younger, probably due to stand replacement, disturbances or shifts in forest composition favouring younger stands. In a and c, the median estimates across the 20 ensemble members are shown. One-degree grid cells with less than 20% forest cover have been masked.

Traditional methods, such as national forest inventories and research plot measurements, offer valuable insights into local forests but have limited spatial and temporal coverage. Several factors constrain their effectiveness, including the absence, complexity or limited availability of sample-based inventories in many regions, the infrequency of repeated measurements and the variability in what they measure. These limitations hinder their ability to comprehensively capture global forest dynamics. Atmospheric CO2 flux estimates from inversion techniques offer an integrated view of biosphere–atmosphere carbon exchange, considering various sources and sinks across different spatial and temporal scales. Yet, their coarse spatial resolution, typically around 110 km, limits their ability to distinguish between forests and non-forests or accurately capture the different dynamics of forests. Additionally, uncertainty in atmospheric transport models and the lack of measurement stations in certain regions limit their regional accuracy15. Efforts to map forest age at global and regional levels have been made16,17,18, but these typically result in static snapshots of forest age distribution. A few satellite-derived maps monitor temporal changes in forest age, but these are limited in space and can only monitor forests since the beginning of the Landsat era19,20. This limitation impedes our ability to effectively track and understand temporal changes in forest age across all age classes.

Using the Global Age Mapping Integration v2.0 (GAMIv2.0) dataset16,21 (Methods), our study analyses changes in forest age distribution from 2010 to 2020 and their implications for the carbon cycle. We integrate forest age maps with independent atmospheric CO2 inversion flux data from the Global Carbon Project22 and European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) satellite-based biomass maps23. Our analysis examines how shifts in forest age, caused by rejuvenation from natural disturbances and clear-cutting, and the natural ageing of established forests affect the net carbon balance. The study has three main objectives: (1) to map global changes in forest age distribution over the last decade, (2) to infer the impact of replacing older, carbon-rich forests with younger ones on the net carbon balance, and (3) to hypothesize the effects of these shifts on aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks under a (1) business-as-usual (BAU) forest management and (2) forest conservation scenario. Our findings highlight the interplay between forest age dynamics and the global carbon cycle, emphasizing the need for strategic, targeted forest management and informed policies to optimize the role of forests in climate change mitigation.

We analysed forest age distribution shifts from 2010 to 2020 using the GAMIv2.0 dataset (Fig. 1a). We focused on this period due to the availability of ESA-CCI biomass data (2010, 2017–2020) and the rising pressure on forests over the past decade24,25. Age classes were defined based on ecological stages (Table 1). From 2010 to 2020, global forest age shifts (Fig. 1b) were driven by stand replacement and the gradual ageing of established forests (definition in Table 2). Mature (81–200 years) forests increased by \(+{0.08}_{+0.05}^{+0.11}\) billion hectares \((+{8.0}_{+4.4}^{+12.6} \% )\), whereas young (1–20 years), maturing (21–80 years) and old forests (>200 years) declined by \(-{0.04}_{-0.08}^{-0.01}\) billion hectares \((-{5.2}_{-12.0}^{-1.5} \% ),-{0.02}_{-0.05}^{+0.05}\) billion hectares (\(-{2.7}_{-7.4}^{+7.4} \%\)) and \(-{0.03}_{-0.04}^{-0.02}\) billion hectares (\(-{2.6}_{-3.3}^{-2.1} \%\)), respectively (Extended Data Table 1). Regional variations are noteworthy, though (Extended Data Fig. 1). For instance, the total area of young forests increased in Eurasian boreal from \({0.039}_{0.038}^{0.042}\) billion hectares in 2010 to \({0.058}_{0.058}^{0.059}\) billion hectares in 2020 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). By contrast, young forests remained relatively stable in European forests, with approximately \({0.036}_{0.032}^{0.042}\) billion hectares in 2010 and \({0.037}_{0.035}^{0.041}\) billion hectares in 2020 (Extended Data Fig. 1d). This stability suggests a balance between young forests maturing into older age classes and stand-replacement processes despite ongoing disturbances26. GAMIv2.0 estimates this relationship using a nonlinear model that considers the effects of local biogeographic and climatic conditions, enabling the representation of non-monotonic biomass accumulation across age classes (Extended Data Fig. 2). However, our analysis does not fully capture the impact of forest management practices on the forest age–biomass relationship. Consequently, shifts between age classes may be biased, especially in regions with substantial management influence on forest dynamics (Supplementary Fig. 1). To address this, we binned the age classes by 20 years, which smooths out variability and reduces sensitivity to errors in age estimation. Whereas this approach captures broader trends and minimizes noise from management-induced variations, it may mask the finer-scale impacts of different management practices. Therefore, more comprehensive forest management data are crucial to enhancing the accuracy and reliability of these models.

The reduction in young forests is probably due to their progression to older stages, outpacing the development of young forests through frequent forest clearings and afforestation. Additionally, the saturation of afforestation programmes in countries such as China27, initiated in the 1980s and 1990s, and the possible exhaustion of old forests suitable for cutting in Southeast Asia due to increased protection efforts28 may have contributed to this reduction. We observe an increase in the global area of forests aged between 21 and 40 years by approximately +0.03 billion hectares (+17%) over 2010–2020 (Extended Data Table 1). The increase could be a response to prior variations in natural or human-induced disturbances, such as clear-cutting, leading initially to an increase in this age class. These dynamics indicate a more complex forest regrowth pattern29, where young forests mature and recover from earlier disturbances. Multiple factors, including the natural ageing of younger forests, enhanced conservation efforts and a shift towards sustainable practices such as thinning, probably drive the increase in mature forests. Additionally, land abandonment and migration to urban areas may indirectly contribute to this trend. The decline of old forests is alarming because it suggests the loss of the oldest and most ecologically valuable forest stands, vital for their substantial carbon storage capabilities and rich biodiversity. These forests not only sequester large amounts of carbon but also enhance the recovery and growth of nearby degraded forests through processes such as seed dispersal and the creation of stable microclimates20. This underscores the critical importance of preserving old forests.

Beyond global changes in forest age distribution (Fig. 1b), we identified contrasting local and regional forest age transitions (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). In regions such as Amazonia, the Congo Basin and Southeast Asia, marked decreases in forest age were evident, with variations at the one-degree pixel level showing up to 30% changes since 2010. Specifically, forests in South America and tropical Asia experienced net age decreases of \(-{4.7}_{-6.2}^{-3.4}\) years (mean age of \({251.9}_{237.2}^{260.2}\) years in 2010, shifting to \({247.1}_{233.9}^{254.3}\) years in 2020) and \(-{7.3}_{-10.0}^{-5.0}\) years (mean age of \({139.4}_{121.2}^{152.5}\) years in 2010, shifting to \({132.4}_{116.4}^{142.3}\) years in 2020), respectively (Supplementary Table 1). This trend is primarily attributed to increasing stand-replacing disturbances and mortality30,31, indicating a shift towards younger forest stands and the replacement of old forests. Traditional activities such as slash-and-burn agriculture also contributed to this trend in the Amazon Basin32. Whereas young forests grow faster27, their regrowth does not fully compensate for the carbon loss from older forests28. Transitions to younger stands often involve associated emissions fluxes—from direct emissions due to fire to delayed emissions resulting from increased substrate availability following the harvest of litter. In North America, especially in the Pacific Northwest, a mosaic of older stands and areas of stand replacement followed by regrowth is evident, probably influenced by clear-cutting, a high-burning frequency regime and other natural disturbances, such as insect outbreaks33. Forests in the North American boreal region experienced a net age increase of \(+{8.9}_{+8.8}^{+9.0}\) years (mean age of \({101.6}_{85.7}^{111.9}\) years in 2010, shifting to \({110.5}_{94.6}^{120.7}\) years in 2020). The age increase is only marginally lower than the expected net ten-year increase if no disturbances have occurred. It suggests that disturbances were relatively limited in this region, allowing the forests to age naturally. We also observed that local patches of Canadian forests were getting younger, probably related to recent fire activity34. These localized disturbances indicate that while the overall impact on forest ageing was minimal, specific areas experienced substantial shifts in forest age distribution. Siberian forests, suspected to harbour an important fraction of the global carbon sink12, predominantly sustained their older age class (that is, forests in Eurasian boreal regions showed a mean age of \({108.0}_{89.0}^{116.5}\) years in 2010, shifting to a mean age of \({113.6}_{95.1}^{122.0}\) years in 2020). However, substantial transitions towards younger forests (approximately 0.09 billion hectares, 7.2% of the Eurasia boreal region) indicate localized impacts from logging, increased wildfire events35 and tree recruitment failure after fire36.

In China, extensive reforestation and afforestation programs since the 1980s37 have led to substantial shifts in the forest age, with younger planted forests maturing. As part of these large-scale afforestation efforts, the forest area in southern China increased from 9% to 35% between 1986 and 2018, reflecting a marked expansion in forest cover following the implementation of these policies37. These efforts have contributed to the overall net ageing of forests in Eurasia temperate by \(+{7.7}_{+6.4}^{+8.2}\) years, from a mean age of \({44.5}_{36.5}^{53.2}\) years in 2010 to \({52.5}_{42.9}^{60.4}\) years in 2020 (Supplementary Table 1). In southwestern Australia, frequent wildfires have led to younger age classes, probably due to increased turnover or the severity of recent fire events34. Overall, forests in Australia aged by \(+{2.1}_{-0.3}^{+3.4}\) years (a mean age of \({67.7}_{55.8}^{88.0}\) years in 2010, shifting to a mean age of \({69.9}_{57.9}^{87.7}\) years in 2020). This suggests that while fire events have caused localized rejuvenation, other areas have aged relatively undisturbed. Conversely, the Miombo woodlands have maintained consistent fire regimes34, resulting in relatively unchanged turnover and gross primary productivity38. This stability indicates an adaptation to the prevailing fire regime, which preserves the understory and maintains the overall forest structure. In South America, forests outside the Amazonia, such as the Atlantic forests, have experienced a decrease in native forest cover due to human activities and disturbances. However, recent conservation efforts have led to some recovery39. This combination of factors has resulted in a slight net age increase in the temperate forests of South America by \(+{3.9}_{+1.2}^{+6.3}\) years (mean age of \({87.4}_{51.6}^{110.1}\) years in 2010, shifting to a mean age of \({91.0}_{57.7}^{110.5}\) years in 2020).

European forests, covering around 33% of the continent, are experiencing complex age dynamics due to management and natural disturbances, such as fire, drought and insect outbreaks since 201040,41. Despite these disturbances, forests are generally ageing (mean age of \({81.5}_{72.1}^{91.2}\) years in 2010, shifting to a mean age of \({89.5}_{80.3}^{98.9}\) years in 2020, that is, \(+{8.0}_{+7.7}^{+8.2}\) years), except in areas such as Portugal, where large fires have led to younger forests34. Climate-induced disturbances and subsequent salvage logging substantially impact northern and central Europe's boreal coniferous and dry forests in the Iberian Peninsula42. Consistent management and stable harvest rates43 suggest that drastic forest age shifts due to human management are unlikely. However, intensified disturbances or increased harvesting could alter the future age structure of European forests, potentially amplifying the reported saturation of the European forest carbon sink44. The net ageing trend in Eurasian boreal forests (that is, forests aged by \(+{5.7}_{+5.4}^{+6.2}\) years), especially in western Russia, is mainly due to large-scale forest abandonment since 1990, a scale surpassing the European forest area45.

Our analysis of global forest age shifts reveals distinct regional patterns, with a mix of undisturbed ageing (Fig. 2a) (\({3.21}_{2.84}^{3.46}\) billion hectares) and stand-replaced forests (Fig. 2b) (\({0.23}_{0.16}^{0.31}\) billion hectares) (Table 2 provides definitions, and Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4 provide a summary of statistics). This variation across regions underscores the complex interplay (Supplementary Fig. 2) of natural processes and human influences (Fig. 2d) in shaping the age distributions of forests. Regionally, stand-replaced forests cover the largest absolute areas in tropical Asia (\({0.26}_{0.22}^{0.28}\) of total stand-replaced forest fraction, \({0.059}_{0.040}^{0.070}\) billion hectares), northern Africa (\({0.22}_{0.11}^{0.25}\) of total stand-replaced forest fraction, \({0.048}_{0.018}^{0.067}\) billion hectares) and South America tropical (\({0.11}_{0.10}^{0.13}\) of total stand-replaced forest fraction, \({0.026}_{0.020}^{0.030}\) billion hectares) (Supplementary Table 3). By contrast, undisturbed ageing forests are primarily located in South America tropical (\({0.20}_{0.20}^{0.21}\) of total undisturbed ageing forest fraction, \({0.64}_{0.63}^{0.64}\) billion hectares), Eurasia boreal (\({0.17}_{0.17}^{0.17}\) of total undisturbed ageing forest fraction, \({0.54}_{0.54}^{0.54}\) billion hectares), Europe (\({0.10}_{0.10}^{0.11}\) of total undisturbed ageing forest fraction, \({0.32}_{0.32}^{0.32}\) billion hectares) and North America temperate (\({0.092}_{0.090}^{0.092}\) of total undisturbed ageing forest fraction, \({0.29}_{0.28}^{0.29}\) billion hectares) (Supplementary Table 3), primarily characterized by a mix of forests often subject to management (for example, selective harvesting) and unmanaged forests (Fig. 1d). Due to its vast forest extent, South America tropical contains substantial absolute areas of both stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forests, making both classes particularly prevalent in the region.

a,b, Spatial distribution of undisturbed ageing (a) and stand-replaced forest fraction (b) at one-degree pixel size. c,d, The forest age pre-stand-replacement (c) and the total area of forest management types46 (d) are also shown across the 11 TRANSCOM-land regions (Supplementary Fig. 3). Unmanaged/intact forests are regenerating forests without any signs of management (including primary forests). Naturally regenerated forests are forests that have regenerated without signs of management (for example, logging, clear-cuts). Plantation forests are considered to have a rotation time of up to 15 years. In a–c, the median estimates of the 20 members are shown. The error bars in c represent the 5th and 95th percentiles of the forest age pre-stand-replacement quantiles across the 20 members. One-degree grid cells with less than 20% forest cover have been masked. NA, North American; SA, South America.

Boreal forests typically have an average pre-stand-replacement age of approximately 120 years (\({123.75}_{99.51}^{132.48}\) years and \({113.05}_{96.00}^{122.79}\) years for Eurasia boreal and North American boreal, respectively) (Fig. 2c). By contrast, forests in the Northern Hemisphere's temperate regions are replaced at younger ages. Management in these temperate regions, which usually involves naturally regenerated and planted forests, results in an average replacement age of \({94.50}_{78.94}^{102.87}\) years in Europe and \({95.74}_{80.64}^{101.63}\) years in North America (Fig. 2c). This variability is influenced by regional rotation lengths, with areas such as northern Spain, Portugal (that is, fast-growing species, such as Eucalyptus, feed into fast rotation forestry projects), Les Landes, Sweden and Finland having shorter rotation periods (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). By contrast, other forests are harvested at an age over 100 years (Extended Data Fig. 3c). We observed short regeneration cycles in Eurasia's temperate (\({33.55}_{21.84}^{39.58}\) years) and South American temperate (\({58.07}_{38.46}^{75.47}\) years) forests. This forest age pre-stand replacement is probably influenced by frequent fires34 and plantation forestry in these regions (Fig. 2d), where the typical rotation period is up to 15 years (ref. 46). In the South American tropics, stand replacement often occurs in older forests, averaging \({190.71}_{166.29}^{215.73}\) years, including old forests over 300 years old, usually characterized by continuous recruitment, though with considerable local variation. The age variability before stand-replacement in South America's tropical region suggests a mix of deforested old forests and young secondary forests harvested and burned before maturity20 or part of a slash-and-burn agricultural system32. The scenario is more complex in northern (\({91.97}_{78.28}^{106.22}\) years) and southern (\({78.92}_{65.99}^{97.57}\) years) Africa regions, which experienced rapid replacement of young forests. These regions experience regular disturbances, primarily from fires34, which can rapidly replace young forests. However, these fires do not always lead to complete stand replacement. Instead, they often leave some trees unburned, especially in lower-intensity or sub-canopy fires. Additionally, in some forest ecosystems, the lower tree density per hectare in certain areas47 may limit the fire severity, reducing the likelihood of complete stand replacement. This highlights post-fire regeneration processes that differ from those of stand-replacing fires, allowing some trees to survive and creating a mix of age structures within the forests.

We observe a distinctive spatial pattern in the distribution of stand-replaced forests across various age classes as of 2010 (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). Forests that were already young (that is 0–20 years) before stand replacement—covering \({0.14}_{0.083}^{0.20}\) billion hectares and accounting for \({58.97}_{46.14}^{66.55}\)% of all stand-replaced forests— are broadly distributed but primarily concentrated in tropical regions (for example, South America's tropics, tropical Asia and northern Africa) and the Eurasian temperate zone (Fig. 3a). This widespread area of young forests being replaced by new stands suggests a high turnover rate, probably driven by plantations (Fig. 2d) and natural disturbances, such as fire events. Maturing forests (that is 20–80 years) replaced by younger stands constitute \({12.51}_{9.97}^{15.96}\)% of the total stand-replaced forest areas. Mature forests (that is 81–200 years) that have undergone stand replacement, where younger stands have replaced previously mature forests, account for \({14.45}_{10.58}^{18.86}\)% of the total stand-replaced forest area. Their distribution (Extended Data Fig. 3c) is sparser than that of younger forests, with large but dispersed patches in regions such as North American, European and Siberian forests. This pattern may indicate less frequent replacement events in mature forests, suggesting a period of relative stability or reduced human influence (Fig. 2d). Old forests (that is >200 years) were the least likely to undergo stand replacement, representing only \({14.38}_{11.78}^{19.92}\)% of the total and are primarily located in tropical regions (Extended Data Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 6a). By contrast, forests undisturbed during the study period display a more balanced distribution across different age classes: young (\({19.01}_{16.56}^{20.59}\)%), maturing (\({18.71}_{16.22}^{20.76}\)%), mature (\(3{0.80}_{26.30}^{32.98}\)%) and old forests (\({32.23}_{30.06}^{34.41}\)%) (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Fig. 3b).

a,b, Total area (in billion hectares) of stand-replaced (a) and undisturbed ageing forests (b) per age class across the 11 TRANSCOM-land regions (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Using the ESA-CCI biomass map for 202023, we observe apparent differences in AGC stocks where younger stands replaced carbon-rich older forests from 2010 to 2020 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 5). After replacement, the AGC stock of stand-replaced forests varies by prior age class: ~2.3 MgC ha−1 in young forests, increasing to 15.2 MgC ha−1 in maturing forests, 31.1 MgC ha−1 in mature and peaking at 31.9 MgC ha−1 in old forests. These differences reflect two main factors. First, not all biomass is lost during stand-replacement—legacy trees and residual carbon often remain, especially in partially disturbed areas. Second, younger stands replacing old forests usually grow faster due to nutrient-rich soils, existing seed banks and structural legacies, with open canopies enhancing light availability and promoting rapid regrowth48 (Extended Data Fig. 6).

The stand-replaced categories represent the AGC stock of forests at a given age class (young, maturing, mature or old) before stand replacement. b, Net carbon changes for stand-replaced forests across different forest age categories. In a and b, the median values from the 20 biomass realizations are displayed, and the spread represents the spatial variation within a given age class. c, The relationship between the fraction of old forests replaced by young stands (that is, stand-replacement extent) and changes in NEE from inversions between circa 2020 (average of 2019–2021) and 2010 (average of 2009–2011) is shown. The dark solid line represents the linear regression on the ensemble estimates, whereas the dashed grey lines indicate the regressions for the nine individual atmospheric inversion models. One-degree grid cells with less than 20% forest cover have been masked. To smooth the spatial distribution of net CO2 fluxes, we applied a Gaussian filter (length = 500 km, equivalent to approximately four one-degree pixels). This smoothing technique reduces noise in the data and helps minimize the influence of local transport errors. To minimize noise and regional variability due to atmospheric transport errors, all spatial data were aggregated using area-weighted averaging over 5 × 5 grid cells (that is, a coarsening scale of 5° × 5°).

Undisturbed ageing forests store substantially more carbon than recently disturbed ones across all age classes (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 7): ~23.8 MgC ha−1 in young forests, 29.5 MgC ha−1 in maturing forests, 50.5 MgC ha−1 in mature forests and 77.8 MgC ha−1 in old forests. The comparable carbon storage capacity in stand-replaced and undisturbed mature forests suggests that stand replacement often involves partial rather than complete biomass removal through selective logging or natural disturbance. Whereas the GAMIv2.0 product does not capture small-scale degradation or mortality effects, the ESA-CCI biomass map partially reflects these dynamics. This may explain the limited AGC gap observed in mature forests across disturbance types. However, ESA-CCI biomass data also have limitations, particularly in the calibration of AGC estimates from remote sensing observations, as the sensitivity of satellite-derived AGC retrievals decreases with increasing biomass, contributing to uncertainty in high-biomass forests49.

Evaluating total carbon stocks across forest age classes (Supplementary Table 5) reveals that old, undisturbed forests store \({127.39}_{99.20}^{155.14}\) PgC. Conversely, young forests, including those that replaced older stands (\({1.85}_{1.35}^{3.17}\) PgC) and undisturbed ageing forests (\({17.99}_{16.02}^{21.32}\) PgC), collectively stored approximately 20 PgC in 2020 (approximately 9% of the total AGC stocks in 2020). Maturing and mature, undisturbed ageing forests cover large areas (Fig. 3b), substantially contributing to total forest AGC stocks (\({31.29}_{26.40}^{35.68}\) PgC and \({60.51}_{47.32}^{79.34}\) PgC, respectively). The total global AGC stock in 2020 was estimated at ~\({235.75}_{192.50}^{286.11}\) PgC in 2020, aligning with independent datasets but substantially lower than previous estimates5 (~371.5 PgC), probably due to differences in disturbance representation, belowground biomass inclusion and forest definition (for example, a 20% forest fraction filter was applied in our study).

The transition from carbon-rich old forests to younger forests, resulting from stand replacement, substantially reduces the overall carbon storage of these ecosystems (Fig. 4b) and ecosystem function50. Between 2010 and 2020, forests undergoing stand replacement lost \(+{0.38}_{+0.35}^{+0.46}\) PgC yr−1 (where + denotes loss of AGC) (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Despite covering only a small fraction of the global forest area (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3 ), these forests disproportionately influenced AGC losses, particularly where old forests were replaced by young stands, contributing to 0.10–0.16 PgC yr−1 of global AGC loss (~1% of total forest area).

Despite the initial loss of AGC following stand replacement, young forests often transition quickly to a net carbon sink51. This is reflected in a significant correlation between the fraction of old forests (>200 years) replaced by young stands (<20 years) and the 10-year trend in net ecosystem exchange (NEE), based on GAMIv2.0 data and atmospheric inversion estimates from nine Global Carbon Budget 2023 (GCB2023) inversion models22 (Fig. 4c) (R2 = 0.28, slope =−34.32 gC m−2 yr−1 per % yr−1, P < 0.05, N = 134). The negative slope indicates that for each 1% annual increase in the fraction of old forests replaced by young forests, the carbon sink strengthens by 34.32 gC m−2 yr−1. This suggests that regions with a higher proportion of old forests replaced by young forests tend to exhibit a stronger carbon sink. However, this pattern should not be misinterpreted as an argument in favour of stand replacement. The strong carbon sink observed in these areas primarily results from the long, undisturbed period before stand replacement, during which old forests accumulated large amounts of carbon and created conditions that facilitate rapid regrowth52. The time since the previous-to-last disturbance has a critical role in shaping carbon sink strength, as long-undisturbed forests develop favourable soil conditions, structural complexity and nutrient availability that enhance post-disturbance regrowth.

It is also essential to recognize the limitations of this analysis. At the spatial resolution of current atmospheric inversion models (~1°), it is beyond our capacity to disentangle NEE trends across all four age classes robustly. This limitation is particularly pronounced in regions with mixed-age forests and intensive management, where inversion signals integrate fluxes across diverse stand conditions. Whereas exploratory correlations by age class are presented in Extended Data Fig. 8a–c, these should be interpreted cautiously. More interpretable signals may emerge in tropical regions, where large areas of old-growth forest have been replaced by younger stands, resulting in more homogeneous age distributions within inversion grid cells. Still, robust separation of age-specific NEE responses remains challenging at this scale. Accordingly, our main interpretation focuses on the consistent NEE signal linked to old-to-young forest transitions in these areas (Extended Data Fig. 3d), which shows a consistent negative correlation with NEE trends across multiple inversion models (Fig. 4c). Still, broader factors such as CO2 fertilization, temperature shifts and climate variability may also influence NEE trends. While we acknowledge these influences, our analysis isolates the relationship between stand replacement and NEE without attempting to disentangle climate-driven effects.

Young, fast-growing forests can sequester carbon at rates higher than old forests, particularly in tropical regions, where young regrowing forests (<20 years) can absorb CO2 up to 20 times faster than old forests52. Yet they do not recover the AGC stocks of old forests within a meaningful timeframe for climate policy. Complete restoration of species composition can take centuries53,54,55. The ability of forests to accumulate carbon over centuries highlights the importance of preserving old forests, which store far more carbon than young regrowing stands. Although undisturbed ageing forests contribute to long-term carbon storage (Fig. 3b), the net CO2 uptake trends suggest that stand-replacement processes—not just naturally ageing forests—are key drivers of recent flux changes. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that forest harvesting, leading to biomass loss, impacts atmospheric carbon levels in multiple ways. Harvesting does not immediately result in equivalent carbon emissions being released into the atmosphere. Forests continue to assimilate carbon, and the fate of harvested biomass—whether rapidly released through burning, gradually decomposed as coarse woody debris or stored in wood products for a long time—determines the timing and extent of carbon released into the atmosphere. The balance between immediate and delayed carbon release may explain the residuals between the proportion of forests replaced by young stands and net CO2 fluxes (Fig. 4c), which are further influenced by variations in hydrometeorological conditions56.

It is crucial to contextualize the impact of stand replacement on carbon flux dynamics within the broader picture of global forest dynamics. Global forests act as a net carbon sink, particularly in boreal and temperate regions5,57. However, deforestation and land-use conversion increasingly challenge this climate-mitigation role, where forests are permanently lost rather than replaced. In deforestation hotspots, atmospheric inversion data mainly show these areas as net CO2 sources, primarily due to emissions from burning activities. For example, in regions such as the eastern edge of the Amazon, fire-related emissions can exceed the carbon uptake of remaining forests58, reinforcing the dominant role of deforestation in increasing atmospheric CO2. Thus, whereas stand-replacement processes contribute to enhanced CO2 uptake in some regions, they should not be viewed in isolation from the broader issue of forest loss and the protection of old forests. Furthermore, the relationship between old-stand replacement and NEE trends varies across atmospheric inversion models. Whereas five of the nine models indicate a significant negative correlation, others show no clear relationship (Fig. 4c), highlighting uncertainties in top-down CO2 flux estimates59. This variability underscores the need for cautious interpretation when linking stand-replacement processes to regional NEE trends. Nevertheless, the consistent signal across multiple models and spatial windows (Supplementary Fig. 8) supports the conclusion that old forest replacement has been key in shaping recent CO2 flux dynamics.

Our findings emphasize the complex role of forest age transitions in shaping the global carbon balance. Whereas old forests store the highest carbon stocks, young regrowing forests, particularly those replacing old forests, can contribute substantially to CO2 uptake due to rapid biomass accumulation. However, this high sequestration rate primarily results from the favourable conditions left behind by the replaced old forests, including legacy soil carbon, nutrient availability and established seed banks. This does not imply that stand replacement is a viable climate mitigation strategy, as old forests take centuries to develop and cannot be restored within a policy-relevant timeframe. Young forests can never fully replace the long-term carbon storage capacity and ecological functions of old forests. Protecting existing forests remains the most effective and immediate strategy for mitigating climate change60.

To explore the implications of age dynamics for future carbon storage, we projected forest age distributions and AGC stocks to 2050 under two idealized pathways: BAU and a forest conservation scenario that halts stand-replacement after 2030 (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Whereas BAU results in stable AGC stocks due to ongoing turnover, the conservation scenario projects an annual increase in carbon storage of +0.55 to +0.63 PgC yr−1 relative to 2020 levels, primarily in maturing and mature forests. Despite reduced AGC in young stands, total projected AGC by 2050 is higher under conservation (209–306 PgC) than BAU (200–296 PgC), illustrating the mitigation potential of conserving ageing forests. Yet, the modest gain suggests that conservation alone will not be sufficient for achieving large-scale sequestration goals.

It is also crucial to distinguish between young forests emerging from stand replacement and those established through afforestation. Whereas afforestation represents an expansion of forest cover, stand replacement involves the replacement of existing forests, thereby reducing their long-term carbon storage potential. Although afforestation can enhance carbon sequestration27,37, its effectiveness depends on the forest type; planted, homogeneous forests provide fewer benefits for carbon storage, biodiversity and local ecosystem resilience than naturally regenerating forests. Beyond carbon storage, natural forests provide irreplaceable ecosystem and social benefits compared to monoculture plantations. Yet, only 34% of global restoration commitments prioritize natural forests, whereas 45% focus on monocultures61. Our study highlights the need for targeted conservation and forest management policies that strike a balance between preserving old forests and implementing sustainable harvesting and regrowth strategies. We call for targeted management and conservation strategies that carefully consider forest age and type to ensure forests remain functional, land-based systems for mitigating anthropogenic climate change.

We used the ESA-CCI biomass v4 data, which provide estimates of AGB density in woody vegetation for 2010 and 2020 (https://data.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/esacci/biomass/data/agb/maps/v4.0). Those data are derived from a combination of Earth observation data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, Envisat's ASAR instrument and JAXA's Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1 and ALOS-2), along with additional information from Earth observation sources. We calculated the changes in AGB for 2010–2020 by taking the differences between the 2020 and 2010 maps. To quantify the uncertainties in the biomass maps, we generated 20 realizations of the AGB data by introducing controlled perturbations to the mean biomass estimates. Specifically, for each time step and each member of our ensemble, we added a scaled version of the standard deviation of the biomass, with the scaling factor drawn from a normal distribution clipped to the range [−1, 1]. This approach allows us to simulate the natural variability and uncertainty in the biomass data. We then combined these perturbed maps to create a comprehensive dataset representing the possible range of biomass values. This enables us to provide confidence intervals and robust statistical measures of uncertainty in our estimates. The following equation can describe the perturbation applied:

where AGBi,j,k (t) is the perturbed aboveground biomass at location (i, j) and time t for the kth member, μi,j(t) is the mean aboveground biomass, σi,j(t) is the standard deviation of the aboveground biomass and Sk is the scaling factor drawn from a normal distribution \(N(0,\frac{1}{3})\) and clipped to the range [−1,1]. The use \(N(0,\frac{1}{3})\) ensures that the perturbations are centred around zero, introducing symmetric and controlled variability. The standard deviation \(\frac{1}{3}\) moderates the variability to prevent extreme perturbations, thus maintaining the realism of the biomass estimates. Clipping the values to [−1,1] further ensures that the introduced variations are within a reasonable range.

The AGB estimates, expressed as dry organic mass, were converted to AGC using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default carbon fraction of 0.47.

GAMIv2.016,21 is an updated version of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC) forest age product, providing global forest age distributions for 2010 and 2020 at a 100-metre resolution. This version leverages the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to generate data-driven estimates of forest age, integrating over 40,000 forest inventory plots, biomass and height measurements, remote sensing observations and climate data. This multi-variable approach accounts for structural and ecological variations across climatic gradients, ensuring that forest age is not inferred from biomass alone but reflects broader growth patterns (Extended Data Fig. 2). Unlike previous global age products that assume monotonic or simplified growth trajectories, GAMIv2.0 is explicitly designed to represent the full diversity of age–biomass relationships, including saturation and declines in older age classes, across biomes. This improves alignment with patterns observed in ground-based studies and enhances the suitability of the dataset for carbon modelling applications.

A key improvement in GAMIv2.0 is the integration of Landsat-based disturbance history with machine-learning-based forest age estimates. The methodology for mapping time since the last disturbance and afforestation is based on Potapov et al.4 and Hansen et al.62. The process involves the following steps:

Mapping time since last disturbance and afforestation

Last disturbance layer: disturbed forest areas are identified using the ‘forests affected by stand-replacement disturbances or degradation' layer from Potapov et al.4. The Hansen et al.62 dataset is then used to determine the year of forest loss, which is subtracted from 2020 to obtain the time since the last disturbance. Negative values (indicating losses in 2021 and 2022) are masked.

Stable forest layer: the ‘stable forest extent' layer from Potapov et al.4 is used to identify undisturbed forest areas as of 2020.

Forest gain layer (Afforestation): afforested (regrown) forest areas are mapped using the ‘forest extent gain' layer and the canopy height data from 2020.

Integrating Landsat-based and machine-learning-based age estimates

To improve forest age predictions, we merged the Landsat-based time since disturbance estimates with the machine-learning-derived forest age estimates through the following decision rules:

If the Landsat-based time since disturbance is ≤19 years and the machine-learning predicted age is higher, we assign the Landsat-based estimate.

If the Landsat-based time since disturbance is ≤19 years and the machine-learning predicted age is equal to or lower than the Landsat-based estimate, we retain the machine-learning estimate.

If the Landsat-based time since disturbance is ≥20 years, we retain the machine-learning estimate, regardless of its value.

This fusion approach refines the estimation of time since the last stand-replacement event over the past 20 years, addressing biases that tend to overestimate the age of young forests in regrowing or afforested areas (Supplementary Fig. 7). Despite these improvements, some biases remain, including a potential overestimation of young forest age and an underestimation of older forest age. This has important implications for our results: the observed decline in young forests may be less pronounced than suggested, whereas the reduction in older forests could be more substantial.

Addressing uncertainties in age estimates

The age maps were generated using an ensemble approach to account for uncertainties:

Aleatoric uncertainty: different biomass data realizations were incorporated into the model to capture variability in input data.

Epistemic uncertainty: multiple XGBoost models were trained with varying hyperparameter settings to assess variability in model performance and predictions.

By incorporating these uncertainty quantifications, we provide a more robust estimate of forest age distribution. We also derived age-class fraction products at one-degree resolution, categorizing forests into two-decade intervals up to 200 years, followed by 201–300 and >300-year age classes.

The GAMIv2.0 product and its associated uncertainties can be visualized in the following Google Earth Engine app: https://besnardsim.users.earthengine.app/view/globalforestage.

We used the 1 × 1° gridded ‘co2flux' output generated by nine (CAMS, CMS-Flux, CT-NOAA, CTE, CarboScope, IAPCAS, MIROC, NISMON-CO2 and UoE) inversion models within the Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes Project (RECCAP-2)22 (https://meta.icos-cp.eu/objects/FHbD8OTgCb7Tlvs99lUDApO0). These models incorporate CO2 mole fraction measurements from surface stations and total column mole fraction data from satellites. The selected atmospheric inversion models include CAMS, sEXTocNEET, CTE2022, NISMON-CO2, CMS-Flux, UoE, GONGGA, THU and CAMS-Satellite. We adjusted the net carbon fluxes by excluding lateral fluxes from the calculation. Such adjustments included removing riverine carbon export to estuaries and coastal oceans and accounting for carbon transfers in crops and emissions from cement production. By adjusting the data, we aligned the atmospheric inversion findings more closely with the forest age estimates inferred from the GAMIv2.0 product. We masked out non-forested pixels. Finally, atmospheric inversion-based net CO2 fluxes estimates were smoothed with a Gaussian filter while maintaining the total intensity by redistributing values only among valid pixels. The NaN values in the input remain unchanged in the output. This approach uses a Gaussian distribution for intensity redistribution, considering only valid pixels. The filter's smoothing scale is set to a length of 500 km, defining the filter's physical length in kilometres. Sigma for the filter is calculated based on a specified degree of longitude at the equator. This approach effectively smooths the data while respecting its original structure and missing values. We created two net CO2 fluxes, circa 2010 (average between 2009–2011) and 2020 (average between 2019–2021), from which we determined the NEE changes by subtracting the latter from the former.

Estimating changes in forest age distribution between 2010 and 2020 involved several steps using the 100 m GAMIv2.0 product. First, we aggregated the data to a one-degree pixel resolution for 2010 and 2020 using an average resampling method. The resulting datasets provided estimates of the mean forest age at a one-degree scale for both years (Fig. 1a). In parallel, we calculated forest age differences at GAMIv2.0's native resolution (100 m). This difference map was then resampled to a one-degree resolution using the same averaging method to maintain spatial consistency (Fig. 1c). Additionally, we quantified the total area occupied by young (0–20 years old), maturing (21–80 years old), mature (81–200 years old) and old (>200 years old) forests in both 2010 and 2020 (Fig. 1b). This analysis was performed independently for each of the 20 forest age maps. In this study, it is essential to distinguish between forest ageing, which progresses at a constant rate over time, and forest growth, representing changes in biomass accumulation over time. Growth rates vary depending on stand dynamics, disturbance history and environmental conditions, whereas ageing itself remains uniform. However, because GAMI estimates forest age as a function of biomass, canopy height and climate variables, variations in modelled age primarily reflect inferred structural and ecological differences rather than the simple passage of time. This distinction is crucial for correctly interpreting trends in forest age distribution and their implications for carbon dynamics.

We first computed the difference in modelled forest age between 2010 and 2020 at 100-m resolution using the GAMIv2.0 product to classify forests into stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing categories. Undisturbed ageing forests were identified as pixels where the age difference was exactly 10 years, indicating that the forest remained undisturbed and aged naturally over the decade. Stand-replaced forests were identified as pixels where the age difference was less than 10 years, meaning that a stand-replacing disturbance occurred between 2010 and 2020. This includes negative values, where the 2020 forest age is lower than in 2010, reflecting a more recent disturbance that had little time for regrowth to occur.

To further analyse these patterns, we generated two derivative products for stand-replaced forests:

Age difference magnitude—capturing the extent of age reduction due to disturbance.

Binary classification—distinguishing stand-replaced (1) vs non-stand-replaced (0) pixels.

Similarly, we created equivalent products based on an age difference of exactly 10 years for undisturbed ageing forests.

To understand how initial forest age influences disturbance and ageing patterns, we stratified both stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forests into four age classes, using their 2010 GAMIv2.0-estimated age: young forests (0–20 years), maturing forests (21–80 years), mature forests (81–200 years) and old forests (>200 years).

Finally, the age difference and binary classification products were resampled to a one-degree resolution using an average resampling method, enabling large-scale analysis. This process was conducted independently for each of the 20 forest age maps to account for model variability. These resampled products served two purposes: the binary classification was used to compute the fraction of forest pixels in each one-degree grid cell that experienced stand replacement or undisturbed ageing. At the same time, the magnitude of the age difference captured the mean severity of age reduction or gain. These metrics were then used to quantify the spatial extent and intensity of age transitions (for example, Figs. 1c and 2a–c).

First, we analysed carbon stock across forest age classes, focusing on stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forests. This involved partitioning 100-m pixels based on age difference, as previously described, to identify distinct categories of forests that had undergone varying degrees of change over the study period. Each partitioned class was then assigned an estimate of carbon stock. Using an average resampling method, those carbon stock estimate products were resampled to a one-degree pixel resolution. In addition, we estimated the total carbon stock across age classes by multiplying the product of the carbon stock estimates and the area of each age-class partition. This was done independently for the stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forest categories. Similarly, we calculated net carbon stock changes for stand-replaced forests by computing the difference in AGC stocks between 2010 and 2020. Specifically, for each spatial unit, the AGC stock 2020 was subtracted from the AGC stock 2010, yielding the net change over the decade (ΔAGC = AGC2020 − AGC2010). To express these changes in a flux-consistent sign convention, we multiplied the resulting values by −1 so that positive values represent carbon loss (biosphere-to-atmosphere flux, typically due to disturbance or decomposition). By contrast, negative values indicate carbon accumulation (biomass regrowth). This approach ensures consistency with commonly used flux representations while preserving the original stock change information. Finally, we estimate the average annual growth rate across age classes for stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forests as follows:

where n is the number of years between the two measurements. In this case, n = 10 years.

Such a procedure was done independently for the corresponding 20 forest age and biomass maps.

To assess the covariation between forest age shifts and net CO2 flux changes, we analysed the relationship between stand-replacement fractions and changes in NEE derived from atmospheric inversions. To ensure the robustness of our analysis, we extract data within spatial windows of different resolutions (that is, 2° × 2°, 5° × 5° and 10° × 10°) before performing the regression analysis. This spatial window approach ensures that stand-replacement fractions and NEE changes remain spatially coherent within each inversion model. We compute the median stand-replacement fraction (20 members) and corresponding median NEE changes across all available inversion models (nine members) for each spatial window. To assess the robustness of our results, we apply Jackknife resampling, systematically excluding individual NEE inversion members to test their influence on the overall trend.

To explore how changes in forest management could influence future age-class dynamics and AGC storage, we developed projections of forest age distributions to the year 2050 under two hypothetical management scenarios: BAU and forest conservation. These scenarios are inspired by, but do not strictly adhere to, the objectives of global forest policy initiatives, such as the New York Declaration on Forests, which aims to halt natural forest loss by 2030 and restore 350 million hectares of degraded landscapes and forests. We aim to provide a first-order estimate of how AGC stocks might evolve in response to shifts in forest age structures under idealized management pathways. Our projections do not account for climate-driven effects such as CO2 fertilization or altered disturbance regimes.

This scenario assumes that current forest management practices and policies remain unchanged for a period of 30 years. Consequently, the distribution of forest age classes is projected to mirror the pattern observed for the 2010–2020 period. As a result, the forest age structure in 2050 is expected to be similar to the one observed in 2020. To calculate the total carbon storage capacity for this scenario, we use a straightforward method: multiplying the total area of each age class in 2050 by its respective total carbon stock estimate and then dividing this product by the total area of each age class in 2020. In the BAU scenario, the total area of each age class in 2050 is expected to be the same as in 2020. Such carbon stock estimation can be estimated as follows:

Where:

The total area of age-class BAUi, 2050 is the area of the ith age class (in hectares) in 2050.

Total area of age classi, 2020 is the area of the ith age class (in hectares) in 2020.

Total stocki, 2020 is the estimated total carbon stock for the ith age class (in MgC per hectare) in 2020.

Aligning with the objectives of the New York Declaration on Forests, this scenario maintains the continuation of existing management practices until 2030, followed by a period of non-intervention in forest areas up to 2050. The aim is to halt BAU stand replacement by 2030 and allow forests to age naturally thereafter. In this scenario, the forest age-class distribution in 2030 is anticipated to be identical to that of 2020, whereas by 2050, all forests are expected to have matured by an additional 20 years. The total carbon stocks under this scenario are estimated by multiplying each age class's total area in 2050 by its corresponding total carbon stock estimates in 2020. This product will then be divided by the total area of each age class in 2020. The carbon stock changes estimation for the forest conservation scenario can be expressed as follows:

Where:

Total area of age-class conservation2050 is the area of the ith age class (in hectares) in 2050.

Total area of age classi, 2020 is the area of the ith age class (in hectares) in 2020.

Total stocki, 2020 is the estimated total carbon stock for the ith age class (in MgC per hectare) in 2020.

First, to investigate the influence of forest management on the relationship between forest age and biomass (Supplementary Fig. 1), we used mixed-effects models on a global scale. These models included the management category as a fixed effect and geographic coordinates as random effects to capture spatial heterogeneity. This approach allowed us to isolate the role of management while accounting for spatial variability across different regions. To manage regional variability effectively, the analysis was conducted within 2-degree latitude by 2-degree longitude windows, ensuring sufficient data points within each window for robust statistical analysis. The mixed-effects model can be expressed as:

Where:

Biomass is the dependent variable, while management type (managed vs unmanaged) and forest age are fixed effects. Latitude and longitude are random effects that account for spatial variability.

Within each 2-degree latitude by 2-degree longitude window, we extracted the P value of the interaction term between the management category and forest age to assess the influence of management practices on the relationship between forest age and biomass.

Second, we investigated the relationship between forest age and logging fraction (Supplementary Fig. 6). To do so, we used a forest management map46 to calculate a metric related to the logging fraction as follows:

Where:

class 11 – naturally regenerating forest without any signs of management, including primary forests;

class 20 – naturally regenerating forest with signs of management, for example, logging, clear-cuts and so on;

class 31 – planted forests;

class 32 – plantation forests (rotation time up to 15 years);

class 40 – oil palm plantations; and

class 53 – agroforestry.

a–k, Total forest area per age class in 2010 (blue) and 2020 (green) across the eleven TRANSCOM land regions (see Supplementary Fig. 3). Values represent the median estimates across 20 ensemble members, with error bars indicating the 5th and 95th percentiles.

a–k, Relationship between forest biomass and age across hydro-climate zones, based on the GAMI dataset and ESA-CCI biomass v4 data for 2020. The figure illustrates consistent patterns of biomass accumulation with forest aging, reflecting broad ecological trends. Although the GAMI product incorporates ESA-CCI biomass data (see Methods), this comparison independently validates the robustness of the observed growth trajectories.

Spatial distribution of stand-replaced forests that were (a) young (forest age <= 20 years old), (b) intermediate (21–80 years old), (c) mature (81–200 years old), and (d) old forests (forest age > 200 years old) in 2010.

Spatial distribution of undisturbed ageing forests (a) young (forest age <= 20 years old), (b) intermediate (21–80 years old), (c) mature (81–200 years old), and (d) old forests (forest age > 200 years old) in 2010.

Spatial distribution of carbon stocks (in MgC ha-1) in stand-replaced forests (a) young (forest age <= 20 years old), (b) intermediate (21–80 years old), (c) mature (81–200 years old), and (d) old forests (forest age > 200 years old) in 2010. Each pixel represents a median estimate of the 100 m pixels belonging to a specific category within each one-degree pixel.

a–k, Annual growth rates across age classes for forests replaced by young stands (in orange) and undisturbed ageing forests (in green) in each TRANSCOM-Land region. The annual growth rate represents the net change in biomass per year. Stand-replaced forests (orange) correspond to areas where older stands have been replaced by younger forests, which generally exhibit higher growth rates due to their early successional stage. In contrast, undisturbed ageing forests (green) represent forests that continue ageing without stand replacement, typically showing lower growth rates as they approach maturity.

Spatial distribution of carbon stocks (in MgC ha-1) in undisturbed ageing established forests (a) young (forest age <= 20 years old), (b) intermediate (21–80 years old), (c) mature (81–200 years old), and (d) old forests (forest age > 200 years old) in 2010. Each pixel represents a median estimate of the 100 m pixels belonging to a specific category within each one-degree pixel.

Relationship between the fraction of forests replaced by young stands (that is, stand-replacement extent) and changes in net CO2 fluxes between circa 2020 (average of 2019–2021) and 2010 (average of 2009–2011) for young (a), maturing (b), mature (c) and old (d) stand-replaced forests. The dark solid line represents the linear regression on the ensemble estimates, while the dashed grey lines indicate the regressions for the nine individual atmospheric inversion models. To smooth the spatial distribution of net CO2 fluxes, we applied a Gaussian filter (length = 500 km, equivalent to approximately four one-degree pixels). This smoothing technique reduces noise in the data and helps minimise the influence of local transport errors.

Potential total carbon stock (a) in 2050 across age classes for the two scenarios. We also show the forest age class distribution in 2050 (b) under BAU and forest conservation scenarios. The young forest age class include the stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forests.

Arabidopsis has been pivotal in uncovering fundamental principles of plant biology, yet a comprehensive, high-resolution understanding of its cellular identities throughout the entire life cycle remains incomplete. Here we present a single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic atlas spanning ten developmental stages, encompassing over 400,000 nuclei from all organ systems and tissues—from seeds to developing siliques. Leveraging paired single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic datasets, we annotate 75% of identified cell clusters, revealing striking molecular diversity in cell types and states across development. Our integrated approach identified conserved transcriptional signatures among recurrent cell types, organ-specific heterogeneity and previously uncharacterized cell-type-specific markers validated spatially. Moreover, we uncover dynamic transcriptional programs governing secondary metabolite production and differential growth patterns, exemplified by detailed spatial profiling of the compact yet complex apical hook structure; this profiling revealed transient cellular states linked to developmental progression and hormonal regulation, highlighting the hidden complexity underlying plant morphogenesis. Functional validation of genes uniquely expressed within specific cell contexts confirmed their essential developmental roles, underscoring the predictive power of our atlas. Collectively, this comprehensive resource provides an invaluable foundation for exploring cellular differentiation, environmental responses and genetic perturbations at high resolution, advancing our understanding of plant biology.

Multicellular organisms have evolved distinct organs to perform specific complex tasks and address challenges that may be present throughout their life. Unlike most animals, plants continuously undergo post-embryonic organogenesis to form new organs throughout development. In the model plant Arabidopsis, many tissues and organs present throughout its life cycle are composed of identical or similarly classified cell types that share functionality across organs and developmental stages1. For example, epidermal cells are the interface of the plant with the external environment for all organs, while internally localized vascular cells universally function in water and nutrient transport2,3. Despite the current understanding of plant anatomy, there is limited understanding of the molecular constituents that define cell types and states within the native context of diverse organs present throughout development.

While cell-type marker genes exist for many recurrent cell types across distinct organs, the form and function of cell types can vary depending on the tissue context or cellular niche from which they originate. Intra-cell-type heterogeneity is exemplified by Arabidopsis sepal and silique epidermal pavement cells, which undergo rapid cellular elongation depending on transcript dosages of the epidermal master regulator ATML1 (ref. 4) or regulators of the cell cycle5 or in response to fertilization signals6, demonstrating that identically classified cell types can undergo varied developmental programs dependent on internal cues. In addition to cell-type classification, cellular states (which can be defined as variations in molecular phenotypes that do not impact the developmental potential7) may further differentiate individual cells within cell types and may reflect developmental factors, such as the cell cycle8, tissue/cellular age9, the spatial location and cellular neighbourhoods within tissues10, and external stimuli11. The molecular identity of a cell can thus be defined as the cumulative expression of transcripts that determine both cell type and state.

Single-cell RNA sequencing has been used to provide detailed maps of cell types in plants12. Still, its application is generally restricted to selected organs, tissues and cell types13,14,15,16,17 within individual studies13,14,15,16,17,18,19, posing a bottleneck towards a standardized comprehensive understanding of cell types and states in this model organism. While a recent study addresses this gap through the generation of single-nucleus transcriptomic datasets of tissues present throughout Arabidopsis development20, a challenge remains in the annotation and validation of large numbers of new marker genes, many of which may have no known function or are uncharacterized. To overcome this challenge, spatial transcriptomic methods present a powerful tool for the native detection of transcripts in situ within tissues, which simultaneously facilitates the validation of newly identified marker genes and the elucidation of spatially regulated expression21,22,23,24,25. Furthermore, the complementary application of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies enables the investigation and elucidation of spatially and temporally regulated cellular states that potentially underlie biological function26 and environmental interaction27 within individual cell types. To date, however, there has not been wide application of single-cell and spatial omics to diverse Arabidopsis organs within individual studies. Here we present a single-nucleus transcriptome atlas with companion spatial transcriptome atlases as a foundational dataset of the Arabidopsis life cycle. These datasets reveal diverse molecular identities integrating cell type and state, including universal and development- and organ-specific cell-type marker genes.

The paired application of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic methods facilitated the identification of new cell-type-specific genes across diverse organs and enabled confident annotation of 138/183 (75%) of the clusters identified in our study. Furthermore, our paired single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic datasets enabled the transcriptome-wide analysis of cellular states associated with rapid differential growth within the etiolated Arabidopsis seedling hypocotyl. Lastly, the examination of mutants in genes that we found to be under the combined regulation of cell-type and developmental specificity revealed functional roles of these transcripts in plants at the physiological level only within their native expression contexts. This study will be a powerful foundation for hypothesis generation that may facilitate discoveries within highly specific cell populations throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle.

To generate a comprehensive atlas of Arabidopsis development, we collected six distinct organ systems that encompass diverse tissues as well as whole organisms at ten discrete developmental time points throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle corresponding to established developmental road maps28,29,30. This includes imbibed and germinating seeds, three stages of seedling development, developing and fully emerged rosettes, the stem, flowers and siliques (Fig. 1a). For each organ system, we also generated a paired spatial transcriptomic dataset (Fig. 1b–e; mature rosette leaf27). For the single-nucleus datasets, 432,919 nuclei from the ten developmental time points passed accepted droplet-based single-nucleus filtering metrics31 (median unique molecular identifier (UMI), 916; Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1) and were independently clustered. For the seedling and rosette samples that constitute developmental time series, we also performed integrative analyses that revealed clusters corresponding to known cell types (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), which confirms the reproducibility of these datasets and enables the investigation of developmentally regulated processes, such as root hair development (Supplementary Fig. 2) and leaf senescence (Supplementary Fig. 3), as reported recently20, across developmentally distinct samples. We also merged all single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets into a global dataset (Fig. 1f) encompassing all cell types across the Arabidopsis life cycle.

For each micrograph in e, results were observed across ten independent seeds, eight independent seedlings, two independent leaves, one stem, three independent flowers (one in longitudinal orientation and two in cross orientation) and three independent siliques. See Methods for detailed information.

To compare cell types across organs and development, we analysed each dataset independently, which resulted in 183 clusters across all datasets (Fig. 1d). Cluster annotation was performed according to the following guidelines. First, an extensive list of marker genes was compiled with known cell-type- and tissue-specific expression in all Arabidopsis organs (Supplementary Table 1), including cell-type-specific markers recently identified from single-cell RNA-seq studies18,19,32,33,34,35. Many of these known cell-type-/tissue-specific expressed genes were enriched in specific clusters of our dataset (>1,000 genes), which aided cluster annotation (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Second, a cell-type enrichment score for each cluster was calculated on the basis of known cell-type markers to systematically infer cell types (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Third, we investigated newly identified cluster markers within each dataset using previously generated dissection-based and cell-type-specific transcriptomic studies (TAIR36 and ePlant37,38) to confirm the accuracy of our cluster annotations (Supplementary Table 2). Finally, we spatially validated a selection of cluster markers for each tissue/organ using sequencing- and imaging-based spatial transcriptomic technologies (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Figs. 2–6).

Our spatial transcriptome approach allowed us to validate examples of known cell-type marker genes across organs and development, as well as validate newly identified cell-type-specific and tissue-specific marker genes across all organs (see Supplementary Table 3 for 109 examples of new cell-type/tissue marker genes). In contrast, we were also able to identify and validate markers that do not universally specify cell types but rather demonstrate cell-type-specific expression only within the context of specific organs, as shown for epidermal cells of seedling hypocotyls (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the localization of cell-type-specific genes identified via snRNA-seq in most developmental stages and plant organs tested (Extended Data Figs. 2–6). In the seedling datasets, we were able to confirm cell identities such as mesophyll cells expressing LIGHT-HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL-PROTEIN COMPLEX II SUBUNIT B1 (LHB1B1; AT2G34430)38, epidermal cells (for example, GLYCOSYL HYDROLASE 9B8 (GH9B8; AT2G32990) and AT2G12462, new epidermal markers restricted to the apical hook and cotyledons in seedlings, respectively) and vascular cells (AINTEGUMENTA (ANT; AT4G37750), which was shown to regulate ERECTA-LIKE 1 (ERL1; AT5G62230) and PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM (PXY; AT5G61480), which maintain procambial cell identity39) that are co-expressed in the same cluster as SUCROSE-PROTON SYMPORTER 2 (SUC2; AT1G22710)40,41,42 (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3). We were also able to annotate clusters to cell states through the cluster-specific expression of cell-division-associated genes such as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE LIKE-D (CSLD5; AT1G02730), involved in cell plate formation43, and HINKEL (HIK; AT1G18370), which is involved in cytokinesis44 (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3).

Visual inspection of spatial marker expression within the single-nucleus datasets did not always reveal cluster-specific expression patterns, as demonstrated by LHB1B1 (Extended Data Fig. 3g), but quantitative evaluation of these markers revealed cluster- and subcluster-specific and enriched expression of these spatial markers both within individual samples (Extended Data Fig. 3k, left) and across tissues and developmental time points (Extended Data Fig. 3k, right), demonstrating conserved expression of these cell-type and cell-state markers across diverse tissues throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle.

In stems, we identified cell-type-specific gene expression localized to the procambium (for example, USUALLY MULTIPLE AMINO ACIDS MOVE IN AND OUT TRANSPORTERS 11 (UMAMIT11; AT2G40900)), cortex (for example, B-BOX DOMAIN PROTEIN 15 (BBX15; AT1G25440)), phloem (H(+)-ATPase 3 (refs. 45,46) (HA3; AT5G57350)) and xylem tissues (XYLEM CYSTEINE PEPTIDASE 2 (XCP2; AT1G20850) and IRREGULAR XYLEM 3 (ref. 47) (IRX3; AT5G17420)), enabling high-resolution mapping of vascular differentiation in the stem (Extended Data Fig. 4). Spatial expression of markers in Arabidopsis floral tissue revealed epidermal markers (for example, AT2G37540), vascular-expressed genes (for example, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT; AT1G65480)) and carpel-specific expression of AGAMOUS-like 8 / FRUITFULL (AT5G60910; ref. 48) (Extended Data Fig. 5). Spatial transcriptomics also revealed distinct expression domains within the Arabidopsis silique, with VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN 2 (VSP2; AT5G24770) and the TPX2 protein family (TPXL6; AT5G37478) marking the exocarp cell layer, and AT2G13810 showing specific localization in developing seeds (Extended Data Fig. 6). Together, these examples demonstrate the strength of our paired single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic datasets on matched biological samples.

While we were able to annotate many clusters to individual cell types, we found that some clusters instead corresponded to anatomical regions or broad cellular states, such as the developing embryo or dividing cells (Supplementary Table 2). This led us to hypothesize that further transcriptional complexity could be resolved within each cluster when examined independently. Through systematic re-clustering of individual clusters (subclustering), we were able to determine further complexity within clusters, resulting in a total of 655 subclusters (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Correlating the aggregated transcriptomes (pseudobulk) of each subcluster, we found that subclusters generally grouped by sample type, but we also found examples of subclusters with unique gene expression patterns that grouped independent of dataset (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Together, these results demonstrate that subclustering captures subtle transcriptional states and uncovers rare or transitional cell populations that may play distinct roles across developmental or environmental contexts.

The silique represents a complex system that includes distinct maternal and progeny tissues. We therefore used the silique dataset as a use case example of dataset annotation that is enhanced by the paired single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic datasets (Fig. 3a). Within the proliferating cell population (cluster 0) that may encompass multiple cell types in siliques, subclustering revealed three transcriptionally distinct groups, with each defined by unique marker genes (Fig. 3b,c). Expression of these markers was restricted to the seed coat layer49, prompting further spatial investigation.

Magnified images of individual seed sacs are also depicted. The scale bar lengths are shown. b,c, Subclustering of cluster 0 from the silique dataset. Groups of clusters corresponding to the outer integument (blue), inner integument (pink) and flavonoid biosynthesis (orange) clusters are depicted (b), with violin plots of select cluster markers (c). d, Relevant cell types and structures of developing seed sacs. e, Magnified images of an individual seed sac in the spatial dataset. Subcluster markers are coloured corresponding to the annotated cluster grouping. The scale bar length is shown. For the micrographs in a and e, results were observed in three siliques and at least ten seed sacs within the siliques.

By mapping these markers in the spatial dataset, we were able to finely annotate subcluster groups corresponding to the seed coat's outer and inner integument layers (Fig. 3a,d,e). This annotation of individual layers within developing seeds was further supported by a similar annotation of these genes in a single-nucleus transcriptome dataset of Arabidopsis seeds35. Consistent with a previous single-nucleus dataset of developing seeds35, we also identified subcluster markers corresponding to flavonoid biosynthetic processes within our subcluster groups (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Fig. 6), but spatial mapping revealed that these transcripts are detected in both the seed coat and endosperm layers of seed sacs (Fig. 3e, beige). While flavonoid secondary metabolites are known to function in seed coat colour and cause the transparent testa phenotype in mutants of flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes50,51, the spatial expression of TRANSPARENT TESTA 4 (TT4; AT5G13930) and other flavonoid biosynthesis genes within the endosperm layer may instead be associated with the alteration of fatty acid levels in embryos. This has been observed in tt2 (AT5G35550)52, tt4 (AT5G13930)53 and tt8 (AT4G09820)54 mutants. The simultaneous but spatially distinct expression of genes encoding flavonoid biosynthesis enzymes may suggest functionally diverse roles of flavonoid metabolites within discrete cell types of individual seeds. Together, these findings demonstrate that transcriptional states may be strongly associated with secondary metabolite production and inclusive of multiple cell types, further demonstrating that the paired application of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptome datasets enables the discovery and annotation of marker genes at the resolution of individual cell layers.

Spatially confined expression of polarity regulators is a hallmark of de novo organogenesis in various Arabidopsis organs10,55,56. We hypothesized that our Arabidopsis life-cycle atlas would capture polarity-defined cells. In our single-nucleus datasets, we detected transcripts of canonical polarity markers across several clusters (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting the presence of such cells within our datasets. However, these transcripts were sparsely expressed, limiting our ability to fully resolve polarity domains on the basis of single-nucleus data alone (Supplementary Fig. 7).

To overcome this limitation, we leveraged our spatial transcriptomics dataset and examined the expression of known polarity regulators in our three-day-old seedling dataset. We detected transcripts of known polarity regulators in expected regions of cotyledons and were able to spatially reconstruct the three-domain model of leaf development57,58 with the detection of REVOLUTA (REV; AT5G60690), WUSCHEL-related homeobox 1 (WOX1; AT3G18010) and YABBY1 (YAB1) / ABNORMAL FLORAL ORGANS (AFO) (AT2G45190) in the adaxial, middle and abaxial domains of cotyledons, respectively (Fig. 4a–c).

For the micrographs in a and d, results were observed in eight seedlings. For the micrographs in i and j, results were observed in two cross-sectioned flowers and one longitudinally sectioned flower.

We identified new marker genes that were spatially co-expressed in regions of known polarity regulators, as exemplified by TT4, which was detected prominently and solely within the adaxial region of cotyledons (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 8). Furthermore, TT4 transcripts were more abundant than those of the canonical adaxial polarity regulators REV and AS2 (Fig. 4a,d), which could be because canonical polarity regulators encode transcription factors that are known to be expressed at lower levels in cells. Despite low detection of canonical polarity regulators in our single-nucleus datasets (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7), we were able to identify nuclei that co-expressed polarity regulators with TT4 (Fig. 4e) and other spatially validated transcripts with polar expression patterns for both abaxial and adaxial defined cells (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 9), in addition to known cell-type markers (Supplementary Fig. 10). These results demonstrate that these new markers with polar expression patterns in cotyledons denote polarity-defined cells (polarity positive), which is supported by the observation that the mutation of individual TRANSPARENT TESTA genes affects the development of specific cell types in seedlings59.

While the polarity-positive nuclei were not restricted to individual clusters (Fig. 4f), we instead found that the expression of canonical and newly identified polarity markers was more defined at the subcluster level (Fig. 4g,h). Together, these results reveal that polar specification demarcates cell subpopulations within individual cell types and may further explain the observed subcluster diversity (Supplementary Fig. 5).

While TT4 exhibited prominent adaxial localized expression in cotyledons of three-day-old seedlings, examining TT4 expression across all organs and developmental stages revealed that TT4 expression was the greatest in several flower clusters (Fig. 4g,h), which prompted us to examine the expression and spatial distribution of TT4 within flowers. Consistent with prior findings, we found that transcripts of canonical polarity markers were spatially restricted to the expected adaxial (REV, yellow) and abaxial (YAB1 (ref. 60), cyan) regions of the carpel (Fig. 4i). Interestingly, in contrast to our findings in cotyledons (Fig. 4a), we found that TT4 transcripts were instead localized to abaxial layers of carpels (Fig. 4i). As TT4 encodes the sole enzyme involved in chalcone synthesis50 upstream of flavonoid biosynthesis, we hypothesized that genes encoding other enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway may also be spatially regulated in flowers. We found that the expression of other flavonoid biosynthesis genes (TT3-7, LEUCOANTHOCYANIDIN DIOXYGENASE (LDOX) / TT18 (AT4G22880) and FLAVONOL SYNTHASE 1 (FLS1; AT5G08640)) was enriched in the same flower cluster (Fig. 4k,l; cluster 10) and spatial regions as that of TT4 (Fig. 4i,j), which suggests that the expression of entire secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways may influence the transcriptional identity of individual cells (Fig. 4k). While we observed the highest expression of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway within flower subclusters, some (but not all) organs were associated with clusters that specifically express flavonoid biosynthesis genes, revealing specific roles of flavonoids in specific organs throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle (Supplementary Fig. 11).

Because flavonoids have diverse roles in several biological processes in various flower tissues61, we questioned whether the flower cluster associated with high expression of flavonoid biosynthesis enzymes, which we consistently observed with altered clustering parameters (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13), may instead represent diverse cell types that all produce flavonoids in contrast to a single cell type. Subclustering of the flavonoid biosynthetic cluster (cluster 10; Fig. 4m) revealed three subcluster populations that were enriched for markers of tapetum62 (subcluster 0, GLYCINE RICH PROTEINS), epidermal63 (subcluster 1, 3-KETOACYL-COA SYNTHASE 10 (KCS10; AT2G26250) and TRANSPARENT TESTA genes) and female gametophyte64 (subcluster 2, ER-TYPE Ca2+-ATPase 1 (ECA1) and ECA1-like gametogenesis family genes) cells (Fig. 4m,n). Together, these results highlight an example of transcriptional complexity driven by the expression of secondary metabolism pathways among several cell types, where cell-type identity is resolved only at the resolution of subclusters.

In the integrated global dataset (Fig. 1f), we identified at least ten clusters that correspond to recurrent cell types, such as vascular (phloem), epidermal (epidermis, guard cells and trichomes) and meristematic (procambium) cell types, that are represented by nuclei from all tissues and developmental time points assayed in which those cell types are present (Supplementary Fig. 14a,b). While these recurrent cell types could be identified by the cluster-specific expression of individual or suites of cell-type markers, we questioned whether heterogeneity within individual cell types may exist at the whole-transcriptome level. We initially focused on phloem companion and guard cells that were identified by the specific expression of the phloem and guard cell marker genes SUC2 (AT1G22710; refs. 41,42) and FAMA (AT3G24140; ref. 65), respectively (Fig. 5a). Independent subclustering of the phloem companion (Fig. 5b) and guard cell populations from the global dataset (Fig. 5c) revealed subcluster complexity within both of these cell types. We observed similar trends within both the phloem companion and guard cell populations, where nuclei from both the seedling and rosette time-series datasets formed individual aggregate clusters (Fig. 5b,c; circled). In contrast, nuclei from other organs, exemplified by silique nuclei, generally clustered separately (Fig. 5b,c), which suggests that organ-specific transcripts contribute to the observed complexity within individual cell types. Examining populations of other recurrent cell types identified from the global dataset (Supplementary Fig. 14a–c) consistently revealed similar trends where silique nuclei clustered separately from those of different organs. From these findings, we hypothesized that the observed heterogeneity within cell types may be due to (1) genes with expression that is restricted to individual organs or developmental time points yet expressed within multiple cell types, or (2) genes with expression under the dual regulation of cell-type and organ or developmental specificity.

The scale bar length is shown. For the micrograph in g, results were observed in one stem.

To investigate this question, we examined the intersection of newly identified markers from the subsets of phloem companion and guard cells. This revealed two classes of marker genes: (1) markers that were shared across cell types within the same tissue, organ or organ system (shared markers; Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 4) and (2) unique cell-type markers that were identified within only phloem companion or guard cell populations of individual sample types (unique; Fig. 5e and Supplementary Table 4). For example, CYTOCHROME P450, FAMILY 709, SUBFAMILY B, POLYPEPTIDE 1 (CYP709B1; AT2G46960) and ARABIDOPSIS NAC DOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN 29 (ANAC029; AT1G69490) were both identified as markers within silique guard cells (Supplementary Fig. 14d, left).

Examining the expression of these silique guard cell markers in the context of whole-plant development, we found that CYP709B1 was restricted to the silique organ but was expressed broadly across cell types (shared marker gene), while ANAC029 expression was unique to silique guard cells within the context of whole-plant development (unique marker gene; Supplementary Fig. 14d, right). Consistent with the broad expression of CYP709B1 across silique cell types, we also identified shared markers of other tissues in the phloem companion and guard cell populations (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 14e). Together, these results demonstrate that transcriptional identities within individual cell types are defined both by the expression of genes shared among cell types within a tissue or organ (for example, flower specific) and by genes under the combined regulation of cell-type and developmental specificity (for example, expression restricted to only one cell type in only one organ, such as silique mesocarp). Extending this cell-type-level analysis to other recurrent cell populations revealed similar results (Supplementary Fig. 14f,g and Supplementary Table 4), demonstrating that this observation was not unique to the cell types of phloem companion and guard cells but is instead widespread across diverse cell types.

To systematically identify organ- and development-specific markers across Arabidopsis development, we compared the pseudobulk expression of marker genes of all 183 major clusters (Supplementary Fig. 15a, calculated from Supplementary Tables 5 and 6; Methods). Of 4,528 genes identified as markers of at least one of the major clusters, 331 (7.3%) genes were uniquely identified as markers within only one dataset (Supplementary Table 4). Consistent with the unique expression patterns in the pseudobulk data, plotting the expression of these markers both in their natively expressed dataset (for example, stem phloem; Fig. 5f,g) and in the globally integrated dataset revealed that the expression of many of these markers (>70%) was restricted to individual clusters and/or subsets of clusters (Supplementary Fig. 15b), demonstrating that our atlas identifies transcripts uniquely expressed in certain cell types or cell states, present only within specific datasets.

We next questioned whether genes with unique expression patterns may have functional relevance within the natively expressed sample type. We evaluated 94 transfer DNA (T-DNA) mutant alleles66 of 46 marker genes uniquely identified or enriched as cluster or subcluster markers within individual datasets (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 15c and Supplementary Table 4). From these mutants, we identified diverse phenotypes for seven genes (15%), including alterations in leaf morphology and physiology, petiole length, bolting time, premature leaf senescence and abnormalities in silique length and morphology (Fig. 5i,j and Supplementary Fig. 15c). Of note, six of the seven genes were not previously associated with phenotypes, demonstrating the capacity to identify new phenotypes in mutants of genes with unique expression patterns. As an example, we focused on mutants of MYO-INOSITOL OXYGENASE 1 (MIOX1; AT1G14520), where we found that high expression of this gene was restricted to the silique dataset and was enriched within individual subclusters of this organ (Fig. 5h). In miox1 mutants, we observed a reduction (~1 mm) in the length of fully elongated siliques (Fig. 5i,j) without observing extraneous phenotypes in other tissues and developmental stages. These results were consistent in several miox1 mutants, suggesting a unique cell-type-specific role of MIOX1 in silique development throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle. Examining the expression of the other MIOX family members revealed similar trends of subcluster-specific expression in siliques for MIOX2 (AT2G19800), MIOX4 (AT4G26260) and MIOX5 (AT5G56640) (Extended Data Fig. 7), although in contrast to MIOX1, the expression of the other MIOX family members was instead restricted to other clusters and cell types in the silique dataset, which may suggest specific yet distinct roles of myo-inositol metabolism enzymes during silique development.

In dicotyledonous plants, the hypocotyl apical hook is a hallmark phenotype of dark-grown (etiolated) seedlings, which is necessary to prevent mechanical damage to the stem cells within the shoot apical meristem as seedlings emerge from soil67. To maintain the apical hook structure (Fig. 6a), it is understood that the opposing activity of the hormones auxin and ethylene causes epidermal and cortex cells to transiently undergo differential rates of cell elongation along the convex–concave axis, but as a ‘standing wave' of growth68, where individual cells transit from the shoot apical meristem, progress through and ultimately exit the apical hook in fewer than 12 hours69 (Fig. 6b). The transient positions of all individual cells as they pass through the apical hook thus represent unique cellular states at the intersection of developmental and hormonal regulation. We therefore sought to use the apical hook as a model to study cellular states.

The scale bar lengths are shown. b, Model of cellular states associated with the development and maintenance of the apical hook. Maximal activity levels of ethylene and auxin are localized to the convex and concave apices of the apical hook, respectively. Domains associated with the apical–basal axis of development from the shoot apical meristem to the basal hypocotyl are also depicted. c, Illustration of the experiments performed. Nuclei were isolated from three-day-old seedlings, with dissected shoot apex tissues collected from Col-0 and whole seedlings from hls1. d,e, Clustering of Col-0 shoot apex cells and whole hls1 seedlings. In d, nuclei from both datasets are plotted separately within the co-embedded UMAP space. The number of nuclei for each genotype among all clusters is depicted as a bar plot (right).

Annotations of select clusters are depicted. A cluster corresponding to cortex cells is circled. g, Left, re-clustering of the cortex cell cluster.

The colour bar represents the expression level. h,i, Spatial locations of transcripts associated with cellular states in the apical hook. The shoot apices of three-day-old dark-grown seedlings of Col-0 (left) and hls1 (right) are depicted. Transcripts with spatial expression patterns enriched within domains of the apical–basal axis of development (h) and the convex–concave domains of the apical hook (i) are depicted. The scale bar lengths are shown. For the micrographs in a, h and i, results were observed in at least eight seedlings for each genotype.

To provide a foundation for identifying cellular states within the apical hook, we generated paired single-nucleus and MERFISH datasets of dissected shoot apices containing the apical hook from wild-type seedlings, as well as whole seedlings of hookless1 (hls1; AT4G37580), which undergoes normal seedling development but specifically lacks the apical hook structure70 (Fig. 6c). Co-clustering of these datasets revealed that specific clusters (clusters 2, 3, 5 and 6) were overrepresented by nuclei of the Col-0 shoot apex and underrepresented in hls1 seedlings, revealing that these clusters represent cells in the apical hook (Fig. 6d,e).

Re-clustering of the apical hook cells revealed additional clusters that correspond to known cell types in hypocotyls (Fig. 6f). Further investigation of heterogeneity within cell types through subclustering analyses revealed a total of 24 subclusters that may represent distinct cellular states in all cell types present in the apical hook. To focus on cell states that may regulate differential growth programs within the apical hook, we focused on cortex clusters, which represent the most abundant cell type in the apical hook by volume71. Subclustering of cortex cluster 2 revealed five discrete cell populations in this cluster (Fig. 6g), where we identified INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE 32 (IAA32; AT2G01200) as a subcluster marker with known expression in the basal concave region of the apical hook72, which we also confirmed in our spatial datasets (Fig. 6h and Extended Data Fig. 8a). We also identified new markers with spatial expression restricted to cortex cells in convex and concave regions of the apical hook (Fig. 6h), as well as along the apical–basal axis of development (Fig. 6i). Additionally, expression of these markers was absent or reduced in straightened hypocotyls of hls1 (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9), further suggesting a role of cell-state markers in apical hook regulation.

While we were able to identify new markers of apical–basal and convex–concave positioning, we observed varying levels of co-expression of these markers both spatially and at the single-cell level, which suggests further spatial complexity in this tissue structure. This observation is exemplified by the basal apical hook cortex markers IAA32 and DEHYDRATION RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 26 (DREB26; AT1G21910), where we observed that IAA32 expression is uniquely restricted to the basal apical hook, while DREB26 expression is similarly expressed in the basal apical hook but also extends into the basal hypocotyl (Extended Data Fig. 8a). This observation is also reflected in the apical hook single-nucleus dataset, where we observed IAA32 and DREB26 co-expression in the same apical hook cortex cluster (cluster 2; Extended Data Fig. 8b, middle), but IAA32 and DREB26 expression becomes more distinct in apical hook cortex subclusters (Extended Data Fig. 8b, right). Together, these results highlight the fine-tuned spatiotemporal regulation of cortex cell neighbourhoods in the apical hook and suggests that IAA32 and other markers of cellular states in the apical hook may be directly involved in the regulation of differential growth to maintain this structure.

Finally, to understand the combinatorial interaction of cellular states that regulate orthogonal spatial axes aligned with developmental progression (apical–basal) and lateral asymmetry that underlies tissue bending (convex–concave), we examined cells that co-express markers of apical–basal and convex–concave patterning, which represent rare cell neighbourhoods of ten or fewer cells within a whole organism (for example, convex cells of the basal hypocotyl) (Extended Data Fig. 10). Independent analysis of all four cell groups revealed that markers of each of these populations were enriched for distinct and diverse Gene Ontology (GO) terms, many of which are associated with the regulation of growth or development, such as anatomical structure arrangement and pattern specification process, which are associated with apical–convex and apical–concave cell states, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16). Furthermore, several newly identified markers in enriched GO categories for all cellular states analysed have demonstrated function in apical hook regulation. Our comprehensive analysis of cellular states within the apical hook thus revealed diverse cellular states, represented by over 20 subclusters, as well as a role of spatiotemporally regulated cell-state genes, with pinpoint precision of expression, in wild-type growth and development of the apical hook.

In this study, we used single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic technologies to characterize cellular identities along the entire life cycle of the model plant Arabidopsis. As a resource of broad interest, complementary application of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic technologies enabled the annotation of known and new cell types and regions (Figs. 2–4) to diverse organs and tissues, many of which have not been investigated at high resolution or at the single-cell level. Our sampling of diverse organs allowed us to evaluate the transcriptomes of recurrent and unique cell populations across organs and developmental stages at the single-nucleus level, which revealed heterogeneity within individual cell types (Fig. 5). With an easily accessible web application, we believe that our life-cycle atlas will be of wide use to the plant science community and scientists interested in single-cell biology for hypothesis generation and reference for future single-cell genomics studies. The integration of our data with published single-cell protoplast-based datasets (Supplementary Fig. 17) demonstrates that our atlas can function as reference datasets onto which future single-cell omics data can be integrated to further annotate cell types and/or investigate cell-type-specific responses to environmental or chemical stimuli. Furthermore, proof-of-concept analyses demonstrate that spatial single-cell analyses are feasible using our datasets (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19).

Across the ten developmental time points assayed, we identified immense transcriptional diversity represented by 183 major clusters and 655 subclusters. In our datasets, we identified known cell types and, with the aid of our paired spatial transcriptomic datasets, were able to more finely annotate cellular populations that were obscured in our single-nucleus datasets, including individual cell layers within seed sacs (Fig. 3) and polarity-defined cells within cell types (Fig. 4). Our life-cycle atlas also highlights a cellular state defined by the expression of enzymes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway that promotes co-clustering of distinct cell populations (for example, tapetum, epidermis and gametophyte; Fig. 4) at the transcriptome-wide level of single cells. What remains undetermined is the level of influence of other secondary metabolite pathways and their effect on cellular transcriptomes throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle. For each of the 655 individual cell populations, newly identified marker genes may be of use for future characterization of other distinct and potentially new cell populations (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 3).

Comparative analyses of recurrent cell types across organs are a unique aspect of our developmental atlas compared with atlases of individual organs. By examining recurrent cell types, we revealed that the expression of organ-wide transcripts further influences the transcriptional identity of cells (Fig. 5). The expression of transcripts broadly within organ systems may indicate high levels of coordinated activity across cell types of a tissue, as is the case for flavonoid biosynthesis (Fig. 4), and may contribute to further transcriptional complexity within cell types.

Transcripts uniquely expressed in individual cell populations throughout development are of particular interest, as they may reveal unique functions and gene regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, cell types of the reproductive tissues were associated with greater quantities of uniquely expressed transcripts than other tissues, which may be attributed to cell types present only within these tissues. A phenotypic investigation of genes with cell-type and developmental specificity revealed that loss-of-function mutants are associated with diverse phenotypes only within the tissue of native expression context (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 15c). Many of the genes for which we identified new phenotypes are members of multigene families, demonstrating non-redundant functions of individual gene family members within their native expression contexts, as was the case for miox1, where we identified a new shortened silique phenotype (Fig. 5i,j). We found that the expression of the remaining members of the MIOX family (MIOX2, MIOX4 and MIOX5) are all enriched for distinct and separate cell types within siliques (Supplementary Fig. 7), which may suggest broad yet distinct spatially partitioned functional roles of myo-inositol metabolism in silique development. Higher-order mutation of MIOX family members may provide interesting future opportunities to investigate the role of myo-inositol metabolism in silique development in both cell-type-specific and organ-system contexts.

Reproductive organs are associated with the production of diverse and unique secondary metabolites73,74,75, such as flavonoids (Fig. 4), which may also be a basis for the observed unique expression patterns. We found that the expression of enzymes of the full flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was consistently associated with a single cluster in our flower dataset that encompasses epidermal, tapetal and female gametophyte cell types (Fig. 4m,n and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). An undefined alteration of cellular status or state within these cell types may occur upstream of flavonoid biosynthesis, and it will be interesting to investigate potential upstream regulatory programs that define this cellular switch in diverse cell types.

Finally, we demonstrated that the hypocotyl apical hook of Arabidopsis serves as an exemplary model for the investigation of complex, spatiotemporally regulated cellular states due to its intricate cellular composition and dynamic developmental processes. Our analysis uncovered 24 distinct cell-state subclusters in this compact anatomical structure that are associated with the apical hook's characteristic differential growth patterns. In cortex cells, which represent the most abundant cell type in the apical hook, we identified new subcluster-specific marker genes that exhibited precise spatial localization to regions of the apical hook, demonstrating clear transcriptional demarcation along both the apical–basal and convex–concave axes. Importantly, the spatial expression of these marker genes was markedly diminished or completely lost in the hls1 mutant, underscoring their critical roles in hook formation and curvature maintenance.

Further detailed analysis revealed cellular subpopulations co-expressing markers of both axes, such as cells uniquely positioned at intersections of apical–basal and convex–concave developmental gradients. Interestingly, we found that several of the newly identified markers of these cellular neighbourhoods have known functions in apical hook development, demonstrating that the spatiotemporal regulation of cellular states can be functionally relevant to wild-type form and function (Supplementary Fig. 16).

Collectively, our comprehensive analysis demonstrates the intricate cellular architecture and transcriptional specificity throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle. The complementary application of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic methodologies to diverse samples facilitated the annotation of the majority of clusters (138/183; 75%) in our life-cycle atlas. Several of the samples profiled currently lack comprehensively annotated single-cell reference datasets. As in situ spatial transcriptomic methodologies require knowledge of up to thousands of transcripts with distinct expression patterns, our datasets also function as a foundation for future spatial transcriptomics studies. Overall, our atlas highlights the complexity of cell types present throughout an organism's entire life cycle. Moreover, this atlas serves as a foundation for future studies that seek to further characterize specific organs and developmental stages or investigate stress or stimulus-driven responses. Researchers can access the processed datasets for rapid exploration in a web-based interface available at our web portal (http://arabidopsisdevatlas.salk.edu/).

For the imbibed seeds (0 days old), germinating seeds (1.25 days old), light-grown 3-, 6- and 12-day-old seedling developmental time points, and 3-day-old etiolated seedlings, Arabidopsis Col-0 seeds (CS6000) were surface-sterilized via incubation in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, followed by incubation in 50% (v/v) bleach and 0.01% (v/v) TWEEN-20 for 5 min, followed by triplicate washes in double distilled water for 5 min. Seeds of hls1-1 (CS3073) were sterilized identically. Sterilized seeds were placed onto 1 X Linsmaier and Skoog media (1.0 LS salts (Caisson Labs), 0.8% agar (w/v), 1% w/v Suc., pH 5.7) in 120-mm2 petri dishes at a density of 100 seeds per row for the 0-day and 1.25-day samples and 30 seeds per row for the 3-day, 6-day and 12-day samples. The imbibed seeds were stratified via incubation at 4 °C for three days in complete darkness. Following stratification, the plates were placed in a long-day (16 h light/8 h dark) growth chamber at 23 °C. For the Col-0 and hls1 three-day-old etiolated seedlings, the plates were placed in sealed dark chambers and grown in a growth chamber without lights at 23 °C. For the rosette, flower and silique tissues, seeds were sterilized identically to the seed and seedling samples, directly sown onto soil and grown at 23 °C in long-day conditions.

For all samples, at least two replicates, defined as multiple plates for seed and seedling time points or at least half a flat of plants (>18 plants) for later developmental stages, were prepared independently. Nucleus purification buffer (NPB; 20 mM MOPS (pH 7), 40 mM NaCl, 90 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.2 mM spermine, 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail, 2% BSA, 1:1,000 SUPERase IN) was prepared fresh and chilled on ice. All the following procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Tissues were chopped in 500–1,000 µl of cold NPB with a razor blade on ice for 5 min to release nuclei and incubated in 10 ml of NPB. For the 0-day and 1.25-day seed samples, the nuclei were extracted in 5 ml of NPB with a Dounce homogenizer with 20 strokes of the loose pestle followed by 20 strokes of the tight pestle. The crude nucleus extract was sequentially filtered through 70-µm and 30-µm cell strainers. BSA, Triton X-100 and NP40 were added to final concentrations of 2%, 0.05% and 0.05%, respectively, and the extract was incubated at 4 °C for 10 min with rotation. Nuclei were pelleted via centrifugation at 700 g for 5 min with a swing-rotor centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of NPBd (NPB, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.05% NP40, 2% BSA) via pipetting and incubated for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 700 g for 5 min. For seedlings and rosettes, additional washes in NPBd were performed until the pellet became translucent. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of NPB and centrifuged at 50 g for 3 min in a fixed-rotor centrifuge to pellet non-nucleus debris (including pollen grains from flower tissues), and the supernatant was taken. This step was repeated until the supernatant cleared or visible pellet was not observed. For root-containing tissues (seedlings), the nucleus suspension was filtered through Flowmi strainers (40 µm) to remove additional sources of debris. Finally, nuclei were pelleted via centrifugation at 700 g for 10 min with a swing-rotor centrifuge and resuspended in an appropriate volume of NPB. Nuclei were counted manually with a haemocytometer. Nuclei from each replicate were evenly distributed into at least four independent samples, with a targeted recovery of up to 20,000 nuclei per reaction. Each nucleus suspension was loaded into the 10x Genomics Chip M, which was then processed with a 10x Genomics Chromium X controller, and sequencing libraries were constructed following the manufacturer's instructions. Each sequencing library was sequenced with the Illumina NovaSeq 6000.

For the stem sample, three regions of the stem (base, branched area and apex) were harvested separately and multiplexed using the 3′ CellPlex Kit following the manufacturer's specifications (10x Genomics). Briefly, equal quantities of purified nuclei from each sample were individually labelled with separate CellPlex barcodes. Following labelling, the nuclei were pelleted and washed twice with PBS containing 2% BSA with RNase inhibitor. The nuclei were then quantified again using a haemocytometer and were pooled in equal quantities and brought to the appropriate volume for loading into the 10x Genomics Chip M as described previously.

Demultiplexed FASTQ files were used to generate gene-by-cell matrices with Cell Ranger (v.7.0.0)76 and were aligned to the Arabidopsis nuclear transcriptome using the include-introns flag, which was prepared with the TAIR10 genome and Araport 11 transcriptome. Downstream analyses were performed with the R (v.4.1.3)77 package Seurat (v.4.1.0)78. Low-quality and potential doublet nuclei were removed from the datasets. Nuclei that did not meet a cut-off of >300 and <7,000 genes detected, >400 UMI per nucleus, <5% mitochondrial or <15% chloroplast reads were removed.

For the analysis of single-tissue datasets, after filtering, 2,000 integration features for the aggregated datasets were determined for data scaling and dimensionality reduction using the SelectIntegrationFeatures function. Each of the datasets was then integrated using the IntegrateData function with 20 principal components (PCs). Following integration of each dataset, the entire dataset was scaled and dimensionality reduction was performed with PC analysis (PCA) followed by UMAP using 30 PCs. Identification of nearest neighbours and clustering were then performed using the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions, respectively. Cluster markers were then identified for each cluster using the FindAllMarkers function with logfc.theshold = 0.25 and min.pct = 0.1. For iterative subclustering, each individual cluster was subset and re-normalized, 2,000 variable features were identified, the data were scaled, dimensions were reduced via PCA and UMAP using 30 PCs, and neighbours and clusters were identified.

For the globally integrated dataset, all of the individual stringently filtered datasets were merged, and the data were normalized. Following the guidelines of refs. 79,80, 4,000 variable features were identified and used for PCA, and pre-clustering was performed with Harmony (v.0.1.0)81 using 50 PCs. t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding was then performed according to ref. 82 using the harmony embeddings with the perplexity value equal to the number of nuclei in the dataset divided by 100 and the learning rate equal to the number of nuclei divided by 12.

For cell annotation, we used marker genes identified in previous studies using promoters and GUS/GFP fusions, in situ hybridization assays, bulk RNA-seq studies of dissected tissues and single-cell atlases of roots, shoot apical meristem, young leaves and inflorescence stems (Supplementary Table 1). For newly identified marker genes of each cluster, the numbers of curated cell-type markers were divided by the number of cluster marker genes to calculate the cell-type enrichment score. We also explored the expression of top cluster markers in databases such as TAIR (www.arabidopsis.org) and ePlant (bar.utoronto.ca/eplant/). Finally, we used spatial transcriptomics generated during this study for seeds, seedlings, stems, flowers and siliques to validate cell identities and uncover identities of unannotated clusters. For annotating silique major clusters, a curated list of marker genes was used35.

To integrate our 21-day-old and 30-day-old rosette single-nucleus datasets with a published leaf protoplast dataset19, each dataset was individually loaded, normalized and scaled using SCTransform83, and 30 PCs were used for dimensionality reduction. Integration anchors were calculated using the FindTransferAnchors function using the protoplast dataset as the reference dataset. Cell-type label transfer, low-dimensional embedding correction and dataset projection of the nucleus datasets were performed using the MapQuery function.

To integrate the seedling and rosette time-series datasets, each dataset was pre-processed as described previously, and each dataset within the developmental time series was merged. For each merged dataset, PCs were calculated, and Harmony (v.0.1.0)81 was used to integrate the datasets regressing variables of dataset input and percentage of mitochondrial and chloroplastic reads, rounded to the nearest integer. Dimensionality reduction, nearest neighbour identification and clustering were then performed using 20 harmony dimensions. Identification of cluster markers was performed as described previously for individual datasets.

First, we identified marker genes for individual clusters of each tissue type (that is, for 183 clusters) using the FindAllMarkers function of Seurat (adjusted P < 0.0005, average log2(fold change) > 2). We then checked whether these cluster marker genes are highly expressed in other organs using pseudobulk expression data of each cluster. A marker gene candidate was removed when (1) its normalized expression level in the target cluster was not more than fourfold higher than that in any other clusters in the other organs or (2) the log2 TPM value of the gene was higher than five in any clusters in the other organs. In this way, we removed genes that are cell-type-specific in a particular organ but are also expressed in other organs. In this analysis, we defined organs in the following way: imbibed and germinating seeds (0 days and 1.25 days), seedlings (3 days, 6 days and 12 days), rosettes (21 days and 30 days), stems, flowers and siliques.

Clusters identified from the global dataset that were well represented by several datasets were selected and individually subset. Re-clustering was performed as described previously. For cross-tissue comparisons of datasets, the tissue dataset that comprised the majority population of each subcluster was specified as the organ identity for each subcluster. Systematic identification of subcluster markers was performed, and unique and overlapping sets of subcluster marker genes were visualized using ComplexUpset (v.1.3.3)84. Intersections of subcluster groups with fewer than ten shared subcluster markers were filtered for visualization.

GO term enrichment of cluster and subcluster markers was performed with ClusterProfiler (v.4.2.2)85 using the enrichGO function, and P values were adjusted via the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.

A list of marker genes of silique major clusters and subclusters were filtered using the following criteria: (1) more than 25 specific probes could be designed on the basis of Vizgen's software, and (2) the TPM value was below 1,000 in the silique pseudobulk RNA-seq data (obtained by aggregating all the silique cells). After the filtering, 140 genes representing most major clusters and selected subclusters were chosen from the remaining marker genes. The panel design was balanced so that the total TPM value of 140 transcripts was below 11,000 to avoid overcrowding of signal.

A list of marker genes of three-day-old seedling shoot apex major clusters and subclusters was filtered using the following criteria: (1) more than 25 specific probes could be designed on the basis of Vizgen's software, and (2) the TPM value was below 1,000 in the three-day-old seedling pseudobulk RNA-seq data86. After filtering, 600 genes representing most major clusters and subclusters were selected in addition to 400 transcription factors with expression that was specific to clusters and/or subclusters in the three-day-old seedling dataset. The panel design was balanced so that the total TPM value of 1,000 transcripts was below 15,000 to avoid overcrowding of signal.

Plants were grown according to the previously described methods. Tissues of three-day-old etiolated seedlings, the stem apex, mature unpollinated flowers and fully elongated siliques matching the aforementioned developmental stages were excised and immediately incubated in OCT (Fisher) for 5 min to acclimate the tissue. Following incubation, the tissue was placed into cryomolds (Sakura), which were filled with OCT and immediately frozen in an isopentane bath cooled by liquid N2. Tissue blocks were acclimated to −18 °C in a pre-cooled cryostat chamber (Leica) for 1 h. The tissue blocks were trimmed until the tissue was entered, after which 10-µm sections were visually inspected until the region of interest was exposed. Sample mounting and preparation were performed according to the MERSCOPE user guide, with slight modifications. Briefly, a 10-µm section was melted and mounted onto a room-temperature MERSCOPE slide (Vizgen, 20400001), placed into a 60-mm petri dish and re-frozen via incubation in the cryostat chamber for 5 min. Subsequent steps were performed with the mounted samples in the petri dish. The samples were then baked at 37 °C for 5 min and incubated in fixation buffer (1× PBS, 4% formaldehyde) for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were then washed with 1× PBS containing 1:500 RNAse inhibitor (Protector RNAse Inhibitor, Millipore Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature in triplicate. Following the final PBS wash, the samples were dehydrated via incubation in 70% EtOH at 4 °C overnight.

Tissue sections were processed following Vizgen's protocol. After the 70% ethanol was removed, the sample was incubated in the Sample Prep Wash Buffer (PN20300001) for 1 min and then incubated in the Formamide Wash Buffer (PN20300002) at 37 °C for 30 min. After the Formamide Wash Buffer was removed, the sample was incubated in MERSCOPE Gene Panel Mix at 37 °C for 42 h. The 1,000-target panel was used for the three-day-old etiolated seedling (Col and hls1), stem apex and flower (cross section) samples, while the silique panel was used for the flower (longitudinal) and silique samples. After the probe hybridization, the sample was washed twice with the Formamide Wash Buffer at 47 °C for 30 min and once with the Sample Prep Wash Buffer at room temperature for 2 min. After the washing, the sample was embedded in hydrogel by incubating it in the Gel Embedding Solution (Gel Embedding Premix (PN20300004), 10% w/v ammonium persulfate solution and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine) at room temperature for 1.5 h. The sample was then cleared by first incubating it in the Digestion Mix (Digestion Premix (PN 20300005) and 1:40 RNase inhibitor) at room temperature for 2 h, followed by the incubation in the Clearing Solution (Clearing Premix (PN 20300003) and Proteinase K) at 47 °C for 24 h and then at 37°C for 24 h. The cleared sample was washed twice with the Sample Prep Wash Buffer and stained with DAPI and PolyT Staining Reagent at room temperature for 15 min and then washed with the Formamide Wash Buffer at room temperature for 10 min and rinsed with the Sample Prep Wash Buffer. The sample was imaged with the MERSCOPE Instrument, and detected transcripts were decoded on the MERSCOPE Instrument using a Codebook generated by Vizgen. Transcripts were visualized on Vizgen's Vizualizer.

Germinating seeds (1.25 days) were grown as previously described and were subsequently submerged in OCT in a cryomold (Sakura) and flash-frozen in a liquid N2 cooled isopentane bath. Cryosectioning of the 1.25-day-old germinating seeds was performed as described above. Following sectioning, the frozen section was arranged onto the centre of the Curio Seeker Spatial Mapping Kit (Curio Bioscience) and gently melted and stored at −80 °C until further processing according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, the frozen tile was gently thawed to room temperature and submerged in Hybridization Reaction Mix for 15 min, followed by sequential transfers to wash buffer and RT Reaction Mix at room temperature. Reverse transcription was performed via incubation at 52 °C for 30 min followed by tissue digestion with the addition of Tissue Clearing Reaction Mix and incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Following tissue digestion, the beads were dissociated from the tile by the addition of Bead Wash Buffer and pipetting. The released beads were transferred to a new tube, pelleted via centrifugation and washed twice in Bead Wash Buffer. Following the second wash, the beads were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and then pelleted and immediately resuspended Second Strand Mix and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Following incubation, Bead Wash Buffer was added, and the beads were washed three times with Bead Wash Buffer. After the third wash, the beads were resuspended in and amplified in cDNA Amplification Mix via PCR. The amplified cDNA was then purified and quantified, followed by tagmentation and clean-up. The libraries were then sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000.

Spot demultiplexing was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications using the Seeker Bioinformatic Pipeline (Curio Bioscience). The resulting spot-by-gene matrix was used for downstream analysis with Seurat (v.4.1.0). Empty and low-quality spots with fewer than 125 genes detected or 125 UMIs were removed. The filtered dataset was normalized with SCTransform with the variable features calculated with a residual variance cut-off of 1. Spatially aware clustering was performed on a SpatialExperiment (v.1.12.0) object using Banksy (v.0.99.7)87 with the parameters lambda = 0.2 and k_geom = 10, and the resulting matrix was used for PCA followed by UMAP dimensionality reduction with 20 PCs, followed by nearest neighbour identification and clustering. Identification of cluster markers was performed as described previously.

Cell segmentation was performed using Baysor88 (v.0.7.1) on the processed transcript coordinate matrix with the following parameters: s, 6; x, global_x; y, global_y; g, gene; m, 20; p; n-clusters, 10; scale-std, 90%; count-matrix-format, ‘tsv'.

Cell segmentation boundaries, centroids, molecule positions and cell-by-gene count matrices were analysed with Seurat v.5.2.1. All datasets were analysed individually and were normalized with SCTransform for all targets detected in each spatial dataset with the parameter clip.range = c(−10, 10). PCs were calculated and used for UMAP dimensionality reduction with 30 PCs, followed by nearest neighbour identification and clustering. Identification of cluster markers was performed as described previously.

Plants were grown as previously described until all flowers had dehisced. All fully elongated siliques from the primary stem (n > 9) were harvested from all individual plants. The length of the silique was measured using digital calipers from the tip to the base of the silique and was rounded to the nearest 0.1 mm. For Col-0 and the miox1-1 mutant, siliques from a total of eight individuals across three biological replicates were measured. For the miox1-2 and miox1-3 mutants, silique measurements were taken from two individuals from two biological replicates. For the statistical analysis, an unpaired Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed for each miox1 mutant compared with Col-0, and the figures were generated using ggplot2 (v.3.3.6)89 and ggpubr (v.0.6.0)90.

For the spatial transcriptomic experiments, similar results were observed across individual samples and across independent experiments. For the germinating seed dataset, n > 10 independent seeds were profiled simultaneously in one experiment. For the Col-0 seedling dataset, n = 8 independent seedlings were simultaneously profiled in one experiment. Technical replication of adjacent tissue sections was performed for the same seedlings. Identical sampling of n = 8 independent seedlings was performed for the hls1 seedling dataset. For the stem dataset, n = 1 stem was profiled. For the flower dataset, n = 3 independent flowers were profiled (n = 2 in transverse orientation, n = 1 in longitudinal orientation) across two experiments. For the silique dataset, n = 3 independent siliques were profiled in one experiment.

Can Peanut Allergies Be Cured?

Remarkable new treatments can free millions of kids and adults from the deadly threat of peanut allergy, tackling one of our fastest-growing medical problems

By Maryn McKenna edited by Josh Fischman

Andrew B. Myers

Anabelle Terry, a slender, self-possessed 13-year-old, has heard the peanut butter story her entire life. At two and a half she ate nuts for the first time. Her mother, Victoria, had made a little treat: popcorn drizzled with melted caramel, chocolate and peanut butter. Anabelle gobbled it down. “And afterward, I felt really sick,” she says. A few minutes later she vomited on the kitchen floor.

There was more trouble ahead. A visit to an allergist confirmed that Anabelle was severely allergic to the peanut butter in the dessert, as well as to most other nuts. It began a life upheaval familiar to families of kids with allergies: learning to decode labels, to carry an EpiPen, and to interrogate friends and their parents about the ingredients in a birthday cake.

Every once in a while, there would be a slip-up. It might be a snack that someone hadn't scrutinized or a food package that didn't list all potential allergens. And every time, Anabelle's reactions got worse. Although she was just a schoolkid, she had to stay alert. “Eating lunch, all my friends would have PB&Js. And I'd be like, I'm going to sit a little bit farther away,” she recalls. “And going over to friends' houses after school, we always had to make sure: ‘Hey, would you mind making a nut-free meal?'”

Most of that caution is in Anabelle's past now. For the vast majority of patients, peanut allergy is an unpredictable, lifelong affliction. But thanks to a clinical trial that Anabelle entered when she was nine, she can now tolerate peanuts and tree nuts well enough to feel safe every day. The drug she received in that trial was approved for treating food allergies by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year, making it the second food allergy remedy to earn the agency's blessing since 2020. And an array of other clinical trials are tackling peanut allergy in a variety of ways, from new modalities for desensitizing patients to bold new applications of existing drugs. Some have reported striking successes. “It's an amazing time right now,” says R. Sharon Chinthrajah, an associate professor at Stanford Medicine, who led the national trial Anabelle joined.

In fact, medicine's entire understanding of how to keep children safe from ever developing allergies is being rethought. With peanut reactions, for instance, there are real hopes that children can be protected—definitely from the worst effects and maybe from any at all. “The future looks very bright for our patients to have more choices in different periods in their lifetime,” Chinthrajah says. “We're not yet at the cure, but we're definitely moving along on the therapeutic front to be able to deal with this chronic disease.”

Peanut allergies are perplexing, in part because they appeared so recently. Food reactions have occurred throughout recorded history, but widespread peanut problems didn't begin to surface until the 1990s. The effects on everyday life were dramatic: airlines began to deprive passengers of peanuts and announce that certain snacks might threaten someone else onboard. Elementary schools set aside peanut-free tables at lunch, and food manufacturers began to label their baked goods “school-safe” to signal they were free of common allergens. Epinephrine auto-injectors, which can shut down severe allergic shock (and are usually called EpiPens, for the dominant trademarked version), were rare and carried mostly for the occasional beesting. Now they are a ubiquitous, nearly $3-billion product.

Scott Sicherer, a clinician and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, watched reports of peanut threats rise in real time. In 1997 he and his colleagues conducted the first survey of peanut and tree-nut allergy in the U.S., finding that 1.6 percent of adults and 0.6 percent of children described themselves as allergic based on reactions they had experienced. The group repeated the survey with a similar-size representative sample five years later and learned that the rate of nut allergies reported in children had doubled to 1.2 percent. In a third sampling, conducted 11 years after the first one, the overall rate tripled from that initial measurement to 2.1 percent of children, and peanut allergies were reported in 1.4 percent of kids.

Since then, the prevalence has risen even more. A large national survey of parents conducted between 2015 and 2016 by researchers in Illinois and California found that food allergies affect 7.6 percent of U.S. children, and peanut allergy affects 2.2 percent. An analysis of health-care payment data in 2018 asked how many new diagnoses of peanut allergy there are among children born each year—what statisticians call incidence, as opposed to prevalence—and reported a rate of 5 percent. And what's more common is now also more dire: researchers at the Mayo Clinic have estimated that emergency-department visits for anaphylactic shock caused by foodborne allergies—the kind of reaction that can squeeze shut airways and trigger heart attacks—increased more than threefold between 2005 and 2014. The highest rate was for peanut allergies.

“One out of 10 individuals in the U.S., more than 33 million, has a food allergy,” says Sung Poblete, CEO of Food Allergy Research and Education, an advocacy organization. “One out of 13 kids has food allergies. That's two kids out of every classroom.”

Medicine's entire understanding of how to keep children safe from allergies is being rethought.

This increase—which is happening around the world, though not at the same rate in every nation—is a mystery. Food allergy is fundamentally a disease of inflammation. The immune system recognizes certain proteins in a food as unwelcome and launches a cascading reaction that often involves an antibody called IgE. The antibody triggers a whole-body inflammatory response: hives, swelling, vomiting, and, in the worst cases, crashing blood pressure and an inability to breathe. “Inflammatory diseases of many kinds are more common than they used to be,” says Brian Vickery, a professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine and director of the Food Allergy Program at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, who is a principal investigator on multiple clinical trials. “Eczema, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cancer, depression—all these things have inflammatory origins and are more common now.”

The reasons seem to be varied. Researchers have proposed that cleaner modern life, early antibiotic exposure, and microbiome damage from detergents and surfactants—all components of what's called the hygiene hypothesis—might influence how often allergies develop. Genetics may predispose people to react to certain foods. There may be a clue as well in which foods provoke reactions. Up to 90 percent of food allergies are caused by just eight things: peanuts, milk, eggs, fish, crustaceans, tree nuts, wheat and soybeans. (These are the foods that, according to a 2004 U.S. law, have to be declared on labels; a separate 2021 law added sesame to the list.) Why these foods are especially allergenic also puzzles researchers. They contain complex proteins, which remain intact during digestion and may trigger the immune system in ways other foods do not; these proteins also may have similarities to common environmental allergens.

Regardless of the underlying causes, research is zeroing in on ways to mitigate food allergies. Peanut allergy is the priority because the disruptions it imposes have become so visible in society. But the hope is that some of the new approaches can be applied to other allergies—and to help children such as Anabelle who experience more than one.

The first priority in tackling peanut allergy has been children who are at extraordinary risk, the ones whose lives are at stake if they consume something with the smallest cross-contamination from a manufacturing error.

Andrew B. Myers

People who suffer from seasonal allergies often receive allergy shots, a program of injections that gradually decreases their sensitivity and keeps their reactions at a level they can tolerate. Allergy shots were briefly tried for peanuts as well, but they were abandoned because of safety concerns, including the 1991 death of a trial participant who received a miscalculated dose. After that, patients' only remaining option was to change their diet, but mistakes and cross-contamination kept putting them at risk. It took more than a decade for immunologists to try a different method of desensitization for peanut allergies that had a century-old history: giving minuscule, escalating doses by mouth, a process called oral immunotherapy. A large international study in 2018 definitively proved that the approach worked, and it became the standard for treating kids whose families weren't willing to trust avoidance. In 2020 it led to the first-ever FDA approval of a therapy for peanut allergy, a powdered form of peanut protein with the trade name Palforzia that is dispensed over months in precisely metered doses.

That was a huge advance—but, for some families, still not a solution. Initially Palforzia was not approved for children younger than four years of age. Dosing needed to be extremely precise and, according to some practitioners, was tricky to manage. Plus, the drug debuted at the start of the COVID pandemic, when repeat office visits for dose changes became especially challenging. And as the drug's own labeling acknowledges, taking it poses the possibility of reactions. That has left some allergy families searching for alternatives to oral immunotherapy. “Ten to 20 percent of patients can't finish the treatment because of the side effects,” says Edwin H. Kim, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and director of the UNC Food Allergy Initiative. “And up to 10 percent of patients experience anaphylaxis at some point while they're on the treatment itself.”

Kim is participating in research into two other methods for presenting smaller doses of peanut allergens to the immune system safely: sublingually (under the tongue) and on the skin. The skin method involves a patch containing peanut protein that is applied daily at home for as many as three years; the patch always contains the same dose but is gradually applied for escalating amounts of time. In a phase 3 clinical trial, the results of which were published in 2023, 67 percent of toddlers who were too young to receive Palforzia and who wore the patch were able to raise the amount of peanut protein they could safely consume to the equivalent of three or four peanuts. That was twice as many children as in the placebo group.

The hope for the patch, which has not yet been approved by the FDA, is that it will be easier for kids to tolerate because of its lower dose and easier for parents to manage logistically. Lora Milburn's son, Vance, wore it for a year as a trial participant. He was eight months old when he started showing allergy symptoms—too young to have words for what he was experiencing—and four years old when he entered the trial through Kim's clinic. He was expected to finish the trial in August of this year, and his mother already thinks his sensitivity is diminished. She does not know whether he received the real treatment or a placebo, but she has noticed the way he reacts to the patch. “Some days he doesn't really complain about it; some days he's scratching his back against the wall trying to get the itchies out,” she says. “But he knows why we're doing it. If it's nighttime, he's like, ‘Mommy, take my patch off, put my new patch on.'”

All these exposure therapies—the patch, the oral doses, the version that goes under the tongue—target reactions to specific peanut allergens. But a separate cadre of researchers has envisioned the struggle to control peanut responses as an entryway to remodeling the way that the immune system reacts to food more broadly.

Jen Christiansen: Sources: “Food Allergy Facts and Statistics for the U.S.,” published by FARE (Food Allergy Research & Education), July 2024, foodallergy.org (prevalence data); “The Epidemiology of Multifood Allergy in the United States: A Population-Based Study,” by Christopher M. Warren et al., in Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, Vol. 130; May 2023 (multiallergy reference)

In 2013 they began testing the efficacy of an existing drug, a monoclonal antibody named omalizumab (marketed as Xolair) that is already approved for severe asthma caused by allergies. “It's an anti-IgE biologic, and IgE antibodies are at the center of the whole allergic inflammatory cascade,” Chinthrajah explains. “And the beauty of something like that, where you're targeting allergic inflammation, is that it has the potential to help all allergies.”

Investigators launched a trial that admitted children and adults who showed allergies to peanuts and at least two other foods; Anabelle Terry was one of the participants. Using a complex study design with several stages, the scientists tested whether regular doses of the injectable drug worked better to reduce allergic sensitivity than did placebos; whether shorter or longer courses of the drug made a difference; whether it worked best alone or combined with oral immunotherapy; and how often and in what amounts people could consume allergenic food once they stopped the treatment.

In 2024 the researchers (a very large team working in multiple medical centers) published the first results. In children aged one to 17 years, 67 percent of those who received the drug were able to eat the equivalent of four peanuts, enough to keep them safe from any accidental exposure. Based on those results, and anticipating more data, the FDA immediately approved Xolair as a protection against peanut allergy.

Participating in the trial was a significant commitment for families. Jennifer Jennison's son, Jack, was two years old and allergic to eggs, peanuts and cashews—among other foods—when the trial accepted him at its Atlanta site. Every two weeks she or her husband, David, would take time off work to bring their son for an injection. After around seven months, the protocol added tests of small doses of food allergens in applesauce to the office visits; after several hours of observation to make sure the dose was safe, the family carried home boxes of premeasured allergen powder for Jack to eat every day. And in a third phase, Jack progressed to a daily maintenance regimen with actual food: powdered egg white, a cashew and seven Reese's Pieces.

Jack's experience is similar to Anabelle's. She was in the same arm of the trial and now eats a daily dose of peanuts, walnuts and cashews to keep her protection up. But what happened to the Jennisons afterward shows that no peanut-allergy protection is perfect yet. Convincing a child to eat the same foods every day is no small task. First Jack refused his maintenance dose of cashew. After a while he started to resist the Reese's Pieces, too.

The Jennisons live in Atlanta, the corporate home of Chick-fil-A, and seemingly every kid's birthday party features the restaurant's nuggets as well as a cake—which both contain eggs. “For us, eggs are the most important,” Jennifer says. “I still feel more comfortable with the cross-contamination risk of peanut knowing that he had built up a tolerance. But for now we're back to avoidance.”

Because new approaches to desensitization have worked so well for severely affected kids, researchers have begun to address the needs of those who are somewhat less allergic. For instance, some kids can eat half a peanut before suffering a reaction. That's a tiny amount from the perspective of a nonallergic person, but it's a huge, life-threatening dose to a highly allergic one. Such people, whom some immunologists call “high threshold,” include possibly 800,000 kids with peanut allergies just in the U.S. But their triggers are so different from those of highly allergic people that they had been excluded from some trials of desensitization strategies. Indeed, immunology didn't have a clear understanding of whether desensitization that started from their baseline would even achieve the same results as in highly allergic kids.

All of that is now changing because after years of diagnosing patients in this class, medical practitioners could perceive that the group was being left behind. “We would have children who maybe would eat half of a serving before they would start to have symptoms,” Sicherer says. “And what we would tell those individuals is: ‘Your symptoms weren't so bad, so you're not really that much in danger. You still need to avoid it, but if there were a small accident, maybe you would be okay.'”

Jackson Esteves was 10 months old when his parents discovered his allergies. His mother, Holly, who was so thoughtful about her children's diets that she made her own baby food, was starting to introduce him to solids. She made a spinach pancake for her older daughter, slid a few morsels onto Jackson's high-chair tray, and then watched in horror as raised red hives rippled down his body. The pancake contained eggs, and tests showed that Jackson was allergic to them—and to dairy, sesame, tree nuts and peanuts.

Andrew B. Myers

The diagnosis sent the Esteveses, who live on Long Island in New York State, hurtling into a landscape familiar to other allergy families. “I was suddenly attuned to every food label,” Holly says now, 10 years later. “I was learning how to modify recipes. I became very insecure in social settings, family parties, birthday parties. I had to bring everything for him.” What made it even more complex was that no one else in the family—Jackson's parents, his older sister, or a younger sister who was born soon after the pancacke incident—shared Jackson's allergies.

The Esteves family didn't know it at the time, but Jackson's allergies concealed a kernel of promise. Although he was extremely reactive to some foods, medicine considered him just minimally allergic to peanuts—and that made him eligible for a new trial launched by Sicherer and a team of researchers from several institutions, called CAFETERIA. (Allergy researchers seem to be exceptionally fond of complex acronyms. “CAFETERIA” comes from “Challenging to Foods with Escalating Thresholds for Reducing Food Allergy.” The Xolair study was known as OUtMATCH, which stood for “Omalizumab as Monotherapy and as Adjunct Therapy to Multi-Allergen Oral Immunotherapy in Food Allergic Children and Adults.”)

Starting in 2019, children between four and 14 years old consumed escalating doses of peanut butter, first under medical supervision and then at home, first with a carefully measured eighth of a teaspoon and increasing every eight weeks until they were consuming one tablespoon daily. Then they were asked to eat two tablespoons of peanut butter—the amount that would go in a sandwich, which an allergic child would never try to consume—every week for 16 weeks but not necessarily in daily doses. Finally, they had to refrain for eight weeks before being tested a final time.

It worked. Among the 32 kids in the peanut-eating arm of the study (as opposed to a control group that avoided peanuts), every child achieved the study's final goal of consuming the equivalent of about three tablespoons of peanut butter without a reaction.

That result was “amazing,” says Patricia Fulkerson, chief of the food-allergy section of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which funded the escalation study. “A 100 percent response rate is hard not to be happy with.”

Jen Christiansen; Source: “National Trends in Emergency Department Visits and Hospitalizations for Food-Induced Anaphylaxis in US Children,” by Megan S. Motosue et al., in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Vol. 29, August 2018 (emergency department data)

The study's authors say it needs to be repeated in more kids and at different medical centers. Jackson, who turned 11 this year, has been able to eat peanuts safely since he completed his participation in CAFETERIA; he'll even eat a PB&J once in a while, although it is not a favorite food. Most of his allergies to other foods remain unaffected, but “he was a success story” all the same, his mother says. “He's over peanut allergy.”

Even though the CAFETERIA study worked at its small scale and the different approach in the OUtMATCH trial resulted in an FDA drug approval, those tests and others share a limiting feature: they are hard for both the children going through them and the parents guiding them. The kids have to push themselves to swallow something that has made them ill in the past and that still, even in tiny doses, might produce an unpleasant reaction. Parents have to endure the stress of watching their children undergo food challenges to test their progress, knowing that life-threatening anaphylaxis might result.

Plus, for highly allergic people, the most that desensitization can offer is to keep them safer, not completely safe. “Ultimately we're not curing the allergy,” Vickery says. “We're kind of providing a protective shell around the patient, a way to defend them against an accidental exposure. They're still reading labels, they're still avoiding the food, they are still carrying their epinephrine.” What families long for is something that could make peanut allergy just go away.

A newly proposed treatment might manage that by rewriting the immune system's memory of antigens—although research into it is in such early stages that results have been reported for only one patient, and the first small clinical trial is just beginning.

The treatment involves successive administration of two drugs, both made by biotechnology company Regeneron. The first drug, dupilumab (marketed as Dupixent), is a monoclonal antibody that is already FDA-approved for treating moderate to severe eczema and asthma and a few other conditions; it works by blocking the action of specific cytokines, signaling proteins that encourage the production of IgE. The second, linvoseltamab, is also an antibody and recently received FDA approval for treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This cancer affects plasma cells, a category of white blood cell that produces antibodies, including IgE.

Investigators initially thought that dupilumab could be a solo treatment for peanut allergy. But several trials showed that although peanut-specific IgE levels went down under its influence, there was no long-term practical benefit. Even immediately after a course of the drug in one trial, participants were unable to tolerate peanuts. In another test, drug recipients showed improved peanut tolerance right away, but it dropped three months later. IgE availability bounced back.

That led researchers to look at the second drug, which deals a mortal blow to the cells where IgE is manufactured. In mice and monkeys, administering a dose of linvoseltamab during an ongoing course of dupilumab destroyed the cells producing IgE. Continuing the dupilumab while the plasma cells grew back suppressed allergic inflammation and kept the animals' immune systems from restarting the overreactions.

“This is very different than other approaches of trying to build tolerance in patients or trying to just decrease IgE,” says Jennifer Maloney, who leads Regeneron's therapeutic work on immune, inflammatory and infectious diseases. “This is something that potentially could remove that allergic antibody from the person.”

The company has shared results from just one patient so far, a 20-year-old man with multiple severe allergies. Regeneron described his treatment at the J. P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2025, documenting a dramatic drop in his IgE production during the dupilumab course and after the linvoseltamab was given. His case has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but the company is now recruiting a small group of patients for an early-phase trial that will primarily test safety. Vickery plans to enroll one patient at Emory, where linvoseltamab is already being used to treat cancer patients.

“We're going to learn something really important,” he says. “If we wanted to cure the disease and make it go away, would this be a viable approach to doing so? If it doesn't work, we're going to learn things about why it didn't work and what we might need to do in the next trial.”

There is another goal of peanut-allergy science. It's the ultimate goal: prevention, not desensitization or cure. And that may be possible for children being born now, thanks to a British study that has been running for more than a decade—and to a snack.

In the early 2000s Gideon Lack, an immunologist then at Imperial College London, went to Tel Aviv to give a talk on how food allergies were rising around the world. He asked the audience, all Israeli pediatricians and allergists, how many of them had treated children with peanut allergy. From his own experience in the U.K., he expected every hand to shoot up. Only a few did.

This low show of hands was extraordinary, and it immediately presented an opportunity to ask why the U.K. and Israel were so different. After returning home, Lack set up a survey to compare national rates of peanut allergy. To rule out some undetected genetic difference in the Israeli kids, he chose to limit the survey to Jewish children, recruiting roughly 5,000 in each country. The results revealed that the occurrence of peanut allergy in Israeli kids was one-tenth the rate among U.K. ones. A second set of questions posed to a subset of the children, 77 in the U.K. and 99 in Israel, hinted at why the rates were so different. Before their first birthday, Israeli children frequently ate peanuts, often in a ubiquitous snack called Bamba—something like Cheetos but coated in peanut butter instead of cheese. By the time they were 14 months old, almost 80 percent of the Israeli children were eating at least a few grams of peanut protein every month. In contrast, 80 percent of the British children had never tasted peanuts.

Early introduction clearly will prevent peanut allergy. “It does work. It's the right thing to do.” —Gideon Lack, King's College London

It made sense that kids in the U.K. weren't eating peanuts because at the time, medical authorities there and in the U.S. recommended that allergy-causing foods be kept out of the diets of children from allergy-prone families until they were three years old. Lack and his team wondered whether the Israeli experience showed that this well-meaning advice might be wrong. They set up a fresh study, recruiting families with infants who were between four and 10 months old and had severe eczema or showed evidence of egg allergy, signs that their IgE production was already disrupted. The babies were tested for preexisting peanut allergy, and if they were negative, they went into one of two groups. The families of one group were told to keep their children from eating peanuts until they were five years old. The rest of the families were encouraged to introduce their kids to peanut products, preferably Bamba or peanut butter.

When the investigators tested the children five years later, the differences were stark. Among the children told to avoid peanuts, 13.7 percent developed peanut allergies. Among the children who began eating peanuts early, only 1.9 percent did—an 86 percent difference.

Lack published the results in 2015, working with a team primarily from King's College London, where he had moved to research pediatric allergies. This study, called LEAP (for “Learning Early About Peanut Allergy,” in a departure from long acronyms), caused an earthquake in allergy science. Anthony Fauci, at the time the director of NIAID, which helped to fund it, said it had “the potential to transform how we approach food-allergy prevention.”

Two more studies cemented the findings. In one, published the following year, children from both arms of the LEAP study were asked to not eat peanut products in their sixth year. Allergy rates rose further among the children who had refrained from peanuts all along, but children who started eating peanut products early maintained their low rates of allergy.

In a third, published in 2024, the team went back to children who had been in the LEAP study and were at least 12 years old to check whether the preventive effect lasted. It had. In the group that refrained from peanuts up to age five, 15.4 percent were allergic to peanuts. In the group that ate peanut products early, only 4.4 percent had bad reactions. Early introduction “overwhelmingly will prevent peanut allergy,” Lack says. “It clearly has been shown that it does work. It's the right thing to do.”

But there have been persistent challenges to implementing that idea. Health authorities no longer recommend that parents avoid feeding allergy-related foods for three years—but most national and international guidelines still recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, and the cultural pressure to maintain that time frame is immense. In 2019 the American Academy of Pediatrics did revise its guidance to allow the introduction of potential allergens at four to six months for children who seem likely to be at high risk, indicated by symptoms of eczema.

Lack worries this approach doesn't provide exposure as early in life as the immune system needs; the children in the LEAP study and in an unrelated 2016 study of early introduction began peanut exposure at four and three months, respectively. “To introduce peanuts effectively in a four-month-old baby, they need to be trained to eat solids already,” he says. “If you start the weaning process at four months, then the baby may not get peanut butter in significant quantities until five to six months of age. And if it's a baby with eczema, it's too late.”

Andrew B. Myers

The challenge of prevention at this point may be not the science of immunology but rather the science of implementation. Scientists have to persuade parents and health-care providers that it's safe to implement new knowledge. Immunologists and allergists are aware that early feeding prevents allergy. Pediatricians, who have to handle many additional issues in young children's lives, might not have caught up. But “an allergist isn't going to see somebody who doesn't have peanut allergy already,” NIH's Fulkerson says. “You have to get the pediatricians involved because they're the ones who see the babies first.”

As many advances as there have been in the past decade, scientists worry that the fundamentals of peanut allergy still elude them. Why it exists, what triggers it, what keeps the immune system from outgrowing it—these basic questions remain unanswered. But the ability to tackle them is growing. “This field is still relatively early in its development compared with oncology or respiratory medicine, which are targeting very specific biological pathways with very specific precision treatments,” Emory's Vickery says. “We're not close to that yet. But can I see that on the horizon? Yes.”

The very latest approaches may involve new technologies. At the University of California, Los Angeles, a team led by Andre Nel has developed a lipid nanoparticle that uses mRNA—the same technology used in the COVID vaccines that were developed rapidly in 2020—to create fragments of peanut allergens. Those fragments are presented to specific cells. In mice, the treatment damped down the IgE cascade that triggers anaphylaxis.

But this is a difficult time for biomedical research, given political decisions in the White House and its newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cancel much of the science emanating from the NIH and the National Science Foundation. Peanut allergy may be due for particular attention from the Trump administration. The president's Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has several times endorsed an unsupported contention that peanut allergy is caused by childhood vaccinations. Earlier this year “peanut allergies” appeared on a list of topics that would cause grants to get extra scrutiny within the NIH.

Despite the potential political interference, for now the future seems bright for patients such as Anabelle Terry. As she grows up, the science that has reduced the risks of her allergy is growing along with her. It already has improved her life. It might one day change it for good. “If I go off to summer camp, I have to go away from the other kids for a while and take my nuts to make sure nobody else who has a nut allergy gets sick,” she says. “Going on vacations, I always have to bring a giant bag of nuts with me in my backpack. It would feel pretty nice just being able to go in for a little visit and just get a shot. That would let off a big burden.”

Humans Aren't as Special as We Once Thought

Other species exhibit capabilities that were once thought to be exclusive to Homo sapiens

It was the telegram exchange that sparked an identity crisis for humankind. In 1960 a young Jane Goodall working in a remote forest in Tanzania observed a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard using blades of grass and twigs to fish nutritious termites out of their nest. The primatologist wrote to her mentor, Kenyan paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey, to tell him about her observation, which flew in the face of the conventional wisdom that held that only humans made tools. Leakey replied: “Now we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as human.”

For decades—centuries, even—scholars have attempted to draw a hard line between our kind and the other organisms with whom we share the planet. They have argued that only humans have culture—sets of learned behaviors, such as toolmaking, that are passed down from generation to generation. They have proposed that only humans think symbolically, using signs to represent objects or ideas. That our species alone is self-aware, capable of planning for the future and experiencing emotions such as joy and fear, love and grief. That only humans are conscious, possessed of an inner world of subjective experience.

For his part, Charles Darwin, writing in the late 1800s, opined that nonhuman animals have the same cognitive abilities and emotions that humans have and that any differences were a matter of degree and not kind. In the absence of any way to reliably read animal minds, however, scientists who studied animal behavior and cognition took the position that ascribing human thoughts, feelings and motivations to animals—anthropomorphism—was a cardinal sin. But in recent decades examples of other species demonstrating these capabilities have emerged from across the tree of life. The findings have spurred fresh thinking about what, exactly, distinguishes Homo sapiens, with our vaunted intellect, from every other species on Earth.

Let's look first at our evolutionary nearest and dearest. We H. sapiens possess much larger brains than our closest living relatives, the chimps and bonobos, do—around three times as large. The brain requires 20 percent of our energy budget despite making up only 2 percent of our body mass. Naturally, anthropologists have wondered why we evolved such energetically expensive brains. At the same time, we know that H. sapiens is the sole surviving member of what was once a diverse group of humanoids. Surely our big brains and all the clever things they allow us to do were a major reason for our success as a species, a vital factor in why we alone went on to spread across the globe and thrive in every ecosystem we set our sights on, outcompeting other branches of humanity until we were the last hominin standing.

Yet virtually every trait that anthropologists have identified as one that might have set our kind apart has subsequently been found in another member of the family. Our closest evolutionary cousins, the Neandertals, left behind decorations that suggest they used symbols, which may indicate a capacity for language. The same goes for our smaller-brained relative Homo erectus. And some 3.3 million years ago, long before brain size began to expand in our lineage, an unknown hominin—possibly Australopithecus afarensis—shaped basalt cobbles into cutting tools, demonstrating an understanding of the material properties of stone and a vision for how to transform a lump of rock into a useful implement.

It's not just our closest hominin and great ape relatives that share our powers of cognition. Humans were long thought to be the only moral animals, uniquely equipped with a sense of right and wrong. But we now know that is not the case. The late primatologist Frans de Waal and Sarah F. Brosnan found in laboratory experiments that brown capuchin monkeys would decline a reward of a slice of cucumber if they observed another monkey receiving a better treat (a grape) for the same task. The monkeys' rejection of unequal payment for equivalent work demonstrated that they have a sense of fairness and experience moral outrage when they get a raw deal.

Other animals exhibit other elements of morality—including empathy. Mice, for instance, can share the emotional state of another individual, exhibiting increased sensitivity to pain if they see a companion showing signs of pain. Dogs recognize distress in their owners and will offer consolation. Rats will sacrifice their own gains to alleviate the suffering of a conspecific, forgoing a food reward if taking the food means inflicting pain on another rat.

Empathy and other complex emotions were long considered beyond the experience of nonhuman creatures. But mounting evidence indicates that they are widespread among mammals. Some of the most striking examples involve emotional responses to death. In 2018 an orca known as Tahlequah made headlines around the world when she carried her dead calf with her for 17 days while she swam 1,000 miles across the Salish Sea. In 2024 Tahlequah lost another calf. This time she held on to its corpse for at least 11 days before releasing it. Researchers characterized the mother orca's reaction to these losses as grief.

Apes, monkeys and elephants have been observed to mourn the loss of bonded individuals, too. It's not just large-brained mammals that appear to express sorrow, however. Barbara King, who is known for her research and writing on animal cognition and emotion, has described compelling examples of grief in peccaries, donkeys and ferrets, among others.

Our fellow mammals are not the only animals to show signs of thinking and feeling as humans do. The Eurasian Magpie, a species of bird, can recognize itself in the mirror—a sign of consciousness. Fish feel pain, another conscious experience: when given an injection that causes discomfort, lab zebra fish will vacate their preferred habitat, which has been decorated with pleasing rocks and vegetation, to visit a barren habitat whose water is infused with a pain reliever. And studies of bees and other insects suggest that they may experience both pain and joy. That is, these creatures, too, may be sentient.

Although the evidence for consciousness in fish, reptiles, insects, and other invertebrates has yet to accumulate to the degree that it has in mammals and birds, researchers are taking the possibility far more seriously than they have in the past. In 2024 dozens of scientists signed a declaration acknowledging that species quite different from humans may have experiences of consciousness and that this possibility needs to be considered in decisions that affect these animals. The document could help shape policies governing animal research ethics and welfare.

One more group of organisms deserves mention. In recent years researchers have increasingly begun to explore the idea that plants—traditionally viewed as noncognitive beings—can learn, remember, make decisions, communicate and experience the world uniquely. In this way, some investigators propose, they are conscious. Consider the Venus flytrap, a carnivorous plant that catches flies, ants, and other insects when they brush against the sensory hairlike structures in the plant's trap. The plant remembers when it has been touched. After two touches, the trap closes and imprisons the insect prey; after five touches, it produces the enzymes needed to digest its catch. Other plants sense when they are being munched by hungry insects and emit chemical signals that summon predators of their attackers.

We might not be as unique as we thought we were. But we needn't feel demoted. There's something marvelous about finding a common thread between flytrap and ferret, bee and human. We're not separate from nature, we're connected to it, part of the weave of life, in all its dazzling diversity.

The Surprising Science behind Your Favorite (and Least Favorite) Scents

More familiar smells and scents from complex molecules can often be more appealing

By Clara Moskowitz, Miriam Quick & Jen Christiansen edited by Jen Christiansen & Clara Moskowitz

The sense of smell, it turns out, is highly individual—a scent that is enticingly floral to one person may be off-putting and chemical to another. Researchers in Germany -recently asked 1,227 participants to describe and rate 73 odors and found their answers to be strikingly variable. “It depends on what people have associated with the odor,” says psychologist Antonie Louise Bierling of Friedrich Schiller University Jena, who led the study. “In my opinion, it would have been really astonishing if the same odor smelled pleasant to everyone. Why should it?”

The researchers did identify some trends. More familiar scents seem to smell more pleasant, for example, and odors from complex molecules seem to have greater appeal than those of simple compounds.

Scientists hope to use the data to help develop “digital olfaction”—artificial noses that can sense scents as well as or even better than humans. Such devices could be helpful for disease detection or in “smart home” applications: a toaster, for instance, that can tell when toast is done by how burned it smells or refrigerators that can identify putrid decay.

Researchers asked people to respond with “yes” or “no” to whether each smell matched 16 descriptive terms, including “sweet” and “musky.” By comparing these answers with the sliding-scale pleasantness scores the same molecules received, we can see which words were most predictive of pleasant—and unpleasant—smells.

The dots in the graph indicate the difference in pleasantness scores for scents associated with each word. For example, the median pleasantness score for all molecules that the respondents considered “sweet” was 61, and the median pleasantness score for all molecules that were not marked as “sweet” was 34. The difference in scores was +27, making “sweet” the word most frequently associated with scents perceived as pleasant. “Decayed,” with a difference in scores of –35, was the descriptor least associated with pleasant smells.

More complex molecules tend to be ranked as more pleasant. Molecular complexity is a rough estimate of how intricate a compound's structure is. It runs on a scale from 0 to thousands—in this dataset, from 10.8 (isopropyl alcohol) to 366 (tonalide). Here each dot represents one of 73 molecules. We grouped molecular complexity into three categories: high, medium and low. Vertical bars mark median pleasantness scores per category.

How Scientists Finally Learned That Nerves Regrow

Long dismissed as impossible, nerve regrowth is offering new hope for healing injuries and treating neurodegeneration

By Diana Kwon edited by Madhusree Mukerjee

Sam Falconer

We're celebrating 180 years of Scientific American. Explore our legacy of discovery and look ahead to the future.

Billions of nerve cells send signals coursing through our bodies, serving as conduits through which the brain performs its essential functions. For millennia physicians thought damage to nerves was irreversible. In ancient Greece, founders of modern medicine such as Hippocrates and Galen refused to operate on damaged nerves for fear of causing pain, convulsions or even death.

The dogma stood relatively still until the past two centuries, during which surgeons and scientists found evidence that neurons in the body and brain can repair themselves and regenerate after injury and that new nerve cells can grow throughout the lifespan. In recent decades this knowledge has inspired promising treatments for nerve injuries and has led researchers to investigate interventions for neurodegenerative disease.

In humans and other vertebrates, the nervous system is split into two parts: the central nervous system, composed of the spinal cord and brain, and the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain to the rest of the body.

Attempts to suture together the ends of damaged neurons in the peripheral nervous system date back to the seventh century. It was only in the late 1800s, however, that scientists began to understand how, exactly, nerves regenerate. Through his experiments on frogs, British physiologist Augustus Waller described in detail what happens to a peripheral nerve after injury. Then, in the 1900s, the influential Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal provided insight into how nerve regeneration occurs at the cellular level. Still, there remained fierce debate about whether stitching nerves together would harm more than help.

It was against the backdrop of bloody world wars of the 20th century that physicians finally made significant advances in techniques to restore damaged neurons. To treat soldiers with devastating wounds that typically involved nerve damage, doctors developed methods such as nerve grafts, in which pieces of nerves are transplanted into the gap in a broken nerve.

Over time physicians learned that some peripheral nerve injuries are more conducive to repair than others. Factors such as the timing, location and size of the injury, as well as the age of the patient, can significantly impact the success of any given intervention. Crushed nerves are likelier than cut ones to be repaired, and injuries that occur closer to a nerve's target tissue have a greater chance of regaining function than those that occur farther away. Take the ulnar nerve, which stretches the entire length of the arm and controls key muscles in the lower arm and hand. A person with nerve damage near the wrist is much more likely to regain function in the arm and hand after undergoing treatment than someone who injures the same nerve near the shoulder, in which case it must regrow from the shoulder all the way to the wrist.

Even today many peripheral nerve injuries remain difficult to treat, and scientists are striving to better understand the mechanisms of regeneration to facilitate healing. One notable development in recent years, according to neurologist Ahmet Höke of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, is a “nerve transfer,” in which a branch of a nearby nerve is rerouted to a damaged nerve. In cases where, for example, a nerve is damaged far from its target muscle, existing techniques may not be sufficient to enable regrowth across the long distances involved within a time frame allowing for recovery. This detour provides an alternative pathway to regain function. Susan Mackinnon, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis, has largely driven the advances in nerve transfer, enabling patients to use their limbs after peripheral nerve injuries that previously would have led to a permanent loss of movement in them.

For instance, Oskar Hanson, a high school baseball player, lost sensation and movement in most of his left arm after a surgery to mend a ligament injury ended up damaging the ulnar nerve in that arm. “There was zero hope that he would be able to have use of his arm again,” says his mother, Patricia Hanson. But after Mackinnon performed a nerve transfer procedure, most of the function returned. “She saved his life with that surgery,” Hanson says.

Despite the leaps that were made in treating peripheral nerve injuries, the notion that neurons within the central nervous system—the brain and spinal cord—were incapable of regrowth persisted until the late 20th century.

A pivotal moment came in the early 1980s, when Canadian neuroscientist Albert Aguayo and his colleagues demonstrated that in rats, neurons of the spinal cord and brain stem could regrow when segments of peripheral nerves were grafted into the site of injury. These findings revealed that neurons of the central nervous system can also regenerate, Höke says: “They just needed the appropriate environment.”

In succeeding years, neuroscientists worked to uncover what, exactly, that environment looked like. To do so, they searched for differences in the peripheral and central nervous systems that could explain why the former was better able to repair damaged neurons. Several key differences emerged. For example, only injuries within the central nervous system led to the formation of glial scars—masses of nonneuronal cells known as glial cells. The purpose of these scars is still debated, however.

Today the search for the specific mechanisms that prevent or enable neuron regrowth—in both the body and the brain—remains an active area of investigation. In addition to uncovering the processes at play in humans, scientists have pinpointed molecules that enable nerve cell repair in other organisms, such as “fusogens,” gluelike molecules found in nematodes. Researchers are attempting to harness fusogens to help with difficult-to-treat human nerve injuries.

Modern neuroscientists have also challenged another long-standing doctrine in the field: the belief that the adult brain does not engage in neurogenesis, the creation of brand-new nerve cells.

Early clues for neurogenesis in the brain emerged in the 1960s, when researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology observed signs of neurons dividing in the brains of adult rats. At the time, these findings were met with skepticism, says Rusty Gage, a professor of genetics at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif. “It was just too hard to believe.”

Then, in the early 1980s, neuroscientist Fernando Nottebohm of the Rockefeller University discovered that in male songbirds, the size of the brain region associated with song-making changed with the seasons. Nottebohm and his colleagues went on to show that cells in the animals' brains died and regenerated with the seasons. Inspired by these findings, researchers looked for signs of adult neurogenesis in other animals. In 1998 Gage and his colleagues revealed evidence of this process occurring in the brains of adult humans—specifically within the hippocampus, a region linked with learning and memory.

Although support for adult neurogenesis in humans has amassed over the years, some experts still debate its existence. In 2018 a team co-led by Arturo Alvarez-Buylla, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who had worked with Nottebohm on songbirds, published a study stating that the formation of new neurons was extremely rare, and likely nonexistent, in adult human brains.

Still, there's a growing consensus that neurogenesis does happen later in life—and that this growth appears to be largely limited to certain parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus. This past July a team at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden reported that the molecular signatures of precursors of neurons, known as neural progenitor cells, were present in the human brain across the lifespan—from infancy into old age. Researchers are now trying to understand the purpose of these budding nerve cells and asking whether they might offer clues for treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Some scientists are even exploring whether, by targeting neurogenesis, they can improve the symptoms of psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

Understanding that a neuron can regrow and be repaired and identifying details of that process has been a great achievement, says Massimo Hilliard, a cellular and molecular neurobiologist at the University of Queensland in Australia. The next step, he adds, will be figuring out how to control these processes: “That's going to be key.”

Identifying a reliable biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is crucial for clinical practice. Here, in this cross-sectional study, we used the Olink Explore 3072 platform to investigate plasma proteomics as a biomarker tool for this neurodegenerative condition. Thirty-three proteins were differentially abundant in the plasma of patients with ALS (n = 183) versus controls (n = 309). We replicated our findings in an independent cohort (n = 48 patients with ALS and n = 75 controls). We then applied machine learning to create a model that diagnosed ALS with high accuracy (area under the curve, 98.3%). By analyzing plasma samples from individuals before ALS symptoms emerged, we estimated the age of clinical onset and showed that the disease process—impacting skeletal muscle, nerves and energy metabolism—occurs years before symptoms appear. Our research suggests that plasma proteins can be a biomarker for this fatal disease and offers molecular insights into its prodromal phase.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons. This degeneration leads to muscle weakness, atrophy and, ultimately, respiratory failure, typically resulting in death within 2–4 years after symptoms begin1. By 2040, the global population of individuals living with ALS worldwide is projected to approach 400,000 (ref. 2). The substantial number of cases and the high cost associated with their care pose a substantial burden on communities and healthcare systems2. In the United States, the only approved treatments for sporadic ALS are riluzole and edaravone. There is an urgent need for better medications; however, the necessity to recruit large numbers of patients with ALS into clinical trials to assess drug effectiveness hinders therapeutic development3.

Currently, diagnosing ALS relies on clinical symptoms and neurological evaluations, much like the methods used 155 years ago when Jean-Martin Charcot first identified the disease4. Although neurophysiological studies and genetic tests are supportive tools for clinical decision-making, no definitive diagnostic test exists5. Patients frequently experience delays of 6–18 months until their symptoms become severe enough to establish a diagnosis6. Even when there is clear evidence of motor neuron dysfunction, differentiating ALS from other neurological conditions can be difficult because the disease presents with heterogeneous clinical manifestations7. This uncertainty can be unsettling for patients and their families. Moreover, it causes delays in entering clinical trials and limits the number of eligible participants due to enrollment restrictions for patients with more severe disability8. In the future, when effective treatments become available for ALS, diagnostic delays may impede treatment initiation, harming patient outcomes.

We addressed this critical knowledge gap by generating and analyzing data for 3,072 plasma proteins within a large ALS case–control cohort. These well-characterized patients had genetic data readily available, allowing us to incorporate these factors into our search for differentially abundant proteins and to use a multiomic approach to determine if the observed plasma protein changes occurred because of the disease process or were primary drivers in the pathogenesis of ALS. Using machine learning, we identified a distinct molecular signature in plasma that effectively differentiates ALS cases from healthy individuals and other neurological disorders. Additionally, we explored whether our model could predict when symptoms would start in asymptomatic individuals who later developed ALS. Notably, we established a public resource for the scientific community to encourage and advance biomarker research in this fatal neurodegenerative disease.

After quality control, we obtained data for 2,886 proteins from 231 individuals diagnosed with ALS and 384 control individuals (n = 214 healthy individuals and n = 170 with other neurological conditions). Patients with other neurological disorders were included as control data, as our central hypothesis was to use proteomics to distinguish ALS cases both from healthy individuals and from other relevant conditions. Participants were recruited from an Italian population-based ALS registry and a US natural history study, and they were diagnosed with ALS based on established consensus criteria9,10. Extended Data Table 1 lists the demographics and clinical features of the cohorts used in this study.

The proteomic data, measured using the Olink Explore 3072 assay in plasma samples, exhibited median intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 9.9% and 22.3%, respectively, confirming the platform's reliability11. Figure 1 gives an overview of the study and analysis. We randomly designated 80% of the samples as the Discovery Cohort (n = 183 ALS cases versus n = 172 healthy controls plus n = 137 other neurological diseases). The remaining samples constituted the Replication Cohort (n = 48 ALS cases versus n = 42 healthy controls plus n = 33 other neurological diseases).

We conducted a cross-sectional study to identify ALS biomarkers via proteomic analysis of plasma samples. We performed differential abundance analysis on proteomic data generated from plasma samples of patients with ALS, healthy controls and patients with other neurological diseases in both the Discovery Cohort and the Replication Cohort. The other neurological diseases included corticobasal syndrome (n = 8 patients), Lewy body dementia (n = 8 patients), multiple system atrophy (n = 5 patients), Parkinson's disease (n = 153 patients), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 19 patients) and dementia, not otherwise specified (n = 1 patient). After this, we applied supervised machine learning using plasma protein levels and clinical parameters to identify a molecular signature of ALS. The same samples from the Discovery Cohort and the Replication Cohort sequentially formed the Training Set and the Testing Set in the machine learning process. The 46 samples withheld from the initial analyses due to the absence of genetic data were labeled as External Validation Set 1. For External Validation Set 2, we obtained proteomic data from the UK Biobank18. Additionally, a web tool was created for clinical researchers to analyze their own data. ‘Neurological' pertains to neurological conditions other than ALS. 1°, first degree; UKB, UK Biobank.

We conducted proteome-wide association testing of individual plasma protein levels using generalized linear regression. Our analyses were adjusted for the following confounding factors: age at sample collection, self-reported sex and the collection tube type (that is, EDTA or heparin). Furthermore, we incorporated the first two uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) components derived from genetic data of the study participants to manage population stratification.

In total, 33 plasma proteins exceeded the significance threshold in the Discovery Cohort (adjusted false discovery rate (FDR) P < 0.05; Table 1 and Fig. 2a). The protein with the highest differential protein abundance was neurofilament light chain (NEFL, log2 fold change = 2.34, adjusted FDR P = 2.22 × 10−88), which is known to be elevated in ALS and various neurological diseases12. Notably, LIF encodes leukemia inhibitory factor, a neurotrophic cytokine that may promote motor neuron survival in vivo and in vitro13. The remaining 31 proteins have not been definitively linked to ALS previously.

The dotted vertical lines delineate a ±1.4-fold change threshold, and the dotted horizontal lines represent the 0.05 P-value threshold. Blue and red dots denote statistically significant downregulated or upregulated proteins determined by generalized linear regression (adjusted to 5% FDR for multiple comparisons). b, Volcano plot showing the differential abundance of proteins in the Replication Cohort (n = 48 ALS cases versus n = 42 healthy controls and n = 33 other neurological diseases). Black circles highlight the proteins that were significant in the Discovery Cohort. c, Scatter plot comparing the discovery and replication z-scores of the 33 proteins significantly associated with ALS in the Discovery Cohort. The error band is shown as a gray band representing the 95% confidence interval for the mean prediction (blue linear regression line) at each x value. Pearson correlation coefficients (R) were calculated to assess the linear association between variables. P values were computed using a two-sided test of the null hypothesis that the correlation coefficient equals 0. d, A comparison of the proteins significantly associated with ALS in plasma and their abundances in CSF. The CSF protein levels were derived from SomaScan data generated for n = 14 ALS cases and n = 89 healthy controls. The 6 proteins significantly correlated with ALS in the CSF are highlighted in color, whereas the other 21 appear in gray. The additional six proteins were not tested by the SomaScan platform. The y axis indicates a log2(fold change) relative to the control cohort.

We verified the differential abundance of the proteins (n = 14 of 33) identified in the Discovery Cohort within the independent Replication Cohort, which similarly included ALS cases, healthy controls and individuals with other neurological diseases (Table 1 and Fig. 2b). The other proteins (n = 9) also showed the same directional effect observed in the Discovery Cohort (Table 1), leading to a high concordance of 0.83 between the discovery and replication analyses for the 33 proteins (Fig. 2c; R = 0.83, P = 1.80 × 10−9). Additional validation was performed using sensitivity analyses (Extended Data Table 2), comparisons with quantitative ELISAs (Extended Data Fig. 1) and analyses against SomaScan 7K proteomic data (Extended Data Fig. 2).

We performed a comparative analysis to assess plasma protein levels in patients with ALS with C9orf72 expansions (n = 29) against those lacking these expansions (n = 202). Our aim was to discover plasma biomarkers linked to this prevalent genetic mutation. This exploratory analysis identified eight significantly upregulated proteins in ALS C9orf72 carriers compared with non-carriers (Extended Data Fig. 3a and Extended Data Table 3). We also compared ALS C9orf72 carriers (n = 29) with non-carrier patients with ALS (n = 202) plus a control group (n = 383, which included 169 neurological control non-carriers and 214 healthy control non-carriers). The same eight proteins were elevated among ALS C9orf72 carriers compared with controls, suggesting that these protein changes are associated with the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion (Extended Data Fig. 3b and Extended Data Table 3).

We performed additional exploratory analysis to assess whether asymptomatic C9orf72 carriers (n = 12) displayed a different proteomic profile compared with symptomatic C9orf72 carriers (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Our results indicated that specific proteins (including EIF2S2, HPCAL1, JPT2, MTIF3, PDAP1 and SMAD3), which are elevated in symptomatic carriers, did not demonstrate significant changes in asymptomatic carriers and may, therefore, have potential as biomarkers for phenoconversion.

We investigated whether the proteins with differential abundance in plasma were similarly impacted in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). For this analysis, we extracted individual protein measurements from SomaScan data generated using CSF from 14 ALS cases and 89 healthy controls for this analysis. Variations were modeled using a generalized linear regression, adjusting for age and sex. Out of the 33 proteins, 27 were assayed on the SomaScan platform. Notably, five proteins—HSPB6, MEGF10, NEFL, RNASE3 and TPM3—demonstrated significant increases in the CSF of patients with ALS (Fig. 2d). The other proteins did not show significant differences in the CSF of patients with ALS (Table 1).

An enrichment analysis of the 33 plasma proteins linked to ALS uncovered significant associations with multiple biological processes (Fig. 3a). Most of the identified pathways showed a strong connection with skeletal muscle and neuronal function (Fig. 3b). These results highlight the importance of cellular pathways involved in ‘skeletal muscle development and degeneration', ‘energy metabolism' and ‘NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity', corroborating earlier research in ALS14,15,16.

a, Functional enrichment analysis of ALS based on the differentially abundant plasma proteins (n = 33) performed using the ‘clusterProfiler' software package. The x axis corresponds to the fold enrichment of the category in ALS cases compared with controls. A one-sided t-test was used to test for enrichment of genes in a particular pathway, followed by FDR correction to account for multiple testing comparisons. The size of each respective dot indicates the FDR-adjusted P value on a −log10 scale. Significant Gene Ontology (GO) enrichments for biological processes (BP, blue), molecular functions (MF, orange) and cellular functions (CC, green) as well as pathways from Reactome (magenta) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (light blue) are shown. b, The three main BPs identified in ALS based on the enrichment analysis of the differentially abundant plasma proteins are shown. The proteins involved in each category are listed. Panels a and b created with BioRender.com.

We leveraged the comprehensive multiomic data available for our cohorts to explore the relevance of the differentially abundant proteins that we observed in the ALS cases in the pathogenesis of the condition. To do this, we examined whether genetic factors affected the levels of the differentially abundant proteins. First, we searched for evidence of genetic association in the autosomal genes (n = 31) related to the proteins that we identified in ALS, using data from a large ALS genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 27,205 cases and n = 110,881 controls)17. None of the tested loci showed evidence of association.

Next, we implemented two-sample Mendelian randomization using merged summary-level ALS GWAS data17 alongside cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data for the 33 plasma proteins with differential abundance in ALS18. This approach helps identify proteins whose levels correlate with ALS through shared causal variants. Extended Data Table 4 shows that none of the analyses reached statistical significance, reaffirming that the differential protein abundance levels seen in patients with ALS are not directly driven by inherited genetic variation encoding the levels of these proteins.

We performed supervised machine learning, hypothesizing that this method would identify a molecular signature of ALS when applied to a proteomic dataset from a well-characterized cohort. Our main goal was to create a binary classification model to distinguish patients with ALS from control individuals. The initial features used to build the machine learning model included the differentially abundant proteins (n = 33) and clinical parameters, including age at sample collection, sex and blood collection tube type (total number of features = 36). The system was trained on the 183 ALS cases and 309 control individuals used as the Discovery Cohort in the differential abundance analysis (now referred to as the Training Set based on standard machine learning terminology; see Fig. 1 for the analysis flowchart). We evaluated the model's accuracy using the 48 ALS cases and 75 control individuals used as the Replication Cohort in the differential abundance analysis (now called the Testing Set).

Ten supervised machine learning algorithms were evaluated (listed in Extended Data Table 5). Of these, the random forest algorithm generated the best-performing model (Extended Data Table 5). After secondary feature selection, 20 features (17 proteins, sex, age at sample collection and plasma collection tube) were identified as the most predictive for discriminating ALS cases from healthy individuals and patients with other neurological diseases (Fig. 4a); the area under the curve (AUC) and balanced accuracy of this model were 96.2% and 89.3%, respectively, when evaluated in the Testing Set (n = 48 ALS cases versus n = 42 healthy controls plus n = 33 other neurological diseases) (Fig. 4b).

a, The mean importance score of the 20 features (17 proteins plus sex, age at collection and blood collection tube type) making up the random forest model. The importance score quantifies the contribution of each feature, when permuted, to the model's predictive performance. Features are ranked from most influential at the top (NEFL) to the least influential at the bottom (sex). Error bars represent the s.d. of the mean feature importance estimates across 100 repeated permutations. b, The performance of the random forest model is displayed as ROC curves. The ROC curves show the performance of the Testing Set (green, n = 48 ALS versus n = 42 healthy controls plus n = 32 other neurological diseases; one other neurological disease sample was excluded due to incomplete protein data), the External Validation Set 1 (red, n = 14 ALS versus n = 15 healthy controls plus n = 17 other neurological diseases) and the External Validation Set 2 (yellow, n = 13 ALS versus n = 23,601 healthy controls). The black curve denotes the average AUC across these three cohorts. c, Classification of individual samples using the ALS risk scores generated by the random forest model using the 20 features. The white area on the right denotes ALS risk scores consistent with a diagnosis of ALS. In contrast, the gray area on the left, which was manually added to the plot, delineates scores consistent with healthy control status or other neurological diseases. A black circle around a dot indicates a sample misclassified by the model.

We also examined how the exclusion of NEFL affected the predictive accuracy of the random forest model. When NEFL was removed as a feature, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) declined by 2.4% to 13.2% across the Testing (89.8%), External Validation Set 1 (96.2%) and External Validation Set 2 (85.9%) datasets, indicating that the model's performance is not solely dependent on NEFL. Instead, it relies on the contributions of the other 19 features, which include 16 proteins as well as factors such as sex, age at sample collection and the type of plasma collection tube, to accurately classify samples as either ALS or control.

We validated our model using two external sample sets that were not part of the training or testing process (Fig. 1). External Validation Set 1 consisted of 46 samples assayed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which were withheld from the primary analysis due to inadequate genetic data. External Validation Set 2 comprised Olink Explore 3072 data from the UK Biobank, including 13 ALS cases and 23,601 controls. Notably, the proteomic data for External Validation Set 1 were normalized with the same bridging samples used in the Testing Set and Training Set. In contrast, the data from External Validation Set 2 (UK Biobank) did not undergo this normalization process.

The AUC and balanced accuracy for the 46 samples tested at the NIH as part of the External Validation Set 1 were 99.8% and 96.4%, respectively (Fig. 4b). Despite the absence of normalization or bridging samples, External Validation Set 2 (UK Biobank) still achieved high AUC and balanced accuracy values of 99.1% and 88.1%, respectively (Fig. 4b). Overall, the supervised machine learning algorithm diagnosed 62 patients (82.7%) out of 75 ALS and correctly identified 23,548 healthy individuals (99.3%) of the 23,707 in the Testing Set, External Validation Set 1 and External Validation Set 2 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Table 5). We then used the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach to illustrate each feature's contribution to the predictions made for each sample (Extended Data Fig. 4)19,20. Finally, we calculated an ALS risk score for every sample from the aggregated SHAP values, scaled between 0 and 100 using the minimum and maximum aggregated SHAP values from the Training Set samples.

We conducted additional analyses of the model's predictive performance for a group of individuals (n = 355) diagnosed with neuropathy (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes G60–G64) or myopathy (ICD-10 codes G70–G73) using data from the UK Biobank. The random forest model successfully identified 333 (93.8%) individuals as non-ALS cases, demonstrating its capability to differentiate ALS from similar conditions.

We identified individuals (n = 110) who had plasma samples taken before the onset of their ALS symptoms (n = 109 samples from the UK Biobank and n = 1 sample from our cohort; mean duration from plasma sampling to symptom onset = 6.4 years, range: 2.0–14.0 years). For those individuals whose genetic data were available, 12 were confirmed to carry the C9orf72 repeat expansion. We used these data points to examine how our machine learning model behaved prior to symptom onset. A significant association was found between the ALS risk score and the time to symptom onset, with the ALS risk score increasing progressively as patients approached symptom onset (based on n = 110 asymptomatic samples and n = 251 ALS cases that were within 5 years of symptom onset; slope coefficient = 4.48, slope P = 1.40 × 10−49, R2 of the regression model = 0.74 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 14.39; Fig. 5a). Notably, this increase in ALS risk score was not due to aging, as individuals with other neurological diseases, healthy individuals or even patients with ALS after they had received their diagnosis did not display the same trend (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

a, Scatter plot comparing the ALS risk score based on the random forest model and the years before symptom onset in patients with ALS. The purple dots represent plasma samples taken from presymptomatic individuals (n = 109 from the UK Biobank and n = 1 from this study) who subsequently developed ALS. The orange dots denote plasma samples taken from individuals with ALS cases in the Training Set, the Testing Set and External Validation Sets 1 and 2 (n = 251 ALS cases whose samples were collected within 5 years of symptom onset). The regression line with the 95% confidence interval for the mean prediction is presented as a black line with a gray band. The slope, associated P value, R2 and RMSE of the regression model are displayed. The statistical significance of each coefficient was assessed using a two-sided hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that the coefficient equals 0. The vertical dashed line indicates the rough boundary between presymptomatic individuals and those diagnosed with ALS. The data sourced from the UK Biobank are represented in whole years, explaining why some cases seem to exhibit symptoms prior to 0 years. b, The slope coefficients of the 17 plasma protein levels included in the random forest model when regressed individually against the time to symptom onset. Data are presented as estimated coefficient values from linear regression ± s.e., and the P values derived from two-sided hypothesis testing are displayed. The color of the bars denotes the Olink panel category of the protein: yellow, cardiometabolic panel; red, inflammation; green, neurology; blue, oncology.

We investigated which proteins may be altered during the prodromal period. After adjusting for collection age, sex and plasma source, we found that 10 proteins making up the model were individually linked to the time until symptom onset when analyzing asymptomatic individuals and ALS cases together (n = 361) (Fig. 5b). The protein with the most significant positive coefficient was NEFL (slope coefficient = 0.147, slope P = 6.37 × 10−16), followed by CSRP3 (slope coefficient = 0.121, slope P = 4.55 × 10−5). In the analysis concentrating exclusively on patients with ALS (n = 251) or asymptomatic individuals (n = 110), only NEFL demonstrated a meaningful correlation with the time to symptom onset (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Interestingly, the slope coefficients revealed opposing trends: NEFL levels sharply increased in asymptomatic individuals as the time to onset approached zero, whereas, in patients with ALS, NEFL levels significantly decreased as the time since onset lengthened.

Clinicians have long sought a reliable method to diagnose ALS. Such knowledge could substantially improve patient care, assist in clinical trials and offer insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms21,22. In this study, we analyzed proteomic data from a well-characterized cohort to identify a unique molecular signature in the plasma of patients with ALS that could serve as a biomarker. We identified a panel of 33 differentially abundant proteins in ALS and validated our findings across multiple independent datasets, showing that the same protein profile can differentiate ALS from other neurological diseases, including clinically relevant differential diagnoses such as myopathies and neuropathies. We used multiomic data (that is, genetic data) from this well-characterized cohort to determine that these changes are likely secondary to the disease process. Additionally, we demonstrated that the ALS risk score computed from our machine learning model could be used as a proxy for forecasting the age at which symptoms may appear in individuals. Our data also suggest that the underlying disease process happens considerably earlier than was previously recognized. Pathway analysis showed that the relevant proteins are linked to cellular processes known to be involved in ALS23, confirming the effectiveness of our data-driven approach and supporting the reliability of our findings.

The key challenges in developing proteomic biomarkers for ALS have been the need for a sufficiently large dataset and the difficulty in analyzing multidimensional relationships. To address these issues, we used plasma samples from a population-based ALS registry that had enrolled patients over an extended period within a defined geographical area9,24. This registry collected data throughout the patientsʼ illness, providing detailed clinical information that informed our categorization efforts19. Our results underscore the value of disease registries in capturing the clinical heterogeneity of the ALS population19. The availability of multiomic data, particularly genetic data that allow for a more careful delineation of the protein signals, adds to the strength of these cohorts for research.

To date, the development of biomarkers for ALS has primarily relied on the study of single analytes, such as neurofilaments25. Although univariate biomarker systems hold clinical value, it is increasingly evident that they fail to capture the complexity of neurodegenerative diseases, raising concerns about their accuracy and sensitivity25,26. In contrast, the machine learning algorithms that we applied were adept at deciphering multifaceted relationships within data19,27. We generated data for almost 3,000 proteins across multiple samples to facilitate these analyses28. The accuracy of Olink has been validated through comparisons with proteomic measurements based on ELISA and mass spectrometry29,30,31,32,33,34, establishing it as an emerging standard in the field35. Our finding of a subset of 17 proteins (listed in Fig. 4)—attributable to multiple pathways—confirms the multiplex nature of ALS and the appropriateness of our machine learning approach for multimodal biomarker development.

We opted for plasma in our proteomic analysis due to its greater accessibility compared with CSF. Crucially, a biomarker derived from blood can facilitate early ALS evaluations, even by non-specialists36. Such testing may streamline referral to multidisciplinary ALS clinics, leading to earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes37. Additionally, biomarkers obtained through venipuncture simplify the enrollment process for clinical trials, thereby reducing costs and participant burden38. Examining the proteomic profile of CSF collected by lumbar puncture may incrementally improve diagnostic accuracy, as these biospecimens are in direct contact with the extracellular space of the brain and spinal cord, reflecting biochemical changes in the central nervous system39. Nevertheless, in neuromuscular diseases, plasma-based biomarkers may be better at measuring changes in the neuromuscular compartment than CSF, which is corroborated by our pathway analysis showing changes in the peripheral tissues. The biomarker field is evolving40; one possible outcome of this research is that plasma-based biomarkers could act as a screening tool for ALS, and CSF assays could provide subsequent confirmation.

We identified a unique set of plasma proteins that distinguishes ALS from healthy individuals and other neurological diseases. The NEFL protein, a proven ALS marker, is part of this panel, supporting our data-driven hypothesis-free approach25,41. However, the real breakthrough is the discovery of 16 additional proteins through predictive modeling, which substantially enhances ALS classification accuracy. The selection of these proteins, which have not been previously linked to ALS, highlights how proteomics and machine learning can provide fresh insights into complex diseases.

For instance, our enrichment analysis identified links between ALS and various biological pathways, particularly those involving skeletal muscle, neurons and energy metabolism. Notably, these changes may occur as many as 10 years prior to symptom onset. Several conclusions can be drawn from these findings. First, our research demonstrates that it is possible to detect the earliest stages of the disease at a molecular level. Our protein panel could act as a biomarker for this prodromal phase of ALS, similar to the biomarkers currently used in Alzheimer's disease42. This capability will greatly improve clinical trials for presymptomatic patients with ALS, which typically rely on natural history studies to determine the expected rate of symptom conversion. Although there may be some noise in these measurements, longitudinal biomarker monitoring may detect an increase in their ALS risk score, indicating a molecular disease onset and predicting phenoconversion.

Second, the processes associated with the disease happen much earlier than previously thought; NEFL has been shown to increase 12 months before symptoms appear43. However, we discovered that the ALS risk score, determined by plasma protein levels, begins to shift in presymptomatic individuals up to 10 years before symptoms emerge, hitting the 50th percentile around 5 years prior to onset. This change in viewpoint again underscores the power of data-driven research to reveal unexpected insights into the pathophysiology of complex diseases. Our comprehensive genetic analyses revealed no evidence that genetic factors directly influence changes in plasma proteins. This suggests that the observed alterations in proteins are likely secondary effects or may originate from indirect mechanisms such as posttranscriptional or posttranslational regulation. Indeed, many of the observed changes, such as muscle regeneration and catabolic changes in energy metabolism, suggest a compensatory phase that occurs in patients with ALS long before symptom onset. However, we cannot rule out that primary muscle pathophysiology could still play an undiscovered role in the development of ALS15.

Our primary analysis focused on general ALS; however, we also uncovered preliminary evidence of distinct plasma proteomic profiles among ALS subpopulations. Notably, we identified eight elevated proteins in patients with a pathogenic C9orf72 repeat expansion (Extended Data Table 3). None of these proteins was altered in the general ALS cohort, indicating that their changes may be specific to C9orf72 carriers. These preliminary findings need confirmation in a larger sample cohort, ideally accompanied by longitudinal data, to explore how these proteins might relate to phenoconversion in C9orf72 carriers.

Our study has limitations. The proteomic platform that we used quantifies approximately 3,000 proteins, which represents a substantial number of the total number of proteins in human plasma44,45. The unmeasured portion likely includes tissue proteins acting as markers of leakage and immunoglobulins that mirror the host's immune response45, some of which may be connected to ALS. Additionally, the Olink assay cannot detect new proteins, limiting its effectiveness in investigating the role of novel proteins generated by cryptic splicing in ALS pathogenesis46. Future studies will investigate these broader proteomic approaches and incorporate longitudinal data collection to further validate and enhance the performance of our model.

The CSF analysis was conducted on a limited number of samples (n = 14 ALS cases and n = 89 healthy controls), which might not entirely reflect the range of protein abundance variations. However, we showed that specific proteins identified in plasma also exhibited variations in the CSF of patients with ALS. We are in the process of increasing our collection of CSF samples to facilitate further research on these and other potential proteins.

Despite the absence of shared bridging controls between our study and the UK Biobank's Olink data, our plasma protein biomarker panel achieved over 99% accuracy in predicting the ALS or control status of 23,614 European individuals in the UK Biobank cohort. It was also able to distinguish patients with diseases such as neuropathies and myopathies that can mimic ALS. Nonetheless, a larger case–control cohort with greater ancestral diversity is necessary for additional validation to assess the global applicability of our predictive model.

In conclusion, we discovered a unique molecular profile through proteomic analysis of plasma samples from patients with ALS. This protein signature serves as a crucial factor for diagnosing ALS and distinguishes it from other neurological disorders with high specificity and sensitivity (AUC > 98%). Furthermore, the same proteomic approach enables us to predict symptom conversion in individuals who have not yet exhibited ALS symptoms. Our data-driven strategy, powered by machine learning, shows how proteomics can enhance ALS diagnosis and reshape understanding of this complex disease, suggesting that the prodromal phase happens much earlier than previously recognized.

This study was a cross-sectional analysis of plasma proteomic data to identify a biomarker panel for ALS. Samples were obtained from participants from the United States and Italy. Recruitment sites were located at the University of Turin in Turin, Italy; the NIH in Bethesda and Baltimore, Maryland; and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

Written consent was obtained from all individuals enrolled in this study. The institutional review boards of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) (protocol numbers 03-AG-0325 and 03-AG-N329); the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (01-N-0206, 13-N-0188 and 17-N-0131); the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (09-I-0032); Johns Hopkins University (00173663); and the University of Turin (004462) approved the study.

From September 2008 through February 2023, 281 patients with ALS and 258 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study at the University of Turin and the NIH. The Italian samples consisted of neurologically healthy individuals (n = 196) and patients diagnosed with ALS (n = 236) living in Northern Italy and recruited in a population-based study known as the Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta Registry for ALS (PARALS; established 1 January 1995)9. The registry's near-complete case ascertainment of ALS among its catchment population of almost 4.5 million inhabitants ensures the applicability of our findings9. The US plasma samples comprised patients diagnosed with ALS (n = 45) evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, as part of a natural history study (NCT03225144)47 and control samples collected as part of the NIH Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (n = 53, NCT00233272)48 and at the Johns Hopkins Hospital (n = 9). The control samples for the CSF analyses (n = 89) were collected under an NIAID natural history protocol (NCT00794352).

Figure 1 shows the study workflow. The patients with ALS were diagnosed according to the revised El Escorial criteria10 by a neurologist specializing in ALS. Patients with familial and sporadic ALS and self-declared diverse ancestry (n = 3 Hispanic samples) were included in the study, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the ALS population. The control individuals were selected based on their lack of a diagnosis of ALS, neurological disease and cognitive decline in their clinical history. The control cohorts were matched to the case cohorts for race and ethnicity but not for sex or age, although the age distribution was similar (Extended Data Table 1).

We also assembled a cohort of individuals with other neurological conditions (n = 194, listed in Extended Data Table 1) as an additional comparison cohort. Plasma samples were collected from these participants at the NIH Clinical Center (n = 172) and Johns Hopkins University (n = 22). The other neurological disease cohort included patients diagnosed with the following conditions: corticobasal syndrome (n = 8 patients) was diagnosed according to the Armstrong criteria49; patients with Lewy body dementia (n = 8) were diagnosed with clinically probable disease according to consensus criteria50,51; the multiple system atrophy (n = 5) cases were diagnosed according to the Gilman criteria52; and Parkinson's disease (n = 153) and progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 19) were diagnosed based on the 2015 and 2017 Movement Disorders Society criteria, respectively53,54. One patient was labeled as having dementia, not otherwise specified, after clinical evaluation.

The plasma samples were collected via phlebotomy of the upper limb. The patients were not fasting. The Italian samples (n = 427) were mainly collected using heparin tubes, and the remaining samples (n = 306) were collected using EDTA tubes. Blood cells were removed by centrifugation within 2 hours of collection, and the supernatant, consisting of the plasma, was carefully removed without disturbing the cell pellet. All plasma samples were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The number of freeze–thaw cycles between aliquoting and running the proteomic assays was minimized, typically one but no more than three.

The CSF samples (n = 14) were collected via lumbar puncture with the patient sitting upright. A 22-gauge Sprotte spinal needle was used and inserted at the L3/L4 level. The CSF was collected in polypropylene tubes, immediately placed on ice and sent to the laboratory for processing within 30 minutes. All samples were gathered at a single location, the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland (NCT03109288).

For each study participant, we performed proteomic profiling on the plasma samples using the Olink Explore 3072 assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation at the NIA, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Olink Explore 3072 assay quantifies 2,926 proteins (https://olink.com/products/olink-explore-3072-384) with high accuracy and specificity11. In brief, the platform is based on oligonucleotide-labeled antibody pairs that bind to their target protein in solution11. When both antibodies are close, their oligonucleotide tails hybridize and undergo extension by a DNA polymerase. This molecular process generates a unique, double-stranded DNA barcode, which is subsequently amplified and quantified using next-generation sequencing (Illumina NovaSeq).

We implemented quality control, normalization and data calibration at the probe, sample and plate levels11. Inter-plate sample controls (n = 2 per 96-well plate) were used to normalize for inter-plate variation. Proteins that did not meet the default standard Olink quality control criteria were excluded from the analysis. These steps were conducted using Olink software (version 1.0). Normalized Protein eXpression (NPX) values, representing the log2-transformed ratio of sample assay counts to extension control counts, were used as the final assay readout; a higher value corresponded to a higher protein expression or abundance levels11. Replicate samples (n = 3 per plate), referred to as bridging samples, were used to calculate both intra-plate and inter-plate coefficients of variation. These bridging samples are independent of the inter-plate sample controls. The coefficients of variation (%) were determined using the following formula: (s.d./mean of the replicate measurements) × 100. Samples with median NPX values (calculated from all proteins in each sample) that deviated by more than 3 s.d. from the mean of the median NPX values of all samples, as well as samples exceeding 3 s.d. from the mean of the interquartile range, were flagged as outliers and excluded from the analysis.

Olink data from the UK Biobank were obtained through the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (https://www.dnanexus.com/partnerships/ukbiobank). ALS cases were defined as individuals diagnosed with ICD-10 code G12.2 and confirmed at death55 and had their blood collected up to 1 year before symptom onset. Control samples were defined as individuals without a recorded diagnosis of myopathy (ICD-10 codes G70–G73) or neuropathy (ICD-10 codes G60–G64).

DNA obtained from the same participants also underwent whole-genome sequencing on a HiSeq X10 sequencer (Illumina; n = 476, 150-bp paired-end reads, 35× coverage)56 or genotyping on Infinium GDA-8+ NeuroBooster BeadChips (version 1.0, Illumina; n = 245), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Standard sample-level and variant-level quality control procedures were applied to the genetic datasets, and variants were extracted for the principal component analysis, performed using ‘flashPCA' (version 2.0). Principal components 1–10 were reduced to two dimensions using UMAP version 0.2.10. These two UMAP values were used to correct for population stratification in the statistical analysis of the individual protein analytes57.

Although methods such as ADMIXTURE can provide percentage estimates of ancestry, the UMAP approach offers a direct and efficient way to control for confounding in our association analyses. Notably, reanalysis using all ten principal components yielded nearly identical results, confirming that the two-component UMAP adjustment sufficiently controlled for stratification in our study cohorts.

Samples that passed Olink's quality control were divided into two cohorts at an 80:20 ratio, labeled as the Discovery/Training and Replication/Testing datasets. The terms ‘Discovery' and ‘Replication' refer to differential protein abundance analysis, whereas ‘Training' and ‘Testing' pertain to machine learning analysis. To accurately represent cohort characteristics in the datasets, samples were matched by diagnostic groups (ALS, healthy controls and neurological controls) and the type of tube used for collection, as implemented in the ‘caret' software package (version 6.0-94). We also balanced the selection of the Italian and United States samples across the Discovery and Replication cohorts. The Training Set included 492 individuals (n = 183 ALS cases, n = 172 healthy controls and n = 137 individuals with other neurological conditions). The Testing Set included 123 individuals (n = 48 ALS cases, n = 42 healthy controls and n = 33 individuals with other neurological diseases) (see Fig. 1 for the flowchart).

We performed a cross-sectional association analysis between plasma protein abundances and the diagnosis of ALS. The following generalized linear model was used to evaluate the relationship between an individual protein's abundance and ALS status: NPXi = β1 × ALSi + β2 × agei + β3 × sexi + β4 × tubetypei + β5 × UMAP1i + β6 × UMAP2i, where NPXi represents the NPX value for individual i; ALSi is a binary indicator for ALS diagnosis (1 for ALS, 0 for control); agei is the age at sample collection; sexi is the reported sex of the individual; tubetypei indicates the plasma collection tube type (heparin or EDTA); and UMAP1i and UMAP2i are the first two components of the UMAP projection of genetic data. The absence of a constant term means that there is no intercept (β0) in the model. This model was implemented using the ‘limma' package (version 3.58.1) in R. In our analysis, all covariates were included in the model simultaneously. In alignment with our primary analysis, the regression model for the patients carrying the C9orf72 expansion was adjusted for sex, age at sample collection, the type of plasma collection tube and the first two dimensions of UMAP based on genetic data.

Multiple comparisons were controlled using the FDR procedure defined by Benjamini and Hochberg, and two-sided FDR-adjusted P values are reported in Table 1, Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 2. The significance threshold was set at an FDR P value of 0.05. Our Discovery Cohort, comprising 183 cases and 309 controls, had 80% power to detect a differentially abundant protein with an effect size (Cohen's f statistic) of 0.242, assuming a significance threshold P value of 1.73 × 10−5. All analyses were conducted using R (version 4.3.2).

We used z-scores to compare the effect sizes of differentially abundant proteins in the Discovery and Replication cohorts. We used z-scores in this comparison because they provide an accurate statistical representation of the difference in effect size between cases and controls by taking into account the s.e. of the effect size58. Without standardizing with z-scores, the slope of the relationship between protein abundance and disease status could be artificially inflated or deflated, resulting in misleading correlation statistics.

Quantification was performed on plasma samples (n = 16 ALS cases and n = 16 healthy controls) using commercially available colorimetric ELISA or fluorescence-based ProQuantum high-sensitivity immunoassay kits according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoassay kits were available for 30 of the 33 differentially abundant proteins (Extended Data Fig. 1). The optimal dilution factor for measuring each protein was determined empirically. Each plasma sample and protein standards were assayed in duplicates. A standard curve for each protein was generated by plotting the absorbance readings at 450 nm wavelength or FAM fluorescence emission at 517 nm against the concentrations of the protein standards. A four-parameter logistic curve was fitted using GraphPad Prism software (version 10.4.1). The protein concentrations for the test samples were extrapolated from the standard curve, and the final concentrations were corrected for the dilution factor.

The Bland–Altman plot was created by calculating the differences in measurements between the ELISA or ProQuantum and Olink assays (log2-transformed concentration from the ELISA or ProQuantum assay minus Olink NPX) and comparing this to the mean measurement from both assays for each paired sample. This standard data visualization technique is recommended for comparing methods59. The 95% limits of agreement were calculated using the mean difference (bias) ± 1.96 s.d. of the differences. The relationship between the protein measurements from both assays was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. For the subset of samples (n = 16 ALS and n = 16 healthy controls), differential protein abundance analysis was performed using a generalized linear regression model with the following formula: ProteinAbundancei = β1 × ALSi + β2 × agei + β3 × sexi + β4 × tubetypei. Here, ProteinAbundancei denotes the protein NPX value measured via Olink or the log2-transformed concentration from the ELISA or ProQuantum assay for individual i; ALSi is a binary variable for ALS diagnosis (1 for ALS, 0 for control); agei refers to the age at which the sample was collected; sexi indicates the self-reported sex of the individual; and tubetypei specifies the type of plasma collection tube (heparin or EDTA). The intercept was set to 0. All analyses and visualizations were conducted using GraphPad Prism software (version 10.4.1).

Proteomic measurements were previously generated for a subset of the BLSA control samples (n = 9) using SomaScan 7K, a single-stranded DNA aptamer-based proteomic platform60. To assess the correlation, the log2-transformed NPX values for the Olink 3072 Explore platform and the scaled measurements for the SomaScan 7K platform were used to calculate Spearman's rho correlation for the 2,868 unique UniProt proteins assayed on both platforms (Extended Data Fig. 2a)11. The data were categorized using the k-means clusters identified by Katz et al.11 (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

CSF proteomic measurements were generated from ALS cases (n = 14) and healthy control individuals (n = 89) using the SomaScan 7K platform. Most of the ALS cases (n = 13) and none of the healthy control individuals used to generate the SomaScan data were not included in the Discovery Cohort or the Replication Cohort used to create the plasma proteomic data. Individual proteins were assessed using generalized linear modeling, adjusted for age at collection and sex.

The proteins that were differentially abundant in ALS were analyzed for pathway enrichment using ‘clusterProfiler' (version 4.10.1) using the following databases: (1) GO61, (2) KEGG62 and (3) Reactome63. Pathways with a single gene were discarded, and significance was defined as an FDR-adjusted P value of less than 0.05.

Regional association plots of the genes encoding the differentially abundant proteins identified in ALS cases were made with ‘locusZoomR' (version 0.3.5) using data downloaded from a large ALS GWAS17. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing a P value less than or equal to 5.0 × 10−8 were regarded as evidence of genetic variants in the locus that may influence the risk of developing ALS.

We performed Mendelian randomization analyses using ‘TwoSampleMR' (version 0.6.1)64. Exposures were the pQTL mapping of the plasma proteins identified by the machine learning model. These plasma pQTL profiles were obtained from GWAS data based on 54,219 UK Biobank participants, available from the Synapse web portal18. Only genetic variants with P < 1.0 × 10−5 from the pQTL summary statistics were included in the analysis. As the outcome, we used an ALS GWAS, comprising 29,612 cases and 122,656 control individuals17. To assess causality, we applied the inverse‐variance weighted method and two Mendelian randomization sensitivity tests (MR Egger and weighted median). Traits were considered consistent with a causal effect when P values were less than or equal to 0.05.

We performed supervised machine learning on the proteomic data to identify a molecular signature of ALS. To do this, we randomly selected 80% of the samples as the Training Set (n = 183 ALS cases versus n = 172 healthy controls plus n = 137 other neurological diseases). The remaining samples were designated as the Testing Set (n = 48 ALS cases versus n = 42 healthy controls plus n = 33 other neurological diseases; see Fig. 1 for flowchart). The samples in the Training Set and the Testing Set were the same as those in the Discovery Cohort and the Replication Cohort used for the differential protein abundance analysis, respectively.

We used ‘caret' (short for ‘classification and regression training', version 6.0-94), an open-source machine learning package that streamlines predictive model creation. The 33 differentially abundant proteins, along with clinical information, such as age at sample collection, sex and the type of blood tube used to collect the sample (total number of features = 36), were entered into the model as the starting features.

The decision to limit the feature set to 33 proteins was made to enhance the model's stability and avoid overfitting, often seen in high-dimensional data analysis65. Additionally, using a minimal feature set makes the model more relevant in clinical environments, where cost and assay complexity play important roles. For instance, even though UMAP components are useful for addressing population stratification in statistical analyses, they were left out of the machine learning model. Their inclusion would require all patients to undergo genotyping, substantially increasing implementation costs and computational complexity. Consequently, we concentrated on proteins that can be directly measured in plasma, ensuring that the model remains both practical and affordable.

Ten supervised machine learning algorithms were evaluated (listed in Extended Data Table 5). Fivefold cross-validation was conducted and repeated ten times, and data were preprocessed with centering and scaling to standardize features. Adaptive resampling with a minimum of ten resamples, and a significance threshold of α = 0.05 using generalized least squares was employed to refine the tuning parameters for each model. Models were trained on 36 features, using the sample diagnosis as the binary target variable. The best model (random forest) was selected based on overall performance (AUC and balanced accuracy) when classifying unseen samples in the Testing Set, External Validation Set 1 and External Validation Set 2.

The random forest model was further tuned on the Training Set, and key predictive features were prioritized using the genetic algorithm feature selection method; fivefold cross-validation was conducted and repeated ten times, and data were preprocessed with centering and scaling to standardize features. The parameters used for finetuning and feature selection using the genetic algorithm method were as follows: nbits = 36, popSize = 500, maxiter = 25, pmutation = 0.1, pcrossover = 0.8 and elitism = 3. The hyperparameter for the optimized random forest model, ‘mtry' (the number of variables considered at each split), was set to 11. For model tuning in the Discovery Cohort, the standard random forest majority-vote threshold of 0.5 was used and then directly applied to the Replication Cohort. The final model was selected based on the performance in the Testing Set, External Validation Set 1 and External Validation Set 2 cohorts.

We conducted a repeated classification analysis, excluding NEFL, to assess the impact of this protein on the model's performance. The remaining features (that is, 16 proteins, demographic factors (sex and age at sample collection) and plasma collection tube type) were incorporated into this model.

SHAP values were calculated using the Shapley function from the ‘iml' package (version 0.11.3) in R. These values reflect the contribution of each feature to the final random forest model. To determine the ALS risk score, we summed the SHAP values for all features (n = 20, including 17 proteins, sex, age at sample collection and type of tube used for collection) for each sample. The summed SHAP values were then scaled to a range from 0 to 100 based on the minimum and maximum values from the Training Set.

Subsequently, we conducted a generalized linear regression analysis, adjusting for age at sample collection, sex and plasma tube collection type, to assess the correlation between the time to symptom onset and (1) the ALS risk score and (2) individual protein abundances.

ELISA assays were performed on plasma samples from the Discovery and Replication datasets (n = 16 ALS cases and n = 16 healthy controls). ELISA kits were available for 30 of the 33 differentially abundant proteins. We present exploratory data for 16 proteins, while the other ELISA assays are excluded due to either lack of protein detection (n = 13) or assay failure (n = 1). Each row displays data for an individual protein. The agreement between protein measurements from the ELISA or ProQuantumTM (abbreviated as ProQ) and Olink assays was evaluated using three methods: correlation (first panel), Bland-Altman analysis (second panel), and differential analysis comparing ALS (orange dots) with healthy controls (blue dots) through either ELISA or ProQuantumTM (third panel) or Olink (fourth panel) measurements. Pearson correlation coefficients (R) were calculated to assess the linear association between variables. P-values were computed using a two-sided test of the null hypothesis that the correlation coefficient equals zero. The grey area indicates the 95% confidence interval for the mean prediction (black linear regression line) at each x-value. In the Bland-Altman (B-A) plots, the mean bias difference between the two assays is depicted as a solid horizontal black line in the center of the plot. The shaded grey area reflects the 95% limits of agreement for the paired measurements from each sample, with upper and lower limit values shown in red font. The box-and-whisker plots in the differential analysis panels present the range (whiskers) alongside the first, median, and third quartiles of the measurements within the box. The effect size of the regression, or beta, along with the corresponding p-values, is included in each panel.

Plasma profiling was performed on a random subset of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) samples (n = 9) using the SomaScan 7 K and Olink 3072 Explore platforms. a, The Venn diagram shows the overlap of the UniProt targets assayed on the two platforms. Of the 2,886 proteins assayed on the Olink platform, there were 2,868 unique UniProt IDs. Of these, 2,120 proteins overlapped with the SomaScan 7 K platform. b, Spearman correlations between the overlapping protein measurements on the Olink and SomaScan platforms. K-means clustering, defined by Katz and colleagues, divided the distribution into three clusters. c, The heatmap illustrates Spearman correlations among overlapping protein measurements from the Olink and SomaScan platforms, specifically for 27 differentially expressed proteins in ALS cases. Data for the six other differentially expressed proteins (CORO6, DTNB, FGF21, NEB, RBFOX3, and SSC4D) were unavailable.

These volcano plots illustrate the differential protein abundance in a, ALS patients with the pathogenic C9orf72 repeat expansion (n = 29) compared to ALS patients without the expansion (n = 202), b, ALS patients with C9orf72 (n = 29) compared to ALS patients without the expansion (n = 202) combined with control subjects (n = 383; comprising 169 neuro-control non-carriers, and 214 healthy control non-carriers), and c, asymptomatic individuals with C9orf72 (n = 12) compared to symptomatic ALS patients with the expansion (n = 29). The dotted vertical lines indicate a ± 1.4-fold change threshold, while the dotted horizontal lines represent the 0.05 p-value threshold. Blue and red dots depict statistically significant down-regulated or up-regulated proteins identified through generalized linear regression. Significance was assessed using two-sided moderated t-tests with p-values adjusted by the false discovery rate (FDR) method.

Distribution of the SHAP values calculated using the machine-learning model for the 20 features with the most substantial effect on the ALS diagnosis classification model. The Training Set (n = 183 ALS cases, n = 172 healthy controls, and n = 137 patients with other neurological diseases), the Testing Set (n = 48 ALS cases, n = 42 healthy controls, and n = 33 patients with other neurological diseases; one sample from the other neurological diseases group was dropped due to incomplete protein data), the External Validation Set 1 (n = 14 ALS cases, n = 15 healthy controls, and n = 17 patients with other neurological diseases), and the External Validation Set 2 (i.e., UK Biobank, n = 13 ALS cases, n = 23,601 healthy controls) are shown. Each point represents a sample; orange dots represent ALS cases, dark blue dots represent healthy individuals, and light blue dots represent patients with other neurological diseases. A black circle around a dot indicates a sample misclassified by the model.

a, The distributions of the ALS Risk Score according to the age at the time of plasma collection are shown for asymptomatic individuals (purple, n = 126), ALS cases (orange, n = 259), patients with other neurological diseases (light blue, n = 186), and a representative sample of the healthy controls (blue, n = 533). Asymptomatic individuals were the only ones showing a slight correlation with time with a 5 to 14-fold steeper slope coefficient compared to healthy individuals and those with ALS or other neurological diseases. This indicates that the increase in ALS Risk Score seen in preclinical ALS is not influenced solely by normal aging or pathological aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The bands represent the 95% confidence intervals of the linear regression lines at each x-value. The statistical significance of each coefficient was assessed using a two-sided hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that the coefficient equals zero. The slopes, the R2 values, and the associated p-values are displayed. A black circle around a dot indicates a sample misclassified by the Random Forest model. b, Scatterplots comparing time to symptom onset in patients with ALS with expression levels for the 17 individual proteins included in the Random Forest model. The purple dots represent plasma samples taken from pre-symptomatic individuals (n = 109 from the UK Biobank, n = 1 from this study) who subsequently developed ALS. The orange dots denote plasma samples taken from individuals with ALS cases (n = 12 from the UK Biobank, n = 239 from this study). The gray bands represent the 95% confidence intervals of the linear regression line at each x-value. The slopes and the associated p-values derived from two-sided hypothesis testing are displayed.

Dual agonists targeting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) are breakthrough treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Compared to GLP1R agonists, dual agonists show superior efficacy for glucose lowering and weight reduction. However, delineation of dual agonist cell targets remains challenging. Here, we develop and test daLUXendin and daLUXendin+, non-lipidated and lipidated fluorescent GLP1R/GIPR dual agonist probes, and use them to visualize cellular targets. daLUXendins are potent GLP1R/GIPR dual agonists that advantageously show less functional selectivity for mouse GLP1R over mouse GIPR. daLUXendins label rodent and human pancreatic islet cells, with a signal intensity of β cells > α cells = δ cells. Systemic administration of daLUXendin strongly labels GLP1R+ and GIPR+ neurons in circumventricular organs characterized by an incomplete blood–brain barrier but does not penetrate the brain beyond labelling seen with single (ant)agonists. At the single-molecule level, daLUXendin targets endogenous GLP1R–GIPR nanodomains, which differ in organization and composition from those targeted by a single agonist. daLUXendins reveal dual agonist targets in the pancreas and brain and exclude a role for brain penetration in determining the superior efficacy of dual agonists, shedding new light on different modes of action of dual agonists versus single agonists.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) potently amplify insulin secretion and influence satiety to reduce food intake1,2,3. Stabilized GLP1R agonists were approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2008 (ref. 4) and at higher doses for overweight and obesity in 2017 and 2018 (ref. 5). Less attention has been paid to the GIP axis, as multiple studies showed that either genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of GIPR protects against body weight gain6, and that GIPR agonism has minimal effects on glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes7, potentially owing to GIPR downregulation8. However, dual agonists such as tirzepatide combine elements of GLP1R and GIPR agonism, such that the full benefits of both hormone axes are realized9.

Although the pharmacological mechanisms underlying dual GLP1R/GIPR agonist efficacy are well established10,11,12, less is known about the cellular substrates that underlie actions on pancreatic hormone secretion as well as food intake. GLP1R and GIPR are low-abundance cell surface proteins, and their instability in solution makes it difficult to raise antibodies against specific epitopes, rendering their immunohistochemical visualization challenging13. Specific antibodies exist for GLP1R, but no reliable commercial antibody exists yet for the detection of GIPR in primary cells and tissues13. Compared to antibodies, GLP1R-Cre and GIPR-Cre reporter mice are sensitive, but only identify cells that express(ed) GLP1R/GIPR transcripts14,15. Finally, animals harbouring a self-labelling enzyme on the GLP1R amino terminus allow facile visualization using a range of fluorophores, although this model is restricted to rodents16. No approach to date provides information on GLP1Rs and GIPRs specifically accessed or bound by a dual agonist.

To circumvent these issues, we previously developed LUXendins and sGIPs17,18,19, which are specific probes against GLP1R and GIPR, respectively. Using these probes, we confirmed that GLP1R is largely a β cell-specific protein marker18,20, whereas GIPR is expressed in both β cells and α cells within the islet17. However, we were unable to make any inferences about dual agonist binding sites within the islet and brain, as GLP1R and GIPR probes might target different receptor (sub)populations. Dual agonism might also influence GIPR/GLP1R localization, expression and access through effects in addition to those mediated by GLP1R and/or GIPR (ant)agonism alone; for example, release of paracrine mediators and functional selectivity21,22,23. Although fluorescent tirzepatide has been reported12, the probe was not pharmacologically validated for its specificity at GLP1R/GIPR.

Structure–activity relationships and cryo-electron microscopy show that the binding affinity and efficacy of GLP1R agonists, GIPR agonists and dual agonists are determined by amino acids closer to the N-terminus24,25,26,27. We thus reasoned that carboxy-terminal functionalization with a fluorophore would be well tolerated, especially because this end is not commonly resolved in structural interpretations. Given that tirzepatide possesses a C-terminal serine, we decided to generate an S39C mutant, allowing the late-stage addition of a fluorophore (Fig. 1a,b). daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 were obtained using cysteine-maleimide ‘click' chemistry to install Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores, respectively, in yields of ~50%. iso-butyric amino acid was incorporated into the structure instead of alanine at position two to confer degradation resistance against DPP-IV28 (Fig. 1a,b). Spectral properties, compound purity and compound characterization are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 1.

At dark onset, mice were injected subcutaneously with either vehicle, daLUXendin660 (daLUX; 10 nmol kg−1) or tirzepatide (10 nmol kg−1), and then food was returned. Graph showing cumulative food intake 12 h and 24 h post injection (n = 8 mice per investigated state) (repeated-measures two-way ANOVA with Šídák's multiple comparisons test). j, Tirzepatide and daLUXendin660 similarly lower glucose in GLP1RWT/WT and GLP1RWT/KO mice during glucose tolerance testing (n = at least five mice per investigated state). k,l, Efficacy of tirzepatide and daLUXendin660 is reduced in GLP1RKO/KO mice (k), shown also by area under the curve (AUC) (l) (n = at least five mice per investigated state) (one-way ANOVA with two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli). m, mGLP1R:mGIPR selectivity is lower for daLUXendin660 versus tirzepatide (selectivity is calculated using the mean AUC ratio from at least five GLP1RWT/WT and five GLP1RKO/KO mice).

AD293 cells transfected with either human GLP1R (hGLP1R), mouse GLP1R (mGLP1R), human GIPR (hGIPR) or mouse GIPR (mGIPR) were used to determine cAMP signalling potency of daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 versus unmodified (acylated) tirzepatide, GIP and GLP1. At both hGLP1R and mGLP1R, tirzepatide and its fluorescent analogues showed reduced potency compared to GLP1, with the potency rank order favouring daLUXendin660 > tirzepatide > daLUXendin544 (Fig. 1c) (Extended Data Table 1). As previously reported for tirzepatide11, there were species differences for GIPR signalling with each of the dual agonist ligands tested, with all showing a larger loss of potency at the mGIPR than at the hGIPR relative to native hGIP (Fig. 1c) (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Of note, even though daLUXendin544 showed globally reduced potency compared to daLUXendin660, half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) ratios suggested that both ligands show similar GIPR:GLP1R selectivity of ~2:1 (that is, favouring GIPR) for human receptors and ~1:2 (that is, favouring GLP1R) for mouse receptors. By comparison, tirzepatide showed GIPR:GLP1R selectivity of ~3:1 for human receptors and ~1:8 for mouse receptors in our assays.

daLUXendin660 showed nM binding affinity at both hGLP1R and hGIPR, although assessment of the daLUXendin544 dissociation constant (Kd) was precluded by interference with the BRET signal (Fig. 1d,e) (Supplementary Table 2). Competition assays showed that binding affinity (pKi) for hGLP1/hGLP1R and hGIP/hGIPR was similar when using daLUXendin660 as a probe compared to Ex4-Cy5 and GIP-Cy5, further confirming strong receptor binding (Fig. 1f–h) (Supplementary Table 3).

Therefore, based upon cAMP assays and binding affinity, daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 are potent GLP1R/GIPR dual agonists that advantageously show approximately fourfold less selectivity for mouse GLP1R over GIPR compared to tirzepatide.

To establish whether in vitro pharmacology is mirrored by in vivo efficacy, mice were dosed with either tirzepatide or daLUXendin660 at 10 nmol kg−1 to maximally engage mGLP1R and mGIPR11,29. At this dose, daLUXendin660 and tirzepatide both reduced food intake during the dark phase and over a cumulative 24 h period. At 12 h and 24 h post injection, tirzepatide demonstrated ~40% greater efficacy in driving anorexia, presumably because of its acylation and plasma binding (Fig. 1i). Likewise, both tirzepatide and daLUXendin660 exerted substantial glucose-lowering effects in Glp1rWT/WT and Glp1rWT/KO mice, with similar area under the curves (Fig. 1j–l). Both ligands partially maintained their efficacy in Glp1rKO/KO mice, reflecting continued engagement of mGIPR at doses >1–3 nmol kg−1 (Fig. 1j–l). However, Glp1r knockout was less effective in daLUXendin660-treated versus tirzepatide-treated mice, demonstrating increased mGIPR dependence for daLUXendin660, as expected from in vitro functional selectivity data (Fig. 1j–m). Results should, however, be interpreted in light of increased mGIPR sensitivity or expression in Glp1rKO/KO mice11. Together, these data confirm that daLUXendin660 and tirzepatide both lower blood glucose and reduce food intake.

In line with the cAMP results, daLUXendin544 led to concentration-dependent labelling of SNAP-hGIPR:AD293 cells, overlapping with cell-impermeable SBG-Oregon Green (OG) SNAP label (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b)30. The brightest labelling was detected at 50 nM–5 µM, corresponding to the cAMP max (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). The strongest and most specific membrane labelling, without evidence of altered cell morphology (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c), was observed with 500 nM daLUXendin544; hence, this concentration was selected for experiments in cell lines and tissue. No labelling was observed in non-transfected AD293 cells (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Both daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 showed colocalization with cells transfected with SNAP_GIPR and Halo_GLP1R, determined using orthogonal cell-impermeable SNAP (SBG-OG) and Halo (CA-Sulfo549 or CA-Sulfo646) labels31 (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Therefore, daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 are highly specific dual agonist probes suitable for cell labelling.

MIN6-CB4 β cells were labelled with both daLUXendin660 and the specific GLP1R probe LUXendin551 (refs. 18,19). Demonstrating specificity for GLP1R, LUXendin551 signal colocalized with daLUXendin660 (Extended Data Fig. 2a), probably owing to labelling of different GLP1R pools (see below). However, not all daLUXendin660 signal colocalized with LUXendin551, presumably owing to GIPR labelling, as well as increased GLP1R internalization (Extended Data Fig. 2a). To investigate this possibility further, MIN6-CB4 β cells were incubated with daLUXendin660 and the specific GIPR probe sGIP549 (ref. 17) (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Demonstrating specificity for GIPR, sGIP549 signal colocalized with daLUXendin660, whereas not all daLUXendin660 signal colocalized with sGIP549, corresponding to GLP1R labelling (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Therefore, daLUXendin660 labels both endogenous GLP1R and GIPR in MIN6-CB4 β cells.

We next repeated studies in isolated mouse islets. To circumvent competition between the various probes at GLP1R/GIPR, we used GLP1RSNAP/SNAP mice in which a SNAP-tag enzyme self-label is knocked into the extracellular domain of the endogenous GLP1R16, allowing GLP1R to be visualized without influencing orthosteric binding. Using this model, colocalization could be detected between the cell-impermeable SNAP label BG-Sulfo646 and daLUXendin544 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). We noticed that daLUXendin544 retained significant levels of GLP1R at the cell surface, as shown by the full width at half maximum (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). By contrast, daLUXendin544 did not exhibit any detectable membrane labelling in α cells, presumably because they express little to no GLP1R transcript or protein (also used to identify α cells versus β cells) (Extended Data Fig. 2f,h)15,18,20, so α cell labelling is largely by GIPR. Using the GIPR probe sGIP648, daLUXendin544 was found to strongly label GIPR in mouse islets (Extended Data Fig. 2g,h), also apparent from studies with the GLP1R probes and GLP1R SNAP labels. Lastly, daLUXendin544 labelling was reduced ~50% in GLP1RKO/KO islets, with a further reduction in labelling seen in the presence of a saturating concentration of GIPAib2 (1 µM) (Extended Data Fig. 2i,j).

To allow post hoc protein labelling and identification of cell types in complex tissue, we optimized a fixation protocol that retained strong and specific daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 labelling post-fixation with either 2% or 4% formalin for 15 min (Fig. 2a). Islets were labelled with daLUXendin544 before formalin-fixation, and immunostaining with antibodies against either insulin, glucagon or somatostatin to identify β cells, α cells or δ cells, respectively. As expected, given their abundant GLP1R and GIPR expression, β cells were strongly labelled with daLUXendin544 (Fig. 2b). Confirming results in live islets, α cells showed weaker but detectable daLUXendin544 labelling restricted to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2c), probably reflecting their abundant GIPR expression and largely absent GLP1R protein expression17,18,20. δ cells also showed weaker labelling versus β cells (Fig. 2d). However, labelling was observed both in the cytoplasm and membrane, which might reflect low-moderate expression of GIPR and GLP1R protein (Fig. 2d). Identical results were obtained with daLUXendin660 (Fig. 2e). Quantification of daLUXendin544/660 labelling is shown in Fig. 2f,g. Demonstrating efficacy of daLUXendin660 in vivo, islets in GLP1R-tdRFP and GIPR-GFP reporter mice were strongly and specifically labelled 60 min following intravenous injection with 100 nmol kg−1 probe but not vehicle (Fig. 2h,i). As for isolated islets, both GLP1R+ and GLP1R− cells were labelled in vivo, the latter probably representing GIPR+ cells (that is, α cells) (Fig. 2h).

a, Following labelling of live islets, daLUXendin660 can be fixed using either 2% or 4% formalin (FA) for 15 min (n = at least five islets from three mice). b, daLUXendin544 labels insulin-positive (INS+) cells throughout the mouse islet (n = 44 islets from five mice). c,d, daLUXendin544 labels glucagon-positive (GCG+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) cells throughout the islet, although to a lesser extent than INS+ cells (INS, 44 islets from five mice; GCG, 25 islets from seven mice; SST, 29 islets from seven mice). e, daLUXendin660 displays a similar labelling pattern to daLUXendin544 in mouse islets (INS, 43 islets from five mice; GCG, 30 islets from seven mice; SST, 27 islets from seven mice). f,g, Quantification of daLUXendin544 (f) and daLUXendin660 (g) labelling intensity in INS+, GCG+ and SST+ cell populations (Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons test).

Fluorescent labelling of low-abundance proteins in human islets is limited by high levels of autofluorescence, in particular from lipofuscin accumulation32. In addition, human islet preparations display heterogeneity in response to GLP1R/GIPR agonist, probably reflecting variable GLP1R/GIPR expression as well as time in culture. To circumvent these issues, we instead turned to human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived islet-like structures (SC-islets), which are therapeutically important as a cell therapy for type 1 diabetes33,34. Analysis of published single-cell RNA sequencing data35 revealed GIPR and GLP1R in early and late β-like cells as well as δ cells, and GIPR in early and late α cells (Fig. 2j). daLUXendin660 labelling was qualitatively similar to that observed in mouse islets, with cells displaying two similar labelling patterns: membrane labelling + cytoplasmic labelling or cytoplasmic staining alone (Fig. 2k, inset). In keeping with the transcriptomic data, immunostaining revealed daLUXendin660 labelling in insulin (INS+), glucagon (GCG+) and somatostatin (SST+) cell populations (Fig. 2j–l). Some daLUXendin660 labelling was detected in INS−/GCG−/SST− cells, which were presumably GLP1R/GIPR-expressing enteroendocrine cells that are present in most differentiations (Fig. 2j–l). Similar to mouse islets, the strongest daLUXendin660 labelling was seen in β cells, with weaker but detectable labelling in α cells and δ cells (Fig. 2k,l) (corrected total cell fluorescence, 3.60 × 105 ± 2.58 × 105 versus 2.30 × 105 ± 1.59 × 105 versus 2.16 × 105 ± 1.46 × 105 AU, β cells versus α cells versus δ cells, respectively; P < 0.0005 one-way ANOVA and Šídák's multiple comparisons test) (n = 12 SC-islets from two differentiations).

To expand the utility of daLUXendin660 for long-term dosing, we installed a C20 di-acid lipid chain on lysine at position 20 to confer albumin binding. The new molecule, termed daLUXendin660+, performed similarly to daLUXendin660 in pharmacology and receptor binding assays, demonstrating that acylation and lipid modification is well tolerated (Extended Data Fig. 3a–d) (Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Table 4). No differences in pancreatic islet cell labelling could be detected between daLUXendin660 and daLUXendin660+ applied to the same islet batch (that is, INS > GCG and SST) (Extended Data Fig. 3e–h).

Following intravenous injection (100 nmol kg−1), daLUXendin660 signal could be readily detected in the circumventricular organs and choroid plexus but not in other areas of the brain (Fig. 3a). The circumventricular organs are characterized by an incomplete blood–brain barrier and include areas such as the median eminence, area postrema, subfornical organ and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, brain regions known to bind GLP1R and GIPR (ant)agonists17,18. We did not observe any difference in the extent of brain penetration between daLUXendin660, daLUXendin660+ and the single GLP1R agonist LUXendin645 (Fig. 3a–c). To establish which incretin receptor-expressing neurons are labelled with daLUXendin660, we performed intravenous injection (100 nmol kg−1) of daLUXendin660 in transgenic mice Cre-dependently expressing fluorescent reporters in either GLP1R-expressing cells (GLP1R-tdRFP) or GIPR-expressing cells (GIPR-GCaMP6). Clear colocalization of daLUXendin660 with GLP1R (Fig. 3d) and GIPR (Fig. 3e) neurons was observed in the area postrema.

Shown are the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (i), subfornical organ (ii), choroid plexus (iii), median eminence (iv) and area postrema (v). d,e, Intravenous administration of 100 nmol kg−1 daLUXendin660 in a GLP1R-tdRFP mouse (n = 1) (d) or GIPR-GCaMP6 mouse (n = 2) (e) labels GLP1R-expressing and GIPR-expressing cells, respectively (indicated by white arrows). Shown are the subfornical organ (i), median eminence (ii), area postrema (iii) and zoom-in of area postrema with merged (iii'), GLP1R-tdRFP/GIPR-GCaMP6 (iii'') and daLUXendin660 (iii''') signals.

The strength and extent of labelling does not necessarily equate to agonist efficacy, especially for peptidic ligands that diffuse freely through fenestrated vessels of the median eminence into the ventricular system22,36. To assess the accessibility of daLUXendin660 binding sites from the cerebrospinal fluid, we performed intracerebroventricular injection of the probe. Intracerebroventricular administration of daLUXendin660 demonstrated clear penetration from the cerebrospinal fluid into the brain parenchyma. Strong labelling was observed in tanycytes—identified through vimentin immunostaining—within the third ventricle (Extended Data Fig. 4a). daLUXendin660 labelling in tanycytes was localized to the apical surface as well as cellular processes extending into the brain parenchyma (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Neurons identified as GLP1R+ in GLP1R-tdRFP reporter mice were co-labelled with daLUXendin660 in the vicinity of the ventricles (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Modest colocalization in GIPR+ neurons was evident in GIPR-GCaMP6 reporter mice (Extended Data Fig. 4d). A small number of neurons positive for both GIPR and GLP1R were labelled with daLUXendin660 (Extended Data Fig. 4e).

GPCRs possess higher organization at the cell membrane and within the cell, forming nanodomains that are important for signalling16,37,38. We therefore set out to determine how endogenous GLP1R/GIPR nanodomains might be targeted by single agonists versus a dual agonist in primary tissue; that is, pancreatic islets. We first established nanodomain organization in the non-stimulated but bound state using LUXendin645, a GLP1R antagonist coupled to Cy5. Following 60 min incubation with LUXendin645, fixation and dSTORM nanoscopy of whole islets, we confirmed our previous data showing that non-stimulated GLP1R form discrete nanodomains16,18 (Fig. 4a,b). The GIPR agonist sGIP648 also labelled discrete receptor nanodomains (GIPR), as defined by clustering (Fig. 4b–d). daLUXendin660, however, engaged more ordered receptor nanodomains compared to the GIPR agonist alone, with high levels of clustering probably reflecting increased receptor interactions (Fig. 4b–d). Localization number per cluster, as well as the density of each cluster, were similar across all ligands examined (Fig. 4e,f). Together, these data suggest that tirzepatide either engages GLP1R into clustering or increases interactions between GLP1R and GIPR, thus contributing to its unique nanodomain arrangement. Owing to the long acquisition times needed for localization counting, dSTORM is best suited to fixed tissue. We therefore set out to show the applicability of daLUXendin660 for TIRF-based GLP1R/GIPR single particle tracking at the cell membrane in live MIN6-CB4 cells (Fig. 4g). To open up super-resolution live imaging approaches, such as STED, we replaced the C-terminal Cy5 with fluorogenic deuterated silicon rhodamine (SiR-d12)39 to create daLUXendin651-d12 (Fig. 4h,i and Supplementary Fig. 1). Labelling with daLUXendin651-d12 was too dim to visualize endogenous receptor but was sufficient to map GLP1R in fixed CHO-K1:SNAP-GLP1R:Halo-GIPR cells. daLUXendin651-d12 was able to image GLP1R below the diffraction limit and could be recorded over multiple frames (Supplementary Fig. 2). Following direct application of daLUXendin651-d12 to CHO-K1:SNAP-GLP1R:Halo-GIPR cells, far-red cell surface signal from SiR-d12 became rapidly visible (10 s) in live STED on the cell surface, colocalizing with BG-Sulfo549 and CA-AF488 (Fig. 4j).

In the present study, we synthesize and validate daLUXendins, red and far-red GLP1R/GIPR dual agonist probes. Nanomolar concentrations of daLUXendin specifically label GLP1R/GIPR in live cells, allowing endogenous binding sites and cellular targets for dual agonists such as tirzepatide to be visualized and interrogated. daLUXendin labelling can be achieved in most cells and tissues with a simple 1 h incubation or injection, followed by washing and analysis. Advantageously, daLUXendins show minimal loss in signal intensity when formaldehyde-fixed, allowing co-labelling for other cellular or neuronal proteins and markers.

A key aspect of tirzepatide efficacy is increased potency and selectivity at human GIPR compared to GLP1R, with approximately 70% of activity at GIPR10,11,12. In mice, however, tirzepatide is selective for GLP1R over GIPR, and its insulinotropic and overall therapeutic efficacy is equivalent or non-superior to semaglutide (GLP1R agonist)10,11. Although this is unlikely to have any bearing on GLP1R and GIPR accessed and bound by tirzepatide, it remains a limitation to the use of preclinical mouse models to understand GLP1R/GIPR dual agonism. Notably, daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 displayed less selectivity for GLP1R over GIPR in mouse (1:2 GIPR:GLP1R) compared to tirzepatide (1:8 GIPR:GLP1R). Although the exact mechanisms underlying the differences between daLUXendin544/660 and tirzepatide remain unknown, our previous studies showed that fluorophore modification can increase GLP1R agonist efficacy18. Therefore, daLUXendin660 could be a useful tool for probing dual agonist biology in the mouse.

Within the pancreatic islet, tirzepatide labelled β cells > α cells = δ cells, in keeping with known protein or transcript expression levels for GLP1R and GIPR (as previously reviewed21). Although studies have shown that tirzepatide stimulates secretion of insulin, somatostatin and glucagon11,21, the cellular substrates have so far remained elusive. The observation that tirzepatide labels β cells, δ cells and α cells suggests both direct and paracrine modes of action. Given that α cells express GIPR >> GLP1R, direct effects of tirzepatide on glucagon secretion are probably mediated by GIPR signalling, a known stimulator of α cell function40,41. By contrast, δ cells express GIPR > GLP1R, inferring a predominant role for GIPR in tirzepatide-stimulated somatostatin secretion, with some GLP1R contribution. β cells express GLP1R = GIPR, but increased affinity of tirzepatide for human GIPR10 is likely to disproportionately contribute to insulin secretion. As well as exerting direct effects on islet cell function, tirzepatide is also likely to stimulate α cell-to-β cell and δ cell-to-β cell communication, further regulating insulin release (as previously reviewed21,42). At the same time, tirzepatide might engage β cell-to-α cell or δ cell-to-α cell communication to provide a brake on glucagon secretion.

Peripherally injected daLUXendin660 was able to label the pancreas as well as readily access the median eminence, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, subfornical organ and area postrema. The extent of daLUXendin660 labelling was similar to that seen for a GLP1R antagonist, LUXendin645, as well as a GIPR agonist, sGIP648 (refs. 17,18). We therefore speculate that the superior efficacy of GLP1R/GIPR dual agonism versus single GLP1R agonism reflects the specific neuronal and supporting cell populations that are activated rather than the extent of brain access. When administered directly into the ventricular space of the brain, daLUXendin660 labelled GLP1R+ and GIPR+ neurons in the vicinity of the ventricles, as well as periventricular cells such as third ventricular tanycytes. Periventricular cell labelling is a common feature across GLP1R/GIPR (dual) (ant)agonists, pointing to a critical role for this cell type in the regulation of food intake and possibly the ligands themselves43.

Outside of conventional pharmacology, it remains unknown how daLUXendin660 interacts with GLP1R/GIPR in cells that endogenously express both receptors. Single-molecule localization microscopy showed that daLUXendin660 densely labelled GLP1R/GIPR clusters or nanodomains in islets, which was in addition to that seen with a GIPR agonist alone. Therefore, daLUXendin660 probably influences either GLP1R clustering or GLP1R and GIPR localization to increase nanodomain formation. We speculate that GIPR and GLP1R signalling within or between cell nanodomains, rather than simple signal summation across the cytoplasm, contributes to tirzepatide efficacy, as recently shown for GLP1 and β2-adrenergic receptors44.

Tirzepatide is just one of many emerging dual and triple agonists that might exhibit different receptor engagement profiles. Given that we are still piecing together single agonist function45, daLUXendin provides a powerful tool to understand dual agonist receptor engagement, brain or organ access and receptor synergism. Owing to the structural similarities between dual and triple agonists, in the future, daLUXendins can be easily modified to incorporate a glucagon receptor agonist component.

The study has a number of limitations. Firstly, tirzepatide and daLUXendins are different molecules, and detailed pharmacokinetic profiles were not determined. Therefore, we cannot categorically state that brain areas or cell types accessed by tirzepatide in humans and rodents would be similar to those accessed by daLUXendins in rodents. Secondly, we did not provide any data on human islets. We have noticed heterogeneity in GLP1R/GIPR expression, probably reflecting culture time and donor variability, compounded by high levels of lipofuscin autofluorescence32. Thirdly, we restricted daLUXendin544/660/651-d12 to Cy3, Cy5 and SiR-d12 fluorophores, as they are well suited for complex tissue labelling16,18,19. In the future, the daLUXendin colour palette could be extended to include blue-near-infrared and even epitope tags to allow signal amplification.

In summary, daLUXendin544/660 are highly specific probes that highlight dual agonist target cells within complex tissues such as the pancreatic islet and brain. We envisage that daLUXendin544/660 will provide interrogable mechanisms underlying dual agonist efficacy.

Individual data points are reported in the figures, and no data were excluded. Islet isolation is a nuisance variable, and as such, data are taken from independent islet preparations. To ensure that all states were represented in the different experiment arms, randomization was used to allocate samples and animals to treatment groups. All studies combined males and females, as no sex-specific phenotype has been reported for any of the genetically modified lines used, and male and female tissues were indistinguishable by their chemical probe or SNAP-tag labelling.

Animal studies were regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 of the UK (Personal Project Licences P2ABC3A83, PP1778740 and PP6526002). Approval was granted by the University of Birmingham, University of Oxford and University College London Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Bodies (AWERB).

Studies with human iPS cells were reviewed by the University of Oxford Medical Sciences Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee (MS IDREC). The study utilizes iPS cells, which are created entirely outside the body and, as such, do not fall under the Governance of the Human Tissue Authority requiring ethics approval for their use in the United Kingdom.

Chemicals and solvents were purchased from Merck, TCI (Tokyo Chemical Industry) and Acros Organics (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and used without further purification. Dry solvents were purchased from Acros Organics (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Amino acids and resins for solid-phase peptide synthesis were purchased from Novabiochem (Merck) or Iris Biotech.

Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with UV–visible light detection was performed for purity assessment, using an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC System equipped with an Agilent SB-C18 column (1.8 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm). Buffer A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in H2O; buffer B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The typical gradient was from 10% B for 1.0 min → gradient to 95% B over 5 min → 95% B for 1.0 min with 0.45 ml min−1 flow or from 30% B for 1.0 min → gradient to 95% B over 5 min. Retention times are given in minutes. Chromatograms were imported into Graphpad Prism 8, and purity was determined by calculating area under the curve ratios.

Preparative or semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography was performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC System equipped with columns as follows: preparative column, Reprospher 100 C18 columns (10 μm: 50 × 30 mm at 20 ml min−1 flow rate; semi-preparative column, 5 μm: 250 × 10 mm at 4 ml min−1 flow rate. Eluents A (0.1% TFA in H2O) and B (0.1% TFA in MeCN) were applied as a linear gradient. Peak detection was performed at maximal absorbance wavelength.

For high-resolution mass spectrometry, samples were analysed on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass spectrometry scans were acquired in a range of 350–1500 m/z. MS1 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with a mass resolution of 120,000 with an AGC target value of 4 × 105 and 50 ms injection time. MS2 scans were acquired in the ion trap with an AGC target value of 1 × 104 and 35 ms injection time. Precursor ions with charge states two to four were isolated with an isolation window of 1.6 m/z and 40 s dynamic exclusion. Precursor ions were fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation with 30% normalized collision energy.

Peptide synthesis and chemical characterization (high-resolution mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography) are detailed in the Supplementary Note 1.

AD293 cells (RRID:CVCL_9804) were transiently transfected 24 h before the assay in six-well plates with plasmids encoding wild-type hGLP1R, mGLP1R, hGIPR or mGIPR using Lipofectamine 2000. AD293 cells were authenticated at source using STR profiling. Cells were detached and treated with a range of agonist concentrations in serum-free DMEM + 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C in 96-well plates, followed by the addition of lysis buffer 2 (Cisbio) at a 1:2 ratio. Lysates were further diluted 1:10 to avoid spectral interference from the higher concentrations of fluorescent ligands in the HTRF assay, and the concentration of cAMP was determined after the addition of cAMP Dynamic detection reagents (Cisbio). Three-parameter logistic fitting was used to determine signalling potencies for each ligand, with EC50 ratios relative to the cognate ligand for each receptor used to establish test agonist selectivity for GLP1R versus GIPR.

HEK293T cells (RRID:CVCL_0063) were cultured in DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher), supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HEK293T cells were authenticated at source using STR profiling. Cells transiently expressing Nluc–GLP1R or Nluc–GIPR were seeded onto white 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h. Media was then removed and the cells were incubated in PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.01% NanoGlo (Promega). For saturation binding assays, daLUXendins were added across the concentration range 0.1–31.6 nM, in the absence or presence of 1 μM GIP and 1 μM Exendin-9 to determine specific binding. For competition binding assays, cells were co-treated with 10 nM daLUXendin and GLP1 or GIP across the range 1 μM to 1 pM. Plates were read using a PheraSTAR microplate reader, using the NanoBRET filter module. BRET ratios (λacceptor/λdonor) were calculated, and saturation data fit using the ‘One Site – Specific Binding' equation of GraphPad Prism 10. Competition binding was fit using the ‘One Site – Fit Ki' equation.

Male and female 8–12 week old Glp1rWT/WT, Glp1rWT/KO and Glp1rKO/KO (ref. 18) littermates (on a C57BL/6J background) were fasted for 4–6 h, with free access to water. Wild-type and heterozygous mice were used as controls, as loss of a single Glp1r allele was found to exert minimal influence on phenotype46. Tirzepatide and daLUXendin were administered at 10 nmol kg−1 before intraperitoneal injection of 2 g kg−1 glucose 60 min later. Glucose was measured in blood from the tail vein at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post glucose challenge. Mice were socially housed in specific-pathogen-free conditions under a 12 h light–dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water, relative humidity 55 ± 10% and temperature 21 ± 2 °C.

Male and female 12–14 week old C57BL/N mice were singly housed in a 12 h dark–light cycle (14:00–02:00 h) and habituated to FED3 feeding devices for 7 days before commencing the study47. All mice were kept on a 12 h light–dark cycle at 20–24 °C and 45–65% relative humidity (typically 21 °C and 55%). On test days, mice were fasted for 3 h before onset of the dark phase by removal of the FED3 devices. At dark onset, mice were injected subcutaneously with either vehicle, daLUXendin660 (10 nmol kg−1) or tirzepatide (10 nmol kg−1), the FED3 devices were returned and food intake was recorded over a 24 h period. The study was performed using a three-way crossover design. A 1-week washout period was observed between experimental days. FED3 devices were checked, serviced and food was topped up daily.

AD293 cells (RRID:CVCL_9804) were grown in DMEM High Glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units per ml penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin and 1% glutamine (complete DMEM).

Cells were transfected with 0.3 μl Lipofectamine 2000 per well and 50 ng DNA (SNAP_hGIPR or SNAP_hGLP1R plasmid) per well in 110 μl OptiMEM per well and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells co-transfected with plasmids for two receptors harbouring orthogonal enzyme self-labels (SNAP_GIPR and Halo_GLP1R plasmid) received 50 ng of each DNA. Control, non-transfected cells were cultured overnight in 50 μl OptiMEM without the addition of Lipofectamine 2000 or DNA. The next day, culture media was removed and 50 μl of labelling solution or complete DMEM (for unlabelled control) was added to each well.

On the day after transfection with SNAP-GIPR and Halo-GLP1R, cells were incubated in triple probe solutions of either 500 nM daLUXendin544 with 500 nM SBG-Oregon Green (SBG-OG) and 500 nM CA-Sulfo646, or 500 nM daLUXendin660 with 500nM SBG-OG and 500 nM CA-Sulfo549, all in 50 μl complete DMEM for 55 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Additional wells of transfected cells were incubated in single probe solutions (500 nM daLUXendin544, 500 nM daLUXendin660, 500 nM SBG-OG, 500 nM CA-Sulfo549 or 500 nM CA-Sulfo646) or unlabelled complete DMEM in addition to non-transfected cells incubated in triple probe solutions, all as control wells. SNAP-tag and Halo-tag have been previously reported and are characterized elsewhere30.

MIN6-CB4 cells were generated and phenotyped, as previously described48. Cells were grown to 70% confluency in MIN6 media (DMEM High Glucose supplemented with 15% FBS, 71 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin). Cells were then seeded in 100 μl MIN6 media per well, on a glass-bottomed 96-well imaging plate previously coated with poly-l-lysine 0.01%. The day after seeding, cells were incubated with either 500 nM daLUXendin660, 100 nM sGIP549 (GIPR probe)17 or 100 nM LUXendin551 (GLP1R probe)18, a combination of two or just complete MIN6 media for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.

Male and female 8–12 week old CD1 and C57BL6/J mice, as well as GLP1RKO/KO (ref. 18) and GLP1RSNAP/SNAP (ref. 16) mice (both on a C57BL/6J background) were used as tissue donors. Mice were humanely killed using a schedule-1 method, and the common bile duct was injected with Serva NB8 (1 mg ml−1) collagenase. The inflated pancreas was dissected, and islets were isolated using Histopaque-1119 and 1083 (Sigma-Aldrich) gradients and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 units per ml penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin. Islets were used up to 4 days after isolation.

Size-matched wild-type or GLP1RKO/KO islets were incubated in 100 nM, 500 nM or 1 μM daLUXendins, sGIP549, sGIP648, LUXendin551 or LUXendin645 for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, before washing twice.

GLP1RSNAP/SNAP islets were incubated with 500 nM BG-Sulfo549 or BG-Sulfo646 and/or another orthogonal fluorescent ligand for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, before washing three times.

For immunostaining, labelled islets were washed three times with PBS, then incubated with 2–4% formalin for 15 min at room temperature (16–25 °C). Islets were again washed three times with PBS, then incubated in permeabilizing blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature before incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The following day, islets were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature before mounting onto microscope slides with VECTASHIELD HardSet with DAPI or Everbrite Hardset. Primary and secondary antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

To assess brain and pancreas access following peripheral administration, GLP1R-Cre:tdRFP (GLP1R-tdRFP) and GIPR-Cre:GFP (GIPR-GFP) mice15 (both on a C57BL/N background) were injected intravenously into the tail vein with 100 nmol kg−1 daLUXendin. Then, 40 min later, mice were terminally anaesthetized with pentobarbital (200 mg kg−1) and perfused with ice-cold 0.1 M PBS followed by 4% formalin solution.

For brain tissue analysis, GLP1R-tdRFP mice and GIPR-Cre:GCaMP6 (GIPR-GCaMP6) mice14 were terminally anaesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride (Ketavet, Zoetis; 75 mg kg−1, intraperitoneally) and medetomidine hydrochloride (Domitor, OrionPharma; 1 mg kg−1, intraperitoneally). Meloxicam (Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim; 5 mg kg−1, subcutaneously) was given for peri-surgery analgesia. Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame, and daLUXendin was injected unilaterally into the lateral ventricle at doses of 5 nmol kg−1 body weight at a rate of 1 µl min−1. Coordinates relative to bregma were A/P −0.5 mm; D/V −2.5 mm; M/L 1 mm. At 1 h post injection, mice were perfused with ice-cold 0.1 M PBS followed by 4% formalin solution.

All brains were cryo-sectioned coronally at 30 µm and mounted onto microscope slides with VECTASHIELD antifade mounting medium (H-1000).

Brains were cryo-sectioned coronally at 30 µm and sections processed for amplification of fluorescent reporter signals by immunofluorescence labelling of vimentin (a marker for ependymal cells and tanycytes). Antigen retrieval of free-floating sections was performed using sodium citrate buffer at 80 °C for 20 min. Sections were next blocked in 5% normal donkey serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h and then incubated overnight in primary antibody (in blocking solution) at room temperature (primary antibody: chicken anti-vimentin, Ab24525, Abcam; 1:750). Sections were next incubated for 2 h in secondary antibody (in 1% normal donkey serum, 0.2% Triton X-100) at room temperature (secondary antibody: donkey anti-chicken IgY (H+L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488, A78948, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:500). Sections were stained with DAPI to mark nuclei, then mounted on Superfrost Plus slides and cover-slipped using Prolong Antifade medium.

Sections were imaged on an inverted Leica SP8 confocal microscope using either a ×25 or ×63 oil immersion objective. Three-dimensional reconstructions of daLUXendin660-labelled tissue or antibody-stained cells were rendered using the Surfaces function in Imaris (v.10.1.1) (Oxford Instruments). Opaque surfaces are three-dimensional reconstructions of overlapping areas of daLUXendin660 labelling and antibody staining created using the Coloc function in Imaris. Primary and secondary antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

Midbrain sections (30 µm) containing the ARH from a GIPR-Cre:GCaMP6 (GIPR-GCaMP6) mouse intracerebroventricularly administered daLUXendin660 (3.3 nmol kg−1 body weight) were collected on Superfrost Plus slides and allowed to air-dry at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were then dipped in molecular-grade ethanol and further air-dried overnight at room temperature. RNAscope in situ hybridization was performed on these sections using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Kit (v.2) (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) as per the manufacturer's instructions, with a modification to the pre-treatment procedure (Protease IV incubation conducted for 20 min at room temperature). Sections were processed for in situ hybridization of Glp1r mRNA (cat. no. 418851-C2, Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Following hybridization, slides were cover-slipped using Prolong Antifade medium.

Human iPS cells (ALSTEM, iPS11) were maintained on iPS cell-qualified Matrigel (Corning, 354277) in mTeSR+ media (StemCell Technologies, 05826). ALSTEM iPS11 cells were authenticated at source by testing for expression of OCT4 and TRA-1-60, as well as alkaline phosphatase activity. Differentiation to islet-like structures (SC-islets) was carried out in a suspension-based, magnetic CELLSPIN bioreactor system (PFEIFFER). Differentiation media was changed daily by letting spheres settle by gravity for 3–10 min. Most of the supernatant was removed by aspiration; fresh media was added and bioreactors were placed back on the stirrer system. SC-islet differentiation was based on published protocols35,49

Live or fixed cell and tissue imaging was performed with either (1) Zeiss LSM780/LSM880 meta-confocal microscopes equipped with GaAsP spectral detectors and ×40 and ×63/1.2 NA water objectives; (2) an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope equipped with GaAsP spectral detectors and UPLSAPO ×60/1.30 NA silicone and ×60/1.41 NA oil objectives; or (3) an Olympus FV4000 confocal microscope equipped with SilVIR spectral detectors and a UPLSAPO ×60/1.41 NA oil objective. Excitation (ex) and emission (em) wavelengths (in nm) are as follows: sGIP549 (λex 561, λem 568–621), sGIP648 (λex 633, λem 639–692), LUXendin551 (λex 561, λem 568–621), LUXendin645 (λex 633, λem 639–692), daLUXendin544(+) (λex 561, λem 569–623), daLUXendin660(+) (λex 633, λem 640–694), SBG-OG (λex 488, λem 496–542), BG-Sulfo549 (λex 561, λem 569–623), BG-Sulfo646 (λex 633, λem 641–694), CA-Sulfo549 (λex 561, λem 568–613), CA-Sulfo646 (λex 633, λem 640–694), Hoechst (λex 405, λem 410–488), Alexa488 (λex 488, λem 496–542), DyLight488 (λex 488, λem 496–542) and DyLight633 (λex 633, λem 640–694). Zen 2012 or Olympus cellSens (v.3.2) were used for image acquisition and analysis.

Islets were labelled with LUXendin645 (500 nM), sGIP648 (1 µM) or daLUXendin (1 µM), before fixation in 2–4% formalin for 15–30 min. Islets were mounted on cavity slides, submerged in STORM buffer (Abbelight) and sealed using a 170 µm coverslip and dental resin. Samples were imaged in HILO mode on an Evident/Abbelight SAFe 180 system, using a ×100/1.5 NA Olympus UPLAPO100XOHR objective. LUXendin645, sGIP648 or daLUXendin660 (all Cy5) were pumped to the dark state using an Oxxius laser combiner and 600 mW 640 nm Coherent Obis diode laser before initiation of photoblinking. Single-molecule events were recorded using an LP650 filter with an integration time of 50 ms on a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion sCMOS for 20,000–40,000 frames. Localizations were extracted and images reconstructed using Abbelight NEO software. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) was used to determine localization clustering, implemented in Abbelight NEO software (v.39), with ε = 25 nm (the average precision of the data) and minPts = 8. Results were confirmed using a custom RNA segmentation and DBSCAN routine implemented in R Project (v.4.4.3) (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dbscan/index.html)50.

Live confocal and STED imaging of CHO-K1:SNAP-GLP1R:Halo-GIPR cells (CHO-K1, RRID:CVCL_0214) was performed on a STEDYCON system (Abberior Instruments), mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TI research microscope equipped with a Plan APO Lambda ×100/1.45 NA oil objective (Nikon) and controlled by NIS Elements (Nikon). CHO-K1 cells were authenticated at source using DNA barcoding and DNA profiling. An incubation chamber surrounding the microscope setup was set to 37 °C 24 h before live-cell imaging. To provide stable focus during imaging, the Perfect Focus System (Nikon) was used. Imaging was performed in FluoroBrite Medium (Gibco) at 37 °C. Excitation was delivered with a 405, 488, 568 or 640 nm diode laser, and emission was detected with avalanche photodiodes at 461, 520, 566 or 671 nm, respectively. Live STED images were acquired with a 640 nm excitation laser, 775 nm depletion laser (at 20% intensity) and 671 nm detector (gate, 1–7 ns). Pixel size was set to 30 nm × 30 nm, with 10 µs pixel dwell time, and a line accumulation of 1 was used during acquisition. STEDYCON 9.0.799-g22f03ed2 software was used for image acquisition and analysis.

MIN6-CB4 cells were labelled with 500 pM daLUXendin660 in complete media for 20 min at 37 °C and washed three times in HEPES-bicarbonate buffer, ensuring sparse labelling of GLP1R/GIPR. Cells were mounted on cavity slides and imaged in HEPES-bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 11 mM d-glucose before TIRF imaging at 40 Hz using an Evident/Abbelight SAFe 180 system and a ×100/1.5 NA Olympus UPLAPO100XOHR objective. Single particles were recorded using an LP650 filter with an integration time of 25 ms on a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion sCMOS for 1,750 frames. Single particle analysis was performed using the Trackmate plugin for ImageJ51, with trajectories shown as maximum displacement.

Probe labelling was analysed using corrected total cell fluorescence, which is integrated density − (area of selected cell × mean fluorescence of background readings)52,53. Colocalization was determined using Manders' coefficient, which calculates the proportion of pixels in one channel that also show intensity from both channels. Full width at half maximum was used to analyse labelling patterns at the membrane versus cytoplasm. All analyses were performed in ImageJ (NIH), with brightness and contrast linearly adjusted across the entire image for presentation purposes and applied equally between all states under examination.

Data distribution was assessed using the D'Agostino–Pearson normality test. Pairwise comparisons were made using unpaired t-tests. For non-parametric data, pairwise comparisons were made using a Mann–Whitney test. Multiple comparisons were made using either one-way ANOVA (parametric), two-way ANOVA (parametric) or Kruskal–Wallis test (non-parametric), with pairwise comparisons made using either Šídák's or Dunn's tests, or the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli. GraphPad Prism 9 and 10 were used for all statistical analyses. Values are presented as means; error bars, s.e.m.; P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

For animal studies, each independent replicate corresponds to a separate animal. For cell line studies, the independent replicate corresponds to experiments performed on different days or using cells split from separate flasks. Variation between individual islets or cells was greater than variation of the mean between animals; therefore, they are considered separate data points for analysis purposes. For representative images, the experiment was repeated the same number of times as the related quantification, always with similar results. If the n number occupies a range of samples or animals, the lowest value is provided as per journal guidelines. Hence, the number of data points on the graph may be higher than the stated sample size.

Direct functionalization of abundant C(sp3)–H bonds is highly attractive. Photobiocatalysis offers promise for expanding enzyme reactivity but has been limited to the use of preactivated radical precursors. Key challenges for C(sp3)–H bond activation include the lack of robust activation modes for the inert bonds under biocatalytic conditions and controlling the reactivity and stereochemistry of prochiral radicals. Here we report a triple activation strategy enabling photobiocatalytic C(sp3)–H bond acylation with aldehydes. By combining hydrogen-atom transfer for prochiral radical formation, organic-dye-modulated single-electron transfer and an engineered thiamine-dependent enzyme, we describe a radical acyl transferase for functionalizing C(sp3)–H bonds. This robust radical enzymatic system achieves benzylic C(sp3)–H and aldehyde C(sp2)–H oxidative coupling in an enantioselective manner (up to 97% e.e.).

Understanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.

Investigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases1,2. We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level1,10. Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain1,11, to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction12,13,14,15. Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.

We first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus—a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging11,13—using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN+ nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).

To gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain sufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons16 (Fig. 1d).

Comparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1)17,18,19 (Fig. 1e–g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance (Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.

To assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).

Source data

Having observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).

To begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) states20. Fe2+ and Fe3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.

To examine aging-associated synaptic alterations14, we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity14. Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.

To investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f–i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired, demonstrating no preference (Fig. 2h,i). As a control, we profiled general health using an open-field paradigm and observed no differences in overall activity, total distance traveled or time spent in the center of the open field, indicative of normal motor and anxiety functions (Extended Data Fig. 3d–f). Our functional data indicate that mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 negatively regulates synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory.

To begin to investigate the converse effect of abrogating neuronal Ftl1, we used a complementary viral-mediated RNA interference in vitro approach. Primary neurons were infected with lentivirus encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting Ftl1 (sh-Ftl1) or luciferase control (sh-Luc) (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Decreased neuronal FTL1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c) resulted in an increase in total neurite length as well as in dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons by immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 3a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under RNA interference conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e).

Next, we sought to explore the potential benefit of targeting the age-related increase of FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice. We performed targeted stereotaxic injections of a high-titer virus encoding shRNA sequences targeting either Ftl1 or luciferase control into the CA1 and dentate gyrus hippocampal regions of aged mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Abrogation of FTL1 was validated by western blot (Fig. 3b). We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis, and, in contrast to the effects observed with FTL1 overexpression, targeting Ftl1 led to an increase in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses in the aged hippocampus (Fig. 3c,d). Additionally, we observed an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Functionally, hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 knockdown (Fig. 3e). Consistent with age-related cognitive decline, control aged mice showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, abrogating FTL1 in the aged hippocampus resulted in cognitive improvements (Fig. 3f,g). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 5d–f). These data suggest that targeting hippocampal FTL1 restores known age-related synaptic molecular changes and cognitive function in aged mice.

To determine the effect of selectively targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we generated aged, temporally controlled, neuron-specific conditional Ftl1 genetic knockout mice (FTL1 cKO) using a viral-mediated in vivo CRISPR–Cas9 approach by delivering high-titer lentivirus encoding a synapsin-driven Cre and guide RNA sequences into aged inducible Cas9 transgenic mice (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Decreased FTL1 levels were validated by western blot (Fig. 3h). We observed an increase in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot in the hippocampus of aged FTL1 cKO mice compared to controls (Fig. 3i,j and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged FTL1 cKO mice (Fig. 3k). Consistent with abrogation of hippocampal FTL1, selectively targeting neuronal Ftl1 resulted in cognitive improvements in memory in FTL1 cKO mice compared to control mice (Fig. 3l,m). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 6d–f). These behavioral data indicate that targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age mitigates age-related cognitive impairments.

To identify potential mechanisms underlying the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function, we characterized the transcriptomes of hippocampal neurons from young and aged mice after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression and abrogation, respectively, by neuronal nuclei RNA-seq approaches (Fig. 4a,d). We detected 100 differentially expressed genes in young mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 and 309 differentially expressed genes in aged mice after hippocampal FTL1 knockdown compared to control conditions (Fig. 4b,e and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We performed Gene Ontology analysis and identified changes in energy metabolism pathways and synaptic processes (Fig. 4c,f). To gain further regional and cell-type-specific resolution, we assessed molecular changes elicited by viral-mediated Ftl1 knockout by single-nuclei RNA-seq (Fig. 4g). Cell clusters were identified using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach and projected by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) onto a two-dimensional plot (Fig. 4h). Signatures of each cluster were generated by differential gene expression analysis to compare clusters. Cell types were established based on transcriptomic signatures, and populations were compared across genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 7). We performed bioinformatics analysis on excitatory hippocampal neurons, and Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes between FTL1 cKO and control mice identified predominantly metabolic processes (Fig. 4i). Concordantly, we observed increased expression of genes related to aerobic respiration and proton-driven ATP synthesis in excitatory neurons of FTL1 cKO mice (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d). Next, we analyzed clusters of CA1 pyramidal neurons, CA2/CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cell neurons separately (Fig. 4j–l). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production, oxidative phosphorylation and NADH across hippocampal neuronal cell types (Fig. 4j–l).

Leveraging our transcriptomic analysis, we next surveyed our in vivo neuronal FTL1 overexpression RNA-seq (Fig. 4a), in vivo neuronal Ftl1 RNA interference RNA-seq (Fig. 4d) and in vivo Ftl1 cKO single-nuclei RNA-seq (Fig. 4g) datasets for convergent molecular pathways. Of the genes that are downregulated in the young hippocampus after increased neuronal FTL1 and upregulated in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1, we detected 32 genes that were bidirectionally changed (Fig. 4m and Supplementary Table 6). Gene Ontology analysis of this gene set identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4n), with restored neuronal expression of genes including Sdhb, Atp5o, Atp5c1, Ndufa10 and Atp5j in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1 (Fig. 4o). To corroborate our RNA-seq findings using an orthogonal approach, we measured neuronal ATP production rate by Seahorse assay after viral-mediated overexpression and abrogation of FTL1 in primary neurons. Increasing neuronal FTL1 significantly compromised ATP production (Fig. 4p), whereas abrogation of FTL1 resulted in increased ATP production compared to control conditions (Fig. 4q).

Consequently, we reasoned that boosting metabolic function might counter the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1. To begin to test this possibility, primary neurons were treated with NADH (a coenzyme driving ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation)21,22,23 after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 4r and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Consistent with our previous observation, we detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 4r); however, this decrease was mitigated after NADH treatment (Fig. 4r). No changes in neuronal toxicity were observed (Extended Data Fig. 9b). To investigate the effect of NADH supplementation on cognitive function, young adult mice were administered NADH after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression, and hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed by NOR and Y maze (Fig. 4s). Although young mice with increased neuronal FTL1 expression showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm, these cognitive deficits were mitigated after NADH supplementation (Fig. 4t,u). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 10a–d). These transcriptomics and behavioral data indicate that the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function are mediated, at least in part, through alterations in metabolic processes.

Cumulatively, our study elucidates a previously unrecognized role for neuronal FTL1 in the progression of aging-associated cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice promotes synaptic changes and cognitive impairments indicative of hippocampal aging. Conversely, targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 reverses synaptic changes and restores hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Mechanistically, we implicate changes in metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP production, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 and demonstrate that boosting metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigates these pro-aging effects on cognition. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the molecular underpinnings of cognitive aging and identify neuronal FTL1 as a potential therapeutic target to counter age-related cognitive dysfunction.

FTL1 comprises the light chain of ferritin and is involved in the long-term storage of iron. Disruption in iron metabolism is known to promote mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent alterations in metabolic processes24—a key hallmark of the aging process25,26. Age-related increased levels of neuronal FTL1 detected in the hippocampus are likely reflective of changes in brain iron metabolism during aging. This is congruent with our neuronal RNA-seq analysis pointing to altered metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP synthesis, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function. This link is further bolstered by recent reports that increasing metabolic function by supplementation with NAD+ and its precursors confers cognitive benefits in aged rodents27,28,29, similar to the effects that we observed with NADH in the context of increased neuronal FTL1.

Excess iron and its abnormal redox cycling can also lead to ferroptosis30,31, an iron-dependent programmed cell death pathway observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease32,33. Ferroptosis was previously characterized using Fe2+-specific and Fe3+-specific DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors, triggering an increase in both Fe2+ or Fe3+ as well as a concomitant decrease in the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio20. The observed decrease in the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio resulting from ferroptosis is distinct from the increase observed after neuronal FTL1 overexpression in the hippocampus. These contrasting observations are likely reflective of key differences between normal aging in the absence of gross neuronal death and neurodegenerative disease conditions in which ferroptosis is observed.

Alterations in mitochondria dynamics are likewise widely reported in the brain during aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, with structural effects to the mitochondrial inner membrane disrupting the electron transport system by modifying the available surface area necessary for ATP synthesis to occur34,35. Both bulk neuronal RNA-seq and single-nuclei RNA-seq after overexpression and abrogation of neuronal Ftl1 point toward changes in the electron transport system linked to potential structural modifications in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Indeed, Gene Ontology analysis of bidirectional, differentially expressed genes indicates fluctuations in proton-motive force, implicating changes in electron transport through complexes I, II and IV that are coupled to electrogenic proton ejection across the mitochondrial inner membrane. These transcriptional analyses are further bolstered by in vitro Seahorse analysis, demonstrating altered ATP production after FTL1 manipulation in primary neurons. Collectively, this body of work posits changes in mitochondria dynamics, and structural alterations to the inner membrane, as potential downstream mechanisms regulating the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1.

From a translational perspective, aging is the most dominant risk factor for age-related neurodegenerative disorders2,36,37 such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Of note, mutations in the Ftl1 gene result in neuroferritinopathy—a rare inherited late-onset monogenic neurodegenerative disorder associated with movement disorders, dystonia and cognitive impairments38,39,40. Moreover, longitudinal studies of patients with Alzheimer's disease showed that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively associated with cognitive performance over 7 years and predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease41. Thus, our data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people.

The following mouse lines were used: C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, line 000664), C57BL/6 aged mice (National Institutes of Aging) and B6;129-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(CAG-cas9*,-EGFP)Fezh/J (The Jackson Laboratory, line 024857). All studies were done in young (2–3 months) or aged (18–22 months) male mice that were not involved in any previous procedures. The numbers of mice used to result in statistically significant differences were calculated using standard power calculations with α = 0.05 and a power of 0.8. We used an online tool (https://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html) to calculate power and sample size based on experience with the respective tests, variability of the assays and inter-individual differences within groups. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with humidity maintained at 30–70% and temperature at 68–79 °F (20–26 °C). All animal handling and use were in accordance with institutional guidelines approved by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Mice were anesthetized with 87.5 mg kg−1 ketamine and 12.5 mg kg−1 xylazine and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. Tissues were removed and processed for subsequent analysis. To process the brains, either the hippocampus was subdissected and snap frozen or the whole brain was fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 48 hours before cryoprotection with 30% sucrose.

Hippocampal and cortical neurons were isolated from E17 C57Bl/6J mouse embryos using the papain dissociation system (Worthington, cat. no. LK003153). Cells were plated at 100,000 cells per well on 12-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Carolina, cat. no. 633009) in 24-well plates. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 21103049) supplemented with B-27 (cat. no. 17504044), GlutaMAX (cat. no. 35050061) and penicillin–streptomycin (cat. no. 15140122). Media were partially changed every 4–5 days. On day in vitro 8 (DIV8), neurons were infected with lentivirus at multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1 and processed 10 days later (DIV18) for immunocytochemistry. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 minutes), washed and stained with MAP2 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. M1406, RRID: AB_477171), anti-GFP (Aves Labs, cat. no. GFP-1020) or anti-turboGFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. PA5–22688, RRID: AB_2540616) antibodies to confirm infection, along with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. H3570) for nuclear staining.

Lentiviral constructs for Ftl1 overexpression, knockdown and conditional knockout were generated using standard molecular cloning techniques. For overexpression, murine Ftl1 coding sequence (with partial untranslated regions) was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified from adult mouse hippocampal cDNA and cloned into pENTR-D-TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. K240020), sequence verified and subcloned into a synapsin–IRES–eGFP lentiviral backbone using NheI and EcoRI. The synapsin–IRES–eGFP plasmid alone served as control. For knockdown, shRNAs targeting Ftl1 (SH1–SH4) were cloned into the pGreenPuro system (System Biosciences), with a luciferase-targeting shRNA as control15,42. For CRISPR-based knockout vectors, six gRNAs targeting Ftl1 exons 2–4 were designed using CHOPCHOP43 and cloned into LentiCRISPR v2 (ref. 44). gRNA sequences included CGTATTTGTAACCTCCCGCA and CGCAGACTGGCGCGCCCCAG, among others. A non-targeting gRNA (GGCGAGGGCGATGCCACCTA) served as control. Validated gRNA sequences were subcloned into a Syn1-Cre lentiviral vector (Addgene, no. 68841; ref. 45) using PacI and NheI/XbaI. All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. Lentivirus production followed previously described protocols46. Ftl1 expression changes were confirmed by qRT–PCR and western blot in mouse cells.

HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, cat. no. CRL-11268) were transfected using a 4:3:1-µg ratio of lentiviral construct, psPAX2 (Addgene, no. 12260, gift from D. Trono) and pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene, no. 8454, RRID: Addgene_8454)47. After 48 hours, supernatants were cleared by centrifugation (5 minutes, 1,000g) and filtration (0.45 μm) and then concentrated by ultracentrifugation (24,000 r.p.m, 1.5 hours). Pellets were resuspended in PBS. Primary neurons were infected at MOI = 1. For in vivo injections, viral solutions were diluted to 1.0 × 108 viral particles per milliliter (vp/ml).

For hippocampal synaptic proteins, confocal images were acquired on an LSM 900 microscope (Zeiss) with a ×63 objective as z stacks (16 optical sections, 0.33-µm step size) per sample. Maximum intensity projections were generated for individual puncta analysis. Synapsin (555 nm) and gephyrin or PSD95 (647 nm) were quantified using the Analysis module. For co-localization, z stacks were split into four approximately 1-µm sub-stacks, each projected to two dimensions. Co-localization was assessed using the ZEN Toolkit 3D. For primary cell cultures, confocal z stacks (12 sections, 0.80-µm step) were acquired on an LSM 900 microscope (Zeiss) using a ×20 objective. Neurite length was quantified with NeuronJ (version 1.4.3) and imagescience.jar in FIJI (ImageJ version 1.54f). Sholl analysis was performed using the Simple Neurite Tracer in the Neuroanatomy plugin. Concentric rings (10-µm spacing, up to 300 µm) centered on the soma were used to quantify dendrite complexity by counting neurite intersections, which were summed to calculate total arborization and plotted as a function of distance.

Mitochondrial ATP production was assessed in primary neurons (75,000 cells per well) using the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Cells were plated on Seahorse 24-well plates pre-coated with 50 μl of poly-l-lysine (10 µg ml−1; Millipore, cat. no. A-005-C) after Ftl1 overexpression or knockdown. On the day of the assay, cells were equilibrated for 1 hour in Seahorse assay medium (DMEM supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine; Agilent Technologies). ATP production was measured using sequential injections of 1.5 µM oligomycin and 0.5 µM rotenone/antimycin (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 103592-100).

Procedures were adapted from Lin et al.46. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in oxygen (2 l min−1) and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to prevent corneal drying, and fur over the skull was trimmed. Adeno-associated virus solutions (1.0 × 108 vp/ml) were bilaterally injected into the hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus at the following coordinates (from bregma: AP: −2.0 mm, ML: ±1.5 mm; from skull surface: DV: −1.8 mm and −2.1 mm) using a 5-μl 26s-gauge Hamilton syringe. A volume of 2 μl per site was infused over 10 minutes (0.2 μl min−1). To minimize backflow, the needle was left in place for 8 minutes after injection and then partially retracted and held for another 2 minutes. Incisions were closed with silk sutures and VetBond. Mice received subcutaneous saline, enrofloxacin, carprofen and buprenorphine postoperatively and were monitored during recovery.

Neuronal nuclei were isolated from flash-frozen hippocampi following a modified version of Krishnaswami et al.48. Tissue was homogenized in 750 μl of ice-cold homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 μM DTT, RNase and protease inhibitors) using a dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, cat. no. 357538; 12 loose and 20 tight pestle strokes). Homogenates were passed through a 40-μm filter and centrifuged (500 relative centrifugal force (RCF), 6 minutes, 4 °C) and then washed and pelleted again under the same conditions. Pellets were resuspended in staining buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS) and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-NeuN antibody (Millipore, cat. no. MAB377X, RRID: AB_2149209) was added at 1:250, and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 hour. After two washes in staining buffer, Hoechst 33342 was added (0.01 μg ml−1), and samples were filtered through 35-μm mesh FACS tubes prior to sorting.

Neuronal nuclei were isolated from flash-frozen hippocampi using a modified version of the 10x Genomics protocol. Tissue was homogenized in 500 μl of NP-40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40 substitute, 1 mM DTT and RNase inhibitor) with 20 loose and 25 tight pestle strokes (Wheaton, cat. no. 357538), followed by the addition of another 500 μl of buffer and 7-minute incubation on ice. Homogenates were filtered (40 μm) and centrifuged (500 RCF, 5 minutes, 4 °C) and then washed in PBS with 1% BSA and RNase inhibitor. After another spin, samples were resuspended in 400 μl of wash buffer containing Hoechst 33342 (1:10,000), incubated for 5 minutes on ice, filtered through 35-μm mesh and sorted using a BD FACSAria II.

Nuclei were sorted on a BD FACSAria Fusion with a 70-μm nozzle and a flow rate of 1–2.5 ml min−1. Nuclei were first gated by forward and side scatter and then gated for doublets with height and width. Nuclei that were both Hoechst+ and NeuN+ (neuronal nuclei isolation) or only Hoechst+ (single-nucleus isolation) were sorted into TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, T9424) for RNA analysis.

RNA-seq libraries were generated using a modified Smart-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al.49). After RNA isolation with TRI Reagent, 8 ng of high-quality RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 18064-014) with anchored poly-dT and TSO primers. cDNA was amplified (10 PCR cycles) using KAPA HiFi HotStart polymerase (cat. no. KK2601) and purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A63881). Quality was assessed by Qubit fluorometry. For library construction, 2 ng of cDNA was fragmented (approximately 500 bp) with Nextera Tn5 transposase (Illumina, cat. no. FC-131-1096) and PCR amplified (12 cycles) with indexed Nextera primers (Illumina, cat. no. FC-131-1002). Final libraries were bead purified, analyzed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq (paired-end 2 × 150 bp, SP flow cell).

Reads were aligned to the mm10 mouse transcriptome using STAR version 2.7.3a50 with ENCODE-recommended settings. Gene-level quantification was performed with RSEM version 1.3.1 (ref. 51), and differential expression analysis was carried out in R version 4.0.2 using DESeq2 version 1.28.1 (ref. 52). Full pipeline details (version 2.1.2) are available at https://github.com/emc2cube/Bioinformatics/. Gene Ontology enrichment was performed using Panther.

Nuclei were submitted to the UCSF IHG Genomics Core for processing with the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ kit. Approximately 10,000 nuclei per sample were captured, and cDNA libraries were prepared following manufacturer protocols (10x Genomics). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S2. Base calls were demultiplexed using Cell Ranger version 7.1, and raw FASTQ files were processed to generate expression matrices, including intronic reads. Each sample yielded approximately 13,100–15,950 nuclei, with a mean depth of 27,000 reads per nucleus and approximately 44% sequencing saturation. Data were analyzed in R version 4.2.2. Ambient RNA contamination was removed using SoupX, and samples were integrated with Seurat (2,000 variable genes, 20 dimensions). Nuclei expressing fewer than 300 or more than 5,000 genes, or more than 2% mitochondrial transcripts, were excluded. Genes detected in fewer than three nuclei were filtered out. Doublets and technical artifacts were removed, and expression was log normalized. Dimensionality reduction was performed using PCA, and clustering was conducted with the Louvain algorithm on the first 20 principal components. UMAP was applied for two-dimensional visualization. Differential expression was calculated using Seurat (min.pct = 0.05, log fold change > 0.15, pseudocount = 0.1). Genes inconsistent across replicates were excluded. Visualizations included violin plots, UMAPs and heatmaps from average expression matrices. Volcano plots were generated using EnhancedVolcano.

To obtain sufficient synaptosomes for proteomic analysis, hippocampus and cortex from multiple mice were pooled. Synaptosomes were isolated following a modified protocol from Trinidad et al.53. Tissue was homogenized in sucrose buffer with phosphatase inhibitors (Na3VO4, NaF, Na2MoO4, sodium tartrate, fenvalerate and okadaic acid) and PUGNAc, followed by differential centrifugation. Synaptic membranes were collected at the 1.0–1.2 M sucrose interface and pelleted. Frozen pellets were resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, phosphatase inhibitor cocktails II/III and PUGNAc. Protein concentration was measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each sample (1.5 mg) was reduced with 2.5 mM TCEP at 56 °C for 1 hour, alkylated with 5 mM iodoacetamide (45 minutes, room temperature, dark), diluted to 1 M guanidine and digested overnight at 37 °C with sequencing-grade trypsin (1:50 enzyme:substrate). Peptides were acidified with formic acid, desalted (C18 Sep-Pak) and dried by SpeedVac. Tryptic peptides were labeled with TMT-6plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol: TMT126–131 for three young and three aged samples. Labeling efficiency was confirmed on a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap. Labeled peptides were quenched with 5% hydroxylamine, pooled, desalted and dried. Peptides were separated using high-pH reverse-phase chromatography on a Gemini 5-μm C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm; Phenomenex). A 9–49% acetonitrile gradient in 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) was run over 20 ml at 550 μl min−1, collecting 60 fractions. Fractions were combined (two per sample) into 12 final samples and dried for downstream analysis.

Tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a NanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were separated on a 50-cm × 75-μm ID, 2-μm C18 EASY-Spray column using a linear gradient from 3.5% to 30% solvent B over 185 minutes. MS1 scans were acquired from 375 m/z to 1,500 m/z at 120,000 resolution (AGC target: 4.0 × 105). Ions with charge states 2–7 were selected using a 1.0-m/z window, with dynamic exclusion (30 seconds) and MIPS filtering enabled. Higher-energy collisional dissociation MS2 spectra were acquired using stepped collision energies (30%/35%/40%) and detected in the Orbitrap at 30,000 resolution (AGC: 5.0 × 104; maximum injection time: 100 ms). The scan cycle was set to 3 seconds. Peaklists were generated using Proteome Discoverer version 2.2 and searched against the SwissProt Mus musculus database (downloaded 6 September 2016, with decoy sequences) using Protein Prospector version 5.21.1. Searches assumed trypsin specificity with up to two missed cleavages. Fixed modifications included carbamidomethylation (Cys) and TMT-6plex labels (Lys and N termini); variable modifications included N-terminal acetylation, oxidation (Met), pyro-glutamate formation (Gln) and N-terminal Met loss (with or without acetylation). A maximum of two variable modifications per peptide was allowed. Identifications were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate at both peptide and protein levels.

Data were filtered to only include peptides unique to a single protein. Quantitation of TMT data was performed by calculating ratios of reporter ion peak intensities between conditions along with variance for each ratio and median normalized. Protein abundances were normalized by the median of ratio distributions. The age-dependent changes were determined using a normalized median log2 Aged/Young ratio of at least 1.0, corresponding to a 2.0 fold change with age and a −log10 P value greater than 1.3.

To quantify mRNA expression levels, equal amounts of cDNA were synthesized using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4368813) and then mixed with SYBR Fast mix (Kapa Biosystems) and primers. β-actin was amplified as an internal control. RT–qPCR was performed in the CFX384 Real Time System (Bio-Rad). Each sample and primer set was run in triplicate, and relative expression levels were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method.

Western blotting was performed on both mouse hippocampal tissue and primary hippocampal neurons. For tissue studies, hippocampi were dissected, flash frozen and pulverized prior to lysis in RIPA buffer (Abcam, ab156034) with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 4693116001). Lysates were mixed with 4× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, NP0008), resolved by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab8245, 1:5,000), β-tubulin (Covance, MMS-435P, 1:1,000), NR2A (Sigma-Aldrich, 07-632, 1:1,000), synapsin (Abcam, ab18814, 1:1,000) and AMPA receptor (Abcam, ab109450, 1:3,000). HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A15999, 1:2,000) and anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare, NA934V, 1:2,000) secondaries were used for detection with ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). Signals were imaged with a ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad) and quantified in FIJI/ImageJ (version 2.0.0).

For cell-based experiments, primary neurons were cultured from E17 mouse embryos, treated as indicated, lysed under the same conditions and processed in parallel. Quantification was normalized to loading controls (GAPDH, β-tubulin or β-actin) and to the control group. Each tissue datapoint represents an individual animal; each cell culture datapoint represents a biological replicate. Statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests.

Iron imaging was performed using a modified protocol from Wu et al.20. Mouse brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (24 hours, 4 °C), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (3 days) and sectioned coronally at 30-μm thickness using a cryostat. Slices were stored at −20 °C in cryoprotectant. For each group, three sections from six mice per cohort were stained with technical replicates. Sections were rinsed in TBS (3×, 5 minutes), blocked in 2% BSA and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-GFP antibody (Aves Labs, cat. no. GFP-1020, 1:250). After washing, samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-chicken secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 703-545-155, 1:250) for 2 hours at room temperature. Excess antibodies were removed with TBS washes. To detect Fe2+ and Fe3+ simultaneously, DNAzyme-based sensors were used. Active and inactive enzyme (E/iE) strands (2 μM) and substrate strands (2.2 μM) were annealed in Bis-Tris buffer (5 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6), 40 mM sodium acetate, 200 mM NaCl) by heating to 95 °C and cooling to room temperature. Fe(II)-H5 and Fe(III)-B12 sensors were combined 1:1 with Hoechst. Brain slices were rinsed in Bis-Tris-acetate buffer, incubated in the sensor mix for 30 minutes and then washed and treated with 0.5× TrueBlack Lipofuscin Quencher (Biotium, PSF006) in 70% ethanol for 30 seconds. Slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) and imaged using a Nikon spinning disk or Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a ×20 objective. Channels used included 405 nm (Hoechst), 488 nm (GFP), 546 nm (Fe2+) and 647 nm (Fe3+). z stacks (four steps, 5-μm intervals) covering the hippocampus were acquired via tiled scan. Images were analyzed in ImageJ; maximum intensity projections were used. Background correction was done by subtracting the average signal from inactive sensor (iErS) controls in the same region (CA1, CA2/CA3 or dentate gyrus).

Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from 16–18-week-old male mice, 1 month after stereotaxic injection of Ftl1-overexpressing (Ftl1 OE) or control virus. All procedures were approved by the IACUC of AfaSci (protocol no. 0223). Mice (28–42 g) were deeply anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. Brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; continuously bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2). ACSF composition (in mM) was as follows: 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3 and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared using a tissue slicer (Stoelting) and recovered for ≥1 hour at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF prior to recording. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in submerged slices perfused with oxygenated ACSF (flow rate: 1.75 ml min−1; DynaMAX pump) at room temperature. Glass microelectrodes (1–3 MΩ, ACSF-filled) were positioned in the stratum radiatum of CA1 to record responses evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals via a concentric bipolar electrode (FHC, Inc.), placed approximately 100 μm apart. Stimuli were 0.2-ms biphasic pulses (0.4-ms total duration) delivered every 10 seconds. Input/output (I–O) curves were generated using 23 increasing current steps (20-µA increments) from threshold (20–100 µA). Test pulse intensity was set to 30–50% of the maximal response. LTP was induced using two trains of 100-Hz stimulation (100 pulses, 1-second duration, 5 seconds apart). fEPSP slope was measured from the initial negative phase using Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices). Data points represent the average of three consecutive sweeps. Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated using a 50-ms interpulse interval as the ratio of the second to the first EPSP. Traces were low-pass filtered with a Gaussian filter (−3-dB cutoff: 1,260 Hz). Representative LTP traces are averages of six consecutive responses (1 minute, unfiltered). Recordings were completed within 8 hours of dissection. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.4, Excel and StatView 5.0. LTP was expressed as percent of baseline; the final 5 minutes were averaged for group comparisons. Results are shown as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.

Mice were placed in the center of an open 40-cm × 40-cm square chamber (Kinder Scientific) with no cues or stimuli and allowed to move freely for 10 minutes. Infrared photobeam breaks were recorded and movement metrics were analyzed by Motor Monitor software (Kinder Scientific).

The NOR task was performed following White et al.54. Mice were habituated to an empty arena for 10 minutes (day 1) and then allowed to explore two identical objects for 5 minutes (day 2). On day 3, one object was replaced with a novel one, and exploration time over 5 minutes was recorded using Smart Video Tracking Software (Panlab, Harvard Apparatus). To control for object and spatial bias, object identity and novel object location were counterbalanced across animals. Objects were selected to elicit exploration regardless of genotype or age. The preference index was calculated as follows: (Time_novel / (Time_novel + Time_familiar)) × 100, where 100% indicates full novel object preference. Mice failing to explore both objects during training were excluded.

Spatial recognition was evaluated in a Y maze as described previously. During training, mice explored the start and trained arms for 5 minutes, with the third (novel) arm blocked. Maze arms were alternated and cleaned between trials. After a 45-minute delay, mice were reintroduced and allowed to explore all three arms for 5 minutes. Entries and time in each arm were tracked (Smart Video Tracking Software). Percent arm entries were computed from the first minute of exploration. The discrimination index was calculated as follows: (Time_novel − Time_trained) / (Time_novel + Time_trained). Mice making fewer than three entries in the first minute were excluded.

Spatial learning and memory was tested using an eight-arm radial arm water maze (RAWM) protocol55. Mice were trained to locate a constant goal arm, with the start arm varied between trials. Each incorrect entry was scored as an error. On day 1, mice underwent 12 training trials (blocks 1–4; alternating visible/hidden platforms), followed by three hidden-platform trials after a 1-hour break (block 5). On day 2, animals completed 15 hidden-platform trials (blocks 6–10). Errors were averaged per three-trial block. Experimenters were blinded to treatment and genotype during scoring.

NADH (300 mg kg−1; Roche, cat. no. 10128023001) as well as vehicle (sodium chloride solution, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. S8776) were administrated intraperitoneally with an injection volume of 200 µl per mouse. All animals were treated with vehicle or NADH once daily for 9 days and for 2 hours pretrial.

NADH (200 uM; Roche, cat. no. 10128023001) as well as vehicle (sodium chloride solution, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. S8776) were administrated for five consecutive days starting DIV14 until DIV18 included.

All experiments were randomized and blinded by an independent researcher. Researchers remained blinded throughout histological, biochemical and behavioral assessments. Groups were unblinded at the end of each experiment on statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. The distribution of data in each set of experiments was tested for normality using the D'Agostino–Pearson omnibus test or the Shapiro–Wilk test. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0, version 9.0 or version 10 (GraphPad Software). Means between two groups were compared using two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests. Additional statistical details are indicated in the respective figure legends. All data generated or analyzed in this study are included in this article. The main experimental findings are representative of two independently performed experiments. All replication attempts were successful. RNA-seq and proteomics data were not replicated due to resource limitations but were orthogonally validated.

Experimental replication was not attempted for negative data.

Small molecule solubility is a critically important property which affects the efficiency, environmental impact, and phase behavior of synthetic processes. Experimental determination of solubility is a time- and resource-intensive process and existing methods for in silico estimation of solubility are limited by their generality, speed, and accuracy. This work presents two models derived from the FASTPROP and CHEMPROP architectures and trained on BigSolDB which are capable of predicting solubility at arbitrary temperatures for a wide range of small molecules in organic solvent. Both extrapolate to unseen solutes 2–3 times more accurately than the current state-of-the-art model and we demonstrate that they are approaching the aleatoric limit (0.5–1 \(\log S\)) of available test data, suggesting that further improvements in prediction accuracy require more accurate datasets. The FASTPROP-derived model (called FASTSOLV) and the CHEMPROP-based model are open source, freely accessible via a Python package and web interface, highly reproducible, and up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than current alternatives.

The solubility of organic solids in various solvents is an essential molecular property that impacts the efficiency1, environmental impact2,3, and phase behavior4 of synthetic processes. Solubility is crucial in wide-ranging chemical processes spanning length and time scales including crystallization and filtration4, membrane-based chemical separations5,6, pharmaceutical design and discovery7, drug delivery and formulation8, the environmental fate of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)9 and geological-scale dissolved organic carbon flux10. By convention, solubility S in mol L−1 is expressed as \({\log }_{10}S\) since values can range over several orders of magnitude. Experimental methods for determining solubility are notoriously time- and resource-intensive11 and error prone, thus many published values are suspected of being highly inaccurate. The challenges of measuring solubility are especially painful in pharmaceutical development where organic solubility complicates synthesis and purification12 and aqueous solubility limits in vivo efficacy13. Given that solubility as a function of temperature is often desired, experimental determination becomes even more onerous. For these reasons a priori estimation of \(\log S\) has long been of immense interest to the chemical sciences.

Critically, the experimental error is typically systematic rather than random because organic molecules are often isolated as an amorphous solid, hydrate, polymorph, or impure cocrystal rather than the desired most-stable pure crystal, confounding accurate measurement14. The reported standard deviation in inter-laboratory measurements in \(\log S\) typically ranges between 0.5 and 0.7 \(\log\) units for aqueous solubility. For example, Katritzky et al.15 notably found the average inter-laboratory standard deviation of 411 compounds to be 0.58. Other reported average standard deviations in inter-laboratory measurements include 0.6-0.716, 0.6217, and 0.6018. Furthermore, other work found that inter-laboratory solubility measurements for the same solution could range over 0.86 \(\log\) units and in some cases could vary as widely as 1.56 \(\log\) unit19. Andersson et al.20 recruited 12 laboratories to measure solubility, standardizing materials and collection methods between laboratories, and found that differences in data analysis alone could result in variations as high as a standard deviation of 0.74 \(\log\) unit between labs. In sum, a variability between a factor of 3 (0.5 \(\log\) units) and 10 (1 \(\log\) unit) in the measured solubility of the same solute in aqueous solutions at the same temperature between laboratories is not unusual.

Prediction methods have evolved from empirical group additivity correlations21,22, to ab initio conductor-like screening model (COSMO) and its extension to realistic solvation (COSMO-RS)23, to bespoke-solvent machine learning (ML) models with random forest regressors24. Direct ab initio calculation of organic crystals using quantum mechanics is now possible but too computationally expensive for routine or high-throughput calculations25,26. Given the specific importance of aqueous solubility in drug discovery, most work has focused on predicting aqueous solubility27, and relatively fewer works have explored organic solvents, which are particularly crucial in synthetic processes. The aforementioned experimental variability limit of 0.5-1 \(\log S\) represents a bound on the performance of any data-driven prediction method on a given dataset, since it is impractical to remeasure a large number of solute-solvent solubility numbers with significantly better accuracy and precision. Currently, this variability limit has primarily been explored in the context of aqueous solubility in the literature.16,17,28 However, there is little reason to believe that the experimental uncertainty should be any lower in organic solvents, and may actually be higher due to increased variability in the experimental methodologies used across laboratories29. This variability defines the aleatoric limit - the ‘irreducible error' below which model performance improvements cannot be discerned.

State-of-the-art methods focus on applying deep learning to organic solubility prediction, including graph-based neural networks and descriptor-based models24,29,30,31. Existing models, however, suffer from a lack of generalizability for a variety of reasons. Boobier et al.24 trained solvent-specific models on only commonly available solvents at room temperature due to a lack of sufficient data to do otherwise, thus rendering their models non-generalizable by construction. Other works like those of Lee et al.30 fail to evaluate model performance when extrapolating to new, unseen solutes, a task which mirrors the real task where solubility prediction would be applied in a synthetic pipeline. The state-of-the-art model in literature by Vermeire et al.31 overcame some of these limitations by training a composition of deep learning models on the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy of solvation, and the Abraham solvation parameters, which are then combined via a thermodynamic cycle to predict the solubility in arbitrary solvents for a wide range of temperatures. A significant advantage of the Vermeire et al.31 model is that when interpolating from known experimental data for a given solute to a new solvent the model predictions are very accurate. Unfortunately without experimental data to supplement the models, as would be the case when screening new solutes in a discovery pipeline, performance drops substantially.

Here, we combine advances in cheminformatics software and a recently compiled database of organic solubility, BigSolDB,32 develop a state-of-the-art general organic solubility prediction model, and validate it under rigorous extrapolation conditions. By adapting the FASTPROP33 and CHEMPROP34,35 architecures to ingest two molecular structures and a temperature (Fig. 1a) we train models on BigSolDB to regress \(\log S\) directly (Fig. 1b). Our optimized models yield a factor of three improvement over the existing state-of-the-art organic solubility prediction models, with rapid inference times suitable for use in high-throughput workflows. We further demonstrate that our optimized FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models, which use fundamentally different molecular representations, both reach the irreducible error, or aleatoric limit, of accuracy with only a small fraction of the total available data. Further progress in organic solubility prediction will require higher quality datasets to determine the true accuracy of the best models. Our fastest model, termed FASTSOLV, is open source and can be downloaded as a python package (pypi.org/project/fastsolv/), accessed online via fastsolv.mit.edu, and is integrated in ASKCOS (askcos.mit.edu).

a In our modeling approach, solute (e.g. paracetamol) and solvent (e.g. ethyl acetate) structures are mapped to representation vectors. These representation vectors are concatenated to the solution temperature to arrive at a solution representation, which is passed into a fully-connected neural network and regressed to the \(\log\) of solubility (S, mol L−1). b Structures are mapped to feature vectors using a fixed representation of Mordred descriptors as implemented in FASTPROP, or a learned representation derived from message passing on a graph representation from CHEMPROP. We compare the performance of models trained on these fundamentally different solution representations.

In a real discovery context, solubility prediction is usually applied toward a solute extrapolation task, wherein it is desirable to know the solubility of a novel candidate compound in a variety of standard solvents for a given temperature. Thus, we rigorously trained and evaluated our model performance with this task in mind. However, attention to the ability of a model to extrapolate to new solutes is not typically heeded in the literature, making benchmarking our model performance challenging.

We selected Vermeire et al.31 as the current literature state-of-the-art model against which to benchmark our results, given that it is widely regarded as a highly accurate solvent and temperature-general model36,37. This approach consists of up to four machine learning sub-models trained on thermochemical datasets which are combined to yield solubility using a thermodynamic cycle. The overall model is tested on the experimental solubility data compiled in the SolProp dataset. Their objective was to to achieve excellent performance when extrapolating into new solvents, so the compiled SolProp dataset contains many solute structures already present in the training data (Fig. 2a). Since its publication, improved models for some constituent properties have become available, such as the solvation energy predictor developed by Kim et al.37, but we leave the original SolProp model intact for the sake of fair comparisons with its originally published performance.

The solutes seen during training have overlaps with the SolProp and Leeds testing datasets. b In this study, we rigorously test solute extrapolation performance of our models by dropping overlap between the training dataset of BigSolDB32, and the SolProp31 and Leeds24 testing sets. c Distribution of the label, the \(\log\) of solubility (S, mol L−1), across the training and external testing sets. d Demonstration of a single solubility experiment, which contains the measured solubility of a solute (dibenzothiophene) in a solvent (diethylene glycol) across a range of temperatures (K), as measured by Tao et al.58. e Rigorous data splitting strategy splits training and validation data by experiment, ensuring data is not leaked during model selection. f Parity plot demonstrating predictions of optimized FASTPROP-based model on BigSolDB, including training and validation data (N = 41,724).

We trained our models on the BigSolDB dataset32, which contains variable organic solvent and variable temperature solubility data at the precipitation limit. As a point of comparison with the model developed by Vermeire et al.31, we tested our models on the SolProp dataset, though with overlapping solute structures dropped from BigSolDB (Fig. 2b). This reflects our intended application—extrapolation into new solutes with no additional information. The Vermeire et al.31 model has many overlapping solute structures in its training data (see Fig. 2a), leading to overly optimistic reported performance. To demonstrate this and provide a second point of comparison in which both the model developed by Vermeire et al.31 and our models extrapolate to new solutes, we also tested on the Leeds organic solubility dataset prepared by Boobier et al.24 This dataset is more diverse in solute structures than the SolProp dataset but contains solubility data only near room temperature. This makes it a rigorous test of a models' capacity to extrapolate to new chemical space, likely also with a higher aleatoric limit given the absence of de-facto averaging over multiple measurements as in the SolProp dataset. The Leeds dataset has less overlap in solute structures with the Vermeire et al.31 training data than SolProp (Fig. 2a), making it a more stringent extrapolation test. Thus, testing the model developed by Vermeire et al.31 and our models on the Leeds dataset evaluates their ability to handle diverse solute chemistry without considering the effects of temperature on solubility. The distribution of the label \(\log S\) across all three datasets is similar, centered around -1 with a long tail in the limit of low solubility (Fig. 2c).

We trained our models using 95% of the remaining data in BigSolDB, reserving 5% for validation and model selection. To avoid data leaks we split our data to ensure no solutes appear in both training and validation sets, meaning that every group of measurements for a solute, one of which is visualized in Fig. 2d, will be grouped together. Since we split our dataset by experiment and solute (Fig. 2e), we ensure that we rigorously test extrapolation to new solutes. Additional details about model training and hyperparameter optimization can be found in Supporting Information Section S1. The performance of the FASTPROP-based model on training and validation is shown in the parity plot in Fig. 2f. Performance is quantified via the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), defined in Equation (1) as:

where yi is the true value, \({\hat{y}}_{i}\) is the predicted value, and n is the number of observations. Additionally, the Percentage of Predictions within 1 \(\log S\) unit, a metric based on the upper reported limit of experimental reproducibility, is referred to as \(\%\log S \pm 1\)24. This is calculated in Equation (2) as:

where yi is the true value, \({\hat{y}}_{i}\) is the predicted value, n is the number of observations, 1[⋅] is the indicator function which equals 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise. The optimized solution FASTPROP model achieves excellent interpolation accuracy, with RMSE = 0.22 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=99.3\%\). Similarly, the optimized solution CHEMPROP model achieved an RMSE = 0.28 and \({\%} \ {\log } \ { S }{ \pm }1=99.2{\%}.\)

After training solution FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models, their performance on extrapolation was evaluated on the Leeds and SolProp test sets and benchmarked against the Vermiere model as made available via a Python package in the original publication. We observe that the Vermiere model performs comparatively poorly on the Leeds dataset, with RMSE = 2.16 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=41.2\%\) (Fig. 3a). On inspection there is observable systematic bias, with the model often over-predicting the solubility. In contrast, both the solution FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models perform similarly well, with RMSE = 0.95 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=73.8\%\) for FASTPROP and RMSE = 0.99 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=70.9\%\) for CHEMPROP (Fig. 3b, c). The systematic bias is greatly reduced in both models.

Gray dotted lines indicate the bounds of \(\log S\pm 1\) around the parity line. a Parity plot of the Vermeire et al.31 model on the Leeds24 test data, which has a root mean squared error (RMSE) = 2.16 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=41.2\%\). b Parity plots of the solution FASTPROP model on the Leeds24 test data (RMSE = 0.95, \(\%\log S\pm 1=73.8\%\)) and (c) the solution CHEMPROP on the Leeds24 test data (RMSE = 0.99, \(\%\log S\pm 1=70.9\%\)). Parity plots highlighting model predictions of (d) Vermeire et al.31 (RMSE = 1.43, \(\%\log S\pm 1=66.9\%\)), (e) solution FASTPROP (RMSE = 0.83, \(\%\log S\pm 1=78.1\%\)), and (f) solution CHEMPROP (RMSE = 0.83, \(\%\log S\pm 1=76.1\%\)) on the SolProp31 dataset. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

On the SolProp dataset, the Vermiere model performs slightly better (RMSE = 1.43 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=66.9\%\)), but still exhibits systematic bias, with several specific experiments appearing with over-predicted temperatures gradients compared to parity (Fig. 3d). This performance is similar to what Vermeire et al.31 reported when no experimental data was available and only molecular structures are used as inputs to the model. In contrast, the solution FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models perform significantly better with RMSE = 0.83 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=78.1\%\) for FASTPROP and RMSE = 0.83 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=76.1\%\) for CHEMPROP (Fig. 3e, f).

When running inference on both the Leeds and SolProp test sets, the solution FASTPROP model demonstrated inference times about fifty-fold faster than the Vermeire et al.31 model due to its comparatively lightweight architecture. The use of molecular descriptors as an embedding also enabled analysis of results with SHAP29 (Supporting Information Figure S1) to aid in interpretability of model results. We trained four FASTPROP models with different initializations and ensemble them, terming the resulting ensemble model FASTSOLV; further results in this study referencing FASTSOLV refer to this ensemble model specifically.

To go beyond these aggregate performance metrics and visually inspect prediction and gradient accuracy, we also evaluated our model performance on specific case studies from the SolProp test set (Fig. 4). We selected two structurally distinct solutes from the held-out SolProp test set–risperidone, a water-insoluble antipsychotic, and L-prolinamide, an amino acid amide–and compared model predictions from the FASTSOLV model and the Vermeire et al.31 model against temperature-dependent experimental solubility data in different solvents. Risperidone was evaluated in polar acetone and isopropyl alcohol, while L-prolinamide was tested in highly nonpolar hexane and heptane.

Solubility predictions and experimental data as a function of temperature for solutions of (a) risperidone in acetone (blue) and isopropanol (orange) and (b) L-prolinamide in hexane (blue) and heptane (orange). Experimental data are plotted as circles, predictions from the Vermeire et al.31 model are plotted as dotted lines, and ensemble average FASTSOLV predictions are plotted as solid lines. The shaded error bands indicate uncertainty in model predictions for both models. For FASTSOLV, uncertainty is the ensemble standard deviation. For the Vermeire et al.31 model, uncertainty is propagated from uncertainty in predicted constitutive thermodynamic quantities. Experimental risperidone solubility data is compiled in SolPropVermeire et al.31 from Mealey et al.59. Experimental L-prolinamide solubility data is compiled in SolProp from Cui et al.60 Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We observe that FASTSOLV significantly improves absolute and gradient accuracy over the Vermeire et al.31 model for risperidone and L-prolinamide solutions. Specifically, FASTSOLV achieves an RMSE of 0.16 for risperidone and 0.25 for L-prolinamide, compared to 1.64 and 2.33 for the Vermeire et al.31 model. For risperidone, FASTSOLV correctly predicts the relative solubility order in acetone and isopropanol and predicts realistic temperature-dependence. The Vermeire et al.31 model, in contrast, overpredicts solubility, has greater model uncertainty, and overestimates the gradient with respect to temperature (Fig. 4a). For L-prolinamide, FASTSOLV successfully discriminates solubility between the highly similar solvents hexane and heptane, correctly predicting higher solubility in heptane, while the Vermeire et al.31 model predicts nearly identical values (Fig. 4b). The ability to rank solubility accurately and distinguish between structurally similar solvents is critical for high-throughput virtual screening and suggests that FASTOSLV accurately represents solvent structure.

We also sought to identify failure modes of FASTSOLV by probing solutes with inaccurate predictions. We observed poor prediction accuracy on anthraquinone solutions in acrylonitrile (RMSE = 1.80), methyl ethyl ketone (1.34), and isopropyl alcohol (1.20), using reference data from Cepeda and Diaz38(Supporting Information Figure S2). Model performance on the parent molecule of anthraquinone, anthracene, in the same solvents exhibited much higher accuracy (RMSE = 0.42, 0.37, and 0.12 in acetonitrile, methyl ethyl ketone, and isopropyl alcohol, respectively). To further probe this poor performance, we also evaluated solubility on 85 solutions of the parent molecule anthracene and multiple -quinone derivatives in a variety of solvents which are compiled in the SolProp test set. We found an overall RMSE = 0.52, with RMSE = 0.76 for 4 anthracene solutions, 0.44 for 32 2-ethylanthraquinone solutions, and 0.55 for 49 1-chloroanthraquinone solutions (Supporting Information Section S3). However, even though the predictions on anthraquinone are relatively inaccurate, the model is still able to correctly rank order solubility between acetonitrile, methyl ethyl ketone, and isopropyl alcohol (Supporting Information Figure S2), suggesting the model has an accurate molecular representation of these challenging polycyclic aromatics.

As previously mentioned, there is substantial discussion in the literature about the inter-laboratory variability of solubility experiments, which can range between 0.5-1 \(\log\) units, depending on the source and the variability metric used. We thus sought to establish if our model performance approaches this limit for the testing data. We first estimated the inter-laboratory experimental variability within the present datasets by identifying solutions with the same solute, solvent, and temperature but different literature sources; this yielded 34 solutions containing 8 unique solutes and 6 unique solvents. Between these solutions the average inter-laboratory standard deviation is 0.34 \(\log\) while the RMSE is 0.75 \(\log\) (Supporting Information Section S4). We use this value of inter-laboratory RMSE (0.75) for direct comparison with model performance, which also is evaluated in RMSE.

With this reference aleatoric limit established, we evaluated the model performance trajectory as a function of training dataset size. To do so, we randomly downsample the training dataset to some smaller size, train a four-model ensemble and report the performance on the test sets. Repeating this at different sizes of downsampled training sets with multiple replicates at each size generates a performance trajectory as a function of training set size (Fig. 5a). We observe that the performance trajectories for both the FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models are similar, despite representing fundamentally different modeling approaches. We also observe that the model performance on the SolProp test set plateaus after only 500 experiments (~5000 data points) are included in training for both the CHEMPROP and FASTPROP models. Similarly, the performance on the Leeds test set plateaus for the CHEMPROP model after only 2000 experiments (~20,000 data points), although performance of the simpler FASTPROP model takes slightly longer to plateau.

a Mean test Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) against the number of experiments used in the training dataset for solution FASTPROP and CHEMPROP on both the SolProp and Leeds datasets. Orange-colored curves show results for solution FASTPROP models, while blue-colored curves show test RMSE for solution CHEMPROP models. For both colors, diamond markers indicate test RMSE on the Leeds dataset, while circular markers indicate test RMSE on the SolProp dataset. The gray shaded area indicates the range of experimental uncertainties reported in literature (\(0.5 < \log S < 1.0\)). The plot cuts off at 0.7 for ease in visualizing the data. Error bars indicate standard deviation across three randomized training trials in which the subset of experiments used was randomly selected in order to account for variability in performance due to the effects of downsampling. b Correlation of FASTPROP and CHEMPROP model predictions on the SolProp31 test set. One-sided Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was determined, with null hypothesis r > 0 and N = 5700. The resulting r = 0.81, with p = 0.00. The 95 % confidence interval of r is [0.80, 1.00]. Black dotted line shows parity. c Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the gradients of \(\log S\) with respect to temperature T (\(\frac{d\log S}{dT}\)) in the SolProp test set. Vermeire et al.31 model predicted gradient CDF (green) achieves an earth movers distance (EMD) of 0.06 compared to the SolProp ground truth gradient CDF (black). FASTPROP predicted gradient CDF (orange, EMD = 0.03) and CHEMPROP predicted gradient CDF (blue, EMD = 0.02) compared to the SolProp ground truth gradient CDF (black). d, e Cumulative residual of FASTPROP (orange) and CHEMPROP (blue) model predictions of \(\log S\) in the SolProp test set against (d) solute molecular weight (g/mol) and (e) solvent Wildman-Crippen \(\log P\). Cumulative residual is multiplied by 10−3 for concise axis labels. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Next, we compared model predictions on these solutions with multiple sources. Specifically, measurements of N-acetylglycine solubility in acetonitrile and methanol were compiled in BigSolDB from Zhao et al.39 and SolProp from Guo et al.40 In acetonitrile, the experimental data differ drastically, and the model predicts solubility values in good agreement with the measurements from Zhao et al.39 (Supporting Information Figure S3a). In methanol, the data from both sources are very similar, and the model predictions are in good agreement (Supporting Information Figure S3b).

It is possible that epistemic uncertainty from model inexpressiveness or error could cause this plateau in test performance. To investigate this point further we also benchmarked our models against state-of-the-art SMILES-based foundation models, MolFormer41 and ChemBERTa-242 by fine-tuning on BigSolDB (Supporting Information Section S5). These models are dramatically different in fundamental architecture and number of parameters compared to FASTPROP and CHEMPROP. We observe that our models outperform both of these transformer models on the SolProp and Leeds test sets (Supporting Information Figure S4). This demonstrates that model testing performance is not limited by model inexpressiveness or low model capacity.

Interestingly, the FASTPROP and CHEMPROP predictions on the SolProp dataset are highly correlated, with a Pearson's r = 0.81 (Fig. 5b). This correlation is actually stronger than the correlation of either model's predictions of the SolProp testing set itself (0.66 for FASTPROP and 0.65 for CHEMPROP). Additionally, comparing the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of predicted gradients of \(\log S\) with respect to temperature demonstrates the strong correlation between the FASTPROP and CHEMPROP model predictions (Fig. 5c). We observe that the Vermeire et al.31 model has severe systematic error in \(\frac{d\log S}{dT}\), achieving an Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) of 0.06. In contrast, our two models exhibit similar and highly accurate gradient distributions, with EMD of 0.03 and 0.02. See Supporting Information Section S1 for further details on model training and gradient-based regularization. To further examine whether the models are predicting similar results, we plot the cumulative residuals of each model against important features in the SolProp test set. The cumulative residuals against solute molecular weight (Fig. 5d) and solvent Wildman-Crippen estimate of \(\log P\)43 (Fig. 5e) both demonstrate that the FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models are making similar predictions and errors across the SolProp test set.

Here, we leveraged state-of-the-art cheminformatics software and large compiled solubility datasets to develop accurate and generalizable solubility models. Under strict extrapolation, we observe a 2-3 fold decrease in RMSE over the state-of-the-art model from Vermeire et al.31. In addition, the relative simplicity of the architecture decreases inference times up to fifty-fold. To the best of our knowledge, our models are the best performing solvent- and temperature-general models in the literature on solute extrapolation.

As shown in the solute Venn diagrams in Fig. 2, many entries in the SolProp testing set are present in the training set for the Vermeire et al.31 model. This focus on interpolation during training leads to decreased performance in the extrapolation study shown in Fig. 3, where the performance decreased from an RMSE of 1.43 to 2.16 when moving from the SolProp to Leeds test set. Furthermore, we observe some nonphysical gradients with respect to temperature in the SolProp dataset, indicating that the model has not learned a comprehensive functional approximation of the temperature dependence of \(\log S\).

In contrast, our optimized solution FASTPROP and solution CHEMPROP models exhibit much more consistent performance between the Leeds and SolProp test sets, highlighting the strong performance of our models under rigorous solute extrapolation (Fig. 3). The slightly decreased accuracy of our models on the Leeds test set is attributable to the increased solute diversity (Supporting Information Figure S5) and lack of de-factor averaging from multiple temperature measurements, artifacts of the difference in its construction.

Both of our models also exhibit accurate predictions of the gradient on the solubility with respect to temperature (Figs. 4 and 5c, Supporting Information Figures S2 and S3), indicating that the models learned physically realistic temperature dependence, which is critically important in process chemistry applications44,45. This can be attributed to both the training procedure, which leverages gradient-based regularization (Supporting Information Section S1), and directly training on the BigSolDB dataset, which contains abundant temperature gradient data. Notably, unlike the Vermeire et al.31 model, our models cannot take into account existing experimental reference data such as the free energy of solvation or Abraham solvation parameters, and in situations where such data is available, the Vermeire model could become more accurate.

Our evaluation of model performance on specific solutions also revealed that FASTSOLV accurately models temperature-dependence and correctly discriminates solubility between similar solvents, such as hexane and heptane (Fig. 4). Additionally, in cases where the model was accurate (Supporting Information Figure S2a–c), or relatively inaccurate (Supporting Information Figure S2d–f) in absolute performance, the model still correctly rank-ordered solubility in different solvents. Taken together, these results suggest that our model could readily be applied in high-throughput solvent screening workflows, which is crucial in synthetic46 and crystallization47 process development.

The training data size study and the error analysis presented in Fig. 5 show that our optimized models, which rely on distinct molecular mappings, both converge to the same performance limits with similar distributions of predictions and errors. The highly correlated predictions and cumulative residuals show both models achieve not only the same average performance, but predict similarly across the tests sets. Since CHEMPROP learns a molecular representation, this model should be able to continuously improve performance as the size of the training set increases, as demonstrated by both Heid et al.48 for several molecular properties and by Vermeire and Green49 for solvation free energy. However, the test performance of our optimized CHEMPROP-based model stops improving after a relatively small amount of training data, at which point variability in the testing data prevents us from discerning improved model performance. As detailed in Section 1.3, we evaluated a measure of the experimental variability present between the training set and test sets, arriving at a standard deviation of 0.34, and an RMSE of 0.75 (Supporting Information Section S3). This standard deviation is well below the average standard deviation range reported in literature (0.5–0.7), suggesting this measure of experimental variability is likely a conservative estimate of the true aleatoric limit. However, our model performance on the test set approaches even this conservative estimate of the aleatoric limit, particularly for the SolProp test set (RMSE = 0.83 for both models). The comparatively poor performance of transformer-based foundation models MolFormer and ChemBERTa also support our conclusion that model expressivity is not limiting performance, but rather aleatoric uncertainty.

In the context of aqueous solubility, Palmer and Mitchell16 compiled a curated set of highly accurate experimental measurements, concluding that model performance was limited by QSPR methods, rather than experimental variability. Since then, innovations in cheminformatics software have led to highly accurate and expressive model architectures which have been shown to perform excellently on molecular property prediction tasks33,34. We expect these flexible models to continue to improve as more training data are provided. However, as shown in Fig. 5a, there is no statistically significant reduction in test RMSE as thousands of additional data are added. These results instead suggest that experimental variability in the test data limits model performance and that better test data is needed to accurately assess the quality of our models. This affirms the observations in the Vermeire et al.31 study, wherein the model was found to perform better on more accurate testing data. Current literature trends toward aggregating larger databases of published experimental solubility values. However, we have demonstrated that fewer than 500 experiments from our training set are needed to achieve near-optimal performance. Compiling larger training databases will not reduce test RMSE beyond the aleatoric limit demonstrated here. Future work should create accurate testing datasets of solubility in organic solvents in the same manner as the CheqSol dataset of highly accurate aqueous solubility compiled by Palmer and Mitchell16 or apply careful, scientifically-informed curation as LLompart et al.50 performed on AqSolDB51. Further innovations in model architecture or compiling more training data may improve predictions but they will be difficult to discern without better test data.

In conclusion, we present organic solubility prediction models using deep learning on fixed and learned molecular representations, then test them under rigorous solute extrapolation. Our models outperform comparable literature models by a factor of 2-3 on publicly-available test sets. We demonstrate that our models predict near the aleatoric limit of the experimental test data, motivating the assembly of highly accurate testing datasets for the field to notice further improvements in organic solubility prediction. Given the importance of solid solubility prediction, we have termed the fixed representation model FASTSOLV due to its rapid inference time and taken extensive steps to make it available. FASTSOLV can be accessed via any web browser for free at fastsolv.mit.edu, downloaded as a python package for use in scripting (pypi.org/project/fastsolv/), and is integrated directly within the ASKCOS (askcos.mit.edu) platform for retrosynthesis.

Rigorous evaluation of extrapolation requires careful preparation of the data for training, validation, and testing. Overlapping solute structures in the testing and training data are dropped from the training data to avoid data leaks. The ASTARTES software package52 is then used to randomly partition entire experiments from the training data into validation and training sets, again ensuring that no solute structures are seen by the model in both sets. A single model contains four individual networks trained on a different random training set to account for the affect of random sampling. Reported predictions on a given test set are thus the average prediction across these four trained models, and reported prediction uncertainty is the standard deviation of these predictions.

Prior to arriving at the architecture shown in Fig. 1, more complex models inspired by the work of Pathak et al. were tested53. Extensive efforts were made to identify a physics-informed neural network architecture which would infuse inductive bias into the network and thereby improve predictions. Each of the following features was made available during the automated hyperparameter optimization such that the algorithm would automatically deduce which was the most effective:

To allow the network to learn a unique per-solvent and per-solute representation rather than a single ‘solution' representation, distinct linear layers could be added after the initial mapping for both the solute and the solvent. This reflects the intuitive understanding that each solute and solvent should have a unique contribution to the resulting solubility which is independent of the exact solution.

The manner in which the latent solute and solvent representations are combined was also configurable, with some choices including elementwise addition, subtraction, multiplication, or simple concatenation. These are analagous to existing solubility prediction models such as the multiplicative Abraham model.

To explore the resulting massive design space, we leveraged the Optuna hyperparameter optimization framework of Akiba et al.54 Across many repeated instances of optimization, the search algorithm always selected the comparatively simple architectures described in the present study. The addition of inductive bias was unable to surpass reliance on the comparatively simple architecture, at least given the current aleatoric limit of available data. See Supporting Information S1 for further details, including a complete table of the search space explored in this work.

Sobolev training55 was implemented for both the Chemprop- and FASTPROP- based FASTSOLV models. This approach penalizes the network during training for both the error in the prediction of the solubility and the gradient of the predicted solubility with respect to the input temperature. The latter is approximated from the input data using finite differences, a reasonable approximation for the typically monotonic and locally-linear solubility curves. During training the gradient is found by continuing backpropagation through all network layers, as is usually done, and additionally the input temperature. The effect of Sobolev training is that networks generally converge in fewer epochs, have substantially increased accuracy relative to experimental gradients, and are stronger interpolators. The latter is of specific interest in some process applications of FASTSOLV. During inference, the FASTSOLV model will not continually increase predicted solubility past an input temperature of approximately 350 K. This is a deliberate design choice, given that many common organic solvents boil at or near this temperature: ethanol (351.5 K), benzene (353.2 K), acetonitrile (355.1 K), methyl ethyl ketone (352.8 K), hexane (341.8 K), tetrahydrofuran (339.1 K), and ethyl acetate (350.2 K).

The performance trajectory shown in Fig. 5 is generated by gradually increasing the amount of training data available to the model. The model is trained in the same manner as described in Section 1.1, actually containing four separate networks trained on different random selections of the downsampled data. At first the model sees only a small number of experiments during training before subsequent testing on the holdout sets. The amount is gradually increased to the full size of the dataset, analogous to performing more solubility experiments to gather more samples in hopes of improving model performance.

The meta-analysis of 33 studies, the first of its kind, looked at the relationship between sensitivity and common mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. Researchers found there was a significant, positive relationship between the two, concluding that highly sensitive people are more likely to experience depression and anxiety compared to those who are less sensitive.

In the study, sensitivity was defined as a personality trait that reflects people's capacity to perceive and process environmental stimuli such as bright lights, subtle changes in the environment and other peoples' moods. Often overlooked in mental health studies and clinical practice, which tend to focus on neuroticism and its association with mental health conditions, this research shows that understanding a person's sensitivity level is important and can have therapeutic implications.

For example, people with more sensitive personality traits may be more likely to benefit from treatment plans which involve techniques such as applied relaxation and mindfulness, which can also prevent relapse.

Tom Falkenstein, a psychotherapist and a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, said: "This is the most extensive systematic review on sensitivity and mental health in adolescents and adults to date, and is the first ever meta-analysis on the topic to estimate the impact of this relationship. We found positive and moderate correlations between sensitivity and various mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia and avoidant personality disorder. Our findings suggest that sensitivity should be considered more in clinical practice which could be used to improve diagnosis of conditions."

"In addition, our findings could help improve treatment for these individuals. Around 31% of the general population are considered highly sensitive, and, as our findings show, are more likely to respond better to some psychological interventions than less sensitive individuals. Therefore, sensitivity should be considered when thinking about treatment plans for mental health conditions. Our work shows it is crucial that the awareness of sensitivity is improved among mental health care professionals, so clinicians and practitioners can recognize the trait in their patients, and tailor treatment to their sensitivity."

Michael Pluess, Professor in Developmental Psychology at University of Surrey and Visiting Professor at Queen Mary University of London said:

"This is the first meta-analysis providing robust evidence that highly sensitive people are more prone to common mental health problems. However, it is important to remember that highly sensitive people are also more responsive to positive experiences, including psychological treatment. Our results provide further evidence that sensitive people are more affected by both negative and positive experiences and that the quality of their environment is particularly important for their well-being."

The systematic review and meta analysis of 33 studies was carried out by an academic team from several universities including Queen Mary University and the University of Surrey.

The Washington Research Foundation today announced Orin Levine as its new president and CEO, effective Oct. 6. 

Levine has worked for more than 30 years in public health, innovation and philanthropy. He was most recently with the Gates Foundation for a decade, leaving the organization in 2022 as the director of global delivery programs where he oversaw initiatives in immunization and primary healthcare. 

Levine is taking over leadership from Tom Daniel, a former chairman of the University of Washington's Department of Biology, who has led WRF for nearly three years.

WRF launched in 1981 to help universities and other nonprofits in the state commercialize and license their technologies. The organization has granted more than $182 million since its creation, issuing nearly $16 million to nonprofit research institutions in its most recent fiscal year. 

The foundation also supports innovation and entrepreneurship through WRF Capital. The latter has provided funding for 132 local startups over three decades and recycles its returns on investment back into the organization.

Brooks Simpson, WRF's board chair, noted in a statement that Levine joins “at a time when state and federal budgets are being challenged.” That includes a revenue shortfall and spending cuts from Washington leaders, as well as Trump administration efforts to withhold and cancel funding from the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, among others. 

“[Levine's] experience and exceptional leadership on the global healthcare stage will serve WRF and the region well as we navigate these uncharted waters,” Simpson said. 

She also thanked Daniel for his stewardship, noting that “WRF has become a widely recognized philanthropic organization in the region's life sciences space” during his tenure. 

Prior to his work at the Gates Foundation — the world's largest private philanthropy — Levine was the executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health for more than 10 years. He began his career as an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“I love innovation and WRF has a remarkable legacy of helping researchers turn bold ideas into innovations that improve lives,” Levine said. “I'm excited by the organization's ambition and for the opportunity to work with the team and our partners to help Washington's life sciences ecosystem reach even greater heights.”

A federal appeals court handed SpaceX a win on Tuesday, in a ruling that prevents the National Labor Relations Board from prosecuting unfair labor practices against the company. The ruling by the Fifth District Court of Appeals, which suggests the structure of the NLRB is likely unconstitutional, could have far-reaching effects.

The ruling keeps unfair labor practice cases against SpaceX and two other companies, Energy Transfer and Findhelp, on hold while the companies pursue their claim that the NLRB structure violates the U.S. Constitution. While the court did declare it unlawful, this is far from a settled issue and the NLRB is undoubtedly likely to challenge the ruling.

The three-judge panel said being subjected to a possibly unconstitutional administrative proceeding, which is what SpaceX claimed, is an irreparable harm — so the pause continues. The NLRB brought the unfair labor practices claim against SpaceX after it fired a group of employees who signed an open letter criticizing CEO Elon Musk and a culture of sexism in the company.

The core of the dispute is over whether the NLRB's in-house judges, called administrative law judges, enjoy unlawful protections that shield them from removal by the president. If that's the case, it violates constitutional rules governing the separation of powers, the judges said.

The panel included two judges appointed by President Donald Trump and a third judge appointed by George H.W. Bush.

Databricks is in the process of closing a fresh round at a $100 billion valuation, sources confirmed to TechCrunch. The round was originally reported by the Wall Street Journal.

A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch exclusively that the new round is about $1 billion and was wildly oversubscribed. Databricks, best known for its data analytics products, refrained from selling even more equity because it didn't need cash for operations after its once record-breaking $10 billion raise at a $62 billion valuation in January, according to the source. (OpenAI has since squashed the record with a $40 billion raise in March.)

The round was co-led by both Thrive and one of Databricks' early investors, Insight Partners, TechCrunch has learned. These two firms led the last round as well. The company has now raised about $20 billion since it was founded in 2013.

This was a primary round, meaning it didn't include employees selling their shares. However, sources close to the company say Databricks has already had two secondary rounds for employees in 2025. Those offers allowed employees to sell up to 40%, 50%, or 60% of their shares, depending on the size of their holdings. 

In both cases, the source said, the full funds available for the secondary round were not maxed out, meaning employees held on to more shares than they could have sold. While Databricks clearly isn't in a hurry to IPO, employees have had two recent chances to cash out shares. 

This new round, however, was raised to pursue two specific projects — a database for AI agents and its AI agent platform — Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi told TechCrunch in an interview. 

The company will invest heavily in its database for AI agents, making it generally available to all customers. It launched the product, known as Lakebase, in June at its annual tech conference. Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres, is enterprise grade and supports corporate developers' vibe-coding projects. This makes it a competitor to Supabase. 

“The database market is $105 billion of TAM [total addressable market], of revenue, sitting there, kind of unaffected in the last 40 years,” Ghodsi told TechCrunch, giving a subtle nod to how database giant Oracle has had a lock on the market for decades. 

“Here's the interesting statistic nobody's paying attention to: a year ago, we saw in the data that 30% of the databases were not created by humans. For the first time, they were created by AI agents. And this year, the statistic is 80%,” he said, adding that he predicts this stat to increase to 99% of new databases within a year. 

“There's a new user. The user is not human. It's an AI agent, and if we just double down on making that user persona successful, that's the wedge to disrupt that TAM,” he said.

As for how Lakebase will differentiate from Supabase and others already building Postgres-based databases for agents, Ghodsi said the key is “separated compute and storage.” 

By untying the pricey compute from the lower-cost storage, Databricks can affordably let users create many databases. “Because these agents are super fast. They just spin up lots of databases, much faster than humans can, but you don't want to go bankrupt because you're doing that,” he explained.

The second project Databricks will be investing heavily in is AI agent platform Agent Bricks, also launched in June. “Everybody's super focused on superintelligence,” Ghodsi said. “But that's not what we need in organizations.”

Rather than artificial general math geniuses or cancer-curing scientists, what companies need are agents that can reliably handle, unaided, mundane tasks like onboarding employees or answering personalized questions about HR benefits. 

“I think that's a much bigger opportunity, actually, for the worldwide GDP and for organizations,” he said. He believes that such focus will give Agent Bricks a competitive advantage. 

He also raised the extra cash so Databricks can get into the AI poaching wars. “As you know, it's pretty expensive to hire AI talent right now,” he said, smiling.

Microsoft is building generative AI directly into the cells of Excel, attempting to bring one of the defining apps of the PC revolution into a new generation of computing. 

A new “COPILOT” function for Microsoft's classic spreadsheet program lets users generate, summarize, and analyze data using plain-language prompts inside a cell. 

For example, a product manager with a column of raw customer feedback could type =COPILOT(“What is the sentiment of the comment in cell A2?”) to quickly label each remark as ‘Positive,' ‘Negative,' or ‘Neutral,' without using a chatbot or plugin.

“I just love this,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote on LinkedIn, sharing a demo video. In the 1990s, Nadella was a technical marketing manager for Excel — once showing how the program could pull data from a mainframe into a spreadsheet using Windows NT Server, a capability considered cutting-edge at the time.

The announcement Monday coincided with coordinated release of videos from tech influencers given early access to the tool. Their demos showed examples such as the ability to generate product descriptions, clean messy data by extracting names and phone numbers, and explain complex Excel formulas in plain English.

The move reflects broader attempts by Microsoft and other tech giants, including Google, Adobe, Salesforce and others, to refresh legacy apps with AI features. 

Previous integrations of AI into Excel focused on explaining complex formulas or suggesting data visualizations from the sidelines, acting more as a helpful guide than an active co-worker in the grid.

Microsoft says the feature is rolling out now on Excel for Windows and Mac to Beta Channel users with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses and recent versions of the software. The company says the feature will be available for Excel on the web soon through its Frontier program.

Meta is rolling out an AI-powered voice translation feature to all users on Facebook and Instagram globally, the company announced on Tuesday.

The new feature, which is available in any market where Meta AI is available, allows creators to translate content into other languages so it can be viewed by a broader audience.

The feature was first announced at Meta's Connect developer conference last year, where the company said it would pilot test automatic translations of creators' voices in reels across both Facebook and Instagram. 

Meta notes that the AI translations will use the sound and tone of the creator's own voice to make the dubbed voice sound authentic when translating the content to a new language.

In addition, creators can optionally use a lip-sync feature to align the translation with their lip movements, which makes it seem more natural.

At launch, the feature supports translations from English to Spanish and vice versa, with more languages to be added over time. These AI translations are available to Facebook creators with 1,000 or more followers and all public Instagram accounts globally, where Meta AI is offered.

To access the option, creators can click on “Translate your voice with Meta AI” before publishing their reel. Creators can then toggle the button to turn on translations and choose if they want to include lip-syncing, too. When they click “Share now” to publish their reel, the translation will be available automatically.

Creators can view translations and lip syncs before they're posted publicly and can toggle off either option at any time. (Rejecting the translation won't impact the original reel, the company notes.) Viewers watching the translated reel will see a notice at the bottom that indicates it was translated with Meta AI. Those who don't want to see translated reels in select languages can disable this in the settings menu.

Creators are also gaining access to a new metric in their Insights panel, where they can see their views by language. This can help them better understand how their content is reaching new audiences via translations — something that will be more helpful as additional languages are supported over time.

Meta recommends that creators who want to use the feature face forward, speak clearly, and avoid covering their mouth when recording. Minimal background noise or music also helps. The feature only supports up to two speakers, and they should not talk over each other for the translation to work.

Plus, Facebook creators will be able to upload up to 20 of their own dubbed audio tracks to a reel to expand their audience beyond those in English- or Spanish-speaking markets. This is offered in the “Closed captions and translations” section of the Meta Business Suite and supports the addition of translations both before and after publishing, unlike the AI feature.

Meta says more languages will be supported in the future but did not detail which ones would be next to come or when.

“We believe there are lots of amazing creators out there who have potential audiences who don't necessarily speak the same language,” explained Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a post on Instagram. “And if we can help you reach those audiences who speak other languages, reach across cultural and linguistic barriers, we can help you grow your following and get more value out of Instagram and the platform.”

The launch of the AI feature comes as multiple reports indicate that Meta is restructuring its AI group again to focus on four key areas: research, superintelligence, products, and infrastructure.

There's going green for the sake of the planet, and then there's going green as part of a policy initiative that winds up buying a bunch of glitch-plagued electric vehicles from a company that went bankrupt and can no longer service them.

The latter is the exact story of a New York-based company called American Lease, which has spent around $45 million for 2,800 cars from Fisker, a now-dead EV startup that only made 11,000 of that model in its short life anyway, and is now using them as part of NYC's Green Rides Initiative.

They have accordingly deployed the Ocean, a sort of Escalade SUV knockoff, across NYC as a ride-sharing or car service vehicle, meaning that the only Ocean you may ever see in your life is popping up multiple times throughout New York.

And in true tech bro fashion, the decision to buy these almost 3,000 now-defunct SUVs for millions of dollars was made fast—and broke things, possibly literally.

“We were sitting at lunch and I was reading an article about how Henrik Fisker, who founded Fisker, had listed his home for more than the market cap of the company at that point,” American Lease executive vice president Josh Bleiberg told Bloomberg. “So I was like, ‘Screw it: Let's buy Fisker.'”

Here's the problem, though: the Ocean debuted in 2020 and was immediately slapped by regulators for multiple safety issues, a problem that eventually led to a recall of all 2024 models and Fisker's bankruptcy filing the same year.

Fisker produced over 10,000 Ocean SUVs in 2023, but only 4,929 of these vehicles were delivered to customers. Fisker also faced challenges in selling the remaining inventory, an understandable position considering the recall issues.

Those problems included suddenly losing power, the inability to exit in an emergency, issues with the gauges and icons on the dashboard, software that did not meet safety requirements, brakes not working, and “unintended” vehicle movement.

“A door that fails to open can prevent occupants from exiting in an emergency, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in its findings.

A Bloomberg reporter who recently took a ride in one noted that you should definitely look out for the “ghost light”—which randomly goes on and then blinks for 10 to 15 seconds before resetting—or California Mode, which sometimes causes the windows to get stuck in the down position and then have to be reset at the company's Bronx site.

Another fun perk? The vehicles are often old, with their software in limbo, managed by third-party startups like indiGO Technologies, who are trying to keep them up-to-date. No word on how you'd fix a major problem with an Ocean, because the company that made it is dead, and it was the only model Fisker ever made.

This makes sense because after the 2024 recall, owners of the cars claimed that the Fisker development engineers were racing to meet the regulatory requirements and made so many changes so fast that many of them didn't work at all. That led to accusations of “bricking,” which is when an EV becomes totally unresponsive.

To be fair, American Leasing did get a good deal on the Fisker cars. While they once sold for around $70,000 as luxury EVs, the company snapped them up for around $16,000 each. Whether that price factored in the recall issues or repair costs, though, isn't clear.

American Leasing did not respond to a request for comment.

What's remarkable is that New York's push for an all-electric fleet—enforced by the city's Green Rides initiative—has inadvertently created a marketplace for these zombie EV startups.

The city aims for all Uber and Lyft rides to be emissions-free by 2030, but limited supply and declining federal incentives have left fleet operators scrambling for affordable replacements, often turning to used and propped-up vehicles from bankrupt or failing companies. The irony in this is that the owner of American Leasing doesn't think the Oceans will make it until that 2030 deadline.

“We don't anticipate these cars lasting much past 150,000 to 200,000 miles,” Bleiberg told Bloomberg.

As legal cannabis has expanded around the United States for both recreational and medical use, companies have amassed troves of data about customers and their transactions. People who have applied for medical marijuana cards have had to share particularly personal health data to qualify. For some patients in Ohio who use medical weed, a recent data exposure could impact their sensitive information.

Security researcher Jeremiah Fowler found a publicly accessible database in mid-July that appeared to contain medical records, mental health evaluations, physician reports, and images of IDs like driver's licenses for people seeking medical cannabis cards. The 323-GB trove stored close to a million records, including Social Security numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, dates of birth, and medical data—all organized by name.

Based on information that seemed to describe specific employees and business partners, Fowler suspected that the data belonged to the Ohio-based company Ohio Medical Alliance LLC, which goes by the name Ohio Marijuana Card. Fowler contacted the company on July 14; when he checked the database the next day, it had been secured and was no longer publicly accessible online. Fowler did not receive a response about his submission.

Ohio Medical Alliance did not answer WIRED's questions about Fowler's findings. At one point, though, the company's president, Cassandra Brooks, wrote in an email: “I need time to investigate this alleged incident. We take data security very seriously and are looking into this matter.”

“There were physicians' reports that would say what the underlying problem was—whether it was anxiety, cancer, HIV, or something else. In some cases, the applicants would submit their own medical records as proof” of their qualifying condition, Fowler tells WIRED. “I saw identification documents from lots of states, from everywhere. And I even saw offender release cards, which are basically IDs for people who just got out of prison that they submitted as proof of identity to get a medical marijuana card.”

Fowler says that most of the files in the database were image formats like PDFs, JPGs, and PNGs. One CSV plaintext document called “staff comments” appeared to be an export of internal communications, appointment histories, notes about clients, and application status. That file also contained more then 200,000 email addresses of Ohio Medical Alliance employees, business associates, and customers.

Databases that are misconfigured and have inadvertently been left publicly exposed on the open internet are a common problem online in spite of efforts to raise awareness about the mistake and its privacy implications.

What if game streaming was your main way to play your games? That idea—once merely a pipedream—is inching closer to reality with Nvidia's latest update to GeForce Now. Come September, players will be able to rent out a server worth 100GB or more to play whatever game they want, so long as they already own it. Even with more games and better streaming visuals, streaming can't replace all your gaming gear. But if you were feeling antsy about how much that new PC upgrade or future console could cost, a $20-per-month sub may seem like a bargain in comparison.

This “Install to Play” feature will be available to all paying members of GeForce Now sometime next month. A publisher needs to “opt in” to let their game be streamed remotely, so you may need to wait for your entire Steam library to be available. When the service is up and running, any compatible games can then be downloaded to a remote PC and played during a single session. But say you want to continue your game without needing to redownload it? Nvidia said it will allow users to effectively rent out 200GB of persistent cloud storage starting at $3 extra per month. More download space will cost more.

Microsoft has made similar moves recently with Xbox Game Pass service. Subscribers can stream some select PC and console games they already own on the Xbox PC app. Compared to that, Nvidia's Install to Play could make a massive windfall of titles available to stream from any place with a good-enough internet connection.

There are other streaming services like Shadow PC, which allow you to effectively rent out a remote PC and operate it like your own, but those can cost between $38 and $50 per month. If the streaming quality holds up, Nvidia's Install to Play, plus the already sizable library of games available to stream, could effectively max out your PC games library. GeForce Now already has apps on PC, Mac, and mobile, along with a dedicated application on Steam Deck. Nvidia also plans to release a specific app for the Legion Go S handheld with SteamOS. This version will allow you to play at 4K and 120 fps connected to a TV via HDMI.

There are several major changes coming for those who subscribe to the GeForce Now Ultimate subscription. Everybody spending $20 a month will be able to access 4K resolution at 120 fps on LG TVs and RTX 5080-level graphics capabilities through the cloud, a jump up from the previous RTX 4080. The new GPU will be hosted on Nvidia's servers at no additional cost to users. Finally, users will be able to play games at 5K resolutions. That will mean additional widescreen support for massive curved monitors like LG's 5K2K UltraGear monitors.

The big benefit now for paying the $20 subscription is access to “Cinematic” quality streaming mode. Essentially, the mode promises even better visuals than what you normally get with streaming. For those enjoying 100 Mbps download speeds, in-game trees will no longer look like a pixelated collage of stems and leaves. Streaming has the tendency to wash out colors and make details less distinct. Nvidia claims Cinematic quality mode will even make in-game HUDs and menus more legible. The mode could result in more accurate colors for games that support HDR, or high dynamic range, for better contrast between darks and lights. SDR content will still look better, but to a lesser degree.

How much better performance you will get from various titles will depend on the game. In our tests of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, we saw the card could get around 8% better frame rates on average compared to the RTX 4080 Super. Nvidia has a bad habit of showing off multi-frame gen capabilities on its GPUs and comparing the improvements to older graphics cards. Multi-frame gen is a technique where the GPU can insert multiple generated frames in between two rendered frames, increasing the overall responsiveness of a game. Older GPUs like the RTX 4080 could only do 2x frame gen, while the 50-series can handle up to 4x. Yes, a GPU doing twice as much frame gen will result in higher frame counts, if that's the only thing you care about.

There are drawbacks to frame generation. The technology can introduce small visual glitches that aren't there when the game is rendered fully natively. Frame generation also introduces latency between what you're seeing on screen and what's rendered by the graphics processing pipeline. Latency can be a real killer for game streaming, but Nvidia told Gizmodo it upgraded the CPU and memory in its SuperPOD servers with new technology, which will offset frame gen latency.

Nvidia also changed its formula for data packets, the unit of data formatted for telecommunication networks, to “intelligently,” which will result in fewer dropped packets. The company is working with major telecom companies like CableLabs and Comcast, as well as T-Mobile and its L4S network, for this new data technique.

Look, Nvidia isn't going to go to communities and set up quality internet. GeForce Now still can't completely replace a console or PC, not when the service is so dependent on your home internet speeds. Late last year, Nvidia added support for 1440p streaming and the ability to save graphics settings between games. The rub was the new limitation of 100 hours of playtime each month. The company has yet to raise streaming prices, but when every major streaming service's prices are ballooning every year, you shouldn't expect to keep shelling out the same amount for much longer.

After some major leaks earlier this month, Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 FE are finally here, and on paper, they look like a pretty good deal. While the “FE” moniker, short for Fan Edition, often signifies a lower price point in exchange for some compromises on features, the new Galaxy Buds 3 FE actually beats Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in a couple of key areas, and one of those battlegrounds is battery life.

See Galaxy Buds3 FE at Samsung.com

According to Samsung, the $150 Buds 3 FE offer 6 hours of battery with active noise cancellation (ANC) activated and 8.5 hours with ANC off. That's compared to the $190 Buds 3 Pro battery life, which clocks in at 6 hours and 7 hours with ANC on and off, respectively. I would have liked to see the ANC battery life get a bump here too, but it's nice to know that if you need to, you can get an extra hour and a half for less money. Those battery life numbers aren't mind-blowing in the general field of wireless earbuds, but they do put the Galaxy Buds 3 FE on par with comparably priced buds from OnePlus.

The other category that the Galaxy Buds FE 3 excel in is weight. These wireless earbuds are actually 5 grams lighter than the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which isn't an enormous difference but is enough to give the FE a slight edge if you're comparing the two against each other. It's also worth noting that Samsung managed to decrease the weight while upgrading the battery life, which is always a feat worth mentioning when it comes to any gadget, earbuds included.

The next biggest selling point is the fact that the Galaxy Buds FE 3 match a lot of the Pro features while keeping the starting price lower. The first thing you'll probably notice is that the new Buds FE 3 borrow the same AirPods-like design as the Buds 3 Pro, which is nice if you like Apple's white earbuds but maybe not so nice if you're looking for something different. There is a slight difference here in that the Galaxy Buds FE 3 come with a matte finish as opposed to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro's glossy one, though, and they don't have any LED lights on the stems—sorry, blades—themselves.

On top of a similar design, the Galaxy Buds FE 3 also come equipped with real-time AI translation features (only if you have a Samsung phone) and hands-free Gemini compatibility so you can activate and use your voice assistant without unlocking your phone. AI features probably won't be make-or-break for most people, but it's nice to know that they'll be there if you should need/want them.

As is the case with any pair of wireless earbuds, the biggest question will be in the sound. One notable difference between the Buds 3 Pro and Buds 3 FE is that the former has a dual-driver design while the latter has just one driver. It's hard to say what kind of difference that will make without hearing them back-to-back, but I'm guessing the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro will have an edge when it comes to fidelity and dynamic range. Even with that difference, however, the Buds 3 FE feel like a good deal for the price, and if you're looking to save a little bit of money but not make any major compromises, this could be the pair of Samsung wireless earbuds you're looking for.

You don't need to do much more to sell me on a pro-level gaming headset than Sony did with its latest Inzone H9 II. Take the Sony WH-1000XM6 ANC headphones—currently the crème de la crème in both sound quality and active noise cancellation—and stick a mic on them, wash your hands, and call it a day. It was never going to be that simple. The Sony Inzone H9 II is simply the best-sounding gaming headset you can get right now. But for $350, you expect perfection, and you won't find that with the H9 II. You'll get an amazing audio experience packed in between some odd software choices and a battery life that doesn't sound nearly as enticing.

Sony Inzone H9 II

This is the gaming headset you get when you care about the sound most of all, even if you need to plug it in more often than most.

Pros

Cons

Sony launched a slew of new PC gamer products under its Inzone brand, including a new $300 Inzone KBD-H75 keyboard with magnetic Hall effect switches and a $150 Inzone gamer mouse. And yet, the second-gen headset is what catches the eye first. The first thing to know about the Inzone H9 II is it contains the same 30mm drivers as the Sony WH-1000XM6. Already, I can see you drooling. These are “soft-edge” carbon fiber dome drivers that create a balanced audio profile with crisp sounds across movies and other passive content. So what does it do for game audio when you're not jamming out to the soundtrack? To put it mildly, the audio quality is impeccable. The low bass hits of rockets and crackle of automatic gunfire are immediately distinct from game to game. Using it for a title like Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 is the perfect match with its boisterous bass of every boltgun fired. The headset includes 360 spatial sound to get the sense of being surrounded by sound.

The Inzone H9 II is also a very light headset. At 260g, or 0.57 pounds, it didn't weigh me down as much as other full-spec headsets of its kind. The removable earcups felt extra plush surrounding my ears, though the headband sports a strange design that makes it odd to wear. Each side requires users to pinch a hinge to adjust its height. It requires a little more fiddling than other devices, but once it's on, the gaming headphones disappear into the background while the audio takes over. Here's another handy bonus of the Inzone H9 II: the pads swivel in both directions, meaning it's very easy to fold up into the included felt-lined soft pouch that comes in the box.

The original $300 H9 from 2022 was lacking in several ways compared to other peripherals. Though Sony laid out the H9 II's specs as if they were somehow the cream of the crop, the headset still seems out of step for a $350 device. It gets a total of 30 hours of promised battery life. That sounds like more than enough for two or three marathon gaming sessions, but I just got done reviewing the $250 Razer BlackShark V3 Pro with a promised 70 hours of total battery life with fast charging. HP's $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 claims to get 250 hours of battery life before needing a recharge. Always-on active noise cancelling would necessarily require more power from the headset, but the Inzone H9 II is still on the lower end of headset battery life, especially for its price.

See Sony Inzone H9 II at Amazon

If I personally had to sacrifice anything for good sound and a comfy fit, it would be extra-long battery life. Sony will get egg releasing a headset so expensive but with less than half the expected battery life. The Razer Kraken V4 Pro costs $400, but it also comes with haptic motors built in and an OLED control hub that acts as the 2.4GHz dongle. The Inzone H9 II still beats Razer's headset in terms of raw audio quality, but there are other factors that Sony is still behind on when competing with headsets at lower prices.

The first Sony Inzone H9 headset arrived in 2022 along with the company's then-new PC gaming brand. It was clear three years ago Sony didn't have much of an idea what PC gamers were looking for. Sony's Inzone PC software has improved by leaps and bounds, but the wide selection of competing headset makers is leaving it in the dust. Inzone Hub only allows for three—yes, three—EQ profiles, all of which are a different variety of first-person shooter. The FPS-1 EQ calls out footsteps slightly better, though I would set it and forget it on either FPS-2 or standard if I wanted to hear the full force of gunshots or explosions. The FPS-3 mode muffles the sounds of battle, though I didn't feel as if it gave me nearly as much of an edge for the sake of mangling my enjoyment of sound effects in various games.

I took the headset into many matches of Counter-Strike 2 (I'm terrible at CS2) and Halo Infinite (where I'm only marginally better). If this was supposed to rank as an esports headset, it would fall a little short despite the various EQ profiles. Sony built the Inzone H9 II along with the pro gaming team FNATIC, with a focus on Valorant and Apex Legends. The EQ profiles were designed to make players perform better in each game, but there's no language in the app to tell users which one they should use. Sony kept reiterating this is a headset tuned for first-person shooters, but it's not like the average gamer looking to play Baldur's Gate III with friends doesn't want a great experience as well. There are no other EQ options for an RTS or RPG gamer. Even if the headset's flat audio profile offers a stellar audio experience, I wonder if Sony couldn't have spent some of its spare time fine-tuning some more game-specific options.

The Inzone H9 II is an odd beast to control. The headset includes a large mute mic button right at the top along with a large volume wheel. All of that's well and good, but it's still hard to know what settings you're using while wearing the device. Unlike other headsets that will indicate settings with full voice cues, the H9 II offers audio chimes when you turn on simultaneous Bluetooth or change from ANC to ambient modes. At least the mic includes a bright red light to let you know if your friends can hear you chewing in the background.

See Sony Inzone H9 II at Amazon

One of the big issues with the original Inzone H9 from three years ago was its mic quality. This time around, Sony seriously upgraded the hell out of its mic quality. I recorded myself compared to several other major headsets, including some of the latest Alienware Pro Wireless and Razer headsets, and the Inzone H9 II stood out easily as one of the better for overall voice quality. The new detachable mic supports a wider band of sound, meaning it can pick up on more minute differences in voice. Despite construction going on outside the office window three feet away, the mic didn't pick up any rumbling jackhammers or car horns.

One of the WH-1000XM6's best standout features is its excellent active noise cancellation that blocks out so much ambient noise I would fear taking a stroll with them near a busy highway. That headset uses a number of exclusive processors and AI assistance to limit outside noise. The Inzone H9 II uses Sony's noise sensors it has stuck with for its NC 1000X series, though the company didn't go as far as to claim it's the same as its latest headset. This isn't the device meant to survive being surrounded by a chorus line of jackhammers. Instead, the Inzone H9 II's sensors were more than enough to help me ignore the jet engine fans of multiple PCs and gaming laptops, along with an annoyingly squeaky office HVAC system making mammoth mouse sounds above my head. My editor was trying to talk to me a foot away as I was gaming, and with the volume on medium settings, I couldn't hear a peep from him. The device also has an ambient mode that can let some outside noise cut through, but there's no full ‘transparency' setting that other headsets have, which may have offered better battery life. This is a headset meant to get you fully engaged with the content you're playing, to the detriment of your boss or partner desperate to get your attention.

The BlackShark V3 Pro is a gaming headset so dedicated to the “pro” gamers it feels like it missed me personally. Every EQ option, aka the equalization settings, is geared toward honing in on enemy footsteps or gunshots. If you don't care too much about smashing face in multiplayer, the Inzone H9 II is more ideal.

The headset also supports PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2. This is a Sony product, after all, which means you can expect it will feature excellent 3D audio on PS5 after you complete the lengthy setup process. The headset proved a great option if you swap between PC and Sony's mainline console for all your gaming needs. And yet, it could be so much more seamless. PlayStation Pulse products and Sony's upcoming fight stick controller use the PlayStation Link standard for low-latency 2.4GHz connection to the console. PlayStation's console gaming arm recently said this should allow for more than one device connected at the same time through a single dongle. Why can't Sony simply make PlayStation Link standard across its entire gaming hardware suite? It's as if the one hand of the Japanese tech giant isn't talking to the other.

All my many quibbles can't override the excellent comfort and the overwhelmingly balanced sound quality. It's a much better headset than the first Sony Inzone H9 and now it has a mic you'll actually want to use. But it's still damn expensive, even if you think of the Inzone H9 II like a WH-1000XM6 with a built-in mic. With its small but noticeable software and hardware foibles, the Inzone H9 II may not look like the part of a pure esports headset. But for when I want to ignore the world and bask in the exclusive bubble with just me and my game, I know I would reach for the Inzone H9 II before any of the many headsets I've used.

OpenAI is reportedly on the verge of a roughly $500 billion valuation, a figure that would make it the most valuable private company in the world—bigger than SpaceX, TikTok's parent company Bytedance, and even public giants like Palantir. It's a staggering number for a company with an “astronomical burn rate.” How is this even possible?

As Axios reports, there are actually two deals in play: a SoftBank-led round valuing the company at $300 billion, which won't close until year's end, and a secondary sale of employee shares at a far steeper $500 billion valuation. Most of the cheaper shares have already been snapped up, leaving investors to fight over the pricier ones.

One OpenAI investor—who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing an NDA—compared it to the dawn of the internet. “We're in one of the biggest technology shifts [in history],” the investor tells me. “The outcomes continue to get bigger than people think.”

The investor argues that the math for investing at the $500 billion valuation is straightforward: Hypothetically, if ChatGPT hits 2 billion users and monetizes at $5 per user per month—“half the rate of things like Google or Facebook”—that's $120 billion in annual revenue.

“That alone would support a trillion-and-a-half-dollar company, which is a pretty good return, just thinking about ChatGPT,” the investor says. “It doesn't include all the rest of the stuff they're working on, all the enterprise stuff, all the agentic stuff, all of the work they're doing on hardware.”

The $5 figure is, admittedly, back-of-the-envelope math. Today, ChatGPT has 700 million weekly active users—and fewer than 10 percent of them pay for it.(OpenAI declined to comment on this figure.) The investor's projections are ambitious, and they seem to discount the threat of major players like Google or Meta eating OpenAI's lunch. “The half-a-trillion-dollar question now is, to what extent will OpenAI be able to retain the customers it has acquired, and simultaneously be able to bring its costs to a point where it can, in fact, monetize at [hypothetically] $5 per user per month,” says Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.

The bet here is that OpenAI is the next Facebook or Google. For investors buying in at $500 billion, “they're expecting an IPO above a trillion in two to three years, otherwise the rate of return does not justify the investment,” says Glenn Okun, who's also a business professor at NYU. That would mean leaping into the top 10 most valuable public companies in the world almost overnight. The investor says they have a longer time horizon than that, but “of course an IPO is the most sensible path given the scale of the company.” Though the investor admits, yes, the company would need to be valued at more than $1 trillion to make the investment worthwhile.

Stranger things have happened—particularly to OpenAI. In the first seven months of 2025, the company doubled its projected annual revenue to $12 billion, which suggests OpenAI is bringing in about $1 billion per month. Enterprise adoption has surged, too, reaching 5 million paying business users this month. Not to mention what potential advertising revenue could do to its bottom line. To the investor, these are signs of a company with the momentum to win: “People don't like unprecedented things, because most people like to pattern-match,” the investor says. “Everything this company has done has been unprecedented, from the pace of its revenue growth to the AI technology.”

It's a nice dream. But OpenAI's spending is ballooning alongside its revenue. It's reportedly expecting a cash burn of $8 billion this year, and Altman said at a recent dinner in San Francisco that much of OpenAI's infrastructure costs are for inference, as opposed to training—and he expects the startup to spend trillions of dollars on data centers in the “not very distant future.” That means in the fantastical future where ChatGPT may have billions of users, it would cost trillions of dollars to serve them.

It's extraordinarily expensive to scale such a power-hungry technology. Even if the chips get faster and cheaper, the overall costs grow as the company works to train even bigger models and serve them to a growing user base sending off billions of queries, Sundararajan tells me.

The investor, however, brushes off profitability concerns, saying OpenAI can spread those massive costs across its entire user base. “It is not cheap, and it's not for the faint of heart in terms of investment,” they add.

Okun takes a more skeptical approach. “What we're looking at here is major capital investment with the sorts of valuations that may be very hard to to actually reach,” he says.

The $500 billion headline also has caveats. Private-market pricing reflects what a small number of investors are willing to pay for a small number of shares. In other words, the feeding frenzy is factored into the share price.

“In all likelihood, it's an approximation,” Okun says of the valuation. He adds that the number reflects both firm value and the competition between investors to get a slice of the pie. “We really can't accurately disentangle those two streams of value in order to isolate firm value.”

Right now, investors appear to have a nearly insatiable appetite for AI startups. According to recent PitchBook data, a third of all venture dollars in the second quarter of this year went to five companies—all in the AI space—which is more than double the spending in 2024.

Is that a bubble? Altman admitted as much at the dinner. But in classic Altman fashion, he reminded attendees that's actually a good thing: “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history [like] the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important, the internet was a really big deal.”

Startup valuations have always reflected how well the CEO can sell a vision. At OpenAI, Altman cranks it up to 11, and it's seemingly paying off. Meanwhile, investors are betting that ChatGPT becomes as indispensable as Google, that billions of people happily pay to use it, and competitors quietly fade into irrelevance. Whether any of that actually happens almost doesn't matter. For now, the story is worth half a trillion all on its own.

“There's definitely risk in it,” the investor tells me. “The story is not fully written.”

Security company CLEAR is partnering with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to launch new biometric “eGates” at select airports across the country, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, to ease bottlenecks at security checkpoints ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026.

The public-private partnership comes at no cost to taxpayers, CLEAR said in a news release on Tuesday.

The automated eGates — available to CLEAR+ members who opt in — are designed to conduct real-time biometric verification, matching a traveler's facial image with their identity document and boarding pass.

Once identity is confirmed, a traveler passes the gate and proceeds to physical screening, bypassing the TSA podium.

“It's fully integrated. It's one step. And the total transaction time should be between three and six seconds,” CLEAR CEO Caryn Seidman-Becker told Axios.

CLEAR says that it transmits only limited data (live photo, boarding pass, ID photo used for enrollment and identity information), and that it has no access to watchlists, cannot override TSA gate decisions, and does not manually open gates.

The pilot program debuts Tuesday at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), next week at Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA), and the week of Aug. 31 at Sea-Tac Airport (SEA). CLEAR plans to expand eGate implementation across more than 30 airports in the next year, according to The Points Guy.

More than 20 million international visitors are expected to fly to the U.S. for the World Cup soccer tournament next year, and Seattle is hosting six matches.

Adoption of biometrics and facial recognition technology is becoming more commonplace in air travel. A handful of airlines at Sea-Tac offer customers the option of using TSA's PreCheck Touchless ID.

CLEAR+ is a paid membership program that costs $209 per year.

More than two decades after Kirby Air Ride launched on GameCube, Kirby Air Riders is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20. Director Masahiro Sakurai announced the news in a Nintendo Direct that aired today, alongside a detailed look at the upcoming racing game. “It basically is like Mario Kart,” Sakurai says.

The sequel is also the first Kirby title to be directed by fan favorite Sakurai since the original.

“Oh dear,” Sakurai said during the Direct. “Why is making a game so hard?”

Air Riders expands on the original, which came out in 2003, with more characters, modes, and new controls beyond the single button players used to boost. “This time we've added a second button,” Sakurai said. “Unfortunately.” While the original game featured different versions of Kirby to play, Air Riders adds King Dedede, Meta Knight, and even lesser known characters like Starman, all of which can use copy abilities like Kirby. Each character has a special move that can boost their speed, attack other racers, or activate abilities like turning into a giant snowball. The game allows up to eight human players locally or 16 online.

In addition to traditional races, Air Riders features City Trial mode, where players will need to upgrade their rides as quickly as possible by gathering power-ups, stealing new machines, and attacking opponents. Random field events will give players the chance to join and play short races and battles; players have only five minutes to upgrade their machines as much as possible before entering Stadiums, where the main competitions take place.

The game is being developed with Bandai Namco Studios and Sora LTD—teams that worked on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate—instead of longtime Kirby developer HAL Laboratory.

Sakurai, creator of both Kirby and the Super Smash Bros. series, has had his hand in a few projects over the past few years. In addition to wrapping up work on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, he also enjoyed a run as a YouTuber. For more than two years, he published over 250 videos on his channel, Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games, about game development. In his finale episode, he revealed that he'd been working on a new game. Today, he confirmed that project is Kirby Air Riders.

Kirby Air Riders joins a fairly light first-party launch lineup for Switch 2 and is the second major racing game to launch this year for the console, following Mario Kart World. Sakurai says even he pointed out the two games' similarity when asked to work on it, but added that “the appeal of the game is not actually the races.” Air Riders is bigger on its modes that offer more than just a dash to the finish.

Nintendo is expected to announce more details, including the game's price, later this year. A hands-on demo will be playable at PAX West in Seattle August 29–September 1.

Over the past decade, organized crime gangs working out of Southeast Asia have scammed people out of billions of dollars. Operating giant scam compounds—where experts estimate around 200,000 victims of human trafficking have been forced to run scams 24 hours a day—the criminal enterprises have used an array of romance, cryptocurrency investment, and impersonation fraud to target thousands of people around the world. Now new research reveals that the already chilling scam compounds may have an even darker underbelly.

Nearly 500 reports linked to child sextortion made over a two-year period to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a US child safety organization, have been tied back to scam compounds operating in Southeast Asia, according to new research exclusively shared with WIRED by the anti-slavery organization International Justice Mission. Another 18,000 child exploitation reports made to NCMEC also contain IP addresses used by devices at known scam compound locations, the research says.

At least 40 of 44 previously identified scam compounds in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos can be linked to the child sextortion reports, says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the IJM who focuses on combatting forced scamming and was part of the team behind the study. Heintz says it is the “first clear evidence” that the forced scamming operations are “likely” linked to global instances of child sextortion. “It was surprising how widespread it was,” he says, adding that the wider data also indicated the locations of previously undiscovered scam compounds.

The findings directly linking scam compounds to the reports of sexual exploitation of children and young people come as sextortion cases have exploded in the past few years. Sextortion often involves criminals tricking someone into sharing sexually explicit images, which they then use to blackmail that person into making payments. While all cases of sextortion can be devastating, criminals have increasingly targeted children, and dozens of teenage boys have reportedly taken their own lives as a result. Many sextortion cases against children have been linked back to Nigerian Yahoo Boy scammers and other West African fraudsters.

The new IJM research, which was funded by child safety group Safe Online and the Thomson Reuters Social Impact Institute, reviewed data from more than 1.1 million “online enticement” incidents—including 3.1 million IP addresses—that tech companies reported to NCMEC between January 2022 and August 2024. Tech companies and electronic service providers in the US are required to report online child exploitation incidents to NCMEC's CyberTipline.

The data was cross-referenced with IP addresses known to be used at the location of 27 scam compounds in Cambodia, 16 in Myanmar, and one in Laos. In total, 18,017 of the child exploitation reports to NCMEC contained IP addresses used at the scam compounds. To establish a stronger link between the potential sextortion cases and the scam centers, the IJM researchers also obtained mobile phone advertising data from data brokers and compared it against the data from NCMEC. Taking all of their analysis together, the IJM concluded that at least 493 of the reports made to the NCMEC are “likely” directly connected to forced scamming locations.

“There are limitations to what we can see with this data, but what we have so far is accurate,” says Heintz. “If anything, I think it's undercounting the scale of the problem.”

The data the researchers obtained is only a snapshot of some alleged sextortion activity linked to scam centers. For instance, advertising industry mobile data is incomplete, the NCMEC data does not contain all possible reported sextortion cases, and tech companies reporting data to NCMEC likely skew toward American firms.

In its report, the IJM points to multiple reports of scam centers being linked to wider sextortion against adults. The report does not rule out that children are being deliberately targeted with sextortion crimes but notes that children may also get caught in schemes targeted at adults if they are using parents' or other caregivers' devices. Now that this research has demonstrated a link, the researchers emphasize that further research is needed to strengthen authorities' understanding of the connection between child sextortion and scam compounds and determine whether children are being specifically targeted. NCMEC did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.

Often run by Chinese organized crime groups, scam compounds have exploded across Southeast Asia since roughly 2019. Criminals have trafficked thousands of people from more than 70 countries into the compounds, where they are usually held captive, have their passports taken away, and are forced to scam people online. If they refuse, they can be beaten and brutalized. Initially targeting Chinese speakers, the scam centers have deployed so-called “pig butchering” scams, alongside various other forms of investment and romance scams. With vast flows of illicit cash, the criminals have increasingly opened scam compounds in the Middle East, West Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe; they have targeted scams against people across the world and altered the ways they scam people.

“Scam centers and cyber-enabled fraud networks in Southeast Asia have rapidly diversified their business lines and scope of targeting, increasingly integrating sextortion as well as malware, deepfakes and pornography into their operations,” says John Wojcik, a senior threat researcher focusing on Asia at the cybersecurity firm Infoblox. An October 2024 report into the growth of scam compounds from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which was partially authored by Wojcik, who worked at the organization at the time, pointed to the increase in sextortion cases against adults and the use of AI.

Wojcik says the IJM research is consistent with reports from law enforcement agencies within Southeast Asia that there has been a “steady rise” in financial sextortion cases against children.

Hieu Minh Ngo, a reformed criminal hacker and now cybercrime investigator at the Vietnamese nonprofit scam-fighting organization Chongluadao, says he has seen sextortion efforts targeting young people and adults in Vietnam in the past few years, and these “operations trace back to scam compounds” located along the Vietnam-Cambodia border. “The tactics are consistent: Bad actors pose as attractive individuals on social media, build trust with victims, then coerce them into sharing sensitive images or videos,” Ngo says. The use of AI deepfakes is also increasing, he adds. “This trend shows clear links between regional scam compounds and organized sextortion targeting children and vulnerable populations.”

“It's likely only a matter of time before they scale up operations in other parts of the world, as they have done in the past,” Wojcik says.

While some efforts have been made to shut down the operations of scam compounds—including thousands of alleged arrests, internet and power shutdowns, and sweeping political declarations—the scam compounds are still operational and appear to be continually expanding. Criminal organizations have flourished as a result of local corruption, weak enforcement of laws, and the ability to use Big Tech services to run scams, such as creating social media accounts that are used to trick people and using web hosting infrastructure to run scams.

Heintz says that governments and tech companies need to do more to tackle the many crimes linked to the scam compounds—including human trafficking, fraud, money laundering, and now, following the IJM's research, evidence that children are likely being harmed. “Everyone is treating this just as a financial crime or a fraud crime, where the tools that everyone can use are limited to that type of crime,” Heintz says. “Now that you have internet crimes against children, then that should open the door for more tools that both tech companies and governments can use.”

Elijah Wood will always be associated with the Lord of the Rings movies, but the actor has also built up a varied array of unusual characters across his career. Maybe his weirdest yet comes with The Toxic Avenger, the long-awaited remake of the cult classic that's finally hitting theaters later this month. Wood has a memorable supporting role as Fritz, the brother and henchman of Kevin Bacon's sleazy villain. He's not as freaky-looking as the title mutant, played in human form by Peter Dinklage, but he comes awfully close.

io9 got a chance to talk to Wood about The Toxic Avenger (and a few other things in that vein) at the recent San Diego Comic-Con.

Cheryl Eddy, io9: Fritz is many things. He's the head of security, he's a music manager, he's the villain's brother. And he's also very unusual looking. Did you come up with a backstory for him to explain what his life's been like until this point?

Elijah Wood: No, but I think the writing's on the wall there, like, he was born physically deformed, probably picked on. His brother was always smarter, more handsome, more capable. I think he desperately wanted to be loved and sort of wasn't; he was kicked to the side and treated like shit. And so I think that turned him into, well, “I guess I'm the henchman,” and I think that brought out, not necessarily an evil in him, but I think it was like, resentment breeds dark deeds. I think that's kind of how he became who he is.

And then, of course, his brother was just like, “I'm going to have you do my bidding,” to which he sort of acquiesced. And I think you see that in the movie; he probably really wants just to be loved. He's actually sort of a sweet guy, and he's just misunderstood.

io9: We saw you earlier this year playing a very different sort of villain in The Monkey. Which character do you think is more odious?

Wood: Oh, [The Monkey's] Ted Hammerman, without question. Odious is a great word, by the way. Yeah, Ted is awful. Just a toxic male [who] thinks he knows better than everybody else. He's got his whole perspective on what makes a great father, although I don't think he really does know what makes a great father. That was a blast. I love Osgood [Perkins, director of The Monkey] too, and it was a joy to come and join that for a bit. I've been a fan of his for a long time.

io9: You starred in the Maniac remake back in 2012. And now you're in the new Toxic Avenger. What draws you to these cult-beloved titles, and is there one you'd like to see be remade in the future, whether or not you star in it?

Wood: It's all circumstantial. That one, I was drawn to it because it was taking the source material and doing something really different with it. Remakes are tricky, you know, and both of these films are related in the sense that they made something new of the source material rather than regurgitating it in the same way.

I was really attracted to Maniac because… my character doesn't really show up. It's primarily a POV film. I love POV horror; it's really interesting. There's a great POV horror film from the ‘60s, Peeping Tom. It reminded me of Peeping Tom a little bit, about how wonderful to take this and put you sort of in the mindset of, or at least the POV of, the characters. That was the reason I wanted to do that. And I love the creative team behind that film.

And then this one, I mean, Macon [Blair, director of Toxic Avenger], I'll do anything Macon asks; I'm a huge fan of his work. I worked with him on this movie called I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore, and so I'll do anything for him. He's a dear friend. And then to be asked to play a character like this in this universe was just a blast. I think it was clear that it was an approach to the original material that was very much its own but had total reverence for what Lloyd [Kaufman of Troma Entertainment] had created.

So it was circumstantial that these two things came into my life. I don't know that I'm seeking these things out, but I love genre, and I'm always going to be interested in making something weird and funny and absurd.

The Toxic Avenger hits theaters August 29.

Stop me if you've heard this one before. Wireless power banks have been recalled for exploding and causing fires.

This time, it's the ESR HaloLock wireless power banks distributed by Waymeet in Hong Kong. The power banks were sold online at Amazon, Home Depot's website, and Esrtech.com from September 2023 to July 2025, according to a press release from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.

“The firm has received nine reports of the lithium-ion battery catching fire and exploding, resulting in property damage of about $20,000,” the CPSC said, though no injuries have been reported.

The power banks come in dark blue, light blue, gray, white, and black—all with five circular LED display lights on the side. The model numbers that have been recalled include 2G520, 2G505B, and 2G512B, which should be printed on the side near the “ESR” branding.

Consumers should contact Waymeet for a refund. The easiest way to reach out is by email, according to the CPSC. You'll be asked to send a photo of your power bank, showing the model number, to [email protected]. The company wants consumers to write the word “recalled” in permanent marker on the power bank for the photo.

After the company sends a refund, consumers are asked to dispose of the power banks responsibly. As the CPSC explains:

Do not throw this recalled lithium-ion battery or device in the trash, the general recycling stream (e.g., street-level or curbside recycling bins), or used battery recycling boxes found at various retail and home improvement stores. Recalled lithium-ion batteries must be disposed of differently than other batteries, because they present a greater risk of fire. Your municipal household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center may accept this recalled lithium-ion battery or device for disposal. Before taking your battery or device to a HHW collection center, contact that office ahead of time and ask whether it accepts recalled lithium-ion batteries. If it does not, contact your municipality for further guidance.

There have been many phone charger recalls in recent months, including a recall of Anker PowerCore 10000 power banks back in June. And the iStore Magnetic Wireless power banks recalled in July.

There's a reason TSA doesn't allow power banks in checked luggage. You really don't want these things to explode in the wrong place.

I'm hackin' it

"Would you like to access sensitive information?" might be the new "Would you like fries with that?" A security researcher called "BobDaHacker" has just revealed how he went from scoring free McNuggets via the fast food chain's mobile app to repeatedly gaining access to a McDonald's platform meant only for employees and franchisees.

"The McDonald's Feel-Good Design Hub is their central platform for brand assets and marketing materials - used by teams and agencies across 120 countries. It used to be 'protected' by a client-side password. Yes, CLIENT-SIDE," BobDaHacker said. "After I reported this, they took 3 months to implement a proper account system with different login paths for McDonald's employees (using their EID/MCID) and external partners ... Except there was still an issue. All I had to do was change 'login' to 'register' in the URL" to create a new account that could access the platform.

Now, I'll be the first to admit that security reporters are often quick to condemn organizations that fail to address vulnerabilities approximately five minutes after their disclosure, even though very few of us have ever needed to develop and deploy software at the scale of a multi-billion-dollar corporation. That's hardly fair. But it's hard to believe McDonald's is taking the security of its "Feel-Good Design Hub" seriously when it takes an entire quarter to resolve a problem... only to have the fix bypassed by changing a single word in a URL. Ronald would be disappointed.

Even that might be excused because, again, developing and deploying software at scale is difficult. Things happen! But then BobDaHacker went on to point out that simply registering a new account prompted the Feel-Good Design Hub to send the password associated with that account in plain-text, even though we as a society have known better than that for decades at this point. And that wasn't even the most embarrassing thing about McDonald's security processes revealed in BobDaHacker's blog post!

"McDonald's HAD a security.txt file with contact info. But they removed it 2 months after adding it. I only found it through the Wayback Machine, and by then it was outdated. So, how do you report security vulnerabilities to a corporation with no security contact? I literally called McDonald's HQ and started dropping random security employee names I found on LinkedIn," Bob said. (Emphasis not added.) "The HQ hotline just asks you to say the name of the person you want to be connected to. So I kept calling, saying random security employee names until finally someone important enough called me back and gave me an actual place to report these issues."

Bob said that McDonald's appeared to fix "most of the vulnerabilities" they disclosed, but the company also let go of Bob's friend, who helped them investigate some of the vulnerabilities and "never established a proper security reporting channel." (I couldn't find a security.txt file on the company's website, and a search for "McDonald's security disclosure" doesn't return any relevant results, either.) That seems ill-advised, given that other researchers would probably give up on trying to disclose vulnerabilities long before Bob did. Having to search on LinkedIn and repeatedly call a hotline is not ideal.

It's been a little over a month since I reported on a different security gaffe affecting McDonald's. In that case, a platform with access to private information was secured with the password "123456." Now we know BobDaHacker was able to use the Feel-Good Design Hub to access a variety of resources, from "highly confidential and proprietary" marketing information to a service that could be used to "search for ANY McDonald's employee globally" and see their email address, among other things.

Eaton Z made sure Intel had closed up all the unearthed security gaps before divulging this research.

It was possible to download sensitive information about 270,000 Intel employees until the end of February, according to Eaton Z, a security researcher, reverse engineer, and application developer. All this information was available with a little 'valid user' dodge applied to the Intel India Operations (IIO) site, where employees usually order their business cards. The vulnerability behind the potential hack, dubbed ‘Intel Outside' by the researcher, was detailed to Intel in correspondence starting in October 2024. Moreover, the business card site was just one of four found with gaping security flaws.

I am excited to share my latest research project I have dubbed the "Intel Outside" project. Last fall I discovered many critical vulnerabilities in Intel's web infrastructure that allowed me to exfiltrate sensitive information about 270k Intel employees/workers, and more. pic.twitter.com/oRXiEP5mPnAugust 18, 2025

From the introduction to his lengthy blog post, it is hinted that Eaton thought testing the locks on Intel websites would be worth a shot, given the firm's history of processor hardware vulnerabilities. With the headlining result, Eaton's preliminary instincts proved accurate.

Eaton explains that after their first scouting of the perimeter, they decided to check the JavaScript files behind the business card login form. It is sometimes possible “to trick an application into thinking a valid user is logged in by modifying the getAllAccounts function to return a non-empty array,” Eaton narrated. Indeed, this worked and got Eaton past the login screen.

Next, it was observed that the website, at this depth, allowed for the probing of a long list of employees, not restricted to India, but worldwide. An API token, which was available to an anonymous user (like Eaton), provided even deeper access to the employee data.

Subsequently, Eaton was alarmed by the amount of information that could be pulled up about every employee. “Way more than this simple website would ever need,” they commented, “Intel's APIs are very generous!”

Things got worse for Intel, not for Eaton. Removing the URL filter from the API being probed eventually yielded “a nearly 1GB JSON file.” Inside this download, Eaton noted that there were details of every Intel employee (there are fewer now). Data included fields like each employee's name, role, manager, phone number, and mailing address.

Eaton's work tested the locks, listening for the clicks, on several other Intel websites. Perhaps you will be surprised to hear that three other vulnerable Intel Outside style hacks were possible?

On the internal ‘Product Hierarchy' website, Eaton discovered easily decryptable hardcoded credentials. Again, the prize was a bumper list of Intel employee data, as well as the possibility to gain admin access to the system. Similarly, Intel's internal ‘Product Onboarding' suffered from easily decryptable hardcoded credentials.

The corporate login on Intel's SEIMS Supplier Site was another security measure that could be bypassed. It delivered an amazing fourth way in which an attacker could “download the details of every Intel employee,” says Eaton.

Eaton communicated with Intel, outlining the internal website flaws that had been discovered, starting from October 2024. Sadly, none of Eaton's work qualified for Intel bug bounty payouts, as it was excluded by some small print. Perhaps even worse, Eaton only got a single canned ‘auto-response' from Intel throughout the whole process.

Easton noticed that all the vulnerabilities he had uncovered and reported to Intel had been addressed by February 28 this year. Publishing the linked blog on August 18, thus, seems eminently reasonable.

In a move reminiscent of Facebook's early days, TikTok is launching a new feature that allows college students to find and connect with others on their campus. The feature, called Campus Verification, lets users add their college campus to their TikTok profile and browse a list of students at their school.

To access the feature, users need to navigate to their profile and tap the “Add school” button. From there, they need to enter their school name and then select their graduation year. 

To verify that they actually go to the school they entered, they need to provide their academic email address. Once complete, their college name and graduation year will be displayed on their profile.

Users can then browse their school's page, filter by graduation year, and view all of the users who have added the school to their profile. They can also sort the users list to show the most-followed users first.

The feature is available across more than 6,000 universities through TikTok's partnership with UNiDAYS, a student verification platform that confirms student status. 

TikTok says the idea behind the feature is to turn its platform into a hub for real-world connections and belonging on campus, which is essentially what Facebook's original mission was when it launched in 2004 as a way for Harvard students to connect with one another.

TikTok's new feature could be a welcome addition for college students looking to connect with others on campus. However, it also raises concerns about digital privacy, as it could make it easier for users to track others online. Of course, the feature is optional, so those who prefer to keep their TikTok presence separate from their student life can choose to simply not add their school to their profile.

It's worth noting that the launch comes as Instagram was spotted testing a similar feature last year that would allow users to display their school info and graduation year on their profile and connect with other students. It's unknown if the feature was scrapped or if the Meta-owned platform still plans to roll it out.

The world's most valuable chipmaker is far from giving up its desire to retain China as a key growth market. Nvidia is apparently putting together a new AI chip meant for sale in China that's half as powerful as its flagship B300 Blackwell GPU, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources.

This new chip, codenamed B30A, would be more powerful than the H20 GPUs the company is currently allowed to sell to China, the report said, though its design will be single-die in nature, unlike the dual-die design used in the more powerful B300 GPUs. The B30A would still have similar features to the H20, like fast data transmission, support for NVLink, and high-bandwidth memory.

The development of the B30A seems to be separate from another chip that the company is said to be developing for sale in the country, Reuters reported.

“We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow. Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use,” Nvidia said in an emailed statement.

The news comes as the Trump administration in recent weeks has relaxed its stance on letting chipmakers export high-performance AI chips to China, though Reuters cited its sources as saying that approvals for this new chip aren't certain at all.

As geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington are increasingly affected by the race to develop AI, critics argue that the U.S. must maintain its lead by controlling the supply of necessary technology to China. But Nvidia and its peers — finding themselves selling the equivalent of shovels during a gold rush — maintain that ceding the valuable market of China to rivals like Huawei would be tantamount to giving up entirely.

European gamers, rejoice! | Some Nvidia RTX 50-series Founders Edition graphics cards just got a 10% markdown.

Nvidia has dropped the prices for some of its RTX 50-series GPUs in Europe, with the RTX 5090, 5080, and 5070 seeing a reduction of almost 10%. As noted by Videocardz, these lower prices are likely tied to a weakening dollar, making the import of American goods into Europe relatively cheaper than before. The USD was at its peak when Nvidia's latest gaming GPUs launched, with the exchange rate hovering around $1.04 for every Euro. Today, it now sits at around $1.16 — a more than 10% drop in value since January.

This currency shift likely influenced the AI tech giant's decision to drop the MSRP of its Founders Edition GPUs. When you visit Nvidia Germany's marketplace, you will see lower prices on the aforementioned cards versus their launch prices. This also holds true for other European Nvidia sites, like France, Belgium, and Spain. Hopefully, other manufacturers will soon follow suit, as they haven't reduced prices at the time of writing.

The lowered prices are a welcome change for European gamers and enthusiasts, especially as it's been proven that almost all GPUs are being sold way above MSRP — especially for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080. Unfortunately, the lower prices aren't because Nvidia produced more graphics cards, thus lowering the pressure on the market. Instead, it's brought by economic realities, like the tariffs that the U.S. has applied to all its trading partners, increasing inflationary pressure and having a slight negative effect on the value of the dollar.

We often see GPU prices drop several months after they launch. However, U.S. tariffs and TSMC's price hikes have actually caused prices to jump between 10% to 15%. There's also the threat of additional import taxes, with President Donald Trump announcing a 100% semiconductor tariff in early August. It's also been reported that he's considering increasing this further to 300% after the U.S. Department of Commerce's Section 232 investigation. These tariffs might not affect Europe, though, if Nvidia can build GPUs for the continent outside of America, or if it's able to completely assemble the RTX 50-series graphics cards within the United States without relying on any kind of import.

This is the latest move in Arm's chip designer hiring spree that's been ongoing for the past year.

British semiconductor and chip design firm Arm Holdings has hired Amazon's director of engineering in its Amazon Web Services division to work on developing its own complete processors, according to Reuters. Rami Sinno headed the team that developed Amazon's own AI processors, Trainium and Inferentia, but will be returning to the fold with this move, having previously worked as VP of engineering at ARM between 2014 and 2019.

Arm's chip designs are nearly ubiquitous in the mobile world, featured in most smartphones and a wide range of tablets and laptops. Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips are based on ARM architecture, as are Apple's A and M-series system-on-chip designs, and Arm is making major inroads in the data center space. It's even starting to make a name for itself in the gaming scene, too.

But Arm doesn't typically build its own processors. That's something it has reportedly been looking to change over the past few years. We first heard rumors that it was looking to build its own AI hardware in early 2024, and that it allegedly already had orders for some of its as-yet-unannounced chips in February this year.

It's not clear how far along in the development process Arm is with its own chips, but Sinno brings significant experience to the company, having been a key component in Amazon's own AI hardware endeavours. Sinno joins the likes of experienced Intel and Qualcomm engineer Steve Halter, as well as HP Enterprise alumnus Nicolas Dube.

Although an exceedingly profitable company already, enough that Nvidia reportedly tried to buy it for $40 billion in 2020, that all came from royalties for its chip designs. Arm is looking to branch into an entirely new venture with the development of its own hardware. CEO Rene Haas said in July that Arm was considering developing its own chiplets that can be bundled together in a larger package, as well as complete (perhaps monolithic) chip designs.

Sinno was brought in early for Amazon's own AI hardware development, building the architecture from the ground up, reportedly using Amazon's standard method of development: starting at the customer's desires and working backwards to develop what they need. At that time, it was high compute, low power chips, and though the market is more contested and the industry much further along now than it was then, Arm's eventual hardware will need to offer much the same.

But it clearly believes it can do it. Earlier this year, Arm announced the aggressive and confident plan that it would capture as much as 50% of the data center CPU market by the end of 2025. That will come from new AI data centers, and with companies like Nvidia building 100 AI factories, there's no shortage of demand.

The idea of starting a book club came to Valeen Heinle late one night in July. She was having a particularly bad argument with her Trump-supporting dad over Israel's war in Gaza and its devastating impacts on children.

"I'm begging you to just try and learn something that isn't from Facebook, Fox, or Newsmax," Valeen, a 38-year-old registered Democrat who works as a pet sitter in Denver, wrote to her dad via Instagram DM after they exchanged a series of posts about Gaza. “Read a book on the history there. I have tons I can suggest but I know you would never because you'd rather sit in your confirmation bias, and that makes me so sad.”

“I spend too much time worrying about my children. What the future will bring for them,” he replied. “So when my kids are safe and [taken] care of then maybe I could give a shit about other kids.”

Gaza isn't the only issue that has left Americans—and Valeen and her dad—divided. They've argued about the Covid-19 vaccine, climate change, gun laws, the results of the 2020 election, the January 6 riot at the Capitol, and more. “Ever since 2016, he seems to be pulled more and more to the far right, and he's become clouded by hatred and anger—things that just aren't him,” says Valeen. “It's gotten harder and harder, and it's not just difficult to debate with him, but it's painful, and some of the things he says really just takes me aback.”

But Valeen said his response to their discussion on Gaza was a breaking point. It upset her so much that when her partner returned home that evening, he found her crying on their Ikea sofa in the living room. They had a long talk, and in an attempt at distraction, they gathered animal crackers and Chips Ahoy cookies and fired up an anime episode on her laptop.

When the anime episode ended at around 3 am, Valeen sent her dad, who now lives in central Florida, a message. “Alright. I'll make you a deal: you read three books of my choosing—all the way through—and prove you actually read and understood them,” she wrote. “And I'll go back to church for a month after.”

Reddit is full of stories from people who, like Valeen, say the current political environment has challenged their relationships with their Trump-supporting parents. In some cases, people have compared their families' involvement in the MAGA movement and blind loyalty to Trump to being part of a cult—a comparison that's also been made by cult experts.

But some think they can potentially salvage their relationships with their loved ones and even “deprogram” their MAGA parents—by starting de facto “book clubs.”

One Reddit user posted on a popular subreddit r/suggestmeabook, asking for suggestions of “good reading materials for someone who may need some help being nudged back towards reality and morality”—their dad. They asked specifically for recommendations of fantasy books, a genre that their dad had enjoyed in the past. “I've always felt fantasy books have ‘progressive' values, and I'm hoping to find some that don't beat you over the head with that message!” they wrote. In another subreddit, someone else asked for book recommendations that they could send to their father “in pursuit of deprogramming him from the cult of Trump.”

Others have said their relationships hit a breaking point, and they had no other choice but to go “no contact" with their parents. One study found that 1 in two adults was estranged from a close relative and cited political differences in a fifth of those cases. Nearly half of those estranged over politics said the rupture had occurred in the past year.

Dominique Forbes, 28, tells WIRED she has minimized contact with her parents, who live in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, over their continued support for Trump since 2016 and hasn't seen them in person since May 2020. “I see MAGA as a cult, personally, and I think the identity fusion and cognitive dissonance are the main pieces that I've experienced firsthand from my parents,” Forbes says. She says she tried to broach the topic in November, around the time of the election, via Facetime. “My dad exploded and said he felt attacked,” Forbes says. “I was adamant about being gentle and remaining calm, but I could see the identity fusion—he could not separate himself from Trump.”

There was talk of them coming to visit her earlier this year where she lives, in Seattle, Washington. She was looking forward to it, and to introducing them to her cats. But she told them she didn't want them to stay with her, to establish some boundaries, and their offer to visit crumbled soon after that. Forbes says that attempts at establishing common ground have fallen flat. “I've learned it's not my responsibility to educate them,” Forbes says. “I believe they're brainwashed, and I believe there could be underlying health issues that could be contributing to it. But I finally just hit a wall of exhaustion. I just feel pushed away and rejected so many times that I'm finally planning on going some form of no-contact.”

Steven Hassan, a cult expert who escaped a cult in 1976 and has since written several books about deprogramming, including The Cult of Trump, says there's no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to helping a loved one who has been brainwashed. And it's not like switching out a faulty component in a car, he says. “The mind is precious. I need to know how he got hooked,” says Hassan. “What I've learned as a mental health professional when it comes to how to effectively influence a person, you need to customize it for the individual”

He does have some advice for what not to do. “It's important to understand that the MAGA identity is fused with Trump and its ideology. And what doesn't work is trying to attack the leader, the doctrine, the policy of any cult,” says Hassan. “Trying to argue with logic or with facts is counterproductive, because it activates the cult identity to label you as an enemy that is persecuting them.”

“What I have always been advocating for years is: Stay warm, stay loving, don't say ‘you're stupid' for following Trump or ‘you're a moron,' but just be warm and say ‘I don't understand, help me step into your shoes,'” Hassan adds. “The most powerful technique is to ask questions that empower the person to think and reflect.” Another key part of effective deprogramming, Hassan adds, is to remind the person who they were prior to being brainwashed.

Valeen grew up in Florida's Pompano Beach, north of Fort Lauderdale, and was raised in the Evangelical church. Her father, who Valeen calls her best friend and her hero, served in the Marines during Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s and later ran a glass business.

For a long time, debating current affairs was “their thing”—and it was fun. But a few years ago he had a pulmonary embolism, leaving him in poor health and often struggling to breathe. Valeen thinks his views have become more extreme in part because he's isolated, depressed, in poor health, and engaging with divisive content online. She worries that he's become increasingly drawn into a political belief system that is defined by misinformation over fact and cruelty over empathy.

Her father, John, says he gets along great with Valeen, though “sometimes it gets a little difficult in our conversations,” adding, “We're on different political spectrums. I raised her to be a free thinker. I wanted her to have her own path and have her own ideas, not mine.”

When Valeen was in her early twenties, she briefly moved to Australia for her long-distance boyfriend she'd met via Facebook. At some point, he started reading Richard Dawkins' The Greatest Show on Earth, which is about evolution. “I'd joke and say ‘that's your devil book,'” she recalls. She became increasingly interested in its ideas as he worked his way through it, and she eventually picked it up herself. She says it challenged her entire belief system and opened her eyes to an entirely new way of thinking; it also taught her that books could be a powerful way to change minds. She left the church when she was 25.

“Reading has had such an impact on my own life,” says Valeen. “I am hoping not only could it potentially teach him something or make him think about something he typically wouldn't, but also if it's laid out in front of him with data and references by someone who has studied, it might be easier to not just understand but to trust.”

And she knew that promising her dad to go back to church, even for a short time, would be a valuable bargaining chip. “She completely turned around,” says John. “Next I noticed she said she was agnostic, then she was atheist. And I'm like, what?” He's chalked up a lot of her misfortunes over the years—financial struggles, health problems—to her lack of faith. “I live in poverty, and he's very much a bootstraps mentality. So he blames anything that goes wrong in my life on me leaving Christianity,” says Valeen.

John says that these days he's more concerned about making sure she gets to heaven. “My health isn't that great, and it would be good to know that when I go one day, I'll see my daughter again,” John says. “She says I was using a guilt trip. I said, ‘I'm not trying to use a guilt trip. I'm trying to say that, you know, that would make me feel a lot better.'”

Hassan says that reciprocity is important when trying to get through to a brainwashed loved one. “The goal is not who is right and who is wrong, the goal is to learn and, based on love, pursue what's true.”

Valeen wants her dad to read The Hundred Years' War on Palestine by Rashid Khalidi, Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation by Kristin Kobes Du Mez, and Poverty, by America by Matthew Desmond, which looks at the systemic causes of poverty in the US.

In selecting her titles, Valeen says she tried to pick books that were “noncombative.” “It's been tough to convince him to do this, because he doesn't really want to read anything that doesn't confirm his beliefs and his views,” she says. “I basically just kept pushing the deal on him and kept telling him, like, well, you really want me to go to church.” Eventually, after some back-and-forth, he agreed.

Valeen is estranged from the rest of her family, and there's no book club that she thinks could fix it. She says her sister believes that the Earth is actually flat, among other conspiracy theories, and her cousins called her an "abomination" and told her she was “going to hell” when she came out as pansexual.

But she believes that she can establish common ground with her dad again. “A lot of things have happened to me in my lifetime, and my dad is the only constant I've ever had,” she says. “So I won't give up on him.”

And as for her dad, he tells WIRED: “I'll read 'em. I've got time.”

Spotify is introducing a new feature that allows subscribers to create more professional, personalized playlists. On Tuesday, the company launched a custom transitions feature that lets you either automatically add transitions between a playlist's tracks or customize your own using preset options like fade, rise, or blend, along with other options.

To use the feature, open any playlist and select “Mix” from the toolbar to begin editing. While customizing the track with different transition styles, you can also adjust settings for things like volume, EQ, and effects, and use the waveform and beat data to find the best spot in each track to begin the transition.

Spotify notes that it will automatically display the key and the beats per minute for each track, to make it easier for novice audio mixers to get started.

The new options are designed to appeal to playlist experts and other music fans, who have collectively created nearly 9 billion playlists on Spotify's platform to date. 

The rollout complements other updates Spotify has launched over the past year that give users more control over their listening experience, the company says, like the tools to add, sort, and edit playlists, customize the genre of the Discover Weekly playlist, snooze tracks, make voice requests to the AI DJ, and more. It also allows Spotify to compete with Apple Music's upcoming AutoMix feature, which is currently live in the iOS 26 developer beta and claims to let you mix “like a DJ.”

Premium subscribers with access to the transitions feature will also be able to save and share the playlist with other friends on social media or even invite other subscribers to collaborate on a mixed playlist.

The mix can be toggled on and off at any time by pressing the “mix” option, allowing you to turn your playlist back to the more traditional kind when the party or gym workout (or wherever else you're streaming the mix) has ended.

The company recommends that mixing works best with music that's already been produced for seamless transitions, like house and techno, which tend to blend more easily.

Like other playlists, the mixes can be further customized using your own cover art, along with newly added stickers and labels made just for mixed playlists.

Custom transitions in playlists are available starting today for the majority of eligible Premium users worldwide. (The company says some markets in the APAC region will still need to wait for the addition.) The feature is rolling out gradually to users who have updated their Spotify app for iOS or Android.

Some say continuous transfers exceeding 50GB can cause drives to vanish from the OS


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


August 19, 5:30 am ET: Phison has issued the following statement to Tom's Hardware: "Phison has recently been made aware of the industry-wide effects of the 'KB5063878' and ‘KB5062660' updates on Windows 11 that potentially impacted several storage devices, including some supported by Phison. We understand the disruption this may have caused and promptly engaged industry stakeholders. We are steadfast in our commitment to product integrity and the success of our partners and end users. At this time, the controllers that may have been affected are under review and we are working with partners. We will continue to provide updates and advisories to partners who may have been impacted to provide support and ensure any applicable remediation."

Microsoft's latest security update for Windows 11 is allegedly causing SSD failures during heavy file transfers. The issue was reported by X user Nekorusukii @Necoru_cat, who was updating Cyberpunk 2077 on a system running Windows 11 24H2 with the KB5063878 update installed, when the SSD on which the game was installed disappeared from the operating system.

An investigation by the user reveals a potential bug that appears during continuous file transfers on certain storage devices, particularly when the transfer exceeds 50GB and the drive is over 60% full. In these cases, the SSD can sometimes disappear from within the operating system. While restarting the PC makes the SSD visible again, the issue seems to occur again as soon as a large data transfer is performed again.

It was earlier reported that the issue lies within how SSDs handle cache, especially DRAM-less models equipped with Phison NAND controllers, but it turns out the problem isn't confined to those types of drives. A series of tests was carried out to establish the scope of the problem, which included copying Cyberpunk 2077's Steam library folder to the drive, preparing a compressed archive, and then copying the expanded archive into the target storage.

Out of the 21 drives tested, it was found that 12 of them became inaccessible, but only the Western Digital SA510 2TB could not be recovered, even after a reboot. This indicates that the issue seems to impact SSDs with multiple types of SSD controllers.



Nekorusukii has listed the complete findings and explains that the SSDs were tested only on his own system, so the results may not offer enough proof on the real-time performance of these drives. Additionally, they do not assert that the Windows 11 24H2 KB5063878 or the previously released KB5062660 updates are directly responsible for the issues. However, a separate report by Japanese outlet NichePCGamer has further identified at least eight users on X who are facing similar issues on their respective drives.

According to a user with a SanDisk Extreme Pro M.2 NVMe 3D SSD, the drive became inaccessible after installing a 50GB update for Honkai: Star Rail. Although restarting the system resolved the issue, the user encountered it again on multiple occasions in August. Suspecting the KB5062660 update as the cause, the user deleted the update file, after which the problem no longer occurred.

By the looks of it, the issue doesn't seem to be widespread. While we wait for Microsoft and SSD manufacturers to acknowledge the bug, it is best to stay cautious, especially if you are dealing with large continuous file transfers on systems running the latest Windows 11 KB5063878 update.

Cheaper energy bills are a nonpartisan issue—no matter where you live.

The second Trump administration is proving to be more disastrous for the climate and the clean energy economy than many had feared. 

Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed most of the clean energy incentives in former president Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Meanwhile, his EPA administrator moved to revoke the endangerment finding, the legal basis for federal oversight of greenhouse gases. For those of us who have been following policy developments in this area closely, nearly every day brings a new blow to past efforts to salvage our climate and to build the clean energy economy of the future.

MIT Technology Review's guest opinion series, offering expert commentary on legal, political and regulatory issues related to climate change and clean energy. You can read the rest of the pieces here.

This has left many in the climate and clean energy communities wondering what do we do now? The answer, I would argue, is to return to state capitals—a policymaking venue that climate and renewable energy advocates already know well. This can be done strategically, focusing on a handful of key states rather than all fifty. 

But I have another piece of advice: Don't get too caught up in “red states” versus “blue states” when considering which states to target. American politics is being remade before our eyes, and long-standing policy problems are being redefined and reframed.  

Let's take clean energy, for example. Yes, shifting away from carbon-spewing resources is about slowing down climate change, and for some this is the single most important motivation for pursuing it. But it also can be about much more. 

The case can be made just as forcefully—and perhaps more effectively—that shifting to clean energy advances affordability at a time when electricity bills are skyrocketing. It promotes energy freedom by resisting monopolistic utilities' ownership and gatekeeping of the grid. It increases reliability as battery storage reaches new heights and renewable sources and baseload power plants like nuclear or natural gas facilities (some of which we certainly do and will need) increasingly complement one another. And it drives job creation and economic development. 

Talking about clean energy policy in these ways is safer from ideological criticisms of “climate alarmism.” Research reported in my forthcoming book, Owning the Green Grid, shows that this framing has historically been effective in red states. In addition, using the arguments above to promote all forms of energy can allow clean energy proponents to reclaim a talking point deployed in a previous era by the political right: a true “all-of-the-above” approach to energy policy.

Every energy technology—gas, nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal and storage, among others—has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. But combining them enhances overall grid performance, delivering more than the sum of their individual parts.

To be clear, this is not the approach of the current national administration in Washington, DC. Its policies have picked winners (coal, oil, and natural gas) and losers (solar and wind) among energy technologies—ironically, given conservative claims of blue states having done so in the past. Yet a true all-of-the-above approach can now be sold in state capitals throughout the country, in red states and even in fossil-fuel producing states. 

To be sure, the Trump-led Republican party has taken such extreme measures that it will constrain certain state policymaking possibilities. Notably, in May the US Senate voted to block waivers allowing California to phase out gas guzzlers in the state, over the objections of the Senate parliamentarian. The fiscal power of the federal government is also immense. But there are a variety of other ways to continue to make state-level progress on greenhouse gas emissions.

State and local advocacy efforts are nothing new for the clean energy community. For decades before the Inflation Reduction Act, the states were the primary locus of activity for clean energy policy. But in recent years, some have suggested that Democratic state governments are a necessary prerequisite to making meaningful state-level progress. This view is limiting, and it perpetuates a false—or at least unnecessary—alignment between party and energy technology. 

The electric grid is nonpartisan. Struggling to pay your utility bill is nonpartisan. Keeping the lights on is nonpartisan. Even before renewable energy was as cheap as it is today, early progress at diversifying energy portfolios was made in conservative states. Iowa, Texas, and Montana were all early adopters of renewable portfolio standards. Advocates in such places did not lead with messaging about climate change, but rather about economic development and energy independence. These policy efforts paid off: The deeply red Lone Star State, for instance, generates more wind energy than any other state and ranks only behind California in producing solar power. 

Now, in 2025, advances in technology and improvements in cost should make the economic arguments for clean energy even easier and more salient. So, in the face of a national government that is choosing last century's energy technologies as policy winners and this century's technologies as policy losers, the states offer clean energy advocates a familiar terrain on which to make continued progress, if they tailor their selling points to the reality on the ground.         

Joshua A. Basseches is the David and Jane Flowerree Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies and Public Policy at Tulane University. His research focuses on state-level renewable energy politics and policymaking, especially in the electricity sector. 

The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Meanwhile, company emissions are up 50% since 2019.

Good time for investment?

SoftBank Group late on Monday announced a plan to purchase $2 billion worth of Intel shares at $23 each, which will provide the troubled chipmaker much-needed cash. The companies inked a definitive securities purchase agreement, which sets the price of Intel stock (currently trading below its book value) at which the Japanese company will buy it. Softbank also still owns a majority share of Arm.

Intel and SoftBank frame the deal as a way to 'deepen their commitment to investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation in the United States.' Given the context of Intel's recent struggles, this $2 billion share purchase is a way to pour some money into Intel's efforts to rebuild itself as a leading supplier of processors and a contract chipmaker that serves both internal and external needs for leading-edge semiconductor production. 

By modern foundry standards, $2 billion is not a large sum of money. Building a single leading-edge semiconductor production facility today typically costs between $20 billion and $30 billion, and in many cases even more, depending on planned production volumes, product mix, and equipment used. However, the investment does not seem to be entirely about money, even though $2 billion will be instrumental for Intel, which bleeds billions every quarter. 

To a large degree, this investment is a vote of confidence in the future of Intel's U.S.-based leading-edge semiconductor production and SoftBank's plan to play a bigger role in the ongoing AI revolution, which will require partnerships with many industry players. If Intel succeeds with its next-generation products and 18A as well as 14A process technologies, then SoftBank will get a partner with a huge potential, which will be important across multiple fronts, including access to advanced semiconductor production capacities (good news for Arm and Ampere that are controlled by SoftBank) as well as a leverage in negotiations with other partners.

"Semiconductors are the foundation of every industry. For more than 50 years, Intel has been a trusted leader in innovation," Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group. "This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role." 

Additionally, SoftBank may consider an investment in Intel, as it represents undervalued infrastructure that could drive significant advancements in the high-tech sector and substantially increase its value. At $23 per share, Intel is trading below its book value with a market capitalization of around $103 billion. By contrast, the company's real estate and manufacturing assets cost $109 billion. So for SoftBank, this is both a financial opportunity (buying undervalued assets) and a strategic move (securing a stake in the perfectly set semiconductor production infrastructure needed to produce chips that support AI in one way or another). 

"We are very pleased to deepen our relationship with SoftBank, a company that is at the forefront of so many areas of emerging technology and innovation and shares our commitment to advancing U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership," said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. "Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment."

From optical trapping experiments to insights into molecular force generation, Dr. Maxim Molodtsov shared how his research is uncovering the mechanical and structural underpinnings of cohesin's role in genome regulation.  

Watch the full webinar

Cohesin is a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together and helps organize DNA into loops essential for gene regulation and mitosis. It's a ring-shaped structure with fairly long coiled arm domains that are about 50 nanometers long, as well as two ATPase domains.

My group's research focuses on the three-dimensional organization and physical rearrangement of DNA during the cell cycle. This spatial organization is also crucial for gene expression, recombination, and DNA repair.

As cells divide, DNA is condensed into distinct chromosomes. The organization of and separation between chromosomes is essential for accurate cell division. We are investigating the mechanical forces that move DNA, create DNA loops, drive these around the cell, and reorganize them in three dimensions.

Cohesin holds sister chromatids together whilst cells divide. When cohesin is depleted, chromosomes simply fall apart. This role makes cohesin key throughout DNA rearrangements in the cell cycle. Cohesin's resistance to the forces of the mitotic spindle is particularly important for this process.

It is believed that the shape of the cohesin complex allows it to hold cystid DNAs through a specific mechanism that entraps two DNA strands.

Studies later suggested that cohesin can create DNA loops, one of the primary means of organizing DNA and interface cells.

Techniques like chromosome confirmation and Hi-C have proven the importance of cohesin in the formation of DNA loops, confirming that if cohesin levels drop, DNA loops begin to fall apart.

Our goal was to find out if, by dynamically binding DNA, it was possible for them to resist the forces generated by a mitotic spindle.

To study this, we first established a system to mimic the interface between two molecules of DNA held together by cohesin. We started a glass slide and attached a molecule of DNA before binding this to a cohesin molecule.

Working with a single molecule is important because interpretation of results becomes very difficult when working with multiple molecules.

We made sure there was one cohesin molecule per DNA molecule by adding a fluorescent tag to the cohesin molecule and measuring fluorescence to verify its presence. We then added a second DNA molecule with a fluorophore attached, allowing us to verify its attachment to the cohesin.

To mimic the tension applied to DNA during mitosis, we touch a glass bead to the DNA or cohesin and use an optical trap to study its behaviour.

The optical trap uses a highly focused laser aimed at a confocal spot on a glass bead. This creates a strong, localized field that allows the bead to be moved with precision. It also allows researchers to apply force to the bead and measure that force accurately.

The basis of this experiment is pulling at the cohesin-bound DNA until it breaks, then analyzing this process to try to understand exactly what is happening.

We work with a JPK NanoTracker 2 optical trap from Bruker attached to a turf elimination system in order to visualize individual cohesin molecules assembled on a relatively standard flow cell.

Using this system, we attached a DNA molecule to a cohesin molecule and washed it with salt. As the salt level increases, the cohesin diffuses, moving back and forth on the DNA molecule. This process can be observed using a climograph. This step also bleached the cohesin in one step, which acts as confirmation that it is a single cohesin molecule.

Then we added the second DNA molecule with a fluorophore, visualizing the correlated movement between cohesin and DNA. We also measure the fluorescence, confirming the presence of a single molecule.

The DNA is stretched as we pull on the glass bead. As we do this, we can see the cohesin is holding onto the bead, but at some point, cohesin breaks, prompting the DNA to jump back to the bead while remaining intact. This experiment allows us to measure the force at which cohesin ruptures. Using a histogram of the detachment rupture force, we can see that the single cohesin ruptures at around about 20 piconewtons of force.

The simplest model we could use to learn about cohesin's interaction with DNA involves a single molecule of cohesin entrapping the DNA in a ring-like structure. Applying force should then cause the ring to break at its weakest point, regardless of how the force is applied.

There are not many points that can break in this cohesin, but there is the kleisin gate (a connection between two proteins) through which the DNA escapes in physiological conditions.

We wanted to see if DNA also escapes this way following the application of external force, so we covalently cross-linked this interface to ensure that the DNA could not escape from it. Our studies showed that the central force remained the same, suggesting that DNA is escaping from somewhere else.

Another potentially weaker interface is the hinge, where coils of DNA interact. We ran a similar experiment, loading cohesins onto the DNA and cross-linking the hinges, although only about half of the cohesins on the DNA were cross-linked.

The histogram of rupture forces looked very different here.

We saw two peaks, as we would expect from two populations of cohesins. Approximately half of these populations showed the same force as our previous experiment, meaning these are likely the complexes that did not cross-link. The other half showed much higher rupture force, however, suggesting that those molecules are cross-linked.

These higher forces suggest that another, much stronger interface is being broken as this one is closed. So, DNA is unable to escape easily, where strong covalent bonds link it to cohesin.

We also repeated the experiment using a second DNA molecule. This time, we loaded the second strand and ensured that a single cohesin molecule was holding both DNA molecules together before applying force and measuring the resulting rupture force.

In this case, we found that the rupture forces were similar but with the distribution slightly shifted. We realized that when we stretch two DNAs, it takes longer to break just because the DNA is longer. If we apply force for a longer period, the bond will break at a smaller amount of force.

We now think that cohesin hold the sister chromatids together by entrapping them physically, and that this physical entrapment can be ruptured by forces of about 20 piconewtons. We believe that the disengagement of this cohesin ring and this force may be an important mechanical regulatory mechanism.

For example, during mitosis or NFA, cohesin must be cleaved by separase to allow chromosomes to separate. This process is reversible, but in other contexts cohesin must be removed entirely to allow the DNA to close back up.

We also know that chromosomes sometimes breathe back and forth to allow cohesin to load and unload. This mechanical unloading may also be important in other processes, for example, during replication, when cohesin needs to be unloaded and then reloaded back on a replication fork. Part of this process may involve mechanical regulation, where the hinge interface disengages, allowing bulky machinery to pass through, engage, and disengage again.

Overall, we think that this mechanical disengagement may be part of the regulation process whereby mechanical force regulates the loading of cohesin on DNA.

Cohesin is a well-established molecular machine that can extrude these DNA loops, but the mechanism used by it to do this is still largely unknown.

One of the fundamental properties of these machines is that they must be able to couple the conformational changes with a hydrolysis cycle and movement along the DNA.

We wanted to see whether different conformational changes in cohesin could generate force, to help us understand how these changes might push cohesin along the DNA.

There are two major conformational changes in a cohesin ring. One is called ‘head-to-head', when the head domain moves back and forth, and the other is the ‘hinge-to-head movement'.

Common cohesin molecules were tracked with two tags. We used one tag to mobilize cohesin to the surface, and another tag was used via passive coil to separate cohesin from the bead and the trap.

We attached a bead held in an optical trap to apply the force to cohesin. A key benefit of this experiment was that this system allowed us to precisely monitor how conformational changes in this cohesin depend on how much force we apply. For example, if a hinge bends over to the head, the bead will have to move with the hinge, and we will be able to detect this movement.

We were able to collect data that corresponded to the cohesins of bent and unbent hinges. The distance inferred from this data was roughly what we would expect from structural data, indicating that we were seeing how head hinge bending occurs in real time.

In terms of how these bends depended on external force, we saw that cohesin remains largely unbent at around 1.5 piconewton of force, but that it also bends back and forth at around one piconewton and even smaller forces.

This dynamic reminded us of the influence of Brownian motion, which likely drives this movement instead of some sort of chemical transitions. We need to test this idea, confirming whether or not thermal fluctuations drive this bending and unbending.

We fitted our data with a simple three-state model to evaluate whether thermal fluctuations drove these transitions between fully bent, half-bent, and fully unbent states. The model fit our data very well, suggesting that it is thermal, Brownian fluctuations that drive this movement.

The next question we asked was, ‘What is ATP hydrolysis for in this instance, and what kind of movement does it drive?'. We looked at the head-to-head movement, using the same setup to look at the forces being generated. To do this, we immobilized one head, and instead of pulling on the hinge, we pulled on the head.

This experiment revealed a completely different picture. Head-to-head movement occurred at much higher forces, for example, five piconewtons and 10 piconewtons, moving back and forth at about 10 nanometers in size. This is exactly what we would expect from structural data and is consistent with other groups' measurements using AFM.

What was interesting about this is that it did not matter how much force we applied within a certain range (up to 15 piconewtons). The rate at which this molecule's domains opened and closed remained largely independent of the external force applied, unlike the exponential dependence on force that we would expect in a thermal Brownian ratchet case.

These findings suggest that this movement is different from the hinge-to-head movement. It is driven by chemical transitions rather than thermal Brownian fluctuations, meaning it is likely the ATP cycle that drives this movement.

In summary, there are two major conformational changes that generate force by two different mechanisms. Head-hinge bending is largely driven by thermal fluctuations, but the head-head movement is largely chemically driven and can generate much higher force.

We don't currently know why you would need two different force generation mechanisms in one molecule, but one of the hypotheses we have is that during loop extrusion, we actually see two processes. We first need to bend the DNA to initiate the loop, and then we need to elongate the loop. It is possible that the two mechanisms are responsible for different phases of loop extrusions: one for elongation and one for separation.

The NanoTracker is an advanced, fully motorized optical tweezers system with high-resolution force and position measurement capabilities.

This is the second version of the device. The NanoTracker is built on an inverted microscope, which can be integrated with different kinds of light microscopy, including EP fluorescence, confocal, TIF, and TIC. It also supports many different microscope manufacturers, such as JICE, Nikon, Olympus, and Leica.

The NanoTracker features a user-friendly software platform that has automation capabilities, skip writing for spectrometry modes, and both CMOS and CCD cameras to visualize samples. The whole device is highly automated; users only need to insert a sample, and everything else is handled automatically through the software controller.

The NanoTracker can measure forces of up to 100 or 200 piconewtons. This depends upon the laser power in use alongside the 0.1 piconewton resolution. Not only can we measure the forces acting on a particle, but we can also track the position of the particle with sub-nanometer resolution.

The NanoTracker also offers a high data acquisition rate in megahertz and support for large bandwidth. It supports single, dual, and multiple traps, and multiple traps can be managed via time setting method, where we share time between different traps. However, the time allocated to each trap is so short that the traps do not register any interruption.

The amount of particles trapped is only limited by the laser power in use. For example, we could trap as many as 255 particles with a single trap. This is a class one laser instrument, so there is no need for additional laser safety goggles or a lab equipped with laser safety features. The system comes with two variants of laser power, 3 watts and 5 watts, and it features a 1064 nanometer wavelength laser.

A Petri dish heater is available for use with 35-millimeter Petri dishes. Samples can be heated up to 45 °C, and gas perfusion functionality is available, ideal for users working with living cells in long-term experiments.

Another useful sample-handling accessory is the magnetic twister, which is ideal for trapping magnetic particles and applying toxins to study their effects.

The NanoTracker's laminar flow cells feature five input channels and one output channel, meaning we can have five different fluids flowing into the instrument, allowing us to do different experiments in different channels without mixing fluids with one another.

For example, beads coated with streptavidin could be flowed into one channel, while in another channel, there are biotinylated DNA molecules. This allows us to apply fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to the DNA molecules to perform a DNA stretching experiment.

This type of experiment uses two traps, trapping a DNA molecule in between these two traps. One part of the DNA (in trap one) is static, and one part of the DNA (in trap two) moves. As we move to trap two, we can record the forces acting on the DNA.

The setup for this experiment begins with a controller, which is used to control all the electronics in the system. It also communicates continuously with the computer in order to record and store the data.

On top of the controller sits the laser power supply and a laser steering unit. Various optical elements create multiple traps and allow them to be steered or modulated. The light is then directed along an optical path to the microscope head, mounted on an inverted Zeiss microscope. The light is guided by a dichroic mirror placed at a 45 ° angle before passing through a high numerical aperture objective.

This setup works by tightly focusing laser light, trapping a particle, and then using another detection objective to detect the position of the particle or the forces applied to it using a quadrant photodiode. The technique is called back focal plane interferometry.

Using the NanoTracker's software, we can set laser power and distribute this power between traps. We can use an attenuation filter to ensure that the detection is not oversaturated.

A window allows us to use either a detection objective or a trapping objective, allowing for precise adjustment to the focal plane to trap particles. The NanoTracker also features motorized sample stages, allowing very precise movement. This includes nano positioning of the sample stages in all three directions (x, y, z), up to 100 micrometers.

The NanoTracker's force spectrometer functionality is ideal here, because we want to stretch the DNA and then measure the forces acting on it.

Before measuring forces, we need to calibrate the optical tweezers using a power spectrum method. We also need to set the diameter of the particle that we are using, the temperature, and the density and viscosity of the medium in which the beads are trapped. Calibrating the power spectrum for a trap involves fitting it with a Lorentzian function. Proper calibration lets us see values such as sensitivity and the stiffness of the trap.

In an example experiment using this setup, we set up two traps, one static and one moving. We set the moving trap to extend the DNA by 12 micrometers at a rate of one micrometer per second. We also set the sample rate for the data to match this.

After performing force spectrometry, we can open the first spectrometer tab and choose the channel we want to view, which can be either trap one or trap two. In this case, we select the signal from the static trap.

The DNA broke once we extended the DNA by approximately 7.8, 7.9 micrometers. This was evidenced by the force spectroscopy results snapping back to zero.

Once the force applied (which the system measures) increases above a threshold value as one of the traps moves, we know that DNA has been successfully captured.

For example, one channel of the laminar flow setup has 3 micrometer or 3.2 micrometer polystyrene beads coated with streptavidin and lambda DNA, which is coated with biotin. Biotin binds with streptavidin to attach DNA to the beads.

Once the trap is on, we can catch these beads. Assuming one trap is fixed and one trap moves in a circle looking for DNA, we can use a script to measure forces as the moving trap circles in 0.1 micrometer steps. If the recorded force rises more than 20 piconewtons above the baseline, this indicates that the DNA has been captured and spectroscopy measurements can begin.

Tools like the NanoTracker's ramp designer are useful in these kinds of experiments, and it is also possible to automate experiments using the experiment planner, or by creating custom scripts in Java or Python.

Optical tracking measurements can be performed alongside AFM measurements. The NanoTracker's COMBI stage features a trapping objective for trapping particles, and we can place an AFM on top of this after removing the NanoTracker's head.

Some users have already performed this kind of experiment to measure interactions between different types of cells.

The American College of Cardiology has established a digital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) registry to learn more about one of the most common genetic cardiovascular diseases and provide more equitable access to treatment and care. The CONNECT-HCM Registry is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and developed in collaboration with Atlantic Health, Arboretum and Yale Center for Outcomes Research & Evaluation (CORE).

Because of the unique challenges in identifying HCM, data, treatment and diagnosis are predominantly from a single center experience with enrollment from limited providers. With this registry we'll be able to proactively capture data that allows for direct patient enrollment regardless of the provider and allow for a broader understanding of HCM diagnosis, guideline-directed care, and outcomes in mainstream HCM care. We will be able to expand this format to sites throughout the country for patients who wish to enroll themselves into this registry."

Matthew W. Martinez, MD, FACC, CONNECT-HCM co-principal investigator and director of Sports Cardiology and the HCM Center at Atlantic Health

HCM is a condition where the heart muscle gets too thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. It's the most common genetic cardiovascular condition, but it is difficult to diagnose because many people don't have symptoms or their symptoms are mistaken for other conditions. Left undiagnosed, HCM can lead to heart failure, blood clots, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.To date, CONNECT-HCM has enrolled over 70 people with HCM who will be followed longitudinally to capture data on their symptoms, diagnostic images, treatment plans, outcomes and demographic information. By linking CONNECT-HCM registry data with individual electronic health records through Arboretum's Hugo Connect platform, researchers will be able to study how individuals with HCM are cared for across medical providers regardless of location. The research approach and platform has started with Morristown Medical Center with anticipated expansion to additional sites rapidly."Registry participants are providing essential data on HCM symptoms, impact of treatments on different patient populations and outcomes that we are currently lacking," said Rohan Khera, MD, MS, FACC, CONNECT-HCM co-principal investigator and an assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. "In the future we'll be much better equipped to diagnose and manage this complex but treatable condition because of the CONNECT-HCM registry."Participants will also receive CardioSmart.org educational materials, including a symptom tracker and exercise fact sheet to determine a safe and effective exercise plan. In the past, some HCM patients have feared exercise, but recent data has shown that exercise is beneficial to people with HCM and is very rarely a cause of sudden cardiac death. The 2024 ACC/AHA HCM Guideline recommends mild to moderate exercise for people with HCM to improve quality of life and ability to do everyday activities.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 7 of Aging (Aging-US) on July 7, 2025, titled "Epigenetic age and accelerated aging phenotypes: a tumor biomarker for predicting colorectal cancer."

In this study led by Su Yon Jung from the University of California, Los Angeles, researchers found a strong association between accelerated epigenetic aging and an increased risk of colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women. The study also indicated that lifestyle factors influence this risk.

Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, particularly in people over the age of 50. However, individuals do not all age at the same biological rate. Two people of the same chronological age can differ in their biological aging, which reflects the condition of their cells and tissues. This study focused on a specific measure of biological aging known as epigenetic aging, which is based on chemical changes to DNA.

The researchers used data from the Women's Health Initiative Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (WHI-dbGaP), which includes genetic and health information from postmenopausal white women aged 50 to 79. They applied three established "epigenetic clocks" to estimate epigenetic age from blood samples collected up to 17 years before a colorectal cancer diagnosis. These clocks measure how quickly a person is aging at the molecular level by tracking DNA methylation. Women with a higher epigenetic age than expected were significantly more likely to develop colorectal cancer

"[…]we examined biological aging status in PBLs via three well-established epigenetic clocks-Horvath's, Hannum's and Levine's […]."

The study also explored the role of lifestyle in modifying this risk. Women who consumed more fruits and vegetables showed no increased risk, even if they were epigenetically older. In contrast, women with both lower fruit and vegetable intake and signs of accelerated aging were up to 20 times more likely to develop colorectal cancer. This suggests that a healthy diet may help reduce cancer risk associated with biological aging.

Another key finding involved women who had both ovaries removed before natural menopause. These women had a higher epigenetic age and, when combined with accelerated aging, a greater likelihood of developing colorectal cancer. This highlights the potential influence of hormonal and reproductive factors on aging and disease risk.

The researchers validated their findings across several independent datasets, supporting the potential of blood-based epigenetic aging markers as early indicators of colorectal cancer risk. These markers could help guide early detection and prevention strategies in aging populations. However, the authors emphasize the need for independent large-scale replication studies.

Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the association between epigenetic aging and cancer. It also supports the idea that modifiable lifestyle factors may reduce disease risk, even among those aging more rapidly at the cellular level.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients may exhibit liver fibrosis and other pathological changes despite normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT). This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tenofovir amibufenamide (TMF) in chronic HBV-infected patients with normal ALT levels.

The ongoing PROMOTE study (NCT05797714) is the first prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, blank-controlled clinical trial involving chronic HBV-infected patients with normal ALT levels. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TMF (TMF group) or no treatment (blank control group). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants achieving HBV DNA levels <20 IU/mL at 48 weeks.

A total of 197 participants were enrolled, with 95 in the TMF group and 102 in the blank control group. At 48 weeks, a significantly greater proportion of participants in the TMF group achieved HBV DNA levels <20 IU/mL compared with the control group (74.2% vs. 9.0%, P < 0.001). The TMF group demonstrated more pronounced reductions in HBV DNA (−2.63 vs. −0.22 log10 IU/mL, P < 0.001), HBsAg (−0.07 vs. −0.04 log10 IU/mL, P = 0.02), and ALT levels (−14.09% vs. 0%, P = 0.003) compared with the blank control. In the TMF group, the proportion of participants with high-normal ALT levels (20–40 IU/L) was reduced. No significant differences were observed between the groups in creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, bone turnover biomarkers, lipid profiles, or phosphorus levels.

TMF treatment demonstrates significant efficacy in chronic HBV-infected patients with normal ALT levels and shows a favorable safety profile regarding bone, renal, and lipid parameters. The PROMOTE study is ongoing, and further results at 96 and 144 weeks are expected to provide additional insights.

As the pace of drug discovery accelerates, scientists are under more pressure than ever to generate high-quality data quickly, reliably, and at scale. For over two decades, Octet® Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) systems have been a trusted part of that journey, offering real-time, label-free interaction analysis without the complexity of fluidics.

Sartorius is pushing BLI further with the Octet® R8e: its most sensitive and versatile system to date for high-throughput analysis of protein-protein, protein-small molecules, and other biomolecular interactions. We spoke with Deirdre Raduns, Manager of Product Management for Protein Analytics, about how the R8e meets the evolving needs of scientific teams working at the front lines of biologics development.

The R8e takes everything that users already appreciate about Octet®—speed, simplicity, no fluidics—and pairs it with a major leap in sensitivity. Researchers can work confidently at the lower detection limits, where other BLI platforms start to struggle. So, if you're working with small molecules, weak binders, or low-abundance targets, the R8e gives you sharper data and clearer answers you can trust.

This is our flagship BLI system for labs needing performance and flexibility. While our other systems serve a wide range of throughput needs, the R8e adds a new dimension with high sensitivity and customizable assay design, all while staying fluidic-free and user-friendly. It's an ideal choice for teams who want the next level of data quality without the long sample loading times and maintenance burden of complex instrumentation.

At its core, the R8e expands what's possible with BLI. It brings near-SPR sensitivity, which means researchers can now detect and quantify interactions that were previously out of reach on a BLI system, especially when working with small molecules or low-affinity analytes.

From a workflow efficiency perspective, you can run assays in 96- or 384-well formats depending on your throughput needs. Plus, we've added smart evaporation control for the 96-well format, so long, overnight runs don't compromise your sample integrity. That's a game-changer for teams who want to push their experiments further without worrying about reliability.

Automation is increasingly non-negotiable in high-throughput environments. Octet® BLI systems are already designed for walk-away operation, but for labs ready to fully integrate with robotics, we offer the RH series (RH16 and RH96) along with a partnership with BIOSERO to integrate these systems and streamline processes. The result is greater consistency, more reproducibility, and more time for teams to focus on science.

Higher prenatalexposure to a common pesticide, chlorpyrifos (CPF), was associated with a greater likelihood of brain abnormalities and poorer motor function among children aged 6 to almost 15 years in a prospective, longitudinal study.

MRIs revealed widespread brain changes, including thicker frontal, temporal, and posterior inferior cortices; reduced white matter volumes; and lower diffusivity of internal capsule white matter.

Researchers also observed that prenatal CPF exposure levels were linked to lower indices of neuronal density in white matter tracts and lower performance on fine motor and motor programming tasks.

Previous preclinical and clinical studies supported the neurotoxicity of CPF, but this is the first research to look at specific brain changes in people.

“These are very strong associations such that progressively higher levels of exposure are associated with progressively greater disruptions in development of brain structure and metabolism, as well as greater disruptions in motor control,” lead author Bradley S. Peterson, MD, division chief of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was published online on August 18 in JAMA Neurology.

CPF is a chlorinated organophosphate and one of the most common pesticides used globally. It enters the bloodstream through ingestion or skin contact or after breathing it in.

In pregnant women, the pesticide crosses the placenta, enters the fetal bloodstream, reaches concentrations up to four times higher than those in the mother's circulation, and crosses the fetal blood-brain barrier.

“Pregnancy is an exquisitely sensitive period of brain development that is vulnerable to environmental exposures, including CPF,” Peterson said. “Protecting unborn children by advocating for restrictions on pesticide use and by educating prospective parents on measures to reduce exposure is essential.”

From January 1998 to July 2006, investigators recruited 727 pregnant African American or Dominican women living in northern New York City. Between 2007 and 2015, MRI scans were performed on 332 of their children aged 6-14.7 years.

Researchers compared MRI findings to CPF levels in umbilical cord or maternal blood, analyzing data between February 2018 and November 2024 on a final cohort of 270 children (median age, 10.38 years).

Maternal exposure to CPF in participants was primarily from spraying indoors for pests, which was prevalent in this inner-city neighborhood before residential use was banned in 2001, the authors noted.

Peterson said a surprising study outcome was “how strong and widespread across the brain these associations were” spanning measures of cortical thickness, white matter myelination, neuronal density, and metabolism.

On an MRI, for example, CPF exposure was associated significantly and positively with cortical thickness in frontal regions, including the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyrus; the anterior cingulate cortex; gyrus rectus; and the middle orbitofrontal and lateral orbitofrontal gyrus.

The same associations were seen in temporal brain regions, including the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyrus, and the parahippocampus. Posteroinferior regions altered the same way, including the posterior cingulate cortex, cuneus, and the inferior occipital, lingual, and fusiform gyrus.

In contrast, CPF levels were associated with lower cortical thickness in the dorsal parietal region, specifically the superior parietal gyrus, and with lower white matter volumes in multiple frontal, temporal, and posteroinferior regions.

In addition to the anatomic MRI findings, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging showed that CPF exposure associated inversely with N-acetyl-L-aspartate, which reflects neuron density, in scattered foci within deep white matter tracts and in gray matter of the insular cortex.

Diffusion tensor imaging also positively linked CPF exposure to fractional anisotropy and inversely with average diffusion coefficient values in the internal capsule. Furthermore, arterial spin labeling revealed higher CPF exposure was associated with a lower regional cerebral blood flow.

“In this cohort study, progressively higher prenatal CPF exposure levels associated significantly with progressively greater alterations in brain measures in each MRI modality, suggesting that prenatal exposure may produce enduring disturbances in brain structure, function, and metabolism in direct proportion to exposure level,” investigators wrote.

Another unexpected result for Peterson was how similar the CPF findings were to those linked to other prenatal exposures, including air pollution, despite being extremely different chemicals.

This suggests a common pathway for disrupting brain development, “most likely by producing inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, which are toxic to brain cells early in development,” he said.

Asked about treating children already affected by CPF, Peterson replied, “Unfortunately, we don't know yet of ways to help children who are already exposed. The only ways we know currently to mitigate risk to unborn children is to minimize exposures.”

He added, “Perhaps in the future, novel therapeutics may reduce inflammation and oxidative stress from CPF and other pesticide exposures and thereby attenuate their adverse effects on brain development.”

CPF is “ubiquitous” on nonorganic fruit, vegetables, and grains, added Peterson, who is also vice chair for research and chief of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Keck School of Medicine of USC in Los Angeles. The pesticide is also carried by outdoor air and is often used in agriculture.

“Farm families are at particularly high risk because pregnant women not only work in the fields but also live in nearby communities, where pesticide drift is common,” said senior investigator Virginia A. Rauh, ScD, the Jane and Alan Batkin Professor of Population and Family Health at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in New York City.

“This is an area where public health policy changes would have a significant impact,” she added.

There are federal and state restrictions. In August 2021, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) removed all “tolerances” or acceptable levels of CPF on food. Several agricultural groups challenged the action, and in December 2023, a US Circuit Court vacated the earlier EPA decision.

The agency is now considering a final rule that would restrict exposures for farm workers and vulnerable populations and set limits for the pesticide on 11 specific crops: alfalfa, apple, asparagus, tart cherry, citrus, cotton, peach, soybean, strawberry, sugar beet, and spring and winter wheat.

State laws on CPF use vary. “Surprisingly,” Rauh said, “CPF is banned in only five states: California, Hawaii, New York, Maryland, and Oregon.”

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the EPA STAR program, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the John and Wendy Neu Family Foundation supported the research. The study was also supported by an anonymous donor, Patrice and Mike Harmon, the Inspirit Fund, and the Robert Coury family. Peterson, Rauh, and Thompson reported no relevant financial relationships.

Despite the increasing recognition of Long COVID as a condition, many patients still face dismissal by medical professionals, misattribution of their symptoms to psychological causes, or simply being left to fend for themselves. The study describes the response many encounter from professionals as 'medical gaslighting', disbelief and dismissiveness.

The study, published in Sociology and conducted in collaboration with Professor Deborah Lupton from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, found that people with Long COVID are turning to wearable devices and online patient communities to make sense of their symptoms, identify patterns and triggers, and develop their own care plans.

The research found that the study participants, most of whom are highly educated and professionally employed (although more than half were unable to work at the time of the interview because of their illness), are using data from smartwatches and symptom-tracking apps to evidence their symptoms to their medical practitioners and advocate for diagnostic tests. In some cases, participants felt it was only because of their self-tracking data that they had been able to get referrals to tests or specialists and subsequently obtain formal diagnoses and access treatment.

We found that people with Long COVID are often left to fend for themselves in a system that isn't adequately informed about their condition and doesn't offer them appropriate medical support. Digital self-tracking, combined with the expertise shared in online patient groups, offers a vital source of knowledge, validation and practical care. But it shouldn't fall to patients to do this work alone. And not all patients have the resources and capacities to usefully engage with self-tracking technologies and advocate for themselves."

Dr. Sazana Jayadeva, co-author of the study and Surrey Future Fellow in the Department of Sociology, University of Surrey

The study found that online patient groups are not only sharing advice on which metrics to monitor and how to interpret data, but are also contributing to the uptake of self-tracking technologies by people with limited to no previous experience or interest in tracking. The study also found that having wearable data gave patients greater confidence to advocate for themselves in medical contexts. Yet many still felt their data was disregarded or even resented. The study identifies this digital evidence as a tool for reducing the power imbalance between patients and doctors - but only where clinicians are willing to listen.

Dr. Sazana Jayadeva continued:

"We need a shift in medical culture, and we urge practitioners to treat patient-generated data as a valuable resource. Without this shift, patients with contested illnesses like Long COVID risk remaining stuck in a system where they have to be their own doctors."

Cerebrovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and stroke remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A common feature of these diseases is vascular stenosis, i.e., the narrowing of blood vessels, which disrupts normal blood flow and contributes to chronic inflammation in the vessel wall. Endothelial cells lining the vasculature play a key role in sensing shear stress from blood flow and responding to disturbed hemodynamics by expressing pro-inflammatory molecules. However, studying this phenomenon in vivo is challenging due to the complexity and variability of living systems.

Traditional in vitro models, including static cultures and microfluidic devices, often fall short of replicating the structural, mechanical, and biological complexity of the human cerebrovascular environment. This emphasizes the need for a more physiologically relevant model to study how abnormal flow patterns drive endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.

To bridge this critical research gap, a collaborative team led by Professor Byoung Soo Kim and Researcher Min-Ju Choi from Pusan National University, along with Professor Dong-Woo Cho and Dr. Wonbin Park from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), developed a 3D-bioprinted in vitro model of stenotic brain blood vessels. Their groundbreaking study was published online in the journal Advanced Functional Materials on June 24, 2025. "We used a novel embedded coaxial bioprinting technique to rapidly fabricate perfusable vascular conduits with controlled luminal narrowing," explains Prof. Kim. "Our bioink, a hybrid of porcine aorta-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM), collagen, and alginate, offered both mechanical strength and essential biological cues to support endothelial cell attachment and function."

The bioprinted vessels encapsulated human endothelial cells, including umbilical vein (HUVECs) and brain microvascular cells (HBMECs), and were exposed to flow conditions simulating both normal and stenotic blood vessels. The model successfully fabricated in vivo blood flow conditions and mimicked stenotic geometries associated with cerebrovascular diseases. Computational fluid dynamics simulations and tracer bead experiments confirmed that stenotic regions produced disturbed flow patterns, characteristic of those seen in atherosclerotic vessels. The endothelialized vessels showed continuous coverage and expressed all junction proteins, including CD31, VE-cadherin, and ZO-1. The vessels also maintained barrier integrity by demonstrating selective permeability. Notably, under disturbed flow conditions, there was a significant upregulation of inflammatory markers, hallmarks of a mature endothelial barrier.

"This 3D bioprinting technology marks a significant advancement in cerebrovascular disease modeling by enabling anatomically accurate and physiologically relevant vessels," shares Prof. Kim. Using a reinforced ECM-based bioink and coaxial bioprinting, the model replicates stenotic vessel geometry and flow dynamics, providing a realistic platform to study flow-induced endothelial inflammation. Its compatibility with multiple endothelial cell types broadens its utility in disease modeling and personalized medicine. By bridging the gap between simplistic in vitro systems and complex in vivo models, this platform also reduces reliance on animal testing and enhances drug screening and toxicity assessments.

Future refinements such as incorporating brain-specific ECM, co-culturing vascular support cells, and using patient-derived cells could further enhance physiological accuracy and patient-specific modeling. Integration with organ-on-a-chip platforms and AI-driven analytics could also enable real-time monitoring of endothelial responses to therapies.

In conclusion, this study delivers a robust and versatile platform for cerebrovascular tissue engineering. As bioprinting technologies continue to evolve, they hold the potential to transform how we study and treat diseases like stroke and atherosclerosis, accelerating therapeutic discovery and the development of personalized interventions.

Aging is particularly harsh on the hippocampus - the brain region responsible for learning and memory.

Now, researchers at UC San Francisco have identified a protein that's at the center of this decline. 

They looked at how the genes and proteins in the hippocampus changed over time in mice and found just one that differed between old and young animals. It's called FTL1. 

Old mice had more FTL1, as well as fewer connections between brain cells in the hippocampus and diminished cognitive abilities. 

When the researchers artificially increased FTL1 levels in young mice, their brains and behavior began to resemble that of old mice.

In experiments in petri dishes, nerve cells engineered to make lots of FTL1 grew simple, one-armed neurites - rather than the branching neurites that normal cells create. 

But once the scientists reduced the amount of FTL1 in the hippocampus of the old mice, they regained their youth. They had more connections between nerve cells, and the mice did better on memory tests. 

"It is truly a reversal of impairments," said Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, which appears in Nature Aging on Aug. 19. "It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms."

In old mice, FTL1 also slowed down metabolism in the cells of the hippocampus. But treating the cells with a compound that stimulates metabolism prevented these effects. 

Villeda is optimistic the work could lead to therapies that block the effects of FTL1 in the brain. 

We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging."

A new study published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery, a journal from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, has identified early hemodynamic valve deterioration (HVD) in more than 6% of patients just one year after undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), raising new questions about valve durability in younger, lower-risk populations.

The retrospective study, which analyzed 10 years of procedures from 2012 to 2022, evaluated 2,123 patients who had complete echocardiographic follow-up data. Researchers found that patients with 1-year HVD were more likely to be younger and have smaller aortic annuli than those without HVD. Importantly, smaller implanted valve sizes were significantly associated with the development of HVD, while larger valves appeared to be protective.

As TAVI is increasingly used in younger and healthier patients, our findings suggest a need to carefully consider valve sizing and long-term durability. Early identification of hemodynamic deterioration may serve as a key predictor of future reintervention and patient outcomes."

Eishan Ashwat, BS, lead study author, medical student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine

According to the study, patients with 1-year HVD had a five-year aortic valve reintervention rate nearly four times higher than those without HVD (2.3% vs. 0.6%). Prior surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) was also independently associated with a higher risk of early HVD.

The findings underscore the importance of vigilant long-term follow-up and may influence future decision-making regarding valve selection, particularly in patients with smaller aortic anatomy or a history of AVR.

The study used the updated Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) definitions to assess bioprosthetic valve function and structural deterioration.

Two studies led by Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Ludwig Center, and Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering researchers report on a powerful new method that significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) for many applications. As an example, they apply the new method to early cancer detection from blood samples, known as liquid biopsy.

One study reports on the development of MIGHT (Multidimensional Informed Generalized Hypothesis Testing), an AI method that the researchers created to meet the high level of confidence needed for AI tools used in clinical decision making. To illustrate the benefits of MIGHT, they used it to develop a test for early cancer detection using circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA)-fragments of DNA circulating in the blood.

A companion study found that ccfDNA fragmentation patterns used to detect cancer also appear in patients with autoimmune and vascular diseases. To develop a test with high sensitivity for cancer but reduced false-positive results, MIGHT was expanded to incorporate data from autoimmune and vascular diseases obtained from colleagues at Johns Hopkins and other institutions who treat and study these diseases.

The studies, supported in part by the National Institutes of Health, are to be published on Aug. 18 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 

A related article, authored by three researchers from Johns Hopkins, Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull, Ph.D., and Microsoft chief data scientist of the AI for Good Lab Juan Lavista Ferres, was published concurrently in Cancer Discovery, a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research. It discusses the challenges of incorporating AI into clinical practice, including challenges addressed by MIGHT.

MIGHT fine-tunes itself using real data and checks its accuracy on different subsets of the data, using tens of thousands of decision-trees, and can be applied to any field employing big data, ranging from astronomy to zoology. It is particularly effective for the analysis of biomedical datasets with many variables but relatively few patient samples, a common situation in which traditional AI models often falter. 

In tests using patient data, MIGHT consistently outperformed other AI methods in both sensitivity and consistency. It was applied to the blood of 1,000 individuals-352 patients with advanced cancers and 648 individuals without cancer.

For each sample, the researchers evaluated 44 different variable sets, each consisting of a set of biological features, such as DNA fragment lengths or chromosomal abnormalities, and found that aneuploidy-based features (an abnormal number of chromosomes) delivered the best cancer detection performance with a sensitivity of 72% (ability to detect cancer) at 98% specificity (correctly identified those who were cancer free). This balance is critical in real-world medical applications where minimizing false positives is necessary to avoid unneeded procedures.

MIGHT gives us a powerful way to measure uncertainty and increase reliability, especially in situations where sample sizes are limited but data complexity is high."

Joshua Vogelstein, PhD, Study Lead Investigator and Associate Professor, Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins Medicine

MIGHT was also extended to a companion algorithm, called CoMIGHT, to determine whether combining multiple variable sets could improve cancer detection. 

The researchers applied CoMIGHT to blood samples from 125 patients with early-stage breast cancers and 125 patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer, which were analyzed along with 500 controls (participants without cancer). While pancreatic cancers were more often detected than breast cancers, CoMIGHT analysis suggested that early-stage breast cancer might benefit from combining multiple biological signals, highlighting the tool's potential for tailoring detection strategies by cancer type. 

In the companion study, researchers Christopher Douville, PhD, assistant professor of oncology, Samuel Curtis, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in the Ludwig Center, and their teams serendipitously discovered that ccfDNA fragmentation signatures previously believed to be specific to individuals with cancer also occur in patients with other diseases, including autoimmune conditions such as lupus, systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis, and vascular diseases like venous thromboembolism. 

Among individuals with abnormal fragmentation signatures, they found an increase in inflammatory biomarkers in all patients, whether they had autoimmune diseases, vascular disease, or cancer. Their results suggest that inflammation-rather than cancer per se, is responsible for fragmentation signals, complicating efforts to use ccfDNA fragmentation as a biomarker specific for cancer. 

To address the challenge of misconstruing inflammation for cancer, the team added information characteristic of inflammation in its training data for MIGHT. The enhanced version reduced, but did not completely eliminate, the false-positive results from non-cancerous diseases.

"Our main goal was to further investigate the biological mechanisms responsible for fragmentation signatures that have previously been thought to be specific for cancer," says Curtis. "As the field moves to more complex biomarkers, understanding the underlying biological mechanisms leading to the results are critical to their interpretation, particularly to avoid false positive results. Our new data indicate that patients with diseases other than cancer can be mistakenly believed to have cancer unless appropriate safeguards are incorporated into the tests." 

Adds Douville, "A silver lining of this study is that reworking of MIGHT could result in a separate diagnostic test for inflammatory diseases." 

Together, the studies demonstrate the promise as well as the complexities of developing trustworthy clinical technologies using AI. In a related editorial, researchers noted several critical challenges that need to be addressed so that tools like MIGHT can be fully integrated into clinical practice. 

They identified eight key barriers to bringing AI into routine clinical care. In simple terms, these include the false expectation that AI tools need to be flawless before they're considered useful; the need to present results as probabilities rather than simple yes-or-no answers; making sure AI predictions match real-world probabilities; ensuring results are reproducible; training models on diverse populations; explaining how AI makes decisions; recognizing how test accuracy can change when diseases are rare; and avoiding over-reliance on computer-generated recommendations. 

"MIGHT could be applied to any field where measuring uncertainty and having confidence in the reliability and reproducibility of findings is key. This could be in the natural sciences, social sciences, or medical sciences. Research across all fields of science requires confidence that what the algorithm is spitting out is real, reproducible, and reliable," says Joshua Vogelstein.

The researchers say results obtained using AI technologies should be viewed as AI-informed data that can complement but not replace clinical judgment. Although MIGHT and CoMIGHT offer powerful new tools in cancer detection, and potentially inflammatory and vascular disease detection, they say that further clinical trials and validation are necessary before such tests can be extended to clinical use. 

"Trust in the result is essential, and now that there is a reliable, quantitative tool in MIGHT, we and other researchers can use it and focus our efforts on studying more patients and adding statistically meaningful features to our tests for earlier cancer detection," says Bert Vogelstein, M.D., Clayton Professor of Oncology, co-director of the Ludwig Center, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and study co-leader. 

MIGHT and its companion algorithm, CoMIGHT, are now publicly available at treeple.ai.

Research led by investigators at Mass General Brigham suggests that the health benefits of more aggressive blood pressure control outweigh concerns about overtreating people with high blood pressure readings. Results of the simulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine. 

The study used data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) trial, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and other published literature to simulate lifetime health outcomes-including heart attack, stroke, and heart failure-for patients whose systolic blood pressure targets were set at <120 mm Hg, <130 mm Hg, and <140 mm Hg.

Recognizing that blood pressure medication comes with side effects, the researchers also simulated and compared the risk of serious events resulting from the treatment. 

The simulation model also accounted for common errors in patients' blood pressure readings based on what has been observed in routine clinical practice. 

Even when including this error rate, the simulation model found that the <120 mm Hg target prevented more cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure, than the <130 mm Hg target. However, the lower target led to additional adverse events related to treatment, such as falls, kidney injury, hypotension, and bradycardia. The lower target also increased overall healthcare spending due to increased antihypertensive use and more frequent visits with clinicians. 

Comparing the cost-effectiveness of the three blood pressure targets with typical levels of measurement error, the researchers found the <120 mm Hg target was cost-effective, associated with a cost of $42,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. 

This study should give patients at high cardiovascular risk and their clinicians more confidence in pursuing an intensive blood pressure goal. Our findings suggest the intensive <120 mm Hg target prevents more cardiovascular events and provides good value, and this holds true even when measurements aren't perfect."

Karen Smith, PhD, Study Lead Author and Investigator, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital

Smith is also a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.

Smith also cautioned, "Our results examine the cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment at the population level. However, given the additional risk of adverse events related to antihypertensives, intensive treatment will not be optimal for all patients. Patients and clinicians should work together to determine the appropriate medication intensity based on patient preferences."

A surge of imported cases from Réunion Island triggered France's earliest chikungunya season ever, testing the limits of its surveillance system and exposing Europe's growing vulnerability to mosquito-borne diseases.

In a recent rapid communication in the journal Eurosurveillance, researchers from France's public health agency detail the current scenario of the chikungunya disease within the country. Specifically, the aftermath of a large 2025 chikungunya outbreak on Réunion Island led to a surge of imported cases in mainland France, triggering an unusually early and widespread season of local transmission.

The report highlights how, by July 10, 2025, 10 local outbreaks involving 27 people had been identified across five French regions. The first local transmission occurring in May (with symptom onset May 27) is the earliest recorded for any arbovirus (chikungunya, dengue, or Zika). These events, driven by the Aedes albopictus (tiger) mosquito, signal an escalating threat from arboviral diseases in Europe and significantly strain surveillance and response systems.

Map of the autochthonous transmission events of chikungunya virus, Mainland France, May–10 July 2025 (n = 27)

Over 86% of travelers from Réunion carried transmissible virus levels while in mainland France, creating widespread opportunities for local mosquitoes to pick up the virus.

Chikungunya is a mosquito-transmitted viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an RNA virus in the alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae. Formally a tropical disease localized in Africa and Southeast Asia, the range expansion of its vector (the Aedes albopictus mosquito) has allowed chikungunya to establish itself globally, particularly in large parts of Europe, including France.

The disease is characterized by high fever and moderate to severe joint pain that manifests suddenly within a week of infection. These symptoms may also be accompanied by muscle pain, headache, fatigue, and rashes.

Viral transmission follows a straightforward and well-documented pattern – an infected individual (termed an "imported case") travels from an outbreak area to a region where tiger mosquitoes are present. If a local mosquito bites that person during their viraemic phase (when the virus is in their blood), it can transmit the virus to other local people, creating an "autochthonous" or local transmission chain.

To combat this, France operates an enhanced surveillance system from May to November, aiming to rapidly detect imported cases and implement vector control to prevent local spread. However, in early 2025, this system faced significant challenges due to a massive chikungunya outbreak on Réunion Island, a French overseas territory (Indian Ocean).

Containing outbreaks required intensive, resource-heavy efforts: public health teams conducted exhaustive door-to-door surveys and targeted mosquito breeding sites around every autochthonous case identified.

The present report represents a rapid communication detailing the real-time findings from France's mandatory surveillance system for Aedes-borne viruses. Conducted by researchers from Santé publique France (the French National Public Health Agency), the report aims to prevent or limit local chikungunya transmission by rapidly identifying and responding to both imported and autochthonous cases.

Surveillance data is collated and synthesized via daily monitoring of laboratory results and epidemiological investigations of confirmed cases. When a case is confirmed, public health authorities interview the patient to determine their travel history and establish the likely place of infection. If a case has no travel history, it is classified as autochthonous, initiating intensive local response.

Chikungunya mitigation measures and intensive local response include: 1. Door-to-door case finding to identify other potential infections, including tracing primary imported cases (successful in 4/10 outbreaks), and 2. Vector control measures, such as eliminating mosquito breeding sites and spraying insecticides and larvicides in the affected area.

The first-ever outbreak in Grand Est (Lipsheim) occurred in an area where tiger mosquitoes are relative newcomers, first spotted in 2015, highlighting the risk even in recently colonized northern zones.

The report credited the Réunion Island outbreak between January and April 2025 with a majority (n = 484; 78%) of the 620 imported chikungunya cases with symptom onset documented in mainland France between May and June 2025. By July 10, 2025, 1,911 imported cases had been notified, 89% linked to Réunion Island – the highest on record since French surveillance began in 2006. Notably, more than 86% of imported cases were viraemic during their stay in mainland France.

This massive influx triggered 10 autochthonous outbreaks comprising 27 cases identified by July 10. The largest cluster (unusually large compared to others) was in Salon-de-Provence with 13 people.

Critically, this marks the earliest arbovirus transmission season in France's history. Prior to 2025, the earliest first case occurred on June 12, with only 3 of 53 previously documented outbreaks starting in June. The median 9-day reporting delay for imported cases facilitated rapid response.

The outbreak in Lipsheim (Grand Est) is particularly significant as the first local transmission in this recently colonized region, where Aedes albopictus was only detected in 2015.

Researchers warned some local transmission chains might be slipping through the surveillance net, raising concerns that undetected spread could trigger larger outbreaks if vigilance wanes.

The present report highlights France's escalating arbovirus challenge and suggests that this is only the start of the expanding threat of mosquito-borne diseases in Europe. The combination of a large overseas outbreak (and its associated influx of cases), a Réunion strain well-adapted to Aedes albopictus, and the mosquito's northward expansion has demonstrated that local transmission can occur much earlier in the season than previously thought, even when vector densities are presumed to be low.

While the rapid detection and containment of these initial outbreaks highlight the effectiveness of France's surveillance system, the resource-intensive nature of door-to-door investigations and vector control measures raises concerns about the system's capacity if transmission trends continue to increase. This report underscores the urgent need for European policymakers to anticipate this growing risk through dedicated funding, contingency planning, and research.

From endothelial repair to anti-inflammatory effects, naringin demonstrates powerful heart-protective actions before reaching clinical trials.

Systematic Review: Endothelial and Cardiovascular Effects of Naringin: A Systematic Review. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers evaluated the cardiovascular and endothelial effects of naringin, a flavonoid found in citrus fruits.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Among the various cardioprotective dietary bioactive compounds, flavonoids have gained significant attention for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities. Naringin is a flavanone glycoside mainly found in citrus fruits, especially in mandarin oranges and grapefruit. It has attracted considerable interest due to its multifaceted biological actions and potential cardioprotective role, though its clinical translation is limited by low oral bioavailability (<5%), prompting research into advanced delivery systems like liposomal encapsulation.

Diabetic mice saw heart calcium levels normalize and cellular energy channels reactivate after naringin treatment, suggesting it repairs metabolic dysfunction at the cellular level.

In the present systematic review, researchers evaluated the cardiovascular and endothelial effects of naringin across cellular, animal, and human studies. First, they searched the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify relevant articles published from January 2000 to June 2025. Original experimental research studies evaluating the effects of naringin on myocardial or endothelial function were included.

Reviews, editorials, abstracts, and studies without cardiovascular endpoints were excluded. Titles/abstracts were screened, followed by full text analysis based on the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes (PICO) framework. Studies in human subjects, cell cultures, and animal models were retained. Cardiovascular or endothelial function outcomes included myocardial infarct size, blood pressure, markers of endothelial function, and cardiac remodeling, among others.

Data on study type, dose, model, treatment duration, endpoints, and mechanistic findings were extracted. A narrative synthesis approach was used due to heterogeneity in model systems, study design, and endpoints. A qualitative synthesis was performed to stratify results by primary endpoints (myocardial or endothelial function) and model type (human, cell, animal).



Naringin Molecular Structure and Citrus Food Sources. The concentration of naringin in plant sources were obtained from Alam et al.

Naringin blocked a deadly cell-death pathway called ferroptosis during heart attacks by silencing the cGAS-STING inflammation alarm in cardiac cells.

The database search identified 2,884 unique records. The full texts of 165 records were assessed for eligibility, and 62 studies were included. These included 28 in vitro, 29 animal, and five human studies. Eight in vitro studies focused on endothelial cells and showed that naringin had protective effects on vascular endothelial cells via suppression of NF-κB signaling and adhesion molecules (e.g., VCAM-1, ICAM-1). Naringin attenuated inflammation activation and preserved normal function in cultured human endothelial cells.

Nineteen in vitro studies were on cardiovascular cell types, including five on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and 14 on cardiac cells. Naringin was found to blunt apoptotic and hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocyte and cardiomyoblast models through modulation of PI3K/Akt and Nrf2 pathways. The anti-hypertrophic effect was related to its ability to inhibit downstream ion transporters and carbonic anhydrase II. Moreover, naringin has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes from simulated in vitro ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) by inhibiting ferroptosis and cGAS-STING pathways.

In a model of hypoxia/reoxygenation injury, naringin reduced oxidative stress, improved cell survival, and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential post-injury. Naringin has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis. Further, naringin has been found to exert anti-atherogenic effects in VSMCs by curbing abnormal migration and proliferation.

Among animal studies, 15 used metabolic disorder models, with nine specifically focusing on myocardial I/R injury or hypertension. Animal models of endothelial injury and hyperlipidemia have demonstrated the anti-atherosclerotic effects of naringin. In rabbit models fed cholesterol, chronic naringin treatment reduced atherosclerotic lesion development.

Studies on hypercholesterolemic rabbits reported significant attenuation of aortic atherosclerosis with naringin treatment, associated with reduced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in the endothelium. In an atherosclerosis-prone mouse model, naringin inhibited plaque formation, protected vascular endothelium, and promoted endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression via PI3K/Akt activation.

Postmenopausal women drinking grapefruit juice for 6 months had significantly more flexible arteries – even though standard blood flow tests showed no change.

Moreover, naringin has demonstrated anti-hypertensive effects linked to renin-angiotensin system (RAS) modulation, preventing cardiac remodeling. Studies on animal models of diet-induced metabolic syndrome have reported that naringin reduces cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis. Beyond ischemia-reperfusion, benefits extended to diabetic cardiomyopathy, sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction, and doxorubicin cardiotoxicity models.

In addition, naringin has consistently demonstrated cardioprotective effects in animal models of I/R injury and myocardial infarction (MI). For instance, naringin pretreatment significantly improved cardiac function and reduced myocardial damage in a rat model of I/R injury. This cardioprotection was associated with reductions in myocardial oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis via PI3K/Akt and Nrf2/GPX4 pathways. In a rat model of MI, naringin pretreatment prevented myocardial necrosis and oxidative stress.

Naringin was found to improve cardiac function and histology in diabetic cardiomyopathy models and attenuate sepsis and lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial dysfunction in other models. Further, compared to preclinical studies, few studies have examined the effects of naringin in humans. Although still limited, evidence on the cardiovascular effects of naringin in humans stems from dietary intervention studies and clinical trials.

A randomized controlled trial reported significant improvements in cardiometabolic parameters in adults who received naringin for 90 days, showing a favorable lipid-modulating effect. Notably, one trial also documented improved arterial stiffness (reduced pulse wave velocity) with naringin-rich grapefruit juice. A dietary intervention study of adults with moderate hypercholesterolemia reported that naringin intake for eight weeks did not change plasma cholesterol levels; this lack of effect might be due to insufficient dose or treatment duration, as effective preclinical doses translate to ~1 g/day in humans.

In sum, a substantial body of evidence positions naringin as a potent compound with cardiovascular benefits. Preclinical studies have documented its ability to protect the myocardium and improve endothelial function through multi-targeted actions on oxidative stress (Nrf2), inflammation (NF-κB), cell survival (PI3K/Akt), and RAS modulation. It can suppress oxidative stress and inflammation, preserve endothelial integrity, and activate pro-survival signaling in cells.

Despite the positive findings of naringin, further research is needed to define optimal dosing, improve bioavailability, and validate effects in large-scale human trials to cement its role in clinical practice.

From Egypt to Italy, children who regularly eat ultra-processed foods are falling short of dietary guidelines and moving away from traditional Mediterranean eating patterns, researchers warn.



In a recent article published in the journal Foods, researchers examined the consumption of unhealthy ultra-processed foods (UPFs) among children and adolescents in five Mediterranean countries, exploring how UPF intake relates to diet quality.

Their analysis showed that higher consumption of UPFs was linked with poorer overall diet quality, reduced compliance with dietary guidelines, and lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet.

Daily UPF consumers faced steep odds: Children eating UPFs daily had 37-60% lower likelihood of achieving high diet quality scores, with the strongest negative effects seen in Egypt, Italy, and Portugal.

In recent decades, diets have shifted from seasonal, fresh, local foods toward industrially processed alternatives, a trend especially evident among children and adolescents.

Technological advances and globalization have reshaped food production, increasing shelf life and convenience but often sacrificing nutritional quality. This shift raises concerns, as children are particularly vulnerable due to developmental needs, marketing susceptibility, and reliance on caregivers and schools for diet.

Early exposure to poor eating habits can disrupt healthy growth, impair cognitive and immune function, and increase the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes.

Mediterranean countries, once known for the balanced and nutrient-rich Mediterranean diet, are also experiencing a gradual move toward Western-style eating, marked by nutrient-poor, calorie-dense foods. Although overall consumption of such foods remains lower than in countries like the US or UK, these trends are concerning.

According to the Nova classification, UPFs are industrial products high in sugars, fats, and additives but low in essential nutrients. Growing evidence links frequent UPF consumption with poor diet quality, chronic diseases, and even cognitive problems.

Legumes got sidelined: Across all five countries, children eating more UPFs consistently fell short of dietary recommendations for legumes – a cornerstone of the traditional Mediterranean diet.

Researchers analyzed dietary habits of children and adolescents aged between 6 and 17 years in five Mediterranean countries, namely Lebanon, Egypt, Portugal, Spain, and Italy, using data provided by 2011 parents recruited from a consumer database.

Eligible participants had to be parents of children within the age range and have internet access, and data, including demographic information, were collected via an online survey. Weight status was calculated using established growth chart body mass index (BMI) percentiles, classifying participants as obese, overweight, or normal weight.

Physical activity was assessed using a questionnaire, which categorized activity as low, moderate, or high. Dietary intake was assessed through 24-hour recalls and weekly food frequency questions. Special attention was given to 13 categories of UPFs, including fast food, soft drinks, pastries, and candies. UPF consumption was categorized as “high” (above the median) or “daily” (daily consumption of at least one type of UPF; not necessarily all categories).

Diet quality was assessed using two indices: the Youth Healthy Eating Index (adapted to a maximum score of 90 in this study) and the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (with a high score of 12). Statistical analyses included Chi-square, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for physical activity, weight, age, and sex.

Meat type matters: Diets high in UPFs weren't just linked to more meat consumption overall, but specifically to diets richer in processed meats like sausages and pre-packaged cold cuts.

Among the 2011 participants, no significant differences by sex were found across UPF consumption groups. However, obesity and overweight were more common among children with higher daily UPF intake. Interestingly, a higher proportion of physically active adolescents also reported high UPF consumption. The authors proposed this might reflect increased hunger from higher activity rather than inherently unhealthy behaviors, but noted this contrasts with most literature and requires confirmation.

In terms of food groups, high and daily UPF consumers ate more sweets, nuts, dairy, meat, and cereals, but showed a lower proportion consuming high fruit intake (≥3 portions/day) and a higher proportion consuming moderate fruit (1–2 portions/day), with Spain as a notable exception where high UPF consumers ate more fruit. Importantly, vegetable and whole grain intake remained consistent regardless of UPF consumption levels. Country-specific patterns largely mirrored these results.

Diet quality was consistently lower in children with higher UPF intake. Those consuming UPFs daily or frequently scored significantly lower on both the diet quality indices. For example, daily UPF consumption was associated with about 40–60% lower odds of achieving high diet quality scores. Subgroup analyses showed particularly strong negative associations in Egypt, Portugal, and Italy, while Lebanon showed paradoxical increases in Mediterranean diet adherence among high UPF consumers, and findings were less consistent in Spain.

Further analysis showed that high UPF consumers were less likely to meet dietary recommendations for fats, sweets, meat, and legumes across countries. Some exceptions were noted, such as higher adherence to Spanish guidelines for fish among frequent UPF consumers.

This study found that higher consumption of unhealthy UPFs among children and adolescents in Mediterranean countries was strongly linked with poorer diet quality and lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet, echoing evidence from other research.

Although some country-level variations emerged, frequent UPF intake was associated with unbalanced diets rich in fats, sweets, and processed meats, potentially displacing minimally processed foods. The study provides a comprehensive multi-country assessment of UPF consumption in Mediterranean youth using standardized metrics.

The study's strengths include its standardized, multi-country design and focus on both diet quality indices and adherence to national guidelines. However, limitations include its cross-sectional design, reliance on parental reports (which may consist of recall and social desirability bias), and restricted focus on only certain UPF categories.

In conclusion, reducing unhealthy UPF intake is essential to preserve the health benefits associated with the Mediterranean diet. This requires multi-sectoral strategies, including education, stricter marketing regulations, school nutrition policies, and industry accountability through reformulation and labeling.

LOUGHBOROUGH, England (Aug. 19, 2025) – The U.S. Women's Cerebral Palsy (CP) National Team utilized goals from seven different players, including a second-half hat trick from Joey Martin and braces from Kaia Spencer, Jesslyn Kuhnel and Echo Yale, to earn a 12-1 win against Nepal in the team's opening match of the 2025 IFCPF Intercontinental Cup at Loughborough University.

Idle on the first day of the five-team competition on Monday, the USA wasted little time on Matchday Two, bagging three goals in the first four minutes. Spencer tallied a first-half brace just four minutes in, sandwiched around captain Cassidy Leake's second minute goal. Kuhnel found the back of the net in the fifth and ninth minutes, before Michelle Cross got on the score sheet in the 18th to make it 6-0 heading into halftime. 

Echo Yale earned their debut by starting the match between the sticks, while Janie Richardson collected her first cap when she replaced Kuhnel just before halftime. At the start of the second half, Gabby Scotto replaced Yale in goal to become the third debutant on the day, with Yale re-entering the match as a field player later in the second frame. 

WATCH: USA 12, Nepal 1

It took the USA a little time to get going in the second half, and Nepal actually tallied their first goal of the tournament as Matilda Stacey pulled one back to make 6-1 in the 34th minute. 

That lone strike was the interval between another onslaught of U.S. goals, as Richardson tallied on her U.S. debut to make it 7-1 in the 38th minute. Yale followed suit with her first goal in a U.S. shirt three minutes later. Second half substitute Martin scored her first off a feed from Richardson in the 44th, before setting up Yale for their second in the 47th minute.

Yale then returned the favor twice more to Martin, feeding her second goal in the 48th, before helping her complete her hat trick with the last kick of the game in the 50th minute. 

Now with a 10W-2L-2D all-time record, the CP WNT is back in action Wednesday when it faces Denmark. Kick off from Loughborough, England is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast live via the IFCPF YouTube channel.

ATLANTA (August 19, 2025) – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team will travel to Spain from Aug 22-Sept. 1 for a pair of international friendlies against the hosts. The matches will take place on Aug. 28 and 31 at Stadi Olímpic Camilo Cano in Alicante, Spain. Both games will be at 11 a.m. local / 5 a.m. ET and are open to the public with free admission.

This trip will be the final training camp and final matches before U.S. head coach Katie Schoepfer chooses the 21-player roster that will represent the USA at the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, taking place in Morocco from Oct. 17-Nov. 8.

The U-17 WNT enters the matches following its recent success at the 4 Nations Tournament in Mexico City, where the team recorded victories over Mexico and Costa Rica and tied Canada (before winning the penalty kick shootout) to secure the championship. Fourteen players who helped lift the trophy in Mexico will travel to Spain for this event, including the goal scorers in that tournament, midfielder Nyanya Touray (3) and defender Sydney Schmidt (1).

The roster consists of seven players who are entering their freshman years of college this fall; Schmidt, who will enroll at Florida State in January of 2026 and is playing for the Sporting Club Jacksonville in the USL Super League until then; and 14 club players. Two players called up currently live and play in Spain: goalkeeper Carmen O'Dea (Barcelona U-19s) and central defender Claire Kessenger (CE Europa Femenino in Barcelona).

The age cutoff to play in the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup is players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008. This roster features 18 players born in 2008, two in 2009 – forward Maddie DiMaria and defender Meila Brewer -- one in 2010 in O'Dea and midfielder Loradana Paletta, who was born in 2011.

The U.S. U-17 WNT has several professional players from the NWSL in the pool, but none of them were available for selection for this roster.

At the 2025 FIFA U-17 WWC, the USA will play in Group C and will face Ecuador (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local time) in its first match on Saturday, Oct. 18. The USA will then face China PR on Tuesday, October 21 (Noon ET / 5 p.m. local) and finish group play against Norway on Friday, October 24 (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local). All three of the USA's Group C games will be played at the Football Academy Mohammed VI (Pitch 3) in Sale, which is just outside of the capital of Rabat.

These will be the ninth and tenth international matches this year for the U.S. U-17 WNT ahead of the World Cup, continuing the focus on the U.S. Way which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

ATLANTA (August 19, 2025) – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team will travel to Spain from Aug 22-Sept. 1 for a pair of international friendlies against the hosts. The matches will take place on Aug. 28 and 31 at Stadi Olímpic Camilo Cano in Alicante, Spain. Both games will be at 11 a.m. local / 5 a.m. ET and are open to the public with free admission.

This trip will be the final training camp and final matches before U.S. head coach Katie Schoepfer chooses the 21-player roster that will represent the USA at the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, taking place in Morocco from Oct. 17-Nov. 8.

The U-17 WNT enters the matches following its recent success at the 4 Nations Tournament in Mexico City, where the team recorded victories over Mexico and Costa Rica and tied Canada (before winning the penalty kick shootout) to secure the championship. Fourteen players who helped lift the trophy in Mexico will travel to Spain for this event, including the goal scorers in that tournament, midfielder Nyanya Touray (3) and defender Sydney Schmidt (1).

The roster consists of seven players who are entering their freshman years of college this fall; Schmidt, who will enroll at Florida State in January of 2026 and is playing for the Sporting Club Jacksonville in the USL Super League until then; and 14 club players. Two players called up currently live and play in Spain: goalkeeper Carmen O'Dea (Barcelona U-19s) and central defender Claire Kessenger (CE Europa Femenino in Barcelona).

The age cutoff to play in the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup is players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008. This roster features 18 players born in 2008, two in 2009 – forward Maddie DiMaria and defender Meila Brewer -- one in 2010 in O'Dea and midfielder Loradana Paletta, who was born in 2011.

The U.S. U-17 WNT has several professional players from the NWSL in the pool, but none of them were available for selection for this roster.

At the 2025 FIFA U-17 WWC, the USA will play in Group C and will face Ecuador (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local time) in its first match on Saturday, Oct. 18. The USA will then face China PR on Tuesday, October 21 (Noon ET / 5 p.m. local) and finish group play against Norway on Friday, October 24 (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local). All three of the USA's Group C games will be played at the Football Academy Mohammed VI (Pitch 3) in Sale, which is just outside of the capital of Rabat.

These will be the ninth and tenth international matches this year for the U.S. U-17 WNT ahead of the World Cup, continuing the focus on the U.S. Way which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

Tottenham have reportedly agreed a £60 million ($81m) deal in principle with Crystal Palace for Eberechi Eze. The 27-year-old England midfielder is seen as the perfect creative spark to inject flair and rhythm into Thomas Frank's side, who are scrambling to plug the gaping hole left by James Maddison after his ACL injury.

HOUSTON — We are less than a year away now from the 2026 FIFA World Cup coming to Houston, which means hundreds of thousands of fans pouring into the city. 

The Texas Department of Transportation is turning up the pressure on one of its projects to beautify a major Houston freeway.   TxDOT is sprucing up the gateways into downtown starting along I-69 near Hazard Street. Crews are removing drought and freeze-damaged vines, repainting walls to cover up graffiti, and replanting greenery to welcome the world to Houston.

“We're going to paint the walls a light tan with some accent colors, and then we'll also fill in the gaps with new vines where we're missing them so they can all grow up over time,” said TxDOT landscape architect Ethan Beeson.

It's part of a project that began more than 25 years ago when Houstonians asked for more green space along freeways. And with the World Cup coming, TxDOT says now is the time to bring that vision back to life.

“We want people to realize this is a great place to come visit,” Beeson said. “We also want everyone to understand Houston is a great place to live and work. We spent a lot of time over the years trying to make the freeways look as good as they can.”

TxDOT says shoulder closures will be in place in this area between Hazard and Montrose while work is underway. As a matter of fact, it's already started. The vines, however, will take years to fully grow back, but officials say the wait will be worth it.

TxDOT hopes to keep these improvements in place well beyond the World Cup for Houstonians and visitors alike to enjoy.

Fort Lauderdale is moving funds previously considered for the FIFA World Cup to its homelessness budget instead.

The city formally torpedoed a $350,000 proposal to fund events in the county around the soccer tournament, which is being held in Miami and 15 other cities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada next summer. 

It comes just weeks after a Miami-Dade commissioner asked for a halt to $46 million in county funds for the World Cup, on the back of major cuts to county services and staffing in the proposed budget for next year.

The shift in priorities in Broward, disclosed in an Aug. 13 memorandum from the city manager, came after Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis and other officials raised financial concerns last month.

“Personally, I don't see any gain from it when nothing's happening in Fort Lauderdale. Nothing's happening in Chase Stadium of consequence,” Trantalis said at a June 17 workshop meeting.

The only time teams will be playing in Broward County during the tournament, Trantalis said, will be for practice at Chase Stadium. The stadium, which hosts Inter Miami's games, is not large enough to accommodate World Cup matches and fans.

Alina Hudak, the CEO of the Miami-area host committee, did not respond to a request for comment.

Instead of World Cup events, the funding will be spent on one-time purchases, “including vehicles and equipment that will support City personnel in engaging directly with homeless individuals,” said Ashley Doussard, a spokesperson for Fort Lauderdale.

The FIFA host committee has struggled to solicit public funds for World Cup programs in Broward County.

At a Tourism Development Council (TDC) meeting in May, the committee requested $2.5 million from Broward County for “fan festival” watch events, advertising inclusion and exclusive events, according to its request.

Visit Lauderdale, the marketing arm for the county, recommended providing $250,000. The rest of the funding would have to be approved by county commissioners for a vote. However, the committee never followed up with the county to formally request the funds, according to Stacey Ritter, president of Visit Lauderdale.

Currently, no money has been allocated from Broward County for the FIFA World Cup, she said — not even the quarter of a million dollars from Visit Lauderdale. “They didn't want it,” Ritter said. “They want more.”

Things may not be going according to plan for Wrexham on the pitch at the start of the season, however, there is some exciting news off it.

Wrexham fans were disappointed with Danny Ward for his performance during the 3-2 defeat to West Brom with many fans calling for Arthur Okonkwo to be reinstated as the number one goalkeeper.

Phil Parkinson thought his side were ‘too soft' in their defending for the three goals and has demanded change ahead of their crucial next fixture at home to Sheffield Wednesday.

However, the Red Dragons are continuing to build their profile off the pitch and owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are considering a move to bring the club into the spotlight of a FIFA competition.

According to BBC Sport, Reynolds and McElhenney are set to play a big role in the UK's bid to host the 2035 FIFA Women's World Cup.

Currently, the UK is the sole bidder for the tournament and the Welsh FA are targeting two grounds to be a part of the competition.

The FAW wants one ground in the south of Wales and one in the North of Wales, with the Racecourse Ground a frontrunner.

FAW chief executive Noel Mooney has stated: “The Kop development is a significant first step and the vision for the stadium is incredible,

“What Ryan and Rob are doing is amazing. They are looking to invest in the stadium and build up the Cae Ras, which is the oldest international ground in the world, and there is a potential north star for them.

“The city and the club have a chance to bring a World Cup to north Wales. What a story that would be. What a legacy for Ryan and Rob to leave Wrexham.”

The Racecourse Ground is no stranger to international football and in fact new signings Nathan Broadhead and Kieffer Moore both scored for Wales at the stadium.

Wales beat Gibraltar at the Racecourse Ground with the duo both on target and games have been played at the home of the Red Dragons before.

The club are targeting hosting the FIFA U17 Women's European Championships next summer, if all redevelopment on the Kop Stand can be completed.

Wrexham need to be in line with FIFA guidelines on the stadium before they can host any international tournament, something that Michael Williamson is determined to make happen.

The Newcastle striker is considered the Reds' dream signing, but scoring goals is the least of their worries right now

The build-up to Newcastle's Premier League meeting with Liverpool on Monday is obviously going to be dominated by Alexander Isak. A striker in every sense, Isak is the protagonist of the most-discussed transfer saga of the summer so far - and we still don't have any idea how it's going to end.

All we can say for sure right now is that Isak's absence is hurting Newcastle. Eddie Howe's team bossed their season-opener at Aston Villa on Saturday - even before their hosts were reduced to 10 men - but lacked a cutting edge, which was hardly surprising given they had to play a winger, Anthony Gordon, up front.

Newcastle are working hard trying to strengthen their attack before the window closes - they wanted another centre-forward even before Isak decided to down tools to try to force through a move to Liverpool - but it's telling that Howe hasn't been overly critical of the Swede's conduct, at least not in public.

The manager is clearly still hoping that he can rebuild the bridges that Isak has burned on Tyneside - because he knows full well that Newcastle need Isak. Do Liverpool, though? Because the evening before Newcastle were held to a scoreless draw at Villa, the Reds were involved in a thrilling encounter with Bournemouth at Anfield that suggested that scoring goals should be the least of Arne Slot's worries right now...

Chelsea took to the pitch for their opening Premier League match with a noticeable change to their kit that differed from what was seen during their pre-season tour. The gold FIFA Club World Cup champion badge has been repositioned on the chest.

During pre-season matches, the gold CWC badge was positioned centrally, sitting directly between the Nike Swoosh and the Chelsea club crest. However, for the official start of the Premier League season, the badge has been moved higher up on the chest, now placed centrally above the two logos.

The adjustment was not an arbitrary decision by the club. According to reports, the change was made following official instructions from Sporting iD, the manufacturer of the badges for the Premier League. The rationale for pushing the badge higher is to prevent the prominent FIFA badge from overshadowing the club's own crest, giving both elements more visual space.

Despite the intention, the new placement has stirred controversy among supporters. Many feel the higher position looks awkward or unbalanced. This discussion is often linked to the general dissatisfaction with the current circular CWC badge compared to the more traditional, and fan-favorite, shield-shaped version used in previous years, which many believe was better designed and easier to integrate into a kit's layout. Following their win in the historic first Club World Cup with the new format, Chelsea will have the badge on their kit for the next three seasons.

The post Iga Swiatek rallies for 1st Cincinnati Open title right after Wimbledon win appeared first on ClutchPoints.

After a long title drought that spanned over a full year, Iga Swiatek is back to dominating like tennis fans are used to seeing. After the 24-year old collected her sixth Grand Slam title with a phenomenal performance to win Wimbledon last month, she has now won her 11th WTA 1000 title at the Cincinnati Open.

After knocking off Elena Rybakina in the semifinals, Swiatek defeated Italian Jasmine Paolini in a close straight-set final, 7-5 6-4.

With that victory, Swiatek improves to 6-0 all-time against Paolini, dropping just one set in the process. Of course, the two contested a major final at Roland Garros in 2024, with the Polish superstar winning 6-2, 6-1.

Cincinnati, a fast hard court, was thought to be one of the most difficult surfaces for Swiatek to play on due to her western forehand grip and her tendency to hug the baseline while refusing to give up court position. That court position combined with her occasionally attackable serve puts her at a disadvantage in the serve-return dynamic on faster courts.

Świątek reversed that trend at Wimbledon, and did so in Cincinnati as well. After the match, she was just as surprised as many watching.

“I don't know why I win the tournaments that were like the last ones in terms of what I thought they were going to be,” Swiatek said at the trophy presentation, in quotes shared by the WTA. “So, thank you [to my team] for forcing me to become a better player and learn how to play on all these faster surfaces.

“I'm kind of shocked and super happy, so thank you for the awesome support, to the team and to my family back home.”

Swiatek is now up to 18 big titles in total, adding her 11 WTA 1000 trophies to her six majors and one victory at the WTA Finals. She has won seven of the 10 different WTA 1000 tournaments after adding Cincinnati to her collection, and is now only missing victories in Wuhan, Canada and Dubai to complete the full collection.

This victory also gets Swiatek back to No. 2 in the world, ensuring that she will avoid top seed Aryna Sabalenka until the final of the U.S. Open if the two of them were to both make it that far. She passes American Coco Gauff, who drops to No. 3.

Swiatek made it to New York just in time for the U.S. Open mixed doubles on Tuesday morning, where she played her first match about 16 hours after finishing the final in Cincinnati. She and Casper Ruud are into the semifinals after winning a pair of matches on Tuesday, and Swiatek will look to keep the winning streak going into the main draw starting on Aug. 24.

Surprise Cincinnati Open semi-finalist Terence Atmane has withdrawn from US Open qualifying due to a foot injury, the Frenchman announced on social media.

"Hello everyone. After a foot MRI yesterday in NY we detected an intermediate grade partial tearing of the first MTP joint [a] Grade 2 muscle injury involving the medial head of the flexor hallucis brevis. Low-grade partial tearing of the medial sesamoidal phalangeal ligament," Atmane wrote on Instagram Stories. "Which in other terms won't make me able to play the US Open...

"I do feel sad about it because with the last result I want to push for more but trying to be smart and get myself ready for Asia was the best decision for my team and I."

The Frenchman entered Cincinnati qualifying as the No. 136 player in the PIF ATP Rankings and emerged as World No. 69. The lefty earned five of his 10 tour-level wins at the tournament, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index

Atmane's dream run came to an end on Saturday against World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in a tightly contested semi-final, which the Italian won 7-6(4), 6-2. The Frenchman wrote that he next plans to compete in Chengdu.

Brian Vahaly doesn't know his life without tennis. After first picking up a racket at the age of 2, Vahaly was a star athlete from 1997 to 2001 at the University of Virginia, where he was a three-time All-American, reached the NCAA singles final and graduated with a double major in finance and business management. During his seven-year pro career, he reached a career-high ranking of World No. 64 and earned victories over his childhood hero Michael Chang and former World No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero.

But Vahaly has perhaps made the biggest impact off the court. In 2017, a decade after retiring due to a rotator cuff injury, he became the first current or former ATP Tour player to come out as gay. Last November, he was elected for a two-year term as the chairman of the board and president of the United States Tennis Association, joining Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova as highly visible LGBTQ sports figures.

A self-described “very private person,” Vahaly said he had made peace with the fact that he was never going to come out publicly, despite being open about his sexuality with his family and friends. But six months after he and his partner, Bill Jones, became parents to twin boys via surrogacy, Vahaly had a change of heart.

“You're just looking at them and thinking about the life you want to build for them, and your priorities shift. It's not about you anymore,” Vahaly, 46, told NBC News. “Suddenly, I felt this overwhelming sense of responsibility not only to my kids, but almost to the younger version of myself who had nobody to look to and often felt lonely and isolated.”

Vahaly said he knew that coming out on a Sports Illustrated podcast would elicit a strong reaction from a sporting community that has the reputation of being largely white, straight and conservative. While his announcement was met with some support — multiple top players, including Roger Federer, said an openly queer player would be “totally accepted” in the men's locker room — Vahaly recalled receiving thousands of hateful messages about his young family.

“There was a lot of feedback I received about raising kids into this world, having kids without a mother,” Vahaly said. “I was disappointed to receive all of that, but I was very well-prepared.” 

Reaching that place of self-acceptance was a lengthy process for Vahaly, who had developed a knack for compartmentalization as a pro athlete. “Unfortunately, what was a great tennis asset was not a great personal-life asset. As feelings hit my mind, anything that felt not beneficial to my career was quickly compartmentalized and pushed to the side,” he said. As a result, he said, he can't quite pinpoint when he realized he was gay.

Having grown up in a religious and conservative household in New Jersey and then having immersed himself in a locker room culture where homophobic remarks were a common way “to build camaraderie,” Vahaly admitted that he had developed a lot of internalized homophobia. “Back in those days, if I thought about a gay bar and what it meant to be gay, and I would see those people publicly, I thought to myself, ‘That is not me. I have nothing in common with that group.'”

It wasn't until his mid-20s that Vahaly, with the help of his longtime sports psychologist, began to come to terms with his sexuality. Part of that emotional work included unpacking his experience of undergoing so-called conversion therapy at a church, where he was told repeatedly that his attraction to men was a kind of “horrible defect” that could be cured by God. In retrospect, Vahaly said, he wasted years trying to change an immutable part of himself.

In his second act, Vahaly has held senior executive positions at Washington, D.C.-based venture capital and investment management firms. But about five years after stepping away from tennis, he was asked to serve on the USTA's board. “As I was learning who I was, I didn't feel like tennis was a safe space for me, so I said no. Fortunately, the guy who was recruiting me knew me quite well and knew how to tap into my competitive side,” Vahaly recalled with a laugh.

“When you don't see people before you as a potential role model, it's hard to know, as a gay athlete and man, whether the organization — or a sport more broadly — would be comfortable with you in a leadership position,” he added. “When I came on, I was very guarded. Most board members for me were significantly older, often talking to me about their daughters. I just played it quiet and focused on where I thought I could make an impact, which was really on the player development side of the house.”

Women's tennis has historically had many openly gay players — including King, Navratilova and most recently Russian-born Australian Daria Kasatkina. But only one men's player has followed in Vahaly's footsteps: Brazil's Joao Lucas Reis da Silva, who reached a career high of No. 234 last month.

While there is now greater cultural acceptance of the LGBTQ community, Vahaly pointed out there are still a number of factors preventing male players — like his younger self — from wanting to come out, including the potential financial fallout from sponsors and the reality that the tour still travels to countries where being gay is neither legal nor accepted.

“The new generation thinks about inclusion and about being themselves so differently than my generation, so I'm hopeful that [homophobic] language starts to fall away a little bit, that people in our community feel accepted into sport,” he said. “Once we start to build the numbers, you'll start to see those athletes making it up to the pro tour.”

Now, as an LGBTQ leader in sports, Vahaly still faces some casual homophobia. “There are still rooms where my profile is shared, but they leave out the fact that I'm gay or I'm a dad,” he said. But, “sometimes, shouting from the rooftops your beliefs or being really firm and in your face is not the right approach.”

“Those are tough rooms, sometimes, when people aren't used to seeing a gay family, but I think humanizing people in our community is actually what drives us forward,” he continued. “I'm not trying to push something down anybody's throat. I'm simply trying to show how and why we're actually not that different. I think that allows the space for people to be open to diversity and inclusion.”

Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has targeted diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and rolled back legal protections for LGBTQ people, particularly those who are transgender. In response to the current political climate, Vahaly said he is “less” focused on “what's happening around us” and more focused on how he can use the U.S. Open to amplify the work of LGBTQ organizations such as The Trevor Project, Athlete Ally, You Can Play and the Gay and Lesbian Tennis Alliance. (The Grand Slam will host its fifth annual Open Pride day on Aug. 28.)

“I think about what I can do and what I can control,” Vahaly said. “What I can do is be honest about myself and take part in interviews like this to continue to show and demonstrate to the world the diversity that exists within our sport and that they should feel welcome. I want people to know and see that this is a safe place for them.”

The new mixed doubles event in New York sees a host of top singles players compete for a $1m prize

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

The new-look US Open mixed doubles event starts today, with Carlos Alcaraz set to feature alongside Emma Raducanu amongst a star-studded list of pairs. 

New for 2025, the mixed doubles in New York will be staged on the two biggest courts – Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong – over Tuesday 19 August and Wednesday 20 August. 

As well as five-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz and 2021 US Open champion Raducanu, a host of other top names are competing alongside one another for the $1m champion prize - an increase of $800,000 from 2024. 

The top-seeded pair features British No 1 Jack Draper alongside Jessica Pegula – they face Alcaraz and Raducanu in the round-of-16. Novak Djokovic is also playing with Serbian compatriot Olga Danilovic, but Jannik Sinner and Katerina Siniakova have withdrawn a day after the men's World No 1 retired from the Cincinnati Open final against Alcaraz with illness.

Croatia's women's singles medallist speaks to Olympics.com a year on from her historic podium finish at Paris 2024.

Donna Vekić has two special souvenirs from Paris 2024: her Olympic silver medal, and her scrunchie.

The Croatian tennis player had to overcome countless hurdles in the buildup to last year's Olympic Games, suffering from so much physical discomfort that she contemplated pulling out.

Vekić candidly remembers her illness in the buildup to Paris, where she endured pain in both her arm and ankle. Even her initial flight to the French capital was cancelled, which delayed preparations for the tournament and being able to adapt to the clay.

Despite everything, the 13th seed reached the gold medal match at Roland-Garros, coming away with the silver medal after defeat to Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen.

“I have the scrunchie that I wore in the final,” Vekić tells Olympics.com of her keepsakes from her successful Games a year ago. “That's the first thing that comes to my mind. I have a lot of merchandise at home from Paris."

A post shared by Donna Vekic (@donnavekic)

“That was the most incredible week of my life, the best achievement of my career by far. Staying in the [Olympic] Village with all the other athletes, having my family there in the semis and finals, it was really special.”

Both the medal and scrunchie sit proudly in her apartment in Monte Carlo, with little proving more meaningful to the 29-year-old than the Olympic silver, Croatia's first medal in Olympic women's singles tennis history.

Sport has always been in Vekić's blood, born to a football-playing father and a hurdler mother, she hit a tennis ball for the first time at the age of six.

With four WTA career titles, the Osijek native had never reached a final on clay before Paris 2024. By her own admission, she is not fond of the red surface - “I'm not the biggest fan of clay, so it always feels good coming back on grass,” she admits.

Arriving in Paris after a maiden Grand Slam semi-final appearance at Wimbledon 2024, Vekić had only once made it into the second week of the clay major at Roland-Garros, where Olympic tennis was held.

The Women's Singles Tennis Final was held at Court Philippe-Chatrier, on 03/08/24. After two hours of play, Qinwen Zheng (CHN) won the Gold. Zheng (CHN) claimed victory over Donna Vekic (CRO) 6:2, 6:3.

Vekić explains, “After having such a good run at Wimbledon I had a lot of confidence going to the Olympics. I was very tired and not thinking too much, just playing my game. Every time before the clay season starts, I always [ask], ‘Okay, what can I change, what can I add?', I'm overthinking and then I lose my head a little bit.”

Then suddenly, everything clicked. The Croatian overcame former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu before stunning second seed and another Grand Slam winner in Coco Gauff in the third round. Though played on Court Philippe-Chatrier, this was not an extension of the French Open by any means.

“The conditions were a little bit different than Roland-Garros,” the silver medallist explains of how the clay conditions benefitted her. “It was a lot warmer, the balls were different, everything helped a little - and playing for your country it's different as well.”

Vekić will be 32 by the time of the next Games in LA 2028, still three years away. “That's very far, let's see about LA,” she responds to the possibility of competing at a third Olympic Games, having debuted at Tokyo 2020 back in 2021.

She knows that she will be even more invested in her fashion endeavours by then, from the Olympic flame to her own flame. “I have my own brand of candles and diffusers,” she concludes, “I don't have a lot of time for that, but it's something I'll definitely focus on after my career.”

Jannik Sinner has withdrawn from the U.S. Open mixed doubles, which begins Aug. 19 in New York. The men's world No. 1 in singles retired after five games of his Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz due to illness, and will recover before preparing for the U.S. Open singles.

Sinner was going to partner Kateřina Siniaková, probably the greatest active doubles player on earth, in a compelling alliance of the two tennis disciplines.

Siniaková, an 11-time Grand Slam doubles champion and a gold medalist at the 2024 Paris Olympics, never received a new partner. The official draw and order of play were updated Tuesday morning, but Sinner and Siniaková's place was occupied by “Qualifier / Qualifier” as of 9:12 a.m., less than two hours before the start of the event.

Americans Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison then took the pair's spot as first alternate, owing to their combined singles ranking.

Alcaraz traveled from Mason, Ohio to partner Emma Raducanu, while Iga Świątek, who won the WTA 1000 title with victory over Jasmine Paolini, also arrived on time to partner Norway's Casper Ruud.

The new mixed doubles event, which will be played over two days and feature short sets, an array of singles stars and a $1 million prize, begins at 11 a.m. Aug. 19. The semifinals and finals will be played Aug. 20, starting at 7 p.m. The teams, prior to the confirmation of Sinner and Siniaková's replacement, are as follows:

DIRECT ENTRIES

Jessica Pegula / Jack Draper
Iga Świątek / Casper Ruud
Elena Rybakina / Taylor Fritz
Amanda Anisimova / Holger Rune
Belinda Bencic / Alexander Zverev
Mirra Andreeva / Daniil Medvedev
Madison Keys / Frances Tiafoe
Karolina Muchová / Andrey Rublev
Danielle Collins / Christian Harrison

WILD CARDS

Emma Raducanu / Carlos Alcaraz
Olga Danilović / Novak Djokovic
Taylor Townsend / Ben Shelton
Sara Errani / Andrea Vavassori
Venus Williams / Reilly Opelka
Naomi Osaka / Gael Monfils
Caty McNally / Lorenzo Musetti

Analysis from Charlie Eccleshare, tennis writer

In Jannik Sinner and Kateřina Siniaková, the U.S. Open had unwittingly stumbled upon a fascinating mixed doubles pairing. How would the men's world No. 1 in singles mesh with arguably the world's greatest active doubles player, and holder of 11 Grand Slam titles across the women's and mixed disciplines?

Advertisement

Sinner was originally paired with WTA singles world No. 11 Emma Navarro, but, having struggled for form of late, she pulled out of the event to play the Monterrey Open to try and get some matches in ahead of the U.S. Open.

Sinner's withdrawal, and the end of his partnership with Siniaková before it had begun, is perhaps a fitting conclusion to his involvement in the competition. When Sinner was asked at Wimbledon about how his partnership with Navarro had come about, he could have tried to play it straight and trot out some line like: “Yeah, look, I've always admired Emma as a player and I really can't wait to play the mixed doubles event with her in New York.”

Instead he started laughing and told the truth: “It was very unexpected, to be honest. I just met her yesterday for the first time. We never talked. We never texted to each other.” He explained that with other pairs partnered up, the U.S. Open had suggested her as one of a few options.

Fast forward nearly two months, and Sinner's withdrawal is not a major surprise. Especially with tennis' scheduling being such that the mixed doubles event begins less than 24 hours after the Cincinnati Open final.

Now the U.S. Open has been left to scramble for a replacement for Sinner, and has lost arguably its most interesting pair in the process. There was always likely to be a degree of chopping and changing, and some has happened already with other partnerships, but this will no doubt provide more fuel for those who are sceptical about the seriousness of this event.

An illness caused top-ranked men's player Jannik Sinner to retire from the Cincinnati Open final against his rival Carlos Alcaraz on Monday after just 23 minutes of tennis. 

He was expected to then travel to New York and play alongside 11-time Grand Slam doubles champion Katerina Siniakova — most recently in the 2025 Wimbledon mixed doubles — in the first round of the new-look 2025 U.S. Open mixed doubles.

With less than five hours to go to his match's 3:00 pm ET start time, Sinner officially backed out. Alcaraz, meanwhile, still plans to play alongside his partner, Emma Raducanu.

Americans Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison were named as Sinner's and Siniakova's replacements and will face Belinda Bencic and Alexander Zverev instead.

Eurosport confirmed that Sinner was battling a 100.4 degree Fahrenheit fever entering Monday's final — the combined high temperatures in Cincinnati certainly didn't help.

After retiring, the Italian profusely apologized to the fans in attendance. "I'm super sorry to disappoint you. From yesterday, I didn't feel great. I thought I would improve, but it came up worse," Sinner said in his post-match interview.



"I tried to come out, to make it at least a small match, but I couldn't handle more....I am very sorry for all of you. I know that maybe some of you, on a Monday, you had to work or do something else, so I'm really sorry."

Sinner, a four-time Grand Slam champion in singles before the age of 23, doesn't quite boast the same resume in doubles. He owns a 3-2 doubles record in the Davis Cup and has one ATP 250 title: the 2021 Atlanta Open with doubles-specialist Reilly Opelka (playing the 2025 US Open with Venus Williams).

Siniakova, meanwhile, is one of the most accomplished doubles players of her generation. The Czech 29-year-old has 10 Grand Slam women's doubles wins and expanded her portfolio to mixed doubles in the last year, winning both the 2024 Olympic gold and Wimbledon in 2025.

Collins, one of the replacements, has career-best rankings of No. 7 in singles and No. 79 in doubles. She reached the 2022 Wimbledon women's doubles semifinals.

DON'T MISS: 

Harrison, her partner, is a much more accomplished doubles player. He reached the semifinals at the 2025 French Open and owns two ATP Tour doubles titles. His best results in mixed doubles came at the 2018 U.S. Open, when he also reached the semifinals.

The scheduling of the Cincinnati Open final on Monday has caused chaos ahead of the start of the new-look US Open mixed doubles event 

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Jannik Sinner has pulled out of the US Open mixed doubles event after struggling with illness and retiring from his Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz after just five games on Monday. 

The World No 1 said he started to feel ill on Sunday and through the night but thought he would have recovered to face Alcaraz in the final, although his condition worsened and he retired trailing 5-0 in the first set. 

“Yesterday I didn't feel great and I'm really sorry to disappoint you,” Sinner said in a post on social media. “Thank you so much to everyone supporting me on-site and from home, your support means the world. 

“Congrats to Carlos Alcaraz and his team, you're having an incredible season and I wish you all the best for what's ahead. Now it's time to rest a couple of days before getting back to work.” 

Sinner had only confirmed his place in the new-look US Open mixed doubles event, where he was set to partner doubles specialist Katerina Siniakova, earlier on Monday - ahead of the afternoon Cincinnati Open final. 

Even if Sinner had been fit, the scheduling left a short turnaround before the start of the 16-team mixed doubles tournament in New York on Tuesday, where Sinner and Siniakova were drawn to play Alexander Zverev and Belinda Bencic. 

Sinner and Siniakova have been replaced by the American duo of Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison, after the US Open said Sinner and Siniakova's place in the draw “will be filled by an alternate team with the highest combined singles ranking” that signed up to play. 

Sinner, 24, had suggested he would not play in the new mixed doubles event shortly after retiring from the Cincinnati Open final, telling the ATP that he was turning his focus to a “couple of days of recovery” before the start of the singles competition. 

As Alcaraz's Cincinnati Open final lasted just 24 minutes, the Spaniard is set to be fresh to partner Emma Raducanu in their opening match against British men's No 1 Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula, who are the top seeds in the draw based on combined singles ranking. 

And Iga Swiatek, who defeated Jasmine Paolini in the women's Cincinnati Open final on Monday evening, will also play in the mixed doubles with Casper Ruud after travelling to New York on the same plane as Alcaraz and arriving in time to compete. 

Alcaraz and Raducanu, who are both previous US Open champions, are one of the star-studded singles players to be paired together for the controversially revamped event, which carries $1m in prize money. 

Sinner was partnered with Siniakova after top-10 player Emma Navarro decided to enter another warm-up event in singles before the start of the US Open main draw on Sunday. 

A greater concern for Sinner will be whether the 24-year-old is fit to start his US Open singles campaign in Flushing Meadows, but the defending champion did allay fears that he had picked up an injury before the grand slam by confirming he had been struck down by illness.

“Usually I start with the opponent but today I have to start with you guys [the crowd],” Sinner said during the peculiar trophy ceremony, as Alcaraz was crowned the champion in strange scenes in Cincinnati.

“I'm super super sorry to disappoint you. From yesterday I didn't feel great. I thought I would improve during the night. It came up worse. I tried to come out and make it at least a small match but I couldn't handle more. I'm very very sorry for all of you. I know some of you on Monday maybe had to work or do something else, so I'm very, very sorry.”

NWSL

When Trinity Rodman thundered in that stoppage-time winner for the Washington Spirit against the Portland Thorns in the NWSL on Aug. 3, it was a comeback goal celebrated throughout the 16,000-strong crowd at Audi Field. A small corner of Wimbledon, south London, also rejoiced in that moment.

The U.S. women's national team forward made a successful return to football after a four-month absence due to a back injury she says might never fully heal. After her volley earned the Spirit a 2-1 victory, the 23-year-old was overcome with emotion, having thought she might not get to experience that feeling again.

“That was just the hardest thing I've had to go through, injury and everything,” Rodman told ESPN. “Being back, and being at the home stadium with the crowd behind me, scoring a goal like that — you saw I buried that. I wasn't going to miss it.”

Thousands of miles away at Goals Wimbledon, a soccer centre that rents out five-a-side pitches for personal use, they feel like a small but proud part of Rodman's comeback trail.

At the end of June, Rodman, an Olympic champion in France last summer, was in England supporting her boyfriend, No. 6 world-ranked professional tennis player Ben Shelton, as he reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon. Fresh from being the face of Adidas' advertising campaign for the F50 Sparkfusion women's football boots, Rodman walked up to the Goals reception desk and asked manager Barry Horsnell if she could hire one of its (artificial turf) pitches.

Horsnell didn't know who this person was at first, but sensed she was famous. Her American accent, along with the fact she had turned up with a coach — Josh Angulo, the Spirit's team chiropractor, who was accompanying her in Europe — piqued his interest.

“I'm nosy, so I'll just ask (people) questions,” Horsnell tells The Athletic. “She said she was here for the tennis, with her other half playing at Wimbledon.

“I said: ‘I really want to pretend that I know who you are, but I don't'. She just laughed and was so nice about it.”

Rodman began training on pitch No. 11 — a seven-a-side field at the far end of the facility called Estadio Centenario, after the national stadium of Uruguay. As she ran through drills for an hour and a half, back in the office, Horsnell typed Rodman's name into Google and was blown away by her level of stardom. Rodman rented the pitch that day for £6 (just over $8) per hour per person. It would be the last time she would have to do so.

Horsnell refused to charge them on later visits but did ask one thing in return — if fans spotted Rodman training on his pitches, which sit next to a golf driving range and a motorcycle-riding school, would she be OK with posing for photographs with them? Rodman kindly agreed, and it wasn't long before locals spotted her being put through her paces and finding the top corner on repeat during shooting practice.

Sisters Sophie and Emily Day train at the centre. Sophie is 13 and plays as a centre-back for Brighton & Hove Albion's academy, a 90-minute drive to the south, and Emily, 10, is in west London club Chelsea's youth pathway.

“There are so many good female role models for girls, and so much more opportunity now as well,” their father, Richard, says, after finding out Rodman trained here. “Opportunities which just didn't exist. And when you listen to the players that are coming towards the ends of their careers, the opportunities they're seeing for girls that are going into the game versus what they had – but they've paved the way for it.”

The clientele of Goals Wimbledon are accustomed to celebrity visitors. Nigel James, father of England and Chelsea stars Lauren and Reece James, runs his youth academy from there, with plenty of appearances from his daughter and son over the years.

“There was a girl training with Nigel James Elite Coaching; she was doing a one-to-one session with a coach. I watched Trinity walk out and I thought: ‘I wonder if she'll recognise her',” Horsnell says. “As soon as Trinity walked out, you could just see this girl's eyes light up. She knew straight away who Trinity was, and she couldn't concentrate on her own football for the next 10 minutes.”

But like Horsnell on her first arrival, not everybody recognised Rodman.

Every few minutes, trains speed by behind the center's pitches, running back and forth from the suburbs of New Malden and Raynes Park in the direction of central London's Waterloo station or towns southwest of the city, such as Richmond.

“There were hundreds of people going past, and they wouldn't have realised who was training on that pitch. There were people playing on the other pitches as she walked past that wouldn't have known who she was either,” Horsnell says. “It's mad, isn't it?”

Rodman was in London as Shelton, 22, was defeated by eventual Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals. A month before that, she had been in Paris watching as he reached the fourth round of the French Open, where he was also defeated by the eventual champion, Carlos Alcaraz.

As Shelton won the Canadian Open just over a week ago, Rodman, now back with the Spirit and building up her minutes, watched on television as her partner won his first ATP Masters 1000 title. And before the U.S. Open, which starts in New York this week, she paid a visit to the Cincinnati Masters to watch him win his opening match against Camilo Ugo Carabelli.

Back in Wimbledon, they are still marvelling at the fact that Rodman trained there. Feeling inspired by her visit and England's Lionesses winning a second straight European Championship in Switzerland last month, Horsnell and his colleagues are excited about watching the center's new women's five-a-side league go from strength to strength.

“Even though we only met her a few times over that couple of weeks, it's mad to see her scoring that last-minute goal and feeling more emotionally connected to it than we might have otherwise been,” he says. “You'd be happy for anyone scoring a last-minute goal, but we know what it means to her and are happy we could help play a small part.”

“There was no air of arrogance, and her celebration for that goal was the same. It was so humble, she was just so happy to score it — and that is exactly how she came across. I know now how big a star she is in America and in women's football, but each day that I met her, she was just so normal.”

Horsnell came out of it all with a Rodman-autographed football for his 11-year-old niece.

“I showed her the ball and she didn't know who had signed it. Then I showed her the photo on my phone and she was like, ‘Oh my god! That's Trinity Rodman!'”

Rodman will not be forgotten soon around these parts.

The ATP Tour has witnessed many iconic players retire from tennis in very recent times, one of whom was Andy Murray.

Murray called time on his phenomenal career after the Olympics last summer, having won 46 titles on the ATP Tour.

That includes three Grand Slam titles, with the Scot having also reached number one in the world rankings.

His fellow legend Rafael Nadal also set down his racket last season, while fellow icon Diego Schwartzman retired from tennis earlier in 2025.

Joining him this season have been the likes of veteran players Richard Gasquet, Fabio Fognini and Fernando Verdasco among others.

And they have now been joined in retirement by Kyle Edmund, who has decided to call time on his career aged just 30.

He shared an emotional post on Instagram to announce his decision, with his fellow Briton Murray quick to reply.

The Scot, who like Edmund was once the British number one player, left the comment: “Great stuff Kedders!”

The 30-year-old retires with two ATP Tour titles to his name, having reached a career-high ranking of world number 14.

A post shared by LTA (@lta)

Edmund has since slipped to 420th in the world rankings, but injuries have played a major role in his decline.

And unfortunately they have now also led to his retirement from the sport, in which he turned pro back in 2012.

He met Murray four times during his career, with the Scot winning on three occasions and losing on the other.

Edmund has certainly left a positive mark on the game, as proven by further warm messages he's received since retiring.

Laura Robson wrote: “Happy retirement kedders! Just the beginning,” with her fellow WTA icon Caroline Garcia noting: “Congrats on an amazing effort.”

Heather Watson added: “We love you Ked! You are the best,” while Neal Skupski said: “All the best for the future. Enjoyed sharing the court with you! Can get yourself to Anfield more now.”

Along with his two career titles, which arrived at Antwerp and New York in 2018 and 2020 respectively, Edmund lost the 2018 Marrekech final.

He leaves tennis with 119 wins and 125 losses, with $6,073,157 earned in prize money from singles and doubles.

Updates from the opening day action at Flushing Meadows

Brilliant net-coverage from Vavassori earns a chance to break back immediately at 30-4,0 and when Rublev nets, he and Errani have it. They've by far the most at stake here: this is their bread and butter, the money is much bigger for them, and they're repping for dubs specialists. They're level with Muchova/Rublev at 1-1 in the first.

On Ashe, McNally/Musetti and Swiatek/Ruud are out and knocking up.

We're away again on Armstrong, Rublev raising break point with an overhead then returning hard; Errani moves out of the road but the ball is good, so he and Muchova lead the champs 1-0 with a break.

On Armstrong, Errani/Vavassori and Muchova/Rublev are back with us. This should be a really fun contest.

Swiatek says she's played Ruud in the United Cup so has a good idea of where to be on the court; Ruud notes that Swiatek is on the winning train and he's just jumping on. They'll now share notes on McNally and Musetti, the match due on court in a matter of minutes.

The winners look a good team and meet McNally/Musetti shortly.

Rublev says he doesn't know what he's doing, he's just trying to serve well. Muchova, though, is a good doubles player with the dexterity and power to become an even better one. They're second-favourites for their quarter and rightly so, but they'll give Errani/Vavssori a better game than Rybakina/Fritz did.

Keys holds serve, forcing Swiatek/Ruuud to serve for the match at 4-1 3-2.

That was never really in doubt. Muchova/Rublev meet Errani/Vavassori in the last eight – and in a few minutes' time.

News reaches me that, in the locker room last week, Fritz said there was no chance he'd lose to a doubles player in mixed doubles.

Penny for em, Taylor old mate.

Oh Maddy. Regular readers of this blog will know she's a favourite – Muchova too – and down 15-40, she sends down a double, missing the box by a way on her second go. Swiatek/Ruud lead 4-1 10 while, on Armatrong, Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opelka 4-2 in their second-set breaker, so are three points from victory. As I mentioned earlier, it's $50,000 to show, with $50,000 more on offer for the first-round winners.

Mucholva holds, so we're playing a second-set breaker on Armstrong; Williams/Opelka have to win it to stay in the competition and it's first to seven.

Coach Calv, who as a Wimbledon and Aussie Open winner, knows a thing or 90,423 about doubles, notes that Rybakina/Frtiz didn't even manage a break point against Errani/Vavassori and, with the best will in the world, the former is not renowned for her prowess in that aspect of the game. He also adds that “Vava is a great lad” and it's clear Errani is too.

Venus finds herself serving at 15-30 and when Muchova volleys between her and Opelka, she's down two break points. The first is saved when Rublev sends a forehand wide, the second with an ace, so here comes the deciding point at deuce … Opelka putting away and overhead with typical venom. Muchova will now serve for a breaker.

A terrific forehand from Ruud, looped down the line, raises three set points at 3-1, and an ace means he and Swiatek lead Keys/Tiafoe 1-0; on Armstrong, Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opelka 4-2 3-3.

Opelka holds so he and Venus lead Muchova/Rublev 3-2 having lost set one; Swiatek holds, so she and Ruud lead Keys/Tiafoe 3-0. I love how businesslike the Pole is – there aren't many more focused competitors in any sport.

Up 0-40, Swiatek and Ruud go for the same ball, clashing rackets, and we wind up at deuce, a Tiafoe double handing over the game after all that hard work saving it. The no 3 seeds lead 2-0; Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opela 4-2 1-2 on serve.

A hold apiece opens set two on Armstrong, but Muchova/Rublev look the defter, more natural pair; I'd be surprised if they lost this. On Ashe. Ruud/Swiatek lead Keys/Tiafoe 1-0.

Keys and Tiafoe come out linking arms – they're great mates, which is always nice to see. I've not a clue what to expect from this match, but I'm fascinated to see how Swiatek pulls up having only just won Cincinnati. We're ready to get going, the winners to meet McNally/Musetti.

Two mahoosive Rublev forehands, one cross then a winner down the line, make 30-0, and terrific net-play, from him and Muchova, secure a 4-2 first set.

Opelka holds in short order, meaning Rublev will now serve for the set. He's not often broken, and it seems unlikely the pair he's facing have what it takes to make that happen.

Rublev nets a volley just as he and Muchova take over the rally and face break-back point; Venus nets a return for deuce, but with no advantage, she and Opelka have another shot at it. But they can't take it, Venus butchering her volley, and Muchova/Rublev lead 3-1.

Back on Armstrong, Venus is serving at deuce … and she's broken for 1-2. It's a long way back from here, Muchova and Rublev both reliable servers.

McNally says she got a call from her agent telling her she had 30 seconds to decide whether to play with Musetti; “Er… yes!” was her response.

Musetti explains they spoke this morning, decided which side to play, and McNally is a really good player and he enjoyed seeing her at net. He thinks they've good chemistry on court and is looking forward to playing again. He was really stressed serving out, but hopes he'll be better when they come back in an hour to play their quarter.

Next on Ashe: Swiatek/Ruud (3) v Keys/Tiafoe.

The stadium looks pretty full, now, by the way, which is good news. As on Armstrong, they've seen the better doubles players win.

The winning pair seemed to really enjoy that, and fully deserve their win.

A fine backhand winner from Osaka, monstered inside-out, earns two break-back points … both saved, but there'll be a third with no advantage, that's also match point. And we're away again on Ashe, Williams/Opelka holding for 1-0.

We're still on serve in the second, but McNally/Musetti look the likelier. With no deuces and four-game sets, though, things can turn on almost nothing. More importantly, though, what do we make of Osaka's trainers?

Sadly, I've no better snap for now, but back on court, a Monfils double means she and he are broken; at 5-3 3-2, McNally/Musetti will now serve for the match.

McNally/Musetti seem to really be enjoying themselves and make deuce at 1-0 1-1, but Osaka/Monfils hold to keep their noses in front in set two; on Armstrong, our new teams emerge.

On Ashe, we're 1-1 on set two, McNally/Musetti by one set to love.

Next on Armstrong: Williams/Opelka v Muchová/Rublev.

Updates from the opening day action at Flushing Meadows

Get in touch! You can mail Daniel here

Andreeva/Medvedev make 30-40 on the Djokovic delivery; a second-serve ace down the T averts the immediate danger, but then Medvedev pings a forehand down the middle and between his two opponents to secure the break and a 3-2 lead. The set is on his racket.

Another swift hold on Ashe, Danilovic/Djokovic now up 2-1, whereupon the latter pastes a forehand winner down the line for 0-15. Then, after missing a backhand, the latter does really well at net to make 15-30, and at 30-all, Djokovic lobs Medvedev twice in a row before punishing a further forehand winner down the line for break point. Andfreeva saves it, which takes us to deuce, and from there, Medvedev secures the hold for 2-2. On Armstrong, it's a good start for the new entrants, Collins/Harrison breaking Bencic/Zverev for 2-0; Harrison, a dubs specialist, is showing what that entails.

“Not sure where the Djokovic mixed stat came from,” alerts Alex Hughes. “He withdrew injured before the mixed doubles bronze medal match in Tokyo…”

I guess they may have said at a grand slam and I missed it, watching my other screen.

Reminder: Collins/Harrison are replacing Sinner/Siniakova.

Good net-work from Danilovic has Andreeva flapping, but Medvedev still holds to 15 and we're at 1-1; on Armstrong, the match has just started.

At 40-30 Danilovic nets an overhead, and with Medvedev returning, Djokivics serve is in peril. But he too nets, meaning the Serbian team lead 1-0.

We learn that Djokivic has played one mixed doubles match in his career, 20 years ago. But he's ready to serve here, clad in the kind of sky-blue collared shirt my dad was wearing in 1982.

Our next sets of teams are out. Good.

Townsend thanks the crowd, noting that Shelton brings “a certain energy” from her, before chastising the crowd for being a little dry and asking for more next match. Shelton says it's easy for him, Townsend is the no 1 mixed doubles player in the world so she makes the rules and he's along for the ride.

Shelton, says Townsend, is “the vibe coordinator”, they work well together, and, interjects Shelton, “we're just having fun”.

Next on Amstrong: Collins/Harrison v Bencic/Zverev.

They look a proper partnership.

Next on Ashe: Danilovic/Djokovic v Andreeva/Medvedev

It's now 5-1 on Armstrong; Townsend/Shelton are nearly there.

Draper says it's a pleasure to play with Pegula as it is to face Raducanu and Alcaraz; Pegula thanks the crowd for showing up and creating a fun atmosphere even if it took a couple of miraculous Alcaraz shots to get them going. They plan to hang out and chill during their break.

Townsend/Shelton immediately secure then lose then secure a mini-break; they lead 3-1.

A banger of a point to finish a really fun game, Draper taking charge to eventually punish a forehand winner down the line.

…but a forehand winner from Raducanu saves it, making deuce while, on Armstrong, Rune holds for a second-set breaker.

A terrific shot from Pegula, who spots Alacaraz moving inside so sticks a winner into the tramlines, raises match point…

At 0-15, Alcaraz misses a chance for 0-30, then Draper intercedes at net for 30-15. On Armstrong, by the way, Rune is serving at 2-2 3-4, so to stay in the match; anyone got any spare eyes?

Draper is the best player on Ashe and by far; he and Pegula make 15-30 on the Raducanu serve and he's into net like an assassin to stick away a volley to raise two but really three match points. But the first two are quickly saved, the second with an ace, so here comes the deciding point, Alacaraz doing enough at net to force Pegula to serve for it at 4-2 3-2. On Armstrong, Townsend/Shelton lead 4-2 3-3.

Draper is playing really well and he holds to love; at 4-2 3-1, he and Pegula are a game away. On Armstrong, Anisimova/Rune trail 2-4 2-3, meaning the former must now serve to stay in the match.

Alcaraz hasn't been at it today and is soon down 30-40 on serve, Raducanu butchering an overhead to confirm the break. It's a long way back for them from here, Pegula/Draper up a set and a break at 4-2 2-1. .

Shelton's on one here, ridiculous net-play making 30-15; he and Townsend are having a right laugh out there, quickly securing their gold for 4-1 2-1, as Alcaraz races beyond the sideline to shove a forehand around the net-post with Raducanu having already given up the point. They still trail 40-15, though, and from there Draper sticks away a winner to give he and Pegula a 4-2 1-1 lead.

Rune is forced to deuce on serve and the break-back is immediate, Townsend and Shelton celebrating in grand style. Meantime on Ashe, Raducanu is forced to deuce, Alcaraz commanding at the net to secure their hold for 2-4 1-0.

Draper makes 30-15, then cunningly guides a forehand line with Alcaraz expecting him to go cross, but a netted forehand then makes things tight. And have a look! Alcaraz has been quiet so far, but fine work at the net earns deuce … then he ruins it by putting too much gas on a forehand. The first set goes to Pegula/Draper 4-2 and, while that's going on, Anisimova/Rune break Townsend/Shelton at the first time of asking in the second to trail 2-4 1-0.

And they only need two, Rune volleying long – his hands aren't as hard as Khachanov's but you'd never call them soft – so the Americans lead by a set to love.

Alcaraz holds in short order, so Draper must indeed serve for 1-0, while Townsend/Shelton hold three break and therefore set points over Anisimova/Rune.

Very quickly, it's 2-2 on Armstrong, Rune then finishing a terrific net-exchange for 0-15, as Pegula swats a backhand wide for 30-all and pressure. But then Alcaraz nets a volley he shouldn't and clouts a forehand wide, meaning a 1-3 first-set deficit; if he holds, Draper will have a chance to serve for it. And on Armstrong, Shelton holds for 3-2.

Anisimova/Rune break back immediately to trail Townsend/Shelton 1-2, while Raducanu holds to keep her and Alcaraz in set one – but they'll need to break Pegula next up to have a realistic chance of saving the st.

Quickly, though, a double makes 0-30; Townsend retrieves for 30-all whole Draper holds to give him and Pegula a 2-0 lead over Raducanu/Alcaraz.

Back on Armstrong, Shelton is dominating, rousting a forehand from the back that makes 15-40, and when Rune then goes long, the American pair lead 2-0. The set feels done and if Townsend holds next up, it will be as good as.

Pegula/Draper race to 0-40, which in this format means four break points. But they only need two, Draper hooking a forehand winner to secure an advantage that, in this format, could well prove decisive in the set.

Both matches are under way, Shelton holding in rapid time while Pegula/Draper make 0-30 on the Alcaraz serve.

Tennis great Novak Djokovic once disqualified from the US Open mid-match after a controversial incident with a lineswoman.

On Sunday, the final tennis major of 2025 will get underway as the US Open starts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York.

Several of the biggest names in the sport are set to compete in the tournament, with the likes of Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and former world number one Jack Draper all hoping to take home the trophy.

As it stands, current world no.1 Sinner is the favourite to win the US Open, despite the fact that he recently was forced to pull out of the Cincinatti Open final against Alcaraz due to illness.

But one player who may not be looking forward to the competition is Djokovic, as it may bring up bad memories of him being disqualified back in 2020 following an incident with a lineswoman during his match.

Off the back of his win in the Australian Open earlier that year, Djokovic was the odds-on favourite to win his 18th Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2020.

However, things didn't go to plan for the Serbian player as he was ejected from the tournament in the fourth round after he accidentally hit a line judge in the throat with a ball smacked in anger.

Djokovic was facing opponent Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta in the fourth round of the major but found himself down 6-5 in the first set, leading to him hitting a ball behind him in frustration.

Unfortunately for Djokobic, and the woman involved, the ball hit the lineswoman behind him directly in the throat, causing her to immediately fall to the ground in pain.

Realising what he had done, Djokovic quickly ran over to check on the judge as she received medical attention before being taken off the court, unable to continue her role.

Despite pleading his case, the moment led to Djokovic being disqualified in the match, and therefore eliminated from the tournament, due to a strict rule stated in the ITF's Grand Slam rule book.

It reads: "Players shall not at any time physically abuse any official, opponent, spectator or other person within the precincts of the tournament site...

"The Referee in consultation with the Grand Slam Chief of Supervisors may declare a default for either a single violation of this Code or pursuant to the Point Penalty Schedule set out above."

Shortly after his removal from the competition was announced, Djokovic took to social media to apologise for the lines judge and the US Open for his behaviour, assuring fans it was completely accidental.

Posting on Instagram, he wrote: "This whole situation has left me really sad and empty. I checked on the lines person and the tournament told me that thank God she is feeling ok. I'm extremely sorry to have caused her such stress. So unintended. So wrong.

"I'm not disclosing her name to respect her privacy. As for the disqualification, I need to go back within and work on my disappointment and turn this all into a lesson for my growth and evolution as a player and human being,

"I apologise to the @usopen tournament and everyone associated for my behaviour. I'm very grateful to my team and family for being my rock support, and my fans for always being there with me. Thank you and I'm so sorry."

In this excerpt from his new book Changeover, writer Giri Nathan recalls the very first time Alcaraz and Sinner played each other at the U.S. Open.

I had spent 10 hot, depleting days covering the 2022 U.S.Open, so I made a bad decision. Each morning I'd left my apartment in Brooklyn, taken the subway to Queens, and shuffled down the boardwalk to the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. There I'd spent the next 12 hours hopping from court to court, occasionally ducking indoors to ask a player a question or refill my water bottle, absorbing as much of the tennis from as close a vantage point as I could. After the matches were over, I'd taken the subway home, stayed up until five a.m. tapping out a dispatch, and repeated the cycle. It sounds pathetic to be complaining about the weather when I was not the one swinging a racquet on court, but rather the one seated nearby scrawling in a notebook—and it is a bit pathetic—but by the second week I'd tired of navigating the sweaty throngs, of lurching awake from a sun-induced micro-nap in the stands. So on this particular evening of September 7, at roughly eight thirty p.m., with one men's quarterfinal still to come, I decided I'd watch from the comfort of my own sofa.

That was how I managed to miss out on the match between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, and with it, a chance to peer into an ecstatic future. There was Alcaraz, happy eyes sunk deep under a heavy brow, his body twitchy and muscled like a sprinter. There was Sinner, thin and laconic, pale as marble, flame-red curls trapped under a hat. I knew they were good but hadn't realized they could do this. I streamed the opening rallies on my phone, sitting on the 7 train, and knew in my gut I'd made a dire error. When I got home, I watched them fight until 2:50 a.m., still stabbing words of bafflement into my notebook as the match ended. Besides sleep, what could you do well, or do at all, for five hours and 15 minutes? How about the opposite of sleep: intermittent sprinting in every direction, batting a small projectile at 125 mph, tracking a projectile coming at you at 125 mph, making constant risk-reward calculations, clean emotional resets, energy and pain management decisions.

All this was done in solitude. When Alcaraz once looked in desperation to his coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, after flubbing a pivotal point, he received a chilly half smile in return. He was then 19 years old and Sinner was 21. At ages when many people can't be trusted with basic self-preservation, these two produced tennis of the highest caliber, rallies so charismatic and coruscating that no other pair of players on tour could have replicated them. I saw Alcaraz leap midair to swat a shot behind-the-back, finding a solution where none existed. I saw Sinner strike the hardest backhands in the world, arrive within a single point of victory, and let his chance slip away. Alcaraz prevailed and went on to win the whole Open.

Reality got lazy with its metaphors: My pen ran out of ink. I'd gotten it only a month earlier. But it was forced to document every highlight, tactic, scoreline, atmospheric detail, and cathartic expletive for these five sets, and even then it caught only a fraction. The pen surrendered its innards and sputtered into retirement. I couldn't blame it. I was tempted to do the same—close my eyes, cross my arms like a mummy, and rest forever—after witnessing what Alcaraz and Sinner had accomplished in that same time span. I no longer feared the future, just my obsolescence in it. It was a smothering counterexample to anyone fussing about what tennis could even be after the old gods faded away. New gods take their place.

Trapped in the heat of that match, I saw only what Alcaraz and Sinner had in common, but in the following months I came to see just how vividly they diverged. The former ran hot and the latter lived in permafrost. One craved a crowd and the other sought privacy. With a racquet, Carlos chased sudden novelty, while Jannik aspired to calm regularity. Tennis was a passion for Carlos and a religion for Jannik, as the writer Owen Lewis put it to me. Like all the richest rivalries before them, each prodigy possessed some virtue absent in the other one; somehow each one appeared to be the antidote to the other's style of play. I detected more and more of these contrasts with every match and every passing season, as they chased not just historical records, but one another.

That 2022 U.S. Open quarterfinal was good enough to generate its own 45-minute highlight reel, which I watch from time to time. They should screen it in movie theaters. It was a vision from some sharp and fearsome new era that our eyes had not yet adjusted to. Now, at the start of 2025, I can see it more clearly. And I have written Changeover to document that new era in its earliest phase, as a primer for the tennis fans who either missed it firsthand or simply want to relive it someday.

As my penance for missing that battle, the inception of a great rivalry, I am giving you this whole book. This time my pen won't run out.

Iga Swiatek asked a camera operator to stop filming her during her Cincinnati Open semi-final match against Elena Rybakina. Despite the minor distraction, Swiatek went on to secure a comfortable victory in just over an hour and 38 minutes, earning her place in the final against Jasmine Paolini.

Swiatek had to dig deep in the first set, securing a 7-5 win that put her one step closer to the final. The 24-year-old then sealed the deal with a 6-3 victory in the second set, in her quest for the top spot at the WTA 1000 event.

Throughout the match, Swiatek remained composed, even when asking a camera operator to stop filming her at the end of the first set. The camera had this year's Wimbledon champion to her bench to capture her reactions after the intense set.

However, after letting out a sigh of relief and taking off her cap, Swiatek gestured to the camera operator, indicating that she didn't want to be filmed while preparing to change her outfit. A quick wag of her finger emphasised her point.

The camera cut away as Swiatek prepared to change her top, a common practice among players between sets to stay comfortable. This brief interaction didn't affect the eventual winner's focus, and she went on to reach her first Cincinnati final, reports the Express.

Following her victory, Swiatek said: "At the beginning, the level was pretty crazy. We played so fast that sometimes we couldn't run to the second ball.

"I was there to play with intensity and good quality. I'm super happy with the performance.

"Anyone in the final is going to be super tough, so I have to think tactically. I will focus on myself and do what I've been doing, because for sure I feel like there's been progress at this tournament.

"I just want to continue that, no matter what the result is. I feel the love here, it's a great place to be.

"People of Cincinnati are so nice, everywhere we go, even though we're here to play, we feel like we can have peace and just relax when off the court. So thank you guys for coming out, rooting for us and see you tomorrow."#

Swiatek was able to clinch her first-ever win at the Cincinnati Open on Monday following a thrilling final with Paolini. In that fixture, she took the opening game 7-5, before clinching the title with a 6-4 win in the second.

            The thought of the top men's and women's singles players teaming up is one that has often intrigued tennis fans around the world.
    


            It's part of the reason the mixed doubles event sometimes draws so much interest during the Olympics, with Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff and Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva forming two star-studded pairings at Paris 2024.
    


            It is also one of the few opportunities men and women have to directly compete against each other in professional sports.
    


            Now, the US Open – the fourth and final grand slam of the season – is aiming to cash in on that intrigue with a revamped version of the mixed doubles.
    


            Rather than having the event run concurrently with the singles and doubles, as is traditionally the case at grand slams, a shortened edition will now take place on the Tuesday and Wednesday of the US Open's ‘Fan Week' that precedes the start of the main draw, which kicks off next week.
    


            Sixteen pairs will take part in a shortened format that is best of three sets, but each set is only the first to four games and there will be no advantage after deuce, with the winner of the next point winning the game. There will also be a 10-point tie break instead of a full third set.
    


            “It's a radical change by the US Open,” Bob Bryan – one half of identical twin duo the Bryan Brothers, the most successful men's doubles pairing in tennis history – told CNN Sports' Don Riddell.
    


            “It'll be sold out in Arthur Ashe Stadium, all the stars, the single stars are playing it. The downside is that the doubles players won't get a shot to play it or to defend their title or whatever, but the prize money is a big increase.”
    


            Prize money for the winning pair this year is $1 million, a mammoth increase of $800,000 – or five times more – from 2024.
    


            And the US Open's attempt to lure big names to take part has clearly worked.
    


            Five-time grand slam singles champion Carlos Alcaraz teaming up with Emma Raducanu and current Wimbledon champion Iga Świątek joining forces with Casper Ruud, what's not to like?
    


            Well, quite a lot if you ask some doubles specialists.
    


            Kristina Mladenovic, a former world No. 1 in doubles and nine-time grand slam winner across doubles and mixed doubles, said it's “embarrassing” hearing the players saying they are “going to have fun” at the event as they prepare for the main singles draw.
    


            “A grand slam is neither preparation nor fun,” she told Eurosport. “It's years of sacrifice. When you're young, you dream of winning one, even in doubles.
    


            “In terms of business strategy, it's a brilliant idea … but from a sporting point of view, it's problematic because it touches on the essence of tennis. A grand slam is a competition steeped in history, in singles and doubles.
    


            “There's no problem putting on such an event, but above all, don't call it a grand slam.”
    


            At the time of the announcement, defending US Open mixed doubles champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori called the format change a “profound injustice,” though they have since been given a wild card to defend their 2024 title.
    


Jan Zielinski, mixed doubles champion at the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2024, said there had been “no communication with players” from the organizers about the change.
    


            Organizers have already confirmed that the event, described as a “pseudo-exhibition” by Errani and Vavassori, will count as an official grand slam.
    


            So not only have the doubles specialists been denied the opportunity to compete for potentially career-changing prize money, they have also been denied the chance to challenge for another grand slam.
    


            CNN Sports has reached out to the United States Tennis Association (USTA) for comment.
    


            Mike Bryan, Bob's twin, says he understands players' frustrations.
    


            “I mean, if we were on tour and we were left out of the possibility of winning a grand slam in mixed doubles, we'd probably be upset,” he told CNN Sports. “Now that we're retired, we see it from a greater perspective of the US Open is a business.
    


            “But you don't want it to cheapen a grand slam title. We'll see. Maybe, maybe it won't. Maybe, it'll make it even bigger.”
    


            But being great singles players doesn't automatically mean two stars will make a good doubles pairing. Court positioning, tactics and timing are vastly different between the two formats, with doubles specialists boasting more skills at the net than many top singles players.
    


            Currently, Andreeva and Jasmine Paolini the only two players across the men's and women's tours to be ranked inside the top 15 in both singles and doubles, though Coco Gauff has also previously been ranked inside the world's top three in the two formats (No. 2 in singles and No. 1 in doubles).
    


            It is common for the doubles and mixed events to draw smaller crowds during grand slams than the singles and Mike Bryan says it was perhaps in danger of becoming an “afterthought” at the US Open.
    


            “As players that play doubles, we're just hoping that kind of trickles down to the popularity of the doubles game itself, which I think it will,” Bob added. “So we're excited to see how it goes.
    


            “Let's see if the other grand slams take a look at it and are interested in making the same change, but it's a kind of a groundbreaking decision and it could revolutionize mixed doubles for years to come.”

Noisy night matches

New York's spectators don't like to watch games in silence and the courts more often resemble a football stadium.

The No. 3 seed hit eight aces and at least that many service winners to defeat Jasmine Paolini.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 19, 2025 copy_link

MASON, OH—“I'm always this kind of player who needs to see the proof,” Iga Swiatek said last week, when she was in the middle of her Cincinnati Open campaign. “If the serves are actually going to go in, I'll be convinced.”Swiatek was talking about the hopes and dreams that Wim Fissette, her coach, had for her serve when they began their partnership last fall. At first, his ambitions seemed a little far-fetched to her.“When I started working with Wim, I didn't believe that I can serve 185 [kilometers per hour] and 180 consistently. So I think he helped me with reaching this higher speed…I just kind of needed to believe it.”There's no way for Iga, or anyone else, to doubt her serving potential any longer. Especially not after her 7-5, 6-4 win over Jasmine Paolini in the final here on Monday evening. Time after time, often at the most opportune moments, Swiatek threw down serves in the 110- to 115-m.p.h. range. That's right around the 185 k.p.h. mark that Fissette envisioned for her.

The result is that Swiatek has turned her career upside down in 2025. The decade's greatest dirt-baller didn't win anything during the clay swing, but since then she has turned around and claimed her first titles at two of the sport's most important tournaments, Wimbledon, on grass, and Cincinnati, on quick hard courts. They're two events that she may have doubted she would ever conquer. In the past, the slow-court-loving Swiatek couldn't find her bearings on their slick surfaces.After her performance on Monday, we may have to ask: Is the Queen of Clay turning into a big-serving fast-courter?She hit eight aces and at least that many service winners against Paolini. Just as important was when she found them. Down 2-3 in the first set, she came up with two unreturnable serves to hold. Up 4-3, she fired two aces. And at 6-5, she closed the set with three service winners and an ace. There was more of the same in the second set. Serving at 4-3, in what turned out to be the most crucial game of the match, she fended off a break point with a service winner and held with an ace. And she ended the match in fitting fashion, with an ace out wide.

Yet Swiatek, ever the process-oriented perfectionist, wasn't entirely thrilled with her serving night. And it's true that she committed seven double faults, and made just 57 percent of her first serves.“I couldn't even toss well,” she told Tennis Channel with a laugh. “It was a love-hate relationship [with her serve] today.”“At the end,” she finally had to allow, “the serve helped me.”With any shot, there will be trade-offs between power and control. If you're getting more free points with the serve, you may be willing to live with more double faults. With Swiatek, the more aggressive she has been with that shot, the more attack-minded she has been, and the more success she has had.“Maybe I wasn't committing to my serve for some part of the season,” she said of her early-2025 troubles.Now, as the final Grand Slam of the year approaches, she's fully committed to what she, Fissette, and her psychologist, Daria Abramowicz, have built. When the last point was over, Swiatek looked back at her team and pointed to her head. She was happy that she hadn't gotten negative when the match tightened.

“I was focusing on the right things,” Swiatek said. “Maybe not everything was perfect. Mentally I was there to just play the best tennis that was possible at that moment.”“Thank you for forcing me to become a better player,” Swiatek said to Fissette afterward. “And to learn how to play on these surfaces.”Now she has all the proof she needs, in the form of the winner's trophy, that his ambitions for her hadn't been delusional after all.With the title, Swiatek moves from No. 3 to No. 2 in the rankings, as well as in the seedings at the US Open—that means no potential semifinal with No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.Speaking of Sabalenka, can we say that Swiatek has also overtaken her as the favorite at the Open, and the favorite to reclaim the year-end No. 1 ranking that she surrendered to her in 2024? In the past, the late-season schedule—which is hard courts only the rest of the way—might have made that a long shot. Now it might be exactly what she wants.

No. 1 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas is playing at ATP Winston-Salem for the first time and looking for some last-minute momentum before the US Open. In the Greeks' current form, not much is a certainty, and Bu Yunchaokete will be hungry for that big win. Can the biggest star of the tournament survive this early test? Who do you think will prevail?

Head-to-head: First meeting

That Bordeaux Challenger title in May is currently keeping Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard's stocks relatively high; otherwise, his ranking would be starting to crash by now (it still might if he can't do anything in Basel title defense). On the other hand, Pedro Martinez mostly plays well on hard courts when he's in good form, and that's not the case at the moment. Mpetshi Perricard is not reliable, but if he's going to start winning again, then this is an opportunity he's got to take.
Prediction: Mpetshi Perricard in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

Mariano Navone isn't picking up hard-court wins on the ATP Tour that often, but a fortunate opening-round draw allowed him to set up a meeting with Marcos Giron here. The American is coming off a disappointing hard-court swing with three consecutive losses in Washington, Toronto, and Cincinnati, which prompted him to seek a last-minute wildcard into Winston-Salem. He needs more time on court, and he might get it here, as Navone is not quite as comfortable on this surface and struggles to convert attacking positions.
Prediction: Giron in 2

Head-to-head: O'Connell 1-0

Recent months have been particularly challenging for Christopher O'Connell, who has been dealing with multiple injuries. Even when he earned a couple of wins in Toronto, it was instantly followed by a withdrawal. 2017 champion Roberto Bautista Agut might be close to wrapping up his career by now, but he's still competitive on the tour. The 37-year-old has plenty left to give and seems like the favorite here, considering O'Connell's form this year.
Prediction: Bautista Agut in 2

Head-to-head: 1-1

Aleksandar Kovacevic had a painful summer on natural surfaces, but it didn't take him long to start performing better once he was back on hard courts. The American lost to Miomir Kecmanovic in Miami earlier this year when he was coming off the Cap Cana title. It's a tough matchup against Kecmanovic, who tends to be solid, but the No. 13 seed hasn't exactly been setting the world on fire. With a match to adjust to these conditions, Kovacevic could be perceived as a tiny favorite here.
Prediction: Kovacevic in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

The drop-off of Stefanos Tsitsipas is an interesting tale, mostly of struggling to fix his weaknesses and juggling between the influence of his father and looking for a world-class coach. The Greek is back with his dad now and thinks this will be the best way forward. Perhaps it will, but it might take him some time to start getting results again. Some rhythm just before the US Open can be helpful, and he's still the better player in this match against Bu Yunchaokete. Just remember, nothing is certain with Tsitsipas right now.
Prediction: Tsitsipas in 3

Shooting begins later this month with two actors from the filmmaker's 'Rebel Moon' movies.

Zack Snyder is finally tackling his passion project, and there is not a single cape, zombie or rebellious moon in sight.


	Starting later this month, Snyder will begin filming The Last Photograph, a drama that he originated and has been developing since the mid-2000s.




	Stuart Martin and Fra Free, both of whom appeared in Snyder's Rebel Moon movies, will star in the feature, an indie whose budget will be significantly lower than many of the epics Snyder has captained before.

					 Zack Snyder to Direct 'Brawler' for UFC		
			









	Snyder is producing with creative partner and wife Deborah Snyder and Wesley Coller via their Stone Quarry banner. Also producing will be Gianni Nunnari and his Hollywood Gang Productions company.

	The project, a war drama, will shoot in several locales around the globe, including Colombia, Iceland and Los Angeles. 


	Local companies will assist in producing in the film's the far-flung locations. Executive producers include the Spanish company Mediaset España, through its film production arm Telecinco Cinema, as well as William Doyle and Columbia's Jaguar Bite, which is run by  Juan Pablo Solano and Simon Beltran. True North serves as the production service company in Iceland. 


Photograph is qualifying for Colombia's CINA incentive (Audiovisual Investment Certificate), which is a tax discount equivalent to 35 percent of the expenditure on audiovisual services in the country. 

	











	Snyder also has his composers lined up as well: Hans Zimmer, Steven Doar and Omer Benyamin. 


	Longtime Snyder colleague Kurt Johnstad wrote the script after working with Snyder on 300 and Rebel Moon. It is based on a story from Snyder.


	The story, according to the producers, is thus: “An ex-DEA operative must return to the mountains of South America in an effort to find his missing niece and nephew, following the brutal murders of their diplomat parents. Enlisting the help of a washed-up junkie war photographer, the only person to have seen the face of the killers, he sets out, determined to find the children and the truth, but soon learns he must also face the ghosts of his past. Their journey into the unknown takes them further and further away from civilization, bringing into question everything they believe, while slowly eroding the distinction between real and surreal.”


	The project has gone under some changes during its 20 years or so in development. For one, the setting used to be Afghanistan and centered on a war correspondent being the lone survivor of an attack on a group of Americans. In the early 2010s, Christian Bale and Sean Penn were attached to star, before Snyder took a detour into his DC movies.


	“The idea of taking camera in hand and simply making a movie in an intimate way is very appealing to me,” Snyder said in a statement provided to The Hollywood Reporter. “The Last Photograph is a meditation of life and death, embodying some of the trials that I have experienced in my own life and the exploration of those ideas through image making.”

	











	Snyder has several movie projects in development, among them an MMA slugfest titled Brawler and an action thriller centered around the LAPD.

	“The idea of taking camera in hand and simply making a movie in an intimate way is very appealing to me,” said Snyder. “The Last Photograph is a meditation of life and death, embodying some of the trials that I have experienced in my own life and the exploration of those ideas through image making.”


	The project has received approval to obtain the CINA incentive (Audiovisual Investment Certificate), granted by the Colombian government and administered by Proimágenes Colombia: a tax discount equivalent to 35% of the expenditure on audiovisual services in the country.


	The story follows an ex-DEA operative who must return to the mountains of South America in an effort to find his missing niece and nephew, following the brutal murders of their diplomat parents. Enlisting the help of a washed-up junkie war photographer, the only person to have seen the face of the killers, he sets out, determined to find the children and the truth, but soon learns he must also face the ghosts of his past. Their journey into the unknown takes them farther and farther away from civilization, bringing into question everything they believe, while slowly eroding the distinction between real and surreal.

	











	Snyder has long wanted to make The Last Photograph, but his busy schedule directing big-budget tentpoles has always led to having table the film. Recently, he not only saw a window to fit the film in before focusing on another large production and also had the actors he wanted to star in it after the three had a strong bond working on Rebel Moon together. Once the financing was in place, pre-production was off to the races, and Snyder officially was underway. He is repped by CAA and Sloane Offer Weber & Dern.


	Martin's star has been on the rise for some time with not only key roles in Snyder's two Rebel Moon pics but the Snyder-produced heist thriller Army of Thieves. On the TV side, Martin has the Channel 4 series In Flight. He is repped by UTA, Independent Talent Group, Untitled Entertainment and Sloane Offer Weber Dern.


	Besides the Rebel Moon films, Fee most recently was seen in the Apple TV+ series Prime Target and also had a role in the Marvel series Hawkeye. He is repped by Paradigm Talent Agency, 42, Untitled Entertainment and Goodman Genow Schenkman.

In this week's Legal Beat newsletter, Diddy wins another lawsuit, Young Thug takes his property back, federal regulators sue bot scalpers and much more.

THE BIG STORY: Six weeks after Sean “Diddy” Combs was largely acquitted on federal criminal charges, he won another court victory dismissing most of a $60 million civil sexual assault lawsuit filed by “Making the Band 2” contestant Sara Rivers.


	Rivers, who became a member of hip-hop group Da Band, sued Combs earlier this year – accusing him of sexually harassing and groping her during the filming of the 2000s MTV reality show. But a federal judge last week dismissed 21 of the 22 counts in her lawsuit, including racketeering, assault and battery, forced labor, and false imprisonment.

	Even after his recent courtroom wins, Diddy is hardly out of the woods. He's still facing dozens of other civil lawsuits from other alleged victims, accusing him of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and various other forms of sexual abuse. And he's still going to be sentenced in October on the lesser criminal charges on which he was convicted – counts that could still send him to prison for years. Stay tuned.

CARDI COPYRIGHT CLASH – A pair of music producers suing Cardi B for copyright infringement over “Enough (Miami)” demanded an injunction that would prohibit the superstar from streaming or otherwise monetizing the track as the litigation moves forward. That includes barring her from putting the song on Am I the Drama?, her long-awaited sophomore album due Sept. 19 via Atlantic Records.


BOT CRACKDOWN – The Federal Trade Commission launched a crackdown on alleged scalpers, filing a lawsuit accusing ticket broker Key Investment Group of using “illegal means” to purchase more than 379,000 event tickets on Ticketmaster and then re-selling them at massively-inflated prices. More than 2,000 of those tickets were allegedly for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour – the poster child for the problem of bot-scalpers and eye-watering secondary prices.


FORFEITURE FIGHT – Young Thug won a court ruling ordering the return of property seized by law enforcement during his Atlanta gang trial, including nearly $150,000 in cash, several cars and numerous pieces of jewelry. The decision – the judge said prosecutors missed key deadlines to litigate the case – came a little under a year after Thug's stunning release from jail after pleading guilty in the RICO case.


CARTEL SENTENCING – Music executive Ángel Del Villar was sentenced to 48 months (4 years) in prison following his conviction on felony charges of doing business with a concert promoter linked to Mexican drug cartels. Prosecutors alleged that Del Villar repeatedly arranged concerts with Jesus Pérez Alvear, a promoter with ties to Mexican cartels – even though he knew he had been sanctioned by federal authorities.


TORY'S APPEAL – Attorneys for Tory Lanez (Daystar Peterson) went before a California appeals court for a crucial hearing in his efforts to overturn his convictions for shooting Megan Thee Stallion. They told the panel that Lanez's trial was “riddled with errors,” including misleading statements about DNA evidence and a key witness they were not allowed to properly cross examine. But the government was unconcerned, calling some of Lanez's arguments non-sensical: “The evidence in this case was compelling.”


DISCOVERY DRAMA – Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge fired back at Drake's demand to read his emails amid the ongoing defamation lawsuit over the Kendrick Lamar diss track “Not Like Us,” calling the request “farcical” and “ridiculous.” He told a judge that it “makes no sense whatsoever” that the boss of the world's largest music company would play a role in the release of a single song and that Drake was trying to “waste my and UMG's time.”


UNSURPRISING DIVORCE – Kate Bowman, the wife of founding Maroon 5 bassist Mickey Madden, filed for divorce, just two weeks after she sought a restraining order in which she accused the musician of beating her during a confrontation about disturbing and sexual texts he'd sent to teenage girls. Seeking spousal support and a separation of assets, Bowman cited “irreconcilable differences” with Madden as the cause for the split.


DYLAN'S REVENGE – Bob Dylan won legal penalties at a federal appeals court against two lawyers who filed — and then quickly dropped — a lawsuit accusing the icon of sexually abusing a child in the 1960s. seeking the sanctions against the duo (Daniel W. Isaacs and Peter J. Gleason), Dylan's lawyers said they made “heinous and false allegations” without sufficient vetting and then repeatedly violated a court order by failing to get their client to turn over key evidence.


UGLY ACCUSATIONS – Priscilla Presley's former business partners (Brigitte Kruse and Kevin Fialko) fired back at her recent allegations of elder abuse against them, filing a countersuit that included the shocking accusation that Elvis Presley's widow “pulled the plug” on Lisa Marie Presley against her late daughter's wishes. Priscilla's attorney — veteran entertainment lawyer Martin Singer — quickly called the case a “disgusting publicity stunt” and “one of the most shameful, ridiculous, salacious, and meritless lawsuits I have seen in my practice.”


DEFAULT JUDGMENT – Jimmie Allen was judged liable for sexually assaulting and secretly filming a woman in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2022. Allen has denied those accusations, but a judge ruled that he had forfeited his right to defend himself by flouting multiple court-imposed deadlines and orders in the lawsuit. The case is one of two civil sexual assault lawsuits brought against Allen in 2023, derailing the singer's promising career; the first was settled in 2024.


GEFFEN RESPONDS – Music and film mogul David Geffen filed his first response to a bombshell abuse lawsuit from his estranged husband Donovan Michaels, calling them “a ludicrous and contrived attempt to humiliate Geffen in the court of public opinion and extract an out-of-court settlement.” The case from Michaels, a former exotic dancer 50 years Geffen's junior, claimed that the Hollywood powerhouse treated him as a “sexual commodity” for years.


KINGSTON SENTENCING – Sean Kingston was sentenced to 42 months (3.5 years) in prison and three years probation after being convicted of federal wire fraud over a scheme involving over $1 million in high-end cars, jewelry and other luxury goods. Kingston, who topped the charts with his 2007 “Beautiful Girls,” was convicted in March alongside his mother for essentially conning vendors into giving him merch – including a Cadillac Escalade and a massive LED television — by falsely promising payment.


FESTIVAL FRAUD – A new lawsuit claimed that a booking agent named Christopher Young lied about securing Doechii and SiR as headliners for a Baltimore music festival this summer, then snagged a nearly $200,000 deposit from the show's organizer and pocketed the cash even after his scheme unraveled. The suit claims that Young “never spoke to anyone” about Doechii and had only “preliminary conversations” about locking down SiR for the festival.

	President Donald Trump has signed 191 executive orders from his desk in the Oval Office since taking office in January. His recent orders have focused on ramping up his efforts to embolden law enforcement across the country, as well as attempting to ban mail-in voting and allow law enforcement to displace and institutionalize unhoused people. Meanwhile, these critical and consequential decisions are being made in the ugliest room in the White House, according to musician Jack White.


	“Look at how disgusting trump has transformed the historic White House,” White shared on Instagram, where he published an image of Trump's recent meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky. Following a recent redesign, the Oval Office is now covered in harsh yellow-gold accents, like Halloween costume jewelry from a Party City clearance bin. “It's now a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler's dressing room. Can't wait for the UFC match on the front lawn too.” 

A post shared by Jack White (@officialjackwhite)


	In the image, White tagged WWE Hall of Famer Ric Flair in place of Trump. He also compared the president to Idiocracy, the 2006 film in which an anti-intellectualism movement leads to the functional collapse on the United States. “He's almost fully achieved the movie,” White said. The only difference is that the president in Idiocracy was actively seeking out help from intelligent people.

	In July, Trump boasted about the new design. “I picked it all myself. I'm very proud of it,” he said, per USA  Today. Barbara Res, who previously oversaw construction as the former vice president at Trump Organization, told the publication that Trump “used the word ‘class' a lot, and it was a high-class thing for him. It conveyed an illusion of taste and wealth, and that's why he wanted to gild everything.”

	











	White describes Trump's choices differently. “Look at his disgusting taste, would you even buy a used car from this conman, let alone give him the nuclear codes?” the musician asked. “A gold plated trump bible would look perfect up on that mantle with a pair of trump shoes on either side wouldn't it? What an embarrassment to American history. Also pictured in this photograph, a REAL leader of a nation in a black suit.”

Every year, fans, critics, and industry artists complain about one or two shows stealing a spotlight that's capable of covering many, many more programs. And every year, the problem only seems to get worse. In 2021, “The Crown” and “The Queen's Gambit” won 11 times — each! Subsequent seasons weren't so redundant, but only by the slimmest of margins: “The White Lotus” and “The Bear” landed 10 trophies apiece in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Then, just last year, “The Bear” topped itself with 11 wins and “Shōgun” won 18 times! 18! I love “Shōgun,” and it was a particularly weak year for drama nominees (if anything, it deserved one more win — for Tadanobu Asano), but still: Only four other shows had at least 18 nominations. There are other shows!

The ceremony's monotony is one thing. Hearing the same thank you's from the same cast and creators, over and over, is a problem, sure, but it's not what's keeping the Emmys from higher ratings. The larger issue is the voters' conformity. People who make television may not have enough time to watch television — Hollywood, by and large, can be a) very busy, and b) shockingly disinterested in its own creations — but the tens of thousands of TV Academy members who vote on the Emmys have a responsibility to broaden their horizons whenever possible. And while the ideal time to do that is before voting on the nominees, the procrastinating majority out there can at least watch all the nominees before picking the winners.

IndieWire is here to help. As in years past, we're putting a frontrunner under the spotlight — in this case, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's “The Studio” — to assess just how big a night it deserves to have. Can it break “The Bear's” record for most Emmys by a comedy in a single season? It would have to top 11 wins, which is very well could do, given it's competing in 18 categories and there's quite a bit of love out there for the show, its cast, creators, and crew.

Voters can use this article as a handy resource — a study guide for the responsible among you who've already watched everything, and a cheat sheet for the truly time-crunched who may not know why people are buzzing about Bryan Cranston's finale performance or Adam Newport-Berra's “Oner” cinematography. Meanwhile, non-voters can better prepare for Emmy night. While your friends take to Bluesky with extreme reactions to “The Studio” over-performing or underperforming, you can lay out exactly why the final tally ended up where it did, with logic and evidence. And for those of you mainly interested in who will win, rather than who should, make sure to keep checking IndieWire Awards Editor Marcus Jones' Emmy predictions.

Maybe you'll disagree with a few picks. Maybe you'll be surprised by a few others. (I know I was.) But we'll all be better informed come Emmys night — and hopefully voters long before that.

Style note: For categories where each nominated program consists of multiple individual artists, not all names are listed. It's just a space issue. Full credits can be found on the Emmys' website.

Nope.

Nominees:
– “The Bear” (Ayo Edebiri)
– “Hacks” (Lucia Aniello)
– “Mid-Century Modern” (James Burrows)
– “The Rehearsal” (Nathan Fielder)
– “The Studio” (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg)

Oners will likely win the day — and I, too, often find myself entranced by all the moving pieces coming together so naturally, and looking so good while doing it — but the same could be said of Nathan Fielder's work on “The Rehearsal,” especially in the nominated episode, “Pilot's Code.” Fans remember it as “The Sully Episode,” in which the writer, director, and star becomes heralded pilot Sully Sullenberger for reasons that defy succinct explanation, yet come to life with moving clarity and absolute hilarity in one of the year's best pieces of entertainment (and yet it's only the second or third best episode of “The Rehearsal” Season 2). It's a testament to Fielder's vision that any of his markedly ambitious show works, let alone thrives, so I'm giving this one to Fielder — though I fully expect the TV Academy to reward Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, which is fine!

Yup.

Nominees:
– “Emily in Paris” (Seamus Tierney)
– “Georgie and Mandy's First Mariage” (Buzz Feltshans IV)
– “Hacks” (Adam Bricker)
– “The Righteous Gemstones” (Paul Daley)
– “The Studio” (Adam Newport-Berra)

At IndieWire, we're big fans of “The Righteous Gemstones” and its Civil War era Season 4 opener, so if Paul Daley can snag the HBO comedy's first Emmy here, we're not going to complain. But yeah, sorry, it should probably go to “The Studio.” Its nominated episode is, of course, “The Oner,” which reflects Matt's anxiety and excitement over shooting a pivotal scene as a long, continuous shot (a “oner”) by capturing the entire episode in the same fashion. It looks great, it pieces together perfectly, and it's a stylish choice that fits the episodic story and the series' overall ethos.

Not quite.

Nominees:
– “Abbott Elementary” (Quinta Brunson)
– “Hacks” (Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs, Jen Statsky)
– “The Rehearsal” (Nathan Fielder, Carrie Kemper, Adam Locke-Norton, Eric Notarnicola)
– “Somebody Somewhere” (Hannah Bos, Paul Thureen, Bridget Everett)
– “The Studio” (Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory, Frida Perez)
– “What We Do in the Shadows” (Sam Johnson, Sarah Naftalis, Paul Simms)

“The Studio” isn't even nominated for its best episode — “Casting” is elite comedy writing — and while I respect the tradition to recognize a new series' premiere episode, it doesn't stack up to the killer competition. “The Rehearsal's” Sully entry is mind-bendingly exquisite, “What We Do in the Shadows'” finale is a clever triumph, and “Somebody Somewhere” ends with such an emotional wallop, I forgive its inclusion despite not being all that funny. Heck, I might even vote for it, but the point remains: “The Studio” is maybe fourth-best among the Outstanding Writing nods.

Yes?

Nominees:
– “Abbott Elementary” (Moira Frazier)
– “Emily in Paris” (Carole Nicolas)
– “Hacks” (Aubrey Marie)
– “The Penguin” (Brian Badie)
– “The Studio” (Vanessa Price)
– “The White Lotus” (Mila Kovero)

I'm sure “Emily in Paris” does plenty of wild ‘dos, and “The White Lotus” had to overcome unbearable humidity to keep everyone looking that good, but I find myself routinely transfixed by Kathryn Hahn's fauxhawk-ponytail hairstyle in “The Studio.” It's not so elaborate that it distracts from the plot, but it's just advanced enough to be exactly what her character would want — edgy, exclusive, and impeccable (not to mention impossible for a rube like me to properly identify).

Nope.

Nominees:
– “Emily in Paris” (Marylin Fitoussi)
– “Hacks” (Kathleen Felix-Hager)
– “The Righteous Gemstones” (Christina Flannery)
– “The Studio” (Kameron Lennox)
– “The White Lotus” (Alex Bovaird)

Just. Look. At. These. LOOKS. It's “The Righteous Gemstones” all the way, baby. Praise Teenjus!

Not really.

Nominees:
– “The Bear” (Joanna Naugle)
– “Hacks” (Susan Vaill)
– “The Rehearsal” (Stacy Moon)
– “The Studio” (Eric Kissack)
– “What We Do in the Shadows” (Yana Gorskaya and Dane McMaster)

While trying to avoid bias toward whatever nominee did the most editing, this one has to go to Yana Gorskaya and Dane McMaster for the “What We Do in the Shadows” finale, right? Not only does the clever, layered conclusion balance a number of delicate tonal shifts, but it also shot and inserted three different “perfect endings” to support the idea that Nadja hypnotized the audience into seeing whatever dream ending they desired. Randomly dropping in a spoof of “Newhart,” “Rosemary's Baby,” or “The Usual Suspects” isn't some grand innovation in editing, but it does speak to how much love and creativity went into making every scene in every episode of this brilliant sitcom. Plus, it's one more joke to land for an editing team that amplified so many.

No!

Nominees:
– “Andor” (Brandon Roberts)
– “Based on a True Story” (Sherri Chung)
– “Cobra Kai” (Leo Birenberg and Zach Robinson)
– “Severance” (Theodore Shapiro)
– “The Studio” (Antonio Sanchez)
– “The White Lotus” (Cristobal Tapla de Veer)

It's “Andor.” Obviously. Just listen to it. Magnificent.

Kind of, but not really.

Nominees:
– “Hacks” (Matt Biffa)
– “The Last of Us” (Evyen Klean, Ian Broucek, and Scott Hanau)
– “The Righteous Gemstones” (DeVoe Yates and Gabe Hilfer)
– “Severance” (George Drakoullas)
– “The Studio” (Gabe Hilfer)
– “The White Lotus” (Gabe Hilfer)

What a year for Gabe Hilfer! Before this year's three nominations, he had two nods— for “Ozark” in 2022 and “The White Lotus” in 2023 — the latter of which he won for. Does he deserve another? Yes, I think so, though my vote is for “The Righteous Gemstones,” a comedy whose curated song selections span quite a range of eras and styles, while offering up plenty of toe-tapping favorites.

Yes!

Nominees:
– “The Bear” (Jeanie Bacharach and Maggie Bacharach)
– “Hacks” (Linda Lowy and Morgan Smith)
– “Only Murders in the Building” (Bernard Telsey, Tiffany Little Canfield, and Destiny Lilly)
– “Shrinking” (Debby Romano and Brett Benner)
– “The Studio” (Melissa Kostenbauder and Francine Maisler)

No matter how you look at the race, “The Studio” has an edge. Are you wowed by the A-list guest stars on “The Bear” and “Only Murders in the Building”? Well, “The Studio” has even more. Do you value the chemistry found in a core ensemble like “Shrinking” and “Hacks”? Great, but “The Studio's” series regulars had to bond on the fly, with no room for error — all those long takes — and they've coalesced nicely in just one season. Plus, Melissa Kostenbauder and Francine Maisler snagged so many stars from this year's other Emmy-nominated shows, including “Hacks” co-creators Jen Statsky and Lucia Aniello, as well as its star, Jean Smart. If you're going to make a meta show about modern Hollywood and promise movie stars, you have to overdeliver — with big names and cinephile favorites alike. “The Studio” did that, and then some.

No, not really.

Nominees:
– “Hacks” (Rob Tokarz)
– “Mid-Century Modern” (Greg Grande)
– “Only Murders in the Building” (Patrick Howe)
– “The Studio” (Julie Berghoff)
– “What We Do in the Shadows” (Shayne Fox)

With all due respect to the difficulty of designing around so many long takes, this one has to go to “What We Do in the Shadows.” The four-time nominee for Outstanding Production Design has yet to win, falling to “The Mandalorian” in 2020 and “Only Murders in the Building” in both 2023 and 2024. Patrick Howe's inventive work merits reconsideration more than your typical repeat winner, as “Only Murders” finds clever and eye-catching ways to incorporate each season's themes (from Broadway to Hollywood), but the team behind “What We Do in the Shadows” is long overdue, and the final season features exciting settings like Guillermo's office, Nandor's war room, and everything in the penultima episode, “Come Out and Play.” FX's excellent sitcom benefits greatly from its inspired design work. Voters shouldn't miss their last chance to recognize as much.

Nah.

Nominees:
– “The Acolyte”
– “Agatha All Along”
– “The Bear”
– “The Righteous Gemstones”
– “The Studio”

With no animated titles nominated this year, my priority turns to soundscapes that have been built largely (not entirely) from scratch, and that favors “The Acolyte” and “Agatha All Along.” Both require their audio engineers to invent nonexistent sounds, whether it's force battles or witchcraft, and the standards set by these franchises' big-screen predecessors means there's a lot to live up to. I'd probably vote for “The Acolyte,” but either way, “The Studio” would be further down the ballot.

Ummmmm, yes, OK, yeah.

Nominees:
– “The Bear” (Scott D. Smith)
– “Mid-Century Modern” (Jeff A. Johnson)
– “Only Murders in the Building” (Joseph White Jr.)
– “Shrinking” (Anna D. Wilborn)
– “The Studio” (Buck Robinson)

As a reminder: Sound Mixing recognizes work done almost completely in post-production, where created, added, and recorded sounds are balanced against each other. “The Bear” has won two years in a row (which I advocated for last year), and another trophy would be more than warranted. But given “The Studio's” preference for long takes, I have to imagine there's a lot of tricky ADR work that can't be as easily masked with an edit. Layer on the noises from a busy casino (in full operation), fully-finished scenes from a variety of fake movies, and the crowds at CinemaCon and the Golden Globes, and “The Studio” team had their work cut out for them.

Naaahhhh.

Nominees:
– Olivia Colman, “The Bear”
– Jamie Lee Curtis, “The Bear”
– Cynthia Erivo, “Poker Face”
– Robby Hoffman, “Hacks”
– Zoë Kravitz, “The Studio”
– Julianne Nicholson, “Hacks”

Kravitz is fun in “The Studio,” but there's a little too much self-awareness in her comedic scenes (especially when her character is tripping on mushrooms). In comparison, Julianne Nicholson is fiercely, courageously committed to the bit, and her drug-addled performance benefits greatly from going all-in.

Still, I gotta go with Cynthia Erivo. Not only does she play multiple parts with razor-sharp specificity, but she understands the baked-in sense of humor her heavily accented roles require. She doesn't reach too far but doesn't do too little either. She lives in just the right zone, making it easy to enjoy her “Poker Face” episode as much as her work in it.

Yes, duh.

Nominees:
– Jon Bernthal, “The Bear”
– Bryan Cranston, “The Studio”
– Dave Franco, “The Studio”
– Ron Howard, “The Studio”
– Anthony Mackie, “The Studio”
– Martin Scorsese, “The Studio”

Bryan Cranston gives the best performance (and the most substantial, given his screen time and significance to the story), but Martin Scorsese would be a worthy winner, too. Great work. (And sorry, but Bernthal — as the only not “Studio” nominee — isn't in a comedy, nor is he giving a comedic performance, so there's no good argument there.)

Nah.

Nominees:
– Ike Barinholtz, “The Studio”
– Colman Domingo, “The Four Seasons”
– Harrison Ford, “Shrinking”
– Jeff Hiller, “Somebody Somewhere”
– Ebon Moss-Bachrach, “The Bear”
– Michael Urie, “Shrinking”
– Bowen Yang, “SNL”

As much as everyone would love to see Barinholtz take the stage and recreate Sal Saperstein's Golden Globes moment, this one has to go to one of two other people: Harrison Ford, who's doing some of the best work of his career on an otherwise forgettable sad-com, or Jeff Hiller, whose endearing breakthrough on the best show of 2024 demands a shelf filled with awards. Personally, I'd vote Hiller (and, side note, I do believe he can win), but for the purposes of this exercise, “The Studio's” submission is at least third on the ballot. (But Barinholtz is very, very good! “The War” is a Top 3 “Studio” episode!) 

It physically pains me to say this, but no.

Nominees:
– Liza Colón-Zayas, “The Bear”
– Hannah Einbinder, “Hacks”
– Kathryn Hahn, “The Studio”
– Janelle James, “Abbott Elementary”
– Catherine O'Hara, “The Studio”
– Sheryl Lee Ralph, “Abbott Elementary”
– Jessica Williams, “Shrinking”

If Kathryn Hahn wins her first Emmy or Catherine O'Hara wins her third Emmy, both for “The Studio,” I will be thrilled. They give the best performances on a series filled with memorable, enthusiastic work, and they're both icons in their own right.

But Hannah Einbinder is looooooong overdue for her “Hacks” Emmy, and she's going to be the rightful pick every year until she's handed a trophy. (Others are bothered by what they see as category fraud, arguing Einbinder should be considered in Lead Actress… but while Ava may be a co-lead with Deborah, in no way can Einbinder and Jean Freaking Smart be seen on equal footing, especially dating back to when the series first began, which is when Max/HBO/HBO Max had to pick their categories. So she's fine to compete here, and she should win no matter where she's nominated.)

You know what? Yes.

Nominees:
– Adam Brody, “Nobody Wants This”
– Seth Rogen, “The Studio”
– Jason Segal, “Shrinking”
– Martin Short, “Only Murders in the Building”
– Jeremy Allen White, “The Bear”

First and foremost, I want to acknowledge the naysayers. Does Seth Rogen do anything that different from what he usually does? No, not really. Are the demands in terms of emotional dexterity placed upon Jeremy Allen White, Jason Segel, and Adam Brody greater than those required of Rogen? Yeah, probably. But White already has two Emmys in this category, and the only thing that matters to him (and everyone) in 2025 is that he nails his Bruce Springsteen biopic. Segel sure gets weepy and loud in “Shrinking,” but he's also the biggest impediment to enjoying the series, so he's out, and Brody could handle playing a rom-com's hot rabbi in his sleep. None of them, really, are comedic leads anyway, so the only real competition for Rogen is Short, who I would love to see win, but this year — and likely only this year — we have to consider the burden on each actor.

Short has been tearing through “Only Murders” for four years now, getting ever more comfortable in a character just as tailor-made to his talents as Rogen's fretful studio boss is his. Meanwhile, Rogen is the lead of a heavily scrutinized, semi-meta comedy filled with massive stars and built on many, many lengthy takes. From an execution level, the difficulty is high, and expectations are even higher; he has to be good enough that audiences are eager to keep watching him, rather than suffering through his scenes while they wait for the next A-lister to show up. “The Studio” never feels that way, and Rogen's lead performance is a big reason why. So yes, give him the Emmy.

No, but it's close!

Nominees:
– “Abbott Elementary”
– “The Bear”
– “Hacks”
– “Nobody Wants This”
– “Only Murders in the Building”
– “Shrinking”
– “The Studio”
– “What We Do in the Shadows”

“What We Do in the Shadows” is the obvious choice — “Hacks” and “Only Murders” had down years, “The Bear” is officially up for Season 3, which is its worst, and the rest range of the nominees from pretty good (“Abbott Elementary”) to fleeting entertainment (“Nobody Wants This”). That leaves “The Studio” to square off with “Shadows,” and seven stellar seasons of real-life vampires trumps one solid season of vampiric movie executives. (And if you're hung up on only voting for the eligible seasons, as you probably should be, the “Shadows” finale tops any episode of “The Studio,” which should help give it the edge overall.)

Final Tally: “The Studio” should win six (6) Emmys at the 77th Annual Emmy Awards (out of 18 categories and 23 total nominations). Oddly enough, that's the exact same number of wins we said “The Bear” deserved last year — from the same number of categories and the same number of nominations — when it ended up with a record-setting 11 Emmys. So come September 14, “The Studio” should feel pretty good about making history!

The fan army for a group from Southeast Asia has won every time since the nearly annual competition originated in 2014. 


													By
												

	Paul Grein



SB19's fan army, A'TIN, won the 2025 Billboard Fan Army Face-Off, besting Selena Gomez's Selenators. It's A'TIN's third victory, which allows them to tie T-ara's Queens for the most wins since the nearly annual competition originated in 2014. (The competition wasn't held in 2019 or 2021.)

	











	With A'TIN's victory, the fan army for a group from Southeast Asia has won every time. SB19 is a Filipino group. All the previous winners were from South Korea.




			Trending on Billboard		







	SB19's fan army faced fierce competition in every round of this (mostly) friendly battle. They topped Tate McRae in Round 1 (82.7% to 17.3%), Ariana Grande in Round 2 (88.6% to 11.4%), Post Malone in Round 3 (81.6% to 18.4%), Shaboozey in the quarterfinals (76.5% to 23.5%), Sabrina Carpenter in the semifinals (67.8% to 32.2%) and Gomez in the finals (59.4% to 40.6%).


	Each of the acts that SB19 squared off against this year has topped the Billboard Hot 100. SB19 has yet to achieve that milestone, but their hit “Dam” reached No. 4 on the Billboard Philippines Hot 100 in March.


	Here's a complete, updated list of winners of the Billboard Fan Army Face-Off. Will A'TIN break out of the tie with Queens next year or will another fan army prevail? We'll have to wait a full year to find out.

EXCLUSIVE: Marlon Wayans is adapting the popular Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation's S. Korean game show Midnight Horror Story for U.S. audiences, with his producing partner Rick Alvarez, through their Ugly Baby Productions and Craig and Clara Plestis of Smart Dog Media (The Masked Singer).


	Smart Dog Media is collaborating for a second time with MBC Korea to bring a popular S. Korean game show to the States, building on their success with Fox's The Masked Singer (known originally as King of Mask Singer).


	The U.S. version will feature well-known actors who, in each episode, will deliver chilling yet comedic stories, brought to life through immersive, cinematic reenactments, according to the official logline. The set itself will surround performers in the sights and sounds of each tale, heightening the fear factor. 

	











	The goal is for each celebrity to use their acting prowess to tell the scariest story. The show's hidden mystic audience of spirits (a mix of live in-studio and virtual audience members) will illuminate a candle whenever they find a story truly frightening. The celebrity who earns the most candles will be crowned the winner. The new series will amplify the comedy elements as a key factor of the format.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Black-ish creator Kenya Barris is returning to broadcast television with a multi-camera comedy at CBS starring Mike Epps, which is executive produced by Aaron Kaplan of Kapital Entertainment. 


	Created and written by Barris, the comedy comes from BET Studios, where Barris is a principal, and is co-produced by CBS supplier CBS Studios. This marks a rare collaboration between the two studios which are now part of Paramount Chair of TV Media George Cheeks' portfolio.


	In the untitled half-hour, after wildfires sweep through Altadena, two estranged Black brothers — one played by Epps — reunite to sell their late grandmother's house to private developers. But when they learn her caretaker now owns part of the home and refuses to sell, they're forced to live together and confront their differences — and what community, legacy, and family really mean.

	Altadena, a diverse area known for its strong Black community and culture, was devastated by the January 2025 Eaton fire, which killed at least 19 people and destroyed more than 9,000 buildings, with thousands of residents losing their homes and most of their possessions. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	There had been speculation that Epps and Barris may be playing the two brothers but only Epps is attached as an actor for now.  Barris is executive producing through his Khalabo Ink Society. Also executive producing are Epps and his producing partner Niles Kirchner as well as Kaplan.


	The comedy reunites Epps with Barris after the comedian appeared in Barris' 2023 Netflix movie You People. It marks Barris' return to broadcast where he created and executive produced the praised ABC comedy seres black-ish, which spawned a franchise for Disney. 


	Epps stars in and executive produces Netflix's sitcom The Upshaws, which is heading into its fifth and final season. It has been nominated for 10 NAACP Image Awards, with Epps winning for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series in 2024. He is repped by UTA, Artists First and Yorn Levine Barnes.

	











	Barris' Khalabo Ink Society has The Vince Staples Show for Netflix and Diarra From Detroit for BET+, both renewed for a second season, and recently produced the Amazon MGM movie The Underdoggs. The company is in various stages of development on several series, including Group Chat, a collaboration with Kim Kardashian based on LaLa Anthony's best-selling book The Love Playbook, which has a pilot order at Hulu; The Book of Jose, which chronicles the life of rapper Fat Joe; and a limited series about the life and legacy of legendary comedian Richard Pryor. 


	Barris is repped by WME and has a new management company, LBI Entertainment. He is also with Yorn Levine Barnes.

Nothing says comedy like a devasting wildfire that destroyed people's lives.

100-year disaster and Hollywood has dollar signs in its eyes. So tacky.

Probably going to film it in Vancouver, too.

I'd love to see this film in Altadena/LA

it's gonna be budapest standing in for eaton canyon

Few stories have influenced the canon of Western storytelling more than Miguel de Cervantes' “Don Quixote,” but its author has never received his own moment in the cinematic spotlight. That changes this fall with Alejandro Amenábar's new film “The Captive,” which follows Cervantes as a 28-year-old sailor in the Spanish Navy who discovers his love of storytelling while confined as a prisoner of war. The film is set to have its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, and IndieWire can exclusively reveal its new trailer. 

 










An official synopsis for the film reads: “1575 — Algiers, Miguel de Cervantes (Julio Peña), a wounded 28-year-old Spanish Navy soldier, is held prisoner by Ottoman corsairs. A cruel death awaits him should his countrymen fail to pay his ransom soon; but within the confines of his cell, Cervantes discovers a surprising refuge — the art of storytelling. Crafted from resilience and hope, his stories enthrall his fellow captives, and capture the attention of Hasan (Alessandro Borghi), the enigmatic and feared Bey of Algiers, igniting a secret affinity between captor and captive. Suspicions rise amidst growing tensions in the city, and Cervantes, driven by an unwavering sense of optimism, devises a daring plan to escape.”

“The Captive” is written and directed by Alejandro Amenábar. The film stars Julio Peña, Alessandro Borghi, Miguel Rellán, Fernando Tejero, Luis Callejo, José Manuel Poga, Roberto Álamo, Albert Salazar, Juanma Muniagurria, César Sarachu, and Jorge Asín.

“The Captive” marks Amenábar's 11th feature film as a director and his first since 2019's “While at War.” That film appears to share some DNA with “The Captive,” as they both explore how traumatic events in Spanish history shaped the lives of one of the nation's most celebrated intellectuals, with “While at War” exploring the life of writer and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno during the Spanish Civil War. The Chilean-Spanish director has worked in a variety of genres over the course of his three-decade career, and IndieWire's David Ehrlich made the case in 2023 that his film “The Others” deserves to be remembered as one of cinema's best ghost stories.

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Danny Boyle has made a name for himself by taking powerful real-life stories and turning them into thrilling cinematic experiences, and the Oscar winner looks to have found that next riveting tale to adapt. Sources tell Deadline that Boyle is on board to direct Ink, a Studiocanal, Media Res and House Productions pic that revolves around the rise of the Rupert Murdoch empire. Insiders add that Oscar nominee Guy Pearce is in talks to play the media mogul and NewsCorp founder and Jack O'Connell is in negotiations to play Larry Lamb, who Murdoch hired to run The Sun when he purchased it in 1969.

	











	An explosive cinematic rollercoaster about a group of visionaries and misfits who had an idea for a new kind of news – one that would give the people what they want and would change the face of the world we live in today. James Graham, who penned the original play, has adapted the screenplay with plans to shoot this October.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Based on the James Graham play, follows Murdoch's struggling newspaper, The Sun, as he intends to make it a must-read news source and hires Lamb to run the paper. The purchase of the paper would start a long-standing rivalry between The Sun and The Mirror, leading to the rise of the British tabloids as we know them.


	Danny Boyle produces with Tessa Ross and Michael Ellenberg. The film reunites Boyle and Ross following their collaboration on Slumdog Millionaire. Tracey Seaward also produces. Tonia Davis is an exec producer.


	Deadline first reported Media Res optioning James Graham's play of the same name directed by Rupert Goold in 2020.

	











	Studiocanal is fully financing the film. Ron Halpern and Joe Naftalin will oversee for for the studio. Studiocanal will release in their territories of the UK, France, Germany, Poland. Benelux, Australia and NZ handling worldwide sales.


	While Hollywood occasionally has had Murdoch appear in projects over the years, with the most recent example being Malcolm McDowell playing him in a cameo role in the 2019 pic Bombshell, there hasn't been an instance where the industry has decided to dive into how he came to be one of the most influential figures in history of media. There are plenty of places Boyle could have pulled from to tell this tale, but given how important this moment was in the Murdoch origin story, Boyle chose to go with source material that was ready for him to adapt.


	When it came to who would play his two main leads, Pearce and O'Connell were Boyle top choices for Murdoch and Lamb from the start. Pearce is coming off his critically acclaimed role in the A24 epic The Brutalist, which earned him an Oscar nomination. The Australia native had been weighing several offers but the chance to play one of his country's most iconic figures ultimately was to hard to pass on. 


	With O'Connell, Lamb essentially is equally if not more important to telling this chapter of Murdoch's story and needed to be played by someone that could match wits with Pearce. O'Connell has had a big year that started with his scene-stealing role as villainous vampire Remy in the box office smash Sinners, followed by the Sony horror hit 28 Years Later. Boyle directed the latter pic, which is where he got his first chance to see O'Connell up close. The filmmaker was so excited by his performance that he made his character a focal point in the next film, 28 Years Later: Bone Temple, which bows in January.

	Boyle is no stranger to taking on projects with larger-than-life figures at the center of the story, like his unconventional biopic Steve Jobs, which told the journey of the man who co-founded Apple and helped turn it into one of the world's most powerful tech companies. With Murdoch's global reach on so many fronts, Boyle looks to be aiming for the fences given the mogul's impact on not just journalism but how the media landscape has been formed over the decades.


	Boyle is repped by WME; Pearce is repped by CAA, Independent Talent Group and Shanahan Management; and O'Connell is repped by UTA, Range Media Partners and Conway van Gelder Grant. Graham is represented by Curtis Brown and WME.

In 1971, Keith Carradine was a struggling young actor with only one film under his belt when he was summoned to Robert Altman‘s Westwood offices to audition for “McCabe & Mrs. Miller.” “I didn't even have an agent yet,” Carradine told IndieWire. Carradine arrived at the office complex and was sent upstairs to Altman's apartment, where he knocked on the door and heard the hottest director in Hollywood — who was fresh off the box office success of “M*A*S*H*” one year earlier — invite him inside.

“I opened the door and he was standing next to the bed wearing a bathrobe and a white T-shirt,” Carradine said. “He was unwrapping this package with brown paper and string around it, and he said, ‘I just got back from Colombia.' This is the '70s, so I'm thinking, what's he unwrapping here? Is it a brick of cocaine? It turns out it was a piece of Pre-Columbian art he had picked up at the Cartegena Film Festival.”

Carradine's “audition” barely lasted a minute. “He said, ‘Did you read the script?' I said, ‘Yeah,'” Carradine said. “He said, “Did you read the part?' I said, ‘Yeah.' He said, “Do you want to do it?' I said, ‘Yeah.' He said, ‘Okay.' And that was my audition. But that was Bob. He never asked anybody to read lines. He would meet you and he would speak with you, and he would decide if who he perceived you to be provided the right essence for the character.”

 










That initial meeting would ultimately yield an actor-director collaboration central to three of the best American films of the 1970s: the beautiful and haunting Western “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” in which Carradine played a sweet, naive, and ultimately doomed cowboy; “Thieves Like Us” (1974), Altman's remake of “They Live By Night” starring Carradine as a Depression-era bank robber; and “Nashville” (1975), a sprawling ensemble piece with Carradine as a self-absorbed folk singer.

The remarkable thing about Carradine's performances in these movies is that he's so natural and convincing in each that he seems to be playing himself in all three, yet the parts couldn't be more different from each other. Carradine concedes that there probably was a little bit of him in the character (listed in the credits as simply “Cowboy”) he played in “McCabe.” “At the age of 20, there I stood all innocent and wide-eyed and ready to take this adventure,” Carradine said of his state of mind when first meeting Altman. “That was what he wanted in that role — he wanted that kind of innocence.” 

Carradine said Altman's ability to read people and capture their essence on film was his greatest talent as a director of actors. “I don't recall him giving me any sort of specific direction, and I don't remember seeing or hearing him do that with anyone,” Carradine said, though he did remember a disappointing moment when he arrived on location with his long hair — which Altman had told him he could keep — and learned he would have to cut it for the part. “My face just fell because I had been growing it for two years, and Bob said, ‘Kid, if that's where your ego is at, it's in the wrong place.' I've never forgotten that.”

 










According to Carradine, Altman tended to shoot in continuity whenever possible, an approach that had a particular benefit on “McCabe,” which was partly about a new town springing up in the middle of nowhere. “Bob dressed all the construction guys who were building the town in period clothes, and he told everybody that was working on it that if they had a place where they wanted to sleep, they could camp out and make it their place,” Carradine said. “So there were people actually spending the night there and getting up to put on their period clothes, and that was going on in the background the whole time Bob shot the film. You saw the town grow.”

The next time Altman cast Carradine it was in a lead role, as the fugitive Bowie in “Thieves Like Us.” Carradine had no idea he was acting in a remake until he came across Nicholas Ray's “They Live By Night” on television the night “Thieves” opened in New York. “After the screening I went back to my hotel and was flipping channels, and I heard Cathy O'Donnell turn to Farley Granger and call him Bowie,” Carradine said. “The next day I asked Bob about it and he said, ‘Oh yeah, we're a remake.'”

In Altman's film, the Cathy O'Donnell role was played by Shelley Duvall, who had appeared in the director's “Brewster McCloud” and “McCabe” and would go on to work with Altman again in “Nashville,” “Buffalo Bill and the Indians,” “3 Women,” and “Popeye.” “Thieves Like Us” was her first big part, and her scenes with Carradine are among the most moving in Altman's oeuvre, sweet and funny and tragic all at once. “She was amazing,” Carradine said. “The fact is that all I had to do was show up and be present, because she had such honesty and energy, and an inability to be untruthful on camera. All I had to do was join in.”

 










The seeds for Carradine and Altman's next collaboration were planted during the “Thieves Like Us” shoot when Altman and “Thieves” screenwriter Joan Tewkesbury heard their star playing some songs at a party. “I had my guitar and I was playing some songs that I had written, and among them were ‘I'm Easy' and ‘It Don't Worry Me,'” Carradine said, referring to two compositions that would be put to brilliant use in “Nashville.” After hearing Carradine's songs, Tewkesbury wrote the folk trio of Bill, Mary, and Tom with Carradine in mind to play Bill — though things worked out a little differently in the end.

“I was originally going to play the role that Allan Nicholls played — Bill,” Carradine said. “The original Tom was supposed to be Gary Busey. Gary Busey got an offer to do a pilot for a half-hour comedy show with Jack Elam called ‘Texas Wheelers' and he dropped out of ‘Nashville' to do the pilot. When he dropped out, Bob moved me into that role. It was a role that was based on Gary Busey's energy, and I was not comfortable playing that guy.”

Carradine struggled on set, feeling that he didn't like Tom and didn't know how to play him, but when he asked Altman for help his director was dismissive. “He looked at me and said, ‘You're fine,' and walked away,” Carradine said. Carradine was more frustrated than ever, but he realized after the fact that Altman knew exactly what he was doing. 

 










“What you see in that movie is a guy who doesn't like himself,” Carradine said. “I wish I could take credit for having designed that, but that was just Bob capturing me, this young actor who was still insecure enough to feel as though the role that I was playing might reflect on me somehow. I didn't want people looking at me and thinking that's who I really was. I had an issue with that, and that's what's in the movie.”   

Carradine was, in his words, “stunned” when he was nominated for an Oscar for the song “I'm Easy,” and figured he had no hope of winning when he was up against songs performed by icons like Diana Ross and Barbra Streisand. “I didn't have a prayer, are you kidding?” Carradine said. “I was up against Berry Gordy and the Motown machine. Diana Ross gave her performance live from Amsterdam in a sleigh where it was snowing with all this production, and I'm sitting there by myself on the stage of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion with my guitar.”

Carradine was terrified performing on the broadcast and just wanted to get through the song without blowing it — and then he won. “I had nothing prepared,” Carradine said. “I did not write anything down or plan what I was going to say, because I just thought I'd be lucky to get through the performance.” At that point the song hadn't even been released as a record, but after the Oscar win David Geffen called Carradine about releasing a heavily produced version that was more elaborate than the version he sang in “Nashville.”

 










Once that record came out and started getting some airplay, the record company that owned the soundtrack rights to “Nashville” belatedly realized what they had and put out the soundtrack version of Carradine's song — meaning he was competing with himself on the radio with two versions of the same hit. “I wound up in the top ten, but I think if there had just been a single record out there without that confusion, I might have gone gold.”

Carradine says that while he might not have realized just how enduring “Nashville” would become, he did know he was working on something special at the time — and he knew that when Altman cast him in “Thieves Like Us” he had been given an incredible gift. “I felt as though Bob had given me the role of a lifetime,” Carradine said, “and I knew I was working with one of the great directors, so I was in a pretty heady place. And I knew when we were shooting ‘Nashville' that we were doing something really good — I didn't realize how good.”

A couple of years before Altman passed away in 2006, Carradine was in New York with his then-girlfriend, now-wife Hayley and they got together with Altman and his wife Kathryn for dinner. “We went to Elaine's, which was one of Bob's favorite hangs,” Carradine said. “I managed to have a moment alone with Elaine where I slipped her my credit card and said, ‘Do not let Bob pick up the tab,' because nobody ever bought him dinner. It just wasn't done. At one point I turned to Bob and said, ‘Bob, I just want to say something.' He looked at me like, what's this? And I said, ‘I just want to say thank you.' And it gave him pause. It stopped him cold. And he just said, ‘You're welcome.' I'll never forget it.”

	President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders on Monday in a follow up to last week's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. While the back-to-back, high-stakes meetings between the warring leaders and their regional partners are aimed at finally bringing in an end to Russia's war against Ukraine, Trump can't seem to stop undermining the delicate negotiations by publicly parroting Kremlin talking points. 


	In a Tuesday morning interview with Fox News, Trump falsely claimed that Putin and Russia had “gotten” Crimea “from Obama,” describing Russia's annexation of the territory as a “real estate deal.” Crimea, a peninsula in the north of the Black Sea, was invaded and occupied by Russia in 2014. 


	“The war started over NATO and Crimea and they wanted Crimea back,” Trump said. “That was given — not a shot fired —- by President Obama in perhaps the worst real estate deal I've ever seen.” 

	











	“Crimea is the apple of Ukraine, it is so beautiful. And Obama gave it away. … He demanded they let it go, Russia took it like candy from a baby. It was really Obama's, that was pure and simple Obama's fault, what a terrible thing,” Trump added.

	In the same interview, Trump declared that it was “insulting” that Ukraine — which has now been invaded by Russia twice in little more than a decade — had sought to join NATO. “They asked for it and shouldn't have asked for it. It was insulting,” Trump said. “They could have asked for other things — the other thing they wanted to get Crimea back.” 

	











	Trump later insinuated that it was actually Ukraine that had instigated the current war against Russia, telling Fox and Friends that “you don't take on a nation that is 10 times your size and military experts.” It was, of course, Russia that invaded Ukraine in February 2022, kicking off the war that has now raged for over three years. 


	Trump rolled out the literal red carpet to receive Putin in Alaska on Friday, even granting the Russian authoritarian a ride in the presidential limousine — an  unprecedented honor rarely granted to foreign dignitaries, much less internationally wanted war criminals.

	Judging by Trump's statements following the summit, Putin spent much of their private discussions stroking the president's ego. On Friday, Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity that Putin had reassured him that it was actually widespread mail-in voter fraud that had cost him the 2020 election.  


	“Vladimir Putin said something — one of the most interesting things — he said, ‘your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting,'” Trump recounted. “He said … ‘it's impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections.” Days later, Trump announced that he would seek to eliminate mail-in voting at a national level, despite lacking the constitutional authority to make any such change to state voting laws.  


	According to a Monday report from Axios, Trump was so eager to talk to Putin again that he interrupted his meeting with European leaders to speak to the Russian president. According to subsequent reporting from The New York Times, the call lasted around 40 minutes.

	Trump apparently left his European counterparts to talk among themselves for the better part of an hour, telling Fox News that it “would be disrespectful to president Putin,” to make the call in their presence. 


	“It was 1:00 in the morning in Russia,” Trump said. “But he picked it up very happily.”

One of the most powerful things a person can be is “around.” Whether it's being in the right place at the right time, or lingering self-consciously until you're the last man standing at a party, presence is potent. The weaponization of proximity is baked into the title of Lurker, the feature debut of filmmaker Alex Russell, who's written on some of the biggest shows of the last few years (The Bear, Beef, Dave). But despite being the least buzzy of the pack, it's the subject matter of Dave, which plays with but never fully undermines the anxieties of musical fame, where Lurker finds its closest match. In this Nightcrawler-like thriller of social and professional escalation, a cold-blooded nobody seizes his moment near a pop star and refuses to let go.

Matthew (Théodore Pellerin) doesn't necessarily look like a starfucker. He's square, a white and gawky retail worker at a fashionable L.A. boutique who conspicuously throws Nile Rodgers on the store playlist when the mononymous Oliver (Archie Madekwe) rolls in with his posse. From this tiny, obviously engineered detail, a row of increasingly sinister dominos begin to fall as Matthew ingratiates himself with Oliver, proves he can hang backstage at a concert, and worms his way into the large home that the entourage crashes at. 

Oliver's other hangers-on—ranging from his quiet videographer (Daniel Zolghadri) to his goof-around pals (Zack Fox and Wale Onayemi, both rappers who've worked with Kenny Beats, who provides the film's score)—regard the newcomer with skepticism. They've managed to stick around during Oliver's meteoric rise because they know how to, and, like veteran reality TV performers, they can sniff out when someone's not there for the right reasons. As Matthew attempts to carve out a place in this unofficial organization, the camera gets up close and personal when documenting the ground-level work of pure ambition. Pellerin's bulging eyes and empty smile start as uncomfortable, but become more transparently hungry as the plot unveils itself—the open mouth of a leech faced with a buffet. Whether he's staring at a screen or a potential victim, Pellerin taps into a disconcerting, entitled soullessness.

This exploitational drive, exacerbated by the racial dynamic of a talentless white guy inserting himself into a group free from them, underscores the movements of the plot. The script's tight machinations, which develop emotional ploys between the characters alongside their more material desires, mostly avoid being outlandish or far-fetched enough to distract from all the jockeying for control. In the always-be-posting era, playing the game inherently looks a little silly—and much of it is captured in amateurish handheld, like a behind-the-scenes music doc or music video B-roll—which gives Russell's screenplay the wiggle room it needs to find an icky honesty in its appearance-forward reality. The ensuing rise-and-fall trajectory of the story isn't new or unexpected, but Russell and his leads complicate things both through cultural specificity (this is a film obsessed with the weightless successes of handles and stories and follows) and by making it clear that, to an extent, the target of all these plots knows what he's doing.

It's not that Lurker blames Oliver for attracting a group of striving lackeys, but that it's smart enough to know that being a pop star also means knowing how to wield power—how to play those underlings against each other and exploit his own sex appeal. The erotic undercurrent flowing throughout the film finds the object of affection dangling just enough encouragement, in Madekwe's alluring glances and physical roughhousing, to stoke the fires of parasocial lust. The unspoken moments between Oliver and Matthew crackle, the veneers erected by both performers rarely budging. 

It's when Russell stops trusting his leads and leans hard into the shock, into what heinous schemes someone close to you could pull off, that Lurker shakes its audience free of its spell. As soon as it takes a step or two over the line with its story, the focus shifts from the intimate royal court politics of this friend group/business enterprise to the believability of the final act turn. 

But of course things get out of control—it's not like the dark underbellies of music-world organizations haven't always exceeded our worst expectations. The strength of Lurker, though, is when it's operating as a slick, slimy social-engineering thriller that anyone could relate to. Whether one recognizes the yen for fame, the capacity to sabotage those around them, or the vulnerability of being known, these eternal egotistical concerns tap into their hyper-modern forms here. Only, now the threats aren't knocking at the door, or breathing hard on the phone—they're following you on social media, monsters hidden in a sea of notifications.

Unfortunately, there's no way for Chris Pratt to know what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is getting up to in the government. Because Kennedy (the cousin of Pratt's mother-in-law) has jumped “on the bandwagon with who is the most divisive president ever”—a polite way to describe Donald Trump—it makes sense to the actor that Kennedy is “made to look terrible,” Pratt says during an appearance on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast. “And so I don't know what to believe.”

If only there was some way to make an informed judgement about Kennedy's policies. If other people are making RFK Jr. look terrible, how else is Pratt supposed to determine the truth? He can't just ask the man himself, despite the fact that he's “spent a number of occasions hanging with him, just in a strictly family dinner kind of vibe,” Pratt says. “It's not like I say to Bobby, ‘Let's talk about this' while we're playing cards or having fun or having dinner. I'm not going to pick his brain to find out exactly which of those things are true. I just kind of assume that none of them are, and, for the most part, I wish him well.”

﻿

If Pratt can't ask Bobby himself, but he also can't trust anyone else's word on the subject, then there's simply no way of knowing what's going on in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But please don't imagine Pratt lives in complete ignorance, because he does have some vague idea of Kennedy's beliefs. “There's certain things [that RFK Jr.] oversees that seem to be supported in a bipartisan way—like getting terrible toxic stuff out of our kids' food. I think that's a great thing. If you just do that, that's amazing,” Pratt says. Unfortunately, Kennedy is not just doing that, but Pratt wouldn't know about it given he apparently doesn't believe stuff like news outlets or words directly from Kennedy's mouth. 

“I'd hate to be so mired in hatred for the president that any success from his administration is something I'd be having an allergic reaction to. To be like, ‘Oh, well, if they do it, I don't want it to happen. I'll put Clorox in my children's cereal myself!' Be reasonable here,” Pratt complains. (Imagine being scolded on what's reasonable by a guy who, in his own words, doesn't know what he's talking about.) The Parks And Rec alum observes that “There's certain things that would be a good thing to have,” which is true. It would be good to have mRNA vaccines, which helped end the pandemic, but Kennedy canceled $500 million in contracts for vaccine development; it would be good to have a division of the CDC monitoring lead exposure levels among children and managing prevention across the country, but that's one of the many important programs Kennedy cut; it would be good to have no dead bears dumped in Central Park trash cans, but, well, you know how that one ends. 

Pratt says he “got along really well” with RFK Jr. during cozy family gatherings. “He's funny, he's wonderful. I love him,” Pratt adds. Of the entire Trump administration, he declared, “I want them all to be successful.” What Trump, RFK Jr., and the whole gang consider “successful” might end up being disastrous for the country, but again, there's no way for Chris Pratt to figure that out.

Westerman has announced the new album A Jackal's Wedding. The British musician's follow-up to 2023's An Inbuilt Fault is out November 7, via Partisan. He wrote most of A Jackal's Wedding in Athens, Greece, and recorded it at Old Carpet Factory with producer Marta Salogni. Below, watch the video for lead single “Adriatic.”

Elaborating on the track, Westerman said in a press release: “I wrote ‘Adriatic' while failing at moving to Greece. I was trying to break outside of the confines of my immediate physical reality. Life is full of practical limitations in terms of having a body, or what you can afford in terms of money, etc., but you can always go to a place in your head where everything is possible, and the song is a celebration of reclaiming that. I hadn't written anything for a long time. I got very depressed after my first record; the whole experience was just so bad that I wasn't sure whether I wanted to make music anymore. Writing this song was taking back ownership of that creative space which is just my thing and it's powerful. There are periods in everybody's life where they feel like maybe they don't have any control over anything. It's the realisation that there's a part of you that they can't get to unless you allow for it, and you can always keep that space, even if it's buried; it doesn't go away as long as you remember that it's there.”

Westerman will support Nation of Language on tour soon. See his tour dates below.

	A documentary on the final years of Ozzy Osbourne's life was pulled hours before its scheduled premiere at the wishes of the Osbourne family, the BBC confirmed.


Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home was set to debut on the BBC Monday evening, Aug. 18, only for the broadcaster to pull it from the schedule earlier that day. At the time, the BBC offered no explanation for the postponement, saying only, “The film has moved in the schedules and we'll confirm new tx [transmission] details in due course.”


	In a follow-up statement, the broadcaster said the Osbourne family had requested the delay, but confirmed the doc would still air at some point. “Our sympathies are with the Osbourne family at this difficult time,” the BBC said. “We are respecting the family's wishes to wait a bit longer before airing this very special film. The new [transmission] date will be confirmed shortly.”


Coming Home was initially announced in 2022 as a multi-part docuseries called Home to Roost that was set to follow the Osbourne family as they realized a long-held dream to move back to England from Los Angeles. But the nature of the doc evolved as Osbourne's health deteriorated in the final years of his life.

Coming Home is now an hour-long film that's been described as a “moving and inspirational account of the last chapter of Ozzy's life.” The filmmakers reportedly had “unique and intimate access” to the whole Osbourne family, with the film also set to feature footage of Osbourne working to get in shape for his farewell concert in early July, just a few weeks before his death. 

	











	Along with Coming Home, there's another documentary about the final years of Osbourne's life, Ozzy Osbourne: No Escape From Now, which is set to arrive in late 2025 on Paramount+. That film is described as, “A deeply personal portrait of Ozzy's harsh new reality as the singer battles to take to the stage for one final performance.”

Fans of the “Real Housewives of Orange County” are well aware of how difficult a time Tamra Judge has had lately. She has been on her own healing journey while trying to support Teddi Mellencamp through stage 4 cancer, and then Tamra jumped back into the Bravo TV mix. Outside looking in, it all seemed like a perfect storm of stressors that could easily lead to precisely the kind of meltdown that Tamra has had.

Luckily, Tamra has a great support system in place, beginning with her ride or die husband, Eddie Judge. She recently chatted with BravoTV.com about how Eddie has helped her navigate one of the toughest years of her life.

When the reality star was asked about how Eddie has handled her emotional roller coaster, Tamra said,  “My husband has been my biggest supporter, my biggest cheerleader. He loves me so much, and he just wants me to do what's right for me or what's healthy. And he's always there for me, so I can't complain.”

Season 19 of the “Real Housewives of Orange County” has been full of ongoing conflicts, and then it seems to have just ripped the band-aid off of Tamra's old feud with Gretchen Rossi.

“You guys are watching my emotional journey happen right here on The Real Housewives of Orange County. It's been definitely a difficult situation for me because I'm not really great with my emotions, but I'm trying to get through it the best that I can. Stop judging me.”

Tamra's breaking point in filming came during a cast trip to New Orleans, the last place that she had traveled to with Teddi. She was already emotional, and then a dinner loaded with conflict was the last straw. She stormed off and then ended up in a car on the phone with Eddie, asking him to book her a flight home.

“I feel not loved and not wanted, and I just don't think there's a place for me in this group,” Tamra later explained in a confessional. While she appeared to quit the series, Andy Cohen recently gave an update on Tamra's status on “Watch What Happens Live.”

When RHOC cast member Heather Dubrow joined Andy in the clubhouse on Aug. 14, 2025, and they discussed the explosive fight. Andy asked Heather, “Did you truly believe she was quitting?” Heather then replied with, “Yes and no.” Andy then confirmed that Tamra did not quit the series.

Do you think that Eddie's rock-solid support will be enough to anchor Tamra through another season on RHOC?

Did we learn nothing from “Rounders”? “The Card Counter”? “California Split” and “Mississippi Grind”? Gambling! It's not for everyone!

But is it, in fact, for Lord Doyle? Well, that remains to be seen in Edward Berger's upcoming return to Netflix, “Ballad of a Small Player.” Adapted from the 2014 Lawrence Osborne novel of the same name, Berger's first post-“Conclave” feature follows Colin Farrell as said small player, the wonderfully (and seemingly falsely) named Lord Doyle, who is having a real tough time with this gambling thing. Perhaps he should have pursued a different sort of hobby.

 










Per the film‘s official synopsis: “Lord Doyle (Colin Farrell) is laying low in Macau — spending his days and nights on the casino floors, drinking heavily and gambling what little money he has left. Struggling to keep up with his fast-rising debts, he is offered a lifeline by the mysterious Dao Ming (Fala Chen), a casino employee with secrets of her own. However, in hot pursuit is Cynthia Blithe (Tilda Swinton) — a private investigator ready to confront Doyle with what he is running from. As Doyle tries to climb to salvation, the confines of reality start to close in.”

In the film's first teaser, things sure aren't looking too good for Farrell's character, as he careens through the neon-accented environs of Macau, Las Vegas, and beyond. (Also, anytime Tilda Swinton is on your tail, it's cause for alarm.) Things might be looking better for the star and his director, however, as the film readies for a TIFF premiere, with other festival berths to be announced soon. Farrell will also be on hand to receive the Golden Icon Award at this year's Zurich Film Festival.

The film isn't just a reunion for Berger and the studio behind his previous smash hit “All Quiet on the Western Front,” it also sees him getting the band back together with much of the crew from that same film, including Academy Award-winning cinematographer James Friend and composer Volker Bertelmann. 

Netflix will release the film in select U.S. theaters on Wednesday, October 15, with a streaming release to follow on Wednesday, October 29. Check out the film's first teaser trailer below.

Madonna celebrated her 67th birthday in spectacular fashion by fulfilling a longtime dream to attend the historic Palio di Siena horse race in Italy, surrounded by her children and boyfriend Akeem Morris during an unforgettable Tuscan getaway.

The Queen of Pop marked her special day on August 16 by experiencing one of Italy's most treasured traditions, sharing the moments with her family while staying at a luxurious 16th-century villa in the heart of Tuscany's wine country.

Madonna's birthday celebration centered around attending the legendary Palio di Siena, a horse race that has entertained audiences since medieval times. The event held special significance for the singer, who had long hoped to witness this particular tradition on her birthday.

“My Dream for many years has been to watch the Palio horse race in Sienna that takes place on my birthday, August 16, since 1482!!” Madonna shared on Instagram, in a reel of the spectacular celebration. “There are no words to describe the excitement, the suspense, and the Pageantry!! A truly sacred ritual to witness thousands of people hushed to a silence before the race begins!”

The singer was clearly moved by the experience, describing the race as “impossible to describe” while expressing gratitude for the opportunity to witness such a meaningful cultural event. She concluded her heartfelt message by stating, “Dreams do come true.”

Madonna watched the historic race from a balcony overlooking the track, accompanied by her children, including daughter Lourdes, 28, son Rocco, 25, and her adopted twin daughters Stella and Estere, 12. Her boyfriend, Akeem Morris, 28, also joined the family celebration.

The Palio di Siena has taken place in the Tuscan city twice yearly since the 17th century, with the first formal race organized in 1633. The event represents centuries of Italian tradition and pageantry, making Madonna's attendance particularly meaningful given her deep appreciation for Italian culture.

A post shared by Madonna (@madonna)

Following the horse race, Madonna and her family retreated to Villa Il Palagio, Sting and Trudie Styler's exclusive 16th-century Tuscan estate. The luxury property sits on 900 acres of picturesque vineyards and is available for private rental, reportedly costing £18,000 for two nights, according to the Daily Mail.

The celebration included a VIP dinner and fireworks display at the stunning villa. A source told the Daily Mail: “Everyone turned out to support Madonna and she had an amazing trip. She loves to celebrate her birthday in Italy and this was one of the best yet. She's been friends with Sting for years so I'm sure he will have sorted her out mates rates for his huge estate.”

One of the celebration's most talked-about elements was Madonna's birthday cake, which featured a pink Labubu doll design complete with her iconic conical bra look. The cake included the playful message “Happy birthday Madudu.” 

Swedish fashion designer Bea Åkerlund documented parts of the celebration on Instagram, sharing glimpses of the fireworks and festivities at the magnificent estate.

The birthday celebration comes just months after Madonna honored her father, Silvio Ciccone's, 94th birthday with a touching tribute. “He has survived many wars and many losses in his life, and he still has a sense of humor and a strong desire to get out of bed every morning and make the most of his day,” she wrote.

Celebrity friends, including Andy Cohen, who wrote “Happy birthday Queen,” Katy Perry, who added “MY QUEEN,” and Justin Trudeau, Former Prime Minister of Canada, who added, “Happy happy birthday,” joined in wishing Madonna well on social media.

	An accident that's been waiting to happen since 2003: the sound of Radiohead onstage, five madmen attacking the Hail to the Thief songbook. The British rock kingpins' new Hail to the Thief (Live Recordings 2003-2009) is basically a track-for-track remake of their politically charged 2003 prog-punk gem, except with live versions, culled from different tours across six years. Since Radiohead rampaged through the 2000s as the planet's most ferocious live band, a fire-breathing five-headed rock behemoth, it's no surprise the performances are across-the-board great, taken from Dublin, Amsterdam, London, and Buenos Aires. 


Hail to the Thief is an outlier in the Radiohead story — it's the album you can always mention in a bar to get an argument started. Nobody really disagrees about the merits of Kid A or The Bends, but you can argue all night about Hail to the Thief, which is part of the fun. For some of us “There There” will always be the definitive Radiohead classic, the song you'd play for a visiting Martian who asked what this band was all about. There's nothing like the electric jolt of excitement that whipped through the crowd every night at the sight of the roadies wheeling out those “There There” drums for Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien to bang.

	











According to Thom Yorke, the inspiration for the new live package was Hamlet Hail to the Thief, a London theater production blending the Shakespeare play with the Radiohead album, fusing four centuries of murderous political dystopia. “I asked to hear some archive live recordings of the songs,” Yorke said. “I was shocked by the kind of energy behind the way we played. I barely recognized us, and it helped me find a way forward. We decided to get these live recordings mixed and released (it would have been insane to keep them for ourselves). It has all been a very cathartic process. We very much hope you enjoy them.”

	It's welcome news to see Thom Yorke suddenly remembering that there once was a band called Radiohead, and that they were actually very good at playing music. But he's right: it would have been insane not to let the world hear this. It makes you hope there's much more to come, since we have to presume Mr. Yorke did not immerse himself in six years' worth of such glorious live work to conclude, “Eureka! We should release exactly 47 minutes of this.”

Hail to the Thief dropped in the summer of 2003, while the world was still reeling from the one-two punch of Kid A and Amnesiac. Everything about it is divisive. It's their longest album, nearly an hour, but hardly diffuse, since it has a linear hard-rocking momentum unlike anything else in their catalog. It's got their most succinct skull-crush rage bombs, like “2 + 2 = 5” and “Myxomatosis” — the most punk album they ever made. 


	The band didn't play coy about the political anger fueling the album with a title plucked right from the headlines, after the Supreme Court's Bush vs. Gore coup of Dec. 12, 2000, blocking the state of Florida from counting its ballots and delivering the White House to the losing candidate. The loud, mean songs do justice to the political fury, but so do ominously quiet moments like “I Will.” The new live album cuts two tracks from the original studio album, “Backdrifts” and “A Punchup at a Wedding,” to bring it down to vinyl length, with 12 songs in 47 minutes. The vinyl version drops on Oct. 31.


	The weirdest thing about this album? It's only the second Radiohead live album — the first was I Might Be Wrong, from 2001, before Hail to the Thief even happened, and that was just eight songs. They also did their 2007 basement webcasts of In Rainbows (with killer versions of the Smiths' “The Headmasters Ritual” and the Joy Division/New Order stalwart “Ceremony”),  plus the less successful From the Basement reprise for The King of Limbs. But considering the collective magic that Radiohead made happen onstage, tour after tour, all through the 2000s, it's a puzzle there haven't been more archival releases like this. You'd have a tough time naming another 21st-century live band this legendary who've let their peak glory years go so underdocumented.

	It's surprising this album skims over such a wide range of time, rather than (say) focusing on their furious 2003 Hail to the Thief tour, a run never forgotten by anyone who witnessed it. (NYC's Madison Square Garden, 10/09/03 — damn good night.) Most curiously, they've never done a deep dive on their 2008 In Rainbows summer jaunt, a night-by-night serial epic that was followed long-distance by freaks across the world, via mp3 blogs. If you were a music fan that year, one of your joys in life was packing your iPod full of these absolutely bonkers shows. An anthology just devoted to that tour's nightly “National Anthem” or “There There” excursions would be a keeper in itself. 

	











	Radiohead previously released Kid A Mnesia in 2021, a reissue package celebrating the 20-year anniversaries of Kid A and Amnesiac, after doing the same for OK Computer with 2017's OKNOTOK 1997 2017. Yorke is also showing his first museum exhibit as a visual artist, This Is What You Get, in his hometown of Oxford, England. But these Live Recordings give hope that the band might finally open up some of the live treasures currently gathering dust in the vaults. If revisiting these songs was “very cathartic” for Yorke, there's even more greatness where this came from.

Aubrey Plaza made a rare public appearance as a guest on Amy Poehler's Good Hang podcast, where she briefly discussed the grief she's experienced since her husband Jeff Baena died by suicide in January.


	“Overall, I'm here and I'm functioning,” Plaza told Poehler, who asked about her “terrible, terrible, tragic year” early in the episode. “I feel really grateful to be moving through the world. I think I'm okay, but it's a daily struggle, obviously.”


	Plaza and Baena married in 2021 after dating for 10 years. During their impromptu ceremony, the couple wore self-made tie-dye clothes, a call back to one of their pandemic pastimes. When Plaza made her first appearance after his death at the Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary special in February, she wore a tie-dye shirt.


	Plaza used a film comparison to explain what her navigation of grief has been like, prefacing, “This is a really dumb analogy and it was kind of a joke at a certain point, but I actually mean it. Did you see that movie The Gorge?”

	











	The 2025 film stars Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy as sniper guards stationed at the gorge, a pit of mutated and monstrous creatures. “In the movie, there's a cliff on one side and there's a cliff on the other side, then there's a gorge in between and it's filled with all these monster people that are trying to get them,” Plaza explained.


	“I swear when I watched it, I was like that feels like what my grief is like,” she said, “or what grief could be like.” Her grief fills her personal gorge, but there are times when she feels as though she's positioned on either cliff.

	“At all times there's like a giant ocean of awfulness, that's like right there and I can see it,” she said. “Sometimes I just want to dive into it, and just be in it. Then sometimes I just look at it, and sometimes I try to get away from it. But it's always there. It's just always there, and the monster people are trying to get me like Miles Teller.”


	Plaza has found support in her friends, who keep her laughing. “My group of my women friends, we were in an all girl improv group but then we turned into a coven legit — we call ourselves Bombardo,” she said. “We have like a text chain, and we do Zooms and we do trips. Those girls make me laugh really, really hard. Also, we've all known each other for so long. The best thing that makes me laugh is just all my funny friends.”

The song is the latest single from the duo's upcoming "Breach" album.

	If you've ever seen Twenty One Pilots live, then you know that drummer Josh Dun is the strong, silent type. The bashing percussionist for the Columbus, OH duo lets his sticks do the talking, keeping the big beat for the band while singer Tyler Joseph handles vocals, keyboards/piano, ukulele, guitar, bass and anything else he can get his hands on.


	But in the just-released video for the second single from the band's upcoming Breach (Sept. 12) album, “Drum Show,” Dun veers out of his lane to sing his first vocals on a 21P song. The punchy, punk-edged rager mostly driven by Dun's bashing beats and Joseph's rubbery bass and urgent vocals is the follow-up to the album's first single, “The Contract,” which currently sits at No. 1 on the Alternative Airplay chart and is also nominated for best rock at the upcoming 2025 MTV VMAs.

	











	In the bare bones video for the song directed by longtime collaborator Mark Eshleman and shot in their midwestern hometown, Joseph and Dun perform the song in an abandoned parking garage, their gear plugged into a minivan. At points, Dun is playing his kit from inside the car, driving through the night as Joseph sings from the back seat.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“He's puttin' on a drum show/ Even now, even now, even now/ He'll take the longer way homeEven now, even now, even now/ He'll never ever say so,” Joseph sings on the chorus. “He drives fast just to feel it, feel it/ He drives slow if his song's not over/ Drown it out, drown it out.”


	About halfway through, Dun steps up to the mic to sing in his previously unheard, affectingly sweet voice, crooning, “I've been this way/ I want to change/ I've been this way/ I want to change” before Joseph jumps back in with a primal scream of the word “change” amid a cymbal-crashing fury.


	The pair recently announced that they will celebrate the follow-up to last year's Clancy album with  a global listening event at indie record stores around the world a week before their eighth LP's release date. The upcoming LP will pick up on the narrative arc that began with 2015's Blurryface and continued on 2018's Trench, 2021's Scaled and Icy and 2024's Clancy. 21P will kick off the Clancy Tour: Breach 2025 stadium/amphitheater run on Sept. 18 with a show at Cincinnati's TQL soccer stadium.


	In addition to the new single, the band unveiled three exclusive box sets tied to key characters from the new album's story: the Dark Clancy edition, Nova Bishop edition and the Torchbearer edition. Each set will feature a hinged book-style box with a CD tray and lift-up door with unique colors and texture that reveals hidden goodies, including a bandana, stickers, a poster, 24-page booklet and a character ID card; click here for more information on the special editions.

International TV Co-Editor


Pierce Brosnan might be 72, but he'd come out of secret service retirement “in a heartbeat” if new James Bond director Denis Villeneuve wanted him.


	In an interview with the Radio Times, Brosnan joked that he could return to the 007 franchise as a “senior citizen” if called upon for the upcoming movie, which Villeneuve is directing and Steve Knight is writing for Amazon MGM Studios. 


	Brosnan played Bond for seven years between 1995 and 2002 in GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day before hanging up his tuxedo and putting his golden gun into lockup. Asked about whether he might return if asked, he responded cheerfully.

	“My wife Keely [Shaye Smith] and I have been listening to the drumbeat of expectation of who's going to be the next James Bond,” he said. “There are many great candidates out there, and I'm sure they're going to make it a spectacle of delight. I don't think anyone wants to see a craggy, 72-year-old Bond, but if Villeneuve had something up his sleeve I would look at it in a heartbeat. Why not? It's great entertainment. It could be lots of laughs. Bald caps, prosthetics… Who knows?”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Numerous names have been bandied about as the identity of the next Bond, who would replace Daniel Craig, who succeeded Brosnan in 2006's Casino Royale.


	Brosnan was speaking during an interview for The Thursday Murder Club, the Netflix adaptation of Richard Osman's novels about a group of pensioners who solve crimes in their spare time.


	Speaking about ageing, the star said: “The older you get, the freer you get, because mortality is circling the wagons. Within this story, there's a lovely lyricism. These four people want to keep their minds active and they also deal with the death that will befall all of us… And it's all wrapped up in a whodunnit.”


	Brosnan's Thursday Murder Club co-star, Helen Mirren, this week said that Bond “has to be a guy,” adding: “James Bond has to be James Bond, otherwise it becomes something else.”

	











	Brosnan had said in the past it would be “exhilarating” for Bond to be played by a woman, but this week backtracked by telling Saga magazine “it has to be a man.”

Considering the strength of Brosnan's recent work and gravitas, would pay money to see this movie if the scrip is decent.  Better than Tom Holland and Daniel Craig with mommy issues.

Jason Isaacs appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to discuss his Emmy nomination for The White Lotus and guest host Tiffany Haddish did her best to get him to talk about his full frontal nude scene. 


	The actor has previously been reluctant to be part of the conversation about the scene, which involved his character Timothy Ratliff accidentally exposing himself to his children, played by Patrick Schwarzenegger, Sam Nivola, and Sarah Catherine Hook. But Haddish remained fixated on whether or not it was a prosthetic, even spraying Isaacs with water when he seemed to dodge her questions. 


	“It made another appearance,” Isaacs revealed after Haddish sprayed him and said “I want to know about the penis!” He noted that it was “funnier the second time” because the kids yelled, “Dad, put it away!” 


	“But the rest of the scene didn't work,” Isaacs recalled. “And I said, ‘Mike, you cut my second dick [scene].” The actor affirmed that creator Mike White didn't keep both scenes in the episode, but delighted Haddish by being willing to discuss his penis. “You never can talk about penis too much with me,” she told him.

	In March, after the episode in question aired, many viewers speculated about whether it was Isaacs' real member or a prosthetic. In an interview with CBS Mornings, Isaacs addressed the conversation around his character's body part being shown on TV while also dodging anchor Gayle King's question about whether it was actually prosthetic.

	











	A lot of people are debating it. It's all over the internet,” Isaacs said. “And it's interesting because the best actress this year is Mikey Madison at the Oscars. And I don't see anybody discussing her vulva, which was on television all the time… I think it's interesting that there's a double standard for men. But when women are naked — Margaret Qualley as well, in The Substance, nobody would dream of talking to her about her genitalia or her nipples or any of those things. So, it's odd that there's a double standard when it comes to discussing [this].”


	The actor later clarified his comments and apologized. “I said the wrong words in the wrong way. I used the phrase ‘double standard,' which I didn't mean at all,” he told Variety. “There is a [different] double standard — women have been monstrously exploited and men haven't.”

	He added, “I absolutely should not have mentioned those two actresses, whom I respect enormously. Mikey Madison I'm a massive fan of. My point wasn't that men have had a harder time than women — that would be absurd. Women have had a monstrous time on camera forever, and I hope to God that is changing.”


	For what it's worth, Nivola and Hook confirmed to TV Insider that, yes, Isaacs did wear a prosthetic. And he seemed to like wearing it. “It was a prosthetic,” added Hook. “He was very excited to do it. I think he took pride in the prosthetic.” Nivola added, “He's like, ‘It's my fake dick scene today!'”

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Channel 4 and Disney are among the television giants declining to pay annual fees to the UK industry's new independent bullying and harassment complaints body, Deadline can reveal.


	As executives gather in Scotland for the Edinburgh TV Festival, sources said there is growing uncertainty over whether the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority (now commonly known by its CIISA acronym) can be sustained by voluntary contributions, with the body planning to be clearer about funding refuseniks as it bids to secure its future.


	Deadline hears that others yet to pay annual fees include Amazon Prime Video, All3Media, Fremantle, and Banijay. Netflix and Paramount-owned Channel 5 declined to confirm whether they are providing ongoing financial support to CIISA, raising questions about their commitment to the body.

	The BBC, ITV, Sky, Warner Bros. Discovery, BAFTA, and union Bectu have all pledged to make annual payments. Hundreds of other creative industry organizations have also signed up, including the Royal Albert Hall and Royal Shakespeare Company. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The idea of an independent misconduct authority has been kicked around by the industry since the Noel Clarke scandal four years ago, but its existence has become more pressing amid a string of power abuse crises involving the likes of MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace and ITV chef Gino D'Acampo. Both denied wrongdoing.


	The BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, and Sky helped fund CIISA's startup costs in 2022, but as the body begins work, it will rely on annual fees to fund its operating overheads, which will be £2M ($2.7M) next year. 

	











	CIISA is asking stakeholders across TV, film, theater, and music to make annual contributions contingent on their annual revenue. Those with sales of more than £500M have been asked to pay £50,000 into CIISA, while the lowest contribution can be discretionary for companies with revenues of less than £250,000. Keira Knightley and Emerald Fennell are among the stars who have helped CIISA appeal for regular contributions. 


	Channel 4's reluctance to pay ongoing annual fees has raised eyebrows, given its position as a publicly-owned broadcaster with a “zero tolerance” approach to unacceptable behavior following scandals involving stars such as Russell Brand. One person claimed Channel 4 had been “very difficult about coughing up the cash” for future operations, though it has contributed in the past.


	Asked why it is not funding CIISA annually, a spokesperson said: “Channel 4 was an early supporter of CIISA and we have committed to their industry-wide standards. We have made substantial contributions to CIISA over the last two years and are actively engaging with them — most notably focusing on putting in place the appropriate remit, structures, and services to ensure their effectiveness — as we are keen to support them in building their success.”


	Disney, Amazon Prime Video, All3Media, Fremantle, and Banijay declined to comment. The position of these companies is that they remain in constructive conversation with CIISA as they seek clarity on how funding will be used.


Warm Words Not Enough


	In a letter to UK Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee this year, CIISA CEO Jen Smith was unsparing about the financial uncertainty. She said voluntary contributions are taking “much longer than expected,” are “rapidly becoming unfit for purpose,” and that the body cannot survive on goodwill alone. “Warm words must be translated into long-term financial commitments,” she said.


	CIISA has declined to name and shame individual companies, but the organization is changing tack in the coming weeks. Nazir Afzal, a CIISA board member and former prosecutor, said the body will actively publish its funding partners, effectively revealing non-funders by omission. 


	He compared the model, which is still being finalized, to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK's financial services regulator. “If you're looking for a loan or mortgage and your [lender] is not on the FCA website, you're playing with fire,” he told Deadline. “There's a strong case for saying that if your [employer] is not on the CIISA list, then the environment they have is not as safe as it could be.”


	It is not clear whether this will be enough to overcome reservations. Sources at companies that have declined to back CIISA financially have questioned what the money is being spent on. There are also concerns that CIISA's work is duplicative of standards already in place across the industry. “Writing guidance doesn't represent value for money,” said one skeptic. “We would like more clarity over CIISA's long-term remit, its mediation and investigative functions.”


	Afzal acknowledged the concerns and said CIISA is consistently addressing industry questions. He stressed that the body's operating functions are “lean” (it doesn't even have its own office space) and that it will publish accounts to boost transparency. 


	But CIISA is yet to deliver on its central pledge to launch a misconduct reporting service, with the complaints hotline not now expected until next year at the earliest. Eagerly awaited by freelancers, Afzal said CIISA will “find the funding” to deliver the service, even if it is unable to convert the likes of Amazon into fee-paying partners.

	











	Whether the reporting service can be maintained in the long term under a voluntary funding model is unclear. CIISA has held talks with the government about introducing a mandatory levy, as well as making funding contributions a conditional part of accessing tax breaks. 


	Culture secretary Lisa Nandy is considering these proposals, even if Afzal considers them a last resort. A staunch supporter of CIISA, Nandy said in December that she was “astonished” to discover Banijay was not funding the body following the MasterChef misconduct scandal that led to hosts Wallace and John Torode being fired.


	A Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport spokesperson said: “We are looking at ways to ensure that CIISA has proper buy-in and support from across the sector. We are pleased that organisations including Sky, Warner Bros. Discovery and the BBC have taken a strong stand, with the BBC announcing that they expect production companies working with them to support the CIISA standards.” 


	ITV has taken the same step as the BBC and told Deadline it was a “proud ongoing financial supporter of CIISA.”


Lack of Support “Ludicrous”


	Philippa Childs, head of TV industry union Bectu, said it was “ludicrous” that large companies were not making annual payments to CIISA.


	“These contributions are small change to the companies, but vitally important for workers and the reputation of the industry as a whole. Existing reporting mechanisms are not working, and industry heavyweights like these need to put their money where their mouth is if they want to achieve lasting change,” she told Deadline.


	“The only conclusion one can draw from organizations' refusal to sign up, is that they want to continue to be able to protect talent at the expense of the hard-working freelancers whose skills are crucial to the creative industries.”


	Afzal added: “We are here working with all these institutions to deal with decency deficit, to attack the trust deficit and, ultimately, to plug the accountability gap.”

The issue is CIISA doesn't really know what it is . Their business model is totally vague and those at the top have zero clue about the industry . I can understand why studios are reluctant to put money in to  something that has no clear objectives or plan .
CIISA muddied the waters talking about training , accrediting  roles – ? Training already exists,  individuals that have been properly trained or have the experience  in valid roles are represented by industry agents they don't need accrediting .
It's duplication. They should have launched the reporting line a year ago and focused on mediation and support. It's demise will be due to poor implementation,  lack of clear leadership  and focus  which is a pity.

Why does Amazon and Netflix have to pay up for bad behavior of other companies?  That's like asking Ford to pay Geico because people crash cars.

This is kinda fishy.
What other industry has an “Independent Complaints Body” they need to pay into when clearly all these big corporations have their own complaints departments already in place.
I remember the hundreds of articles about WB's investigation of Joss Whedon, Disney's investigation into Johnathon Majors, Netflix and Kevin Spacey, the list goes on and on..
so this article to me just reads as they want more money for their grift.

The BBC and others have all repeatedly failed to properly investigate complaints – including sexual assault – until forced to by outside bodies or lawsuits. Many internal investigations are half-hearted ass covering exercises that keep the alleged abusers in place (ie Hugh Edwards, Russell Brand, Martin Bashir) and the whistleblowers blacklisted. It shows how little genuine interest the companies have in dealing with abuse that they refuse to pay for an organisation many suggested be set up.

It's in their own best interests to support this. Like the MPAA and the BBFC, the industry needs a voluntary outside body that is NOT under government control to deal properly with complaints to keep the government from creating a mandatory body, because governments getting involved only makes matters worse.

CIISA can't conduct investigations. They aren't the police. They have no power to require compliance from the accused. They have no immunity from being sued for libel. 3 million a year for a phone line that might get a call or two a day is ridiculous.

Based on your examples this is very specific to the UK. All the people you list are British.
Why does USA need to foot the bill for a broken studio system across the pond? 

And I wouldn't mention the MPAA as a good thing.

We give you two choices for each honoree: Michael Crawford, Gloria Gaynor, KISS, Sylvester Stallone & George Strait.

	Paul Grein



	By now, you've heard about the five artists who are slated to receive Kennedy Center Honors in December – Michael Crawford, Gloria Gaynor, KISS, Sylvester Stallone and George Strait. At a press conference announcing the honorees, President Trump said he was “98% involved” in the selections and that he'll host the televised ceremony on which these artists are saluted.


	While Trump's involvement will make many view these selections through a partisan lens, we're asking you to put that aside and simply tell us what's your favorite song associated with this year's honorees. We give you two choices for each honoree.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	For Crawford, the Tony-winning star of The Phantom of the Opera, you can choose between his two most famous solos in that show: “The Music of the Night” and “The Phantom of the Opera.”


	For Gaynor, you can choose between her two top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: her discofied remake of The Jackson 5's “Never Can Say Goodbye” and her Grammy-winning No. 1 smash “I Will Survive.”




	For KISS, you can choose between their rock anthem “Rock and Roll All Nite” and their image-broadening ballad “Beth,” the band's first top 10 hit on the Hot 100.


	For Stallone, you can choose between Hot 100-topping hits from two of his Rocky movies: Bill Conti's “Gonna Fly Now” and Survivor's “Eye of the Tiger.” Both songs were Oscar-nominated for best original song. (Fun Fact: Stallone is this year's only Kennedy Center Honors recipient who is associated with two No. 1 Hot 100 hits.)


	For Strait, you can choose between “Amarillo by Morning,” a 1983 hit that has long been a fan favorite, and “Check Yes or No,” one of his record 44 No. 1 hits on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart.


	What's your favorite of these 10 songs associated with this year's Kennedy Center Honorees? Vote!

Gal Gadot is taking another bite of the poison apple and continuing to talk about Snow White‘s box office failure, particularly, yup, October 7's role in the flop. Over the weekend, comments Gadot made to an Israeli interviewer went viral. She said, “I was positive the movie was going to be a huge hit. And then October 7 happened.” It probably isn't advisable to explain a Disney remake's failure with “And then October 7 happened,” but that's what happened. However, more recently, Gadot attempted to clarify her statements on Instagram Stories, saying that she answered “from an emotional place.”

“When the film came out, I felt that those who are against Israel criticized me in a very personal, almost visceral way,” she wrote. “They saw me first and foremost as an Israeli, not as an actress. That's the perspective I spoke from.”

“The film didn't fail solely because of external pressures. There are many factors that determine why a film succeeds or fails, and success is  never guaranteed.”

Here are her full comments (per Hollywood Reporter):

“I was honored to join an extraordinary interview with inspiring  interviewers, whose questions go straight to the heart. Sometimes we respond to questions from an emotional place. When the film came out, I  felt that those who are against Israel criticized me in a very personal,  almost visceral way. They saw me first and foremost as an Israeli, not as an actress. That's the perspective I spoke from when I answered the  question. Of course, the film didn't fail solely because of external pressures. There are many factors that determine why a film succeeds or  fails, and success is never guaranteed …”

Would it have been so hard to say the dwarfs looked bad? But we digress. Namely, because much of the blowback toward the film surrounded her co-star, Rachel Zegler, who became a culture war target well before release. Such viral moments of Facebook outrage included the pearl-clutching surrounding her joking that Prince Charming “stalks” Snow White and posting “free Palestine” on Instagram. Two weeks after the movie bombed, a Variety report dropped the blame at Zegler's feet, framing her concern for Gazans, who are currently enduring a famine among many other alleged war crimes, as the reason for the film's failure.

Nevertheless, in Gadot's original sentiments, she said she “really had fun. Even working alongside Rachel Zegler. We laughed and we talked.” Still, it's a little rich to hear Gadot say there was “a lot of pressure put on celebrities, actors, creators to post against Israel” when posting against Israel can get you arrested and deported.

Here are Gadot's full comments from the talk show:

“I really enjoyed filming that movie, I really had fun. Even working alongside Rachel Zegler. We laughed and we talked, we had fun. I was positive the movie was going to be a huge hit. And then Oct. 7 happened,  and what happened all over in different industries, not just Hollywood, there was a lot of pressure put on celebrities, actors, creators to post against Israel. And it happened. I can always explain and try to give people in the world context about the situation and the reality in Israel, and I always do that. But at the end, people make up their own minds. And I was disappointed that the movie was incredibly affected by all of that and that it didn't do well at the box office. But it is what it is, you win some, you lose some.”

He might have an invested stake in late-night TV enterprise, but Jimmy Kimmel doesn't believe CBS and Paramount's reason for canceling The Late Show With Stephen Colbert was “a purely financial decision.” The Late Show remains the format's most popular program, and, in fact, makes lots of money, according to Kimmel. Speaking to Variety, Kimmel calls reports that Colbert's show was losing $40 million a year “beyond nonsensical.” How does he know? He makes one of these. Apparently, “these alleged insiders” analyzing budgets don't know what they're talking about, Kimmel argues. For one thing, they focus solely on advertising and ignore affiliate fees. Affiliate fees, or carriage fees, generate hundreds of millions of dollars—”probably in total billions”—from stations around the country. Those station affiliates cannot produce as much programming as NBC, so they pay the network for programming, which includes late-night shows. “You must allocate a certain percentage of those fees to late-night shows,” he continues. “It really is surprising how little the media seems to know about how the media works. There's just not a snowball's chance in hell that that's anywhere near accurate.”

Apparently, Kimmel has more optimism toward late-night viability than, say, TV-personality-turned-podcaster Conan O'Brien. Still, he admits that there's “no question” of network TV's decline, but “more people are watching late-night TV than ever. I include Johnny Carson in that. People may find that shocking.” Okay, let's hear him out.

According to Kimmel, at Carson's peak, The Tonight Show averaged around 9 million viewers a night with “the lead-in shows getting 30 and 40 million.” Today, it's more fragmented. People are watching the shows “in different places,” and there are more of them. Until The Late Show debuted, it was essentially just Carson. Today, Seth Meyers pulls 2 million views on “YouTube alone. We're not even talking about Instagram.” Kimmel's monologues “get between 2 and 5 million.” Jon Stewart gets 5 million. If you add online views to TV ratings (in Kimmel's case, an average of about 1.77 million per night) and DVR, you get pretty close to Carson. Anyway, he's right that people still watch this stuff, including the president, who watches enough of it to be mad at these guys and predict their cancellation all the fucking time.

Summer vacation looks good on longtime HGTV star Alison Victoria, who's been turning heads with her latest social media posts, full of photos from a 2025 getaway to Greece alongside her filmmaker beau, Brandt Andersen. 

In two separate posts on August 16 and 17, Victoria — whose new show, “Sin City Rehab,” premieres in September — shared multiple photos of herself posing in a hot pink string bikini at the beach. Fans flooded the 43-year-old designer's posts with compliments and questions about how she stays so fit.

Over 8,000 followers liked Victoria's first post, which she captioned, “Postcards from Spetses 🇬🇷💙🩵.” Spetses is a small island that Vogue has called “the Greek elite's favorite holiday hotspot.”

Victoria's post included photos of her on the shoreline, a video of her diving into the water, a collection of seashells, a snapshot of her enjoying a meal in a yellow bikini, scenic views, and an image of her and Andersen's legs intertwined as they sunbathed. 

The “Windy City Rehab” star thanked one fan who wrote, “I've followed you for years and I have to say, this is the happiest I've ever seen you and I'm so happy for you because you deserve it!! ❤️”

Fans and friends flooded the post with compliments, with many calling the pics “stunning,” including Victoria's fertility doctor, Roohi Jeelani. 

One fan wrote, “My favorite HGTV designer! Love ya girl! Looking stunning per the usual! 🔥”

Another commented, “Wow! What is your workout routine? Seriously post a video based on workouts and nutrition! 🖤🤍”

Victoria's second post from Greece, on August 17, began with a pic of her sunbathing in her pink bikini while floating on a bright yellow inner tube. Other snapshots included her posing in her swimsuit with her back arched against a tree trunk and another as she stood on her tiptoes in front of a white wall near the ocean. 

Fans celebrated her pics on that post too, with one writing, “looking amazing girlie!! 😘” and another calling her “smokin' hot.”

Other pics Victoria shared included Greek design elements like charming doors and windows, picturesque scenes of boats on the water, and multiple shots of her and Andersen snuggling. 

The couple went Instagram official in June 2024, when Victoria shared multiple photos with him at the Daytime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, when “Windy City Rehab” was nominated for an Emmy. The couple has traveled all over the world together during the second half of the year as he promoted “The Stranger's Case,” his feature film directorial debut. 

On January 31, Victoria posted a carousel of photos from another tropical getaway with Andersen, beginning with a sultry pic of her in a different string bikini, leaning in as she kissed Andersen aboard a catamaran.

Let's just say it: Hollywood creators look down on digital creators. The fashion gurus and family lifestylers and cats with nearly 16 million followers are all the rage, but they've got nothing to do with the work that goes into creating Oscar- and Emmy- winning film and TV. 

But what if all those Instagram and TikTok icons knew how to teach Hollywood veterans how to get an edge in being hired to create all that award-winning work? Instead of keeping a password-protected reel, why shouldn't an art director use social profiles as an engaging and public-facing portfolio?

 










That's the pitch for Flipping the Script, a two-day course sponsored by G&B's College of Influence. It's the online education arm of the 10-year-old management company, which reps more than 100 content creators (including the ones linked above). Now G&B wants to hand its playbook to Hollywood's below-the-line talent.

Before you give in to oh good, more influencers are just what we need, consider that when IMDb launched in the ‘90s industry response ranged somewhere between polite curiosity and WTAF. 

 










Today, an IMDb profile is the first thing anyone checks when hiring or starting a new job: Who are these people I'm working with and what are they about? However, the platform founded 35 years ago also shows its age: static profiles, clunky updating, and limited personalization.

It's not a stretch to imagine that personal branding becomes the new norm for everyone who makes Hollywood run. 

G&B director of education Joey Gagliardi reframes social media as a professional tool. “Why keep your reel hidden when you can publish your work, put paid [boosting] behind it, and build an audience that proves your skills?,” he said. “That audience can translate into jobs and collaborations.”

While the company brokers thousands of sponsorship deals each year for clients ranging from Chanel to Walmart, that's not the goal here. 

“I don't think at this time we're the most knowledgeable about how to take a film editor and get them into a brand deal,” said G&B founder Kyle Hjelmeseth. “We're teaching the tools that influencers have refined over the last 15 years. How to share your ideas, showcase your craft, and let people see your creative point of view.”

For crew members, it's less about follower counts and more about showcasing artistry — inventive editing, lighting rigs, or world-building — while also signaling they're available for work.

 










“It's an investment in yourself,” Gagliardi said. “You're building a brand, and that brand is what makes studios, producers, and eventually even audiences invest in you.”

So if Hjelmeseth and Gagliardi aren't looking to launch a division for craft artists, why the two-day seminar at Soho Works? It's the first in-person class for the online school, and it's free.

The G&B principals like to talk about sharing their tools and seeing what comes from it. “The innovative moment — the true mashup of entertainment and creators — hasn't happened yet,” Hjelmeseth said. “We want to be part of defining what that looks like.”

Sure, but there's also this: Teaching guild and academy members how to think like digital creators starts to level the playing field. When the establishment starts to behave like the upstarts, it gives the upstarts — like the people G&B manage — a leg up. 

“We've been doing this for 10 years. We know the tools, we know how this works,” Hjelmeseth said. “If we can give creatives a way to put their ideas out there and help them stay employed, that's worth it.”

It's also worth noting that the school creates custom, paid courses for consultations. If this really does become the new normal, how big is that market? One word: IMDb.

 










G&B and Soho Works will host Flipping the Script August 21 and September 4 at Soho Works in West Hollywood. Registration is free and limited to members of the film and TV academies as well as guild members. 

This essay from the Obsolete Media Substack celebrates the independent video rental stores that remain in business and wonders if an abundance of instant choice is eroding our ability to appreciate media. 

Independent filmmakers are constantly being told that distributors are unlikely to help them in the way that they might have 20 years ago, and that the way to succeed in today's marketplace is to take the business side of the equation into your own hands. It's great advice, but that means we have to learn the kinds of industry secrets that were once reserved for distributors and publicist. This breakdown of the annual film calendar and the best times for indie releases is a great resource for anyone with a completed film who is thinking about taking the next step.

 










A favorite topic of many film historians are the projects that our favorite writer-directors unsuccessfully tried to make. Writing for the Film School Sucks Substack, Adam Petrey offers an appreciation of the ways that unproduced screenplays from great filmmakers went on to shape their artistic development — and in some cases, even contributed to their legacies. It's a reminder that writing your passion projects is always a worthwhile endeavor, even if the current market seems unreceptive to them.

Quibi was one of the more public failures in recent entertainment history, but does its bet on big-budget, short-form narrative content make more sense with the benefit of hindsight? This essay explores whether Quibi could have worked in a different era or with better execution, circling around a question that will help define the next era of filmmaking: is the appeal of short-form content inherently tied to its DIY relatability, or will we ever see our movie stars and auteurs lending their talents to short-form stories?

Writing for his Amauteur Substack, filmmaker Adam Kritzer offers a detailed recounting of the kind of indie film rollout that's much more realistic than the pie-in-the-sky success stories we often hear: a premiere at a respected regional festival followed by an online release that failed to translate much of the interest it generated into financial value. It's a compelling read for anyone with even a passing interest in film distribution, and filled with vital lessons for filmmakers crafting their own release strategies.

Five decades into her career, the Cuban American legend — along with Shakira, Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello and more — reflects on her legacy in Latin music.

Deputy Editor, Billboard Español


Gloria Estefan remembers vividly the first time she met her husband, Emilio Estefan Jr. “He had short shorts, he had great legs, playing the accordion — he looked naked,” she says with a laugh while reflecting on a moment that would change their lives forever.


	She was at a friend's house putting a band together for one night, and Emilio, who knew her friend, showed up to give them some pointers. “I was sitting on the floor and I thought, ‘Wow, this guy has charisma,' ” she recalls. “He left, we did our gig, everybody went their separate ways.”

	











	That summer, the two would meet again at a wedding that her mother had dragged her to. He was part of the band, playing Van McCoy's “The Hustle” on the accordion when she spotted him — this time in a tux. “We run into each other in a doorway, and he goes, ‘You're that girl!' and I go, ‘Yeah, you're that guy.' ‘Come sing with the band!' And I go, ‘Ahhhh.' ” By then, she was known within the community, and many guests had heard her play guitar and sing since she was a kid.




			Trending on Billboard		







	So she obliged and performed two Latin classics, “Sabor a Mí” and “Tú Me Acostumbraste,” earning both an ovation from the guests and an invitation from Emilio to formally join the band. Gloria Maria Milagrosa Fajardo, then 18 years old, working two jobs and about to start college, politely declined.

	











	“He found my number and called me two weeks later,” Gloria continues, beaming. It was her grandmother who made her see the light. “‘You aren't going to be happy in your life unless you share your gift,' ” she recalls her saying. “ ‘Listen to me and not your mother.' And I did. I joined the band for fun.”


	“I really liked the metal in her voice,” Emilio says. “I thought there was a sound for the new generation that was bilingual — the Miami Sound — and I said, ‘This would be good, because it would be something new in the music industry, and she can sing both in English and Spanish.'


	“I think that Gloria and I, it was destiny, because we both found happiness in music amidst all the tragedy we were going through,” he adds. “I didn't have my mom, I didn't have anyone, and I was obsessed with being able to carry a sound that I thought was unique. And also, the need [as a Cuban immigrant] — everything I saved would be used to bring my mother, my brother, my whole family [to the U.S.].” As for Gloria, “I saw her sad — her father went to the Bay of Pigs. When he came back, he went to Vietnam, and when he came back from Vietnam, he came back in a wheelchair. But when it came to making music, her eyes shone.”


	Now that 50 years have passed, Gloria adds, “Every step of the way has continued to be fun.”


	Since rising to stardom in the 1980s as the lead vocalist of Miami Sound Machine and later as a solo artist, Gloria has helped infuse Latin flavor into English-language pop music, breaking barriers with hits like 1985's top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit “Conga” — which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame this year — and “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” — which was inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2017 — while also singing in Spanish.

	











	She has placed 29 songs on the Hot 100 — three of them at No. 1 (“Anything for You” in 1988, “Don't Wanna Lose You” in 1989 and “Coming Out of the Dark ” in 1991) — and 31 tracks on the Hot Latin Songs chart, 15 of which reached the top (from “Si Voy a Perderte” in 1989 to “Hotel Nacional” in 2012).


	Her first Spanish-language album, Mi Tierra (1993), spent an impressive 58 weeks at the summit of Top Latin Albums and earned her the first of her four Grammy Awards. Her latest, Raíces, debuted in the top 10 of the Tropical Albums chart, while the title track landed atop Latin Airplay, Tropical Airplay and Latin Pop Airplay. In between, 2000's Alma Caribeña debuted and spent seven weeks at No. 1 on Top Latin Albums and 2007's 90 Millas debuted and spent three weeks at the top of the same chart.


	“Gloria Estefan is a global icon, a true artist with endless talent, but above all, she's a wonderful person,” says Afo Verde, chairman/CEO of Sony Music Latin Iberia. “Her trust in Sony Music throughout her career speaks to a relationship based on professionalism, passion, love and respect. She's an essential part of the company's heart.”


	“Gloria Estefan represents the best of our music and our history,” adds Alex Gallardo, president of Sony Music U.S. Latin. “Her legacy is eternal, and her generosity and spirit continue to inspire all of us who have the privilege of working with her.”


	Gloria has also proved to be a talented author — she's written two children's books — and an actor with a comedic edge in her performance as the no-nonsense mother in the 2022 remake of Father of the Bride alongside Andy Garcia. She also co-hosted Red Table Talk: The Estefans, a spinoff of the popular talk show Red Table Talk, featuring her daughter, Emily Estefan, and niece Lili Estefan.

	











	It's a remarkable career for the Cuban American star, who in 2023 became the first Latina inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and in 2024 received the Legend Award at the Billboard Latin Women in Music ceremony for her lifetime achievements — all while balancing work and family and putting her loved ones first.


	And many have not only noticed but been inspired by her, inside and outside the Latin music world.


	“To have that sound and go mainstream, topping the pop charts, was groundbreaking and really incredible. What she and Miami Sound Machine did influenced music, food, television, fashion,” American pop icon Cyndi Lauper, her contemporary and friend, tells Billboard Español. “Gloria is a true cultural phenomenon. And on top of that, she and Emilio are the salt of the earth. Such great people, generosity of spirit, caring, leading by example to change to world. People throw these kinds of words around a lot, but the Estefans really did change the world.”


	“Gloria and Emilio have been a true family to me. They've always made me feel at home, and when the U.S. was a new country for me, they supported me every step of the way,” Colombian superstar Shakira recalls. “Gloria was a role model, a true inspiration … She accompanied me throughout my crossover as a mentor and a friend, helping me translate my lyrics from Spanish to English [for the 2001 album Laundry Service] while maintaining their essence when I hadn't yet mastered the language.”


	“Gloria is a hero to me, not only for being a pioneer in music and opening doors for Latinos in the industry but also for what she represents as a human being,” Cuban American star Camila Cabello says. “Beyond her talent, her humility, her passion for her people, her fight for our shared dream of a free Cuba make her even more admirable and adored by all.”

	











	A mother of two and a proud grandmother of one, Gloria now chooses her projects carefully, based not only on what moves her but also how much time and travel it will take. “A lot of it has to do with, ‘Is it going to take me away from my family?' ” she says. “If it's something that is going to take me away from my grandson's life and miss big chunks of it — that's high on my list of priorities. He is growing so fast.” She also feels she's earned that precious time. She will do an occasional concert but not a full, big tour like she used to in the '80s and '90s, when she was at the peak of her stardom. “[Touring] is wonderful because I get to be with the fans, but it is like boot camp for me,” she explains. “I've worked really hard in my life, and I think, ‘Did I really work that hard to work this hard?' ”


	In the last few years, she's been busy creating songs for an upcoming Broadway musical titled BASURA (Spanish for “garbage”) along with her daughter. Based on the 2015 award-winning documentary Landfill Harmonic, it will narrate the journey of Paraguay's Recycled Orchestra, a group of young artists who turn scrap material into musical instruments.


	So when Emilio presented her with the idea for the song “Raíces” a couple of years ago, Gloria, who usually writes or co-writes her own music, got excited.


	“Emilio didn't even realize [this year] was my 50th [career anniversary],” says Gloria, who wanted to do something special to celebrate. “I told him, ‘Babe, I can't change my mindset for this, but I would like, if I do an album again, for it to be tropical, for it to be in Spanish.' He says, ‘Do you trust me?' I go, ‘Who else am I going to trust [other] than you?' ”

	











	Released May 30 on Sony Music Latin, Raíces contains 13 tracks mostly co-written by Emilio. Salsa, bolero and tropical rhythms resonate in songs ranging from the title track and “La Vecina (No Sé Na')” to romantic tunes such as “Tan Iguales y Tan Diferentes,” “Te Juro,” “Agua Dulce” and “Tú y Yo.”


	“He wrote his own love songs for me to sing to him!” Gloria jokes.


	Among the songs she penned is the sweet “Mi Niño Bello (Para Sasha),” dedicated to her grandson, with an English version titled “My Beautiful Boy (For Sasha).” Another track on the album, “Cuando el Tiempo Nos Castiga” (co-written by Emilio and Gian Marco and originally recorded by Jon Secada in 2001), also has a new English version courtesy of Gloria titled “How Will You Be Remembered.”


	Gloria sat with Billboard for a trip down memory lane leading straight to the future.


Going back to your beginnings, what do you remember about your start in the music business? You've said in the past that you were shy.


	It's not that I was shy, because one-on-one I was perfectly fine and I could handle any situation. I was an observer. But what I don't like is to be the center of attention; that's just not my nature. So to join the band, it was for fun. I never thought, “Oh, I'm going to be famous,” or “I'm going to do these crazy things.” No.


And there was a really nice guy in that band…


	He was, but I saw him as a man. He was only four-and-a-half years older than me, but he was very responsible, and he took care of his parents. He worked during the day, he studied at night, he had side jobs, he had businesses. I saw him as “Oh, Mr. Estefan,” you know, the boss … I didn't start dating him until a year after. He had an older girlfriend, let me tell you. She was 36, he was 22. And I didn't think he would be interested in me. I had zero experience, never went out anywhere because I took care of my dad [who had multiple sclerosis]. Joining the band was a freeing experience, and marrying him was an even more freeing experience. I didn't think I'd get married the day after I turned 21. I had no doubt that I wanted to be with him the rest of my life. We've made a very unique partnership, and a lot of the things we've accomplished [are] because we're together.

	











When did you realize that you had really made it in music?


	When “Conga” crossed charts in Billboard, I thought, “OK, they're getting it, they're understanding what we have believed all along could happen.” And look, that song is now going to the Grammy Hall of Fame [after] 40 years.


Which three songs do you consider to be the most important in your career and why?


	“Conga,” clearly. Probably “Mi Tierra.” And “Con Los Años Que Me Quedan,” [which] became a love song and a wedding song and it's the first song that Emilio and I wrote together way back in the day. But there are so many more!


OK, tell me two more.


	If we're going to be real, “Dr. Beat,” which actually broke through, but I didn't write that one. “Anything for You,” my very first No. 1. And “Coming Out of the Dark,” which was a big thank-you to everyone that sent prayers my way after the accident. That song poured out of me in 10 minutes. [In March 1990, Gloria was in a tour bus accident that resulted in a broken back and temporary paralysis. She underwent surgery and a lengthy recovery.]


I remember the first time you sang it live, at the American Music Awards.


	Oh, gosh, it was insane. I wanted to kill Emilio because Dick Clark had called Emilio in September [1990], so I was still at a point where I couldn't move by myself anywhere. And Emilio actually came to me to tell me that Dick Clark wanted me to perform the following January. I was inside this body that didn't feel familiar. I was relearning everything: how to walk, how to wash my face and not be in pain. The last thing that I'm going to think about is getting on a stage. I want to be able to walk and get a glass of water by myself. I want to not put my family through what I went through [with my father] if I could help it. He was nuts. I said, “Babe, I can't.” And then he told Dick Clark, “I can't convince her; you're going have to.” And Dick Clark got on a plane and flew to Miami to talk me into [the performance].

	











Did that help you with the recovery in any way?


	It did. Emilio, as usual, was right. My first outing three months after the accident was to the studio, because I felt so bad for him that he hadn't left my side. He said, “I have this piece of paper that I wrote this thing on the day you had the accident, in the helicopter. I found it today in my pant pocket.” It was all washed. He hands it to me. I look at it and I go, “Why is it in English?” (Laughs.) And it said: “Coming out of the dark.” He said, “I would love for you to come to the studio. Jon Secada is going to meet me there.” And I went, for him. And when I heard the one melody line of (Sings.) “coming out of the dark” that Jon sang, it was like, Oh, my God. And it all poured through me. That's what I was going to perform at the American Music Awards. Having that goal really helped me to focus and not just deambular [wander]. Even though every day I was focused on getting better, it gave me a date to shoot for.


Is there anything you miss doing or wish you could do without being recognized?


	Nothing stops me from doing anything I want. I was talking to my grandson about that the other day, because he and I would get in a car and go to an escape room and inevitably someone would ask for a picture. He knows I'm always going to stop. He always says, “I'll take the picture.” He's very kind about it. My kids lived a different experience, because that part of it — when you are at the top, you literally can't go anywhere because it becomes impossible. It creates a scene, people go crazy, you divert from the kids. Even though I told them, “If we're in public, I'm never going to say no to an autograph, because we have a moment to either make them happy or possibly traumatized from approaching anyone.” They understood, but it was harder for them. That's why I love this moment when, yes, we have a beautiful career and I still get the love, people ask me for hugs, but it's not the craziness of that moment when you're new, fresh; the fame is huge.

	











As one of the most stable and beloved couples in Latin music, how do you and Emilio keep the spark alive?


	Oh, my gosh. He makes me laugh every day. And if he goes on a trip, I'll go to brush my teeth and there's a little note: “Babe, I'm going to miss you.” He draws a little thing, him with the guitar or something. He's just very sweet and thoughtful. He would buy me stuff all year-round, to the point where I tell him, “Babe, please, I don't need any more jewelry,” but he's happy doing that. Me mima, he spoils me in so many ways. And I try to do the same for him. We're excited, we love being with each other, we miss each other. We don't sleep the same when we're apart. It just becomes deeper, and there's a lot of respect and admiration.


Is there anything you still would like to achieve professionally?


	This was always my go-to answer, and it's getting a little more difficult to envision it, but if it were to happen within the next few years, to sing in a free Cuba. Somehow that dream, every time we feel a piece of it — like what happened July 11 [of 2021 with the anti-government demonstrations] and we thought, “Oh, maybe this is it, maybe this is the moment” — it dissipates under the crushing weight of that dictatorship. Celia [Cruz] had that dream, too, and it wasn't in the cards.


As the closing song on Raíces, “How Will You Be Remembered,” goes, how do you wish to be remembered?


	I actually wrote a song answering that exact question years ago, and the title is “Remember Me With Love.” That's all I hope. That when people think about me, either because of my music or the way I represented the culture or family life, they remember me with love, there's a smile on their face and they play the music a lot.

HUNTR/X and Saja Boys each boast two songs in the Global 200's top five.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X and Saja Boys may do battle in Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, but the acts team up to claim four of the top five on the Billboard Global 200 chart.


	HUNTR/X's “Golden” adds a fifth nonconsecutive week at No. 1 on both the Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts. In July, the song became the first leader on each list for the act, whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI.

	











	Meanwhile, HUNTR/X earns its second top five Global 200 hit, as “How It's Done” jumps 8-5.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In between the trio's two top five entries, Saja Boys rise 4-3 with “Soda Pop,” which returns to its best placement, and 5-4 with “Your Idol,” which has also reached No. 3. Both songs are performed by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee.


	Since the Global 200 began in September 2020, four elite albums — by two superstars — other than the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack have generated as many as four concurrent top five hits. Taylor Swift monopolized the entire top five in the debut chart weeks for her LPs The Tortured Poets Department (May 4, 2024), 1989 (Taylor's Version) (Nov. 11, 2023) and Midnights (Nov. 5, 2022), while Drake held Nos. 2-5 the week that Certified Lover Boy made its chart start (Sept. 18, 2021).


	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	











	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.


	“Golden” leads the Global 200 with 117.8 million streams (down less than 1% week-over-week) and 14,000 sold (up 7%) worldwide in the week ending Aug. 14.


	As for the only song not from the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack in the Global 200's top five, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. 2 after 10 weeks on top beginning in May.


	“Golden” tops Global Excl. U.S. with 86.1 million streams (down 1%) and 7,000 sold (up 8%) outside the U.S.


	“Ordinary” keeps at No. 2 on Global Excl. U.S., following eight weeks at No. 1 starting in May; BLACKPINK's “Jump” repeats at No. 3, after it led in its debut week in July; “Soda Pop” is steady at its No. 4 high; and “Your Idol” rises 8-5, returning to its best rank.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated Aug. 23, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Aug. 19. For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard's subscription-based service. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.

Sharon Stone knows a thing or two about Basic Instincts. She's starred in two of them. Having played Basic Instinct‘s femme fatale, Cathrine Tramell, in Paul Verhoeven's 1992 original and the 2006 sequel, Stone must've been surprised to hear that Amazon MGM reportedly paid Basic screenwriter Joe Eszterhas $4 million to write an “anti-woke” reboot. How does one un-woke the infamously progressive tale of a coked-out detective shooting two tourists before becoming the target of an icepick-wielding murderer? And isn't “sleepy” the opposite of “woke”? Why would anyone want a sleepy erotic thriller? That's for Eszterhas and his $4 million to figure out. In the meantime, Ms. Stone would like to send the team behind the reboot a hardy “good fucking luck.”

“If it goes the way the one I was in went, then I would just say I do not know why you would do it,” Stone told The Today Show while drawing on her Basic Instinct 2 experience. “I mean, go ahead, but good fucking luck.”

No luck needed. It won't be easy coming up with an erotic thriller based entirely on being annoyed that a co-worker included preferred pronouns in their email bio. But that's a knot for the millionaire screenwriter to untangle. Considering MGM blew $70 million on the 2006 sequel for a return only slightly more than they're paying the screenwriter, their instincts are working just fine.

Erin Brown Thomas submitted to film festivals more than 900 times before she made it into the Harvard of indie cinema, AKA Sundance. Ask the multi-hyphenate “Chasers” filmmaker and artistic director of Salute Your Shorts Fest — an annual film event that returned to Los Angeles this weekend (August 15-17) for its ninth year — about her recent achievement, and she'll give you pithy advice like a private movie tutor.

“A prophet's going to prophet, even if there's no profit,” she recently quipped of her passion to IndieWire. 

A psychologically lush episodic pilot shot as a 31-minute oner, “Chasers” sees Brown Thomas reflect on the many personal and professional sacrifices she feels she had to make to compete in entertainment. The fearless filmmaker has faced a lot of headwinds over the years but continues to find comfort in the Salute community, which balances artists with unique POVs and supporting authenti, good craft.

“Balancing convention with invention is one of the sweet spots in our lineup at Salute,” explained Brown Thomas. “Our mantra has always been, ‘Films with aftertaste.' When we give you a laurel, it means we believe you have a future. Whenever someone picks the festivals they're submitting to, I always tell them they should make sure that that laurel they could win actually means something. Ours absolutely does.”

 










Salute Your Shorts brings together a growing network of like-minded creators each summer. Co-founded by Brown Thomas and Becky Murdoch in 2017, the small but mighty fest takes place at the Assistance League Theater in LA. “For eight of our nine years, we've been in our current venue,” said Brown Thomas. “People might know it from ‘The Office,' the TV show, because Andy does a play there. But it's nestled behind Home Depot and Target in Hollywood, with a wonderful projector and only 300 seats.”

In 2025, lead organizer Brown Thomas, executive director Elle Shaw, and programming director Lauren Reid Brown (Brown Thomas' mother) received just over 1,300 submissions for Salute. The staff, which also includes programmers Jillian Corsie, Vincent DeLuca, and Kath Tolentino — and associate programmers Christopher Francis and Anna Long — showed about 60 films in 16 awards categories. 

“Having someone close to you who really believes in your thing, who will tell you that whatever festival that rejected you is so stupid and that they are just so wrong, is vital,” Brown Thomas said of dealing with rejection. “You need that. With distance, you'll either learn that you weren't ready and you're improving, or that they really were stupid and they were wrong, and hey! The people who love you already knew that.”

 










The Assistance League Theater feels distinctly intimate and SoCal, but Salute Your Shorts pushes the boundaries of storytelling in a broader philosophical sense with its programming. IndieWire judged the genre section and awarded the top prize to Zoe Davidson's “Clementine,” with “Two People Exchanging Saliva” from Alexandre Singh and Natalie Musteata named as our runner-up.

Over the years, acclaimed filmmakers — from the beloved Duplass brothers to the Daniels of “Everything Everywhere All at Once” — have visited Salute. “A Lien” from executive producer Adam McKay went onto the 97th Academy Awards and was at the festival last year. Salute aims to become an Oscar-qualifying shorts competition in the future. Its documentary, animation, and narrative contests are juried.

In honor of the 9th Salute Your Shorts Fest, IndieWire pays tribute to bite-sized films with nine essential tips for festival submissions from Brown Thomas. Find a complete list of winners for SYSF 2025 below. 

Once you know about FilmFreeway, your potential in the festival world grows exponentially.

“Up until the day that I decided that I wanted to make a film festival, I had only been using it as a filmmaker,” said Brown Thomas. “Then, I did a little clicking around and I figured out you can create a film festival just as easily as you can create a film profile. That's truly all it takes.”

 










Creating a compelling first impression anywhere online can be time-consuming, but Brown Thomas says it's specifically worth it for artists on FilmFreeway. Not only does the portal allow you to explore new festivals, but it can also help you keep track of who you've already paid to screen your short. If you learn that a certain type of competition isn't working for your project, then you can adjust the types of festivals you're submitting to — or improve the impression you're making by fixing your profile first.

“A lot of filmmakers really don't use their page to their advantage,” said Brown Thomas, walking IndieWire through her evolving appreciation of the platform. Her first suggestion? “Not enough people invest in hiring a poster designer,” she said. “Really. More people will see your poster over the span of your career than your movie. Whether they're on FilmFreeway or IMDB, that's a fact.”

No amount of marketing can fix a bad movie, but as a programmer, Brown Thomas has learned that you can “teach” festivals how to consider your work while screening. “The first audience you're marketing to is programmers,” she said. “And you can show us how to see your film through the way you choose to talk about it and in the images you choose to accompany your application.”

 










After you've finished your project (and beefed up your profile and poster for FilmFreeway), Brown Thomas recommends thoroughly combing your application to ensure that your enthusiasm shines through. Whenever possible, filmmakers should aim to play festivals that want to show their movies — but that's a two-way street and it's important to express your earnest desire for the opportunity.

“Look, there are plenty of cases with Salute where I haven't cared that their poster was terrible, or whatever,” she said. “But sometimes, you have to make a choice and it comes down to feeling like you can tell how much this filmmaker wants it, but ‘Oh, this person seems like they just submitted to submit.'”

Festivals can use smoke and mirrors too, of course. “Scam is a spectrum,” said Brown Thomas. “On one far side, you've got the people who are not following through on their basic promises. These are often online events that either don't exist or feel totally different from what was advertised.”

You can save yourself a lot of hassle by doing your research, but if you've already submitted to a seemingly legitimate festival, and you're not getting good results, there can be nefarious reasons for that too. “Without naming names, there are plenty of festivals that just do not put enough care into programming,” Brown Thomas said. “Maybe there's less rhyme or reason as to what's getting selected, or it could be, ‘Oh, wow, these people are really only selecting their friends.' That's a version of a scam.”

 










There are festivals in the middle, as well. “It can also be, ‘Well, this festival is doing everything it says it's going to do, but it doesn't add a lot of value,'” she said. “You'll think, ‘They're nice people, and they mean well. But that laurel just doesn't mean enough.' Always ask, ‘Is this how I want to spend my money?'”

Much like recruiters at universities, festival organizers will consider different criteria depending on the lineup they're programming for, and their choices can shift based on any number of factors. You should have a matrix of considerations for when and where you apply with your film, as well. 

“One category of festival that I definitely think is worth submitting to is the Tax Deductible Vacation,” said Brown Thomas, giggling. “This is a business trip where you are going to have a lovely time. Think of like, the Sedona International Film Festival or the Hawaii Film Festival. If you've never been hiking along those beautiful vistas, and you think you can take your film there, take your film there.”

Another festival type to consider? Something Brown Thomas likes to call “The Artist's Date.” Citing two beloved events for the filmmaker in Colorado — Crested Butte Film Festival and Ouray International Film Festival — she said, “They feel almost like an artist's residency. These are really well-curated events where the scenery is beautiful too. Very Julia Cameron, having a date with your inner artist.”

 










Filmmakers should also seek out the Best of the Best Networking. Rubbing elbows with folks at Sundance helped gain “Chasers” prestige, but Brown Thomas knows better than most that you can find critical connections in all kinds of places. “Great networking is usually horizontal,” she said. “You want to play alongside really good films so the peers that you meet are people you will actually connect with.”

Smaller fests are often geared toward fostering local talent, and that can be a great place to start if you're just beginning. (Heck, take a page out of Brown Thomas' book, and found your own event!) But being based in Los Angeles, Salute Your Shorts presents a unique challenge to its programming team.

“My local audience is people who make movies,” said Brown Thomas. “So, they're going to be much harder on certain things. They're going to be much more unforgiving about bad acting, for example, whereas someone in middle America might be OK with a more amateurish performance if it's for the story.”

Programmers see the world through a cinematic lens, and filmmakers do too. It was combining those skillsets that made Brown Thomas succeed, she said. Honing the Salute schedule for nearly a decade was essential to her work on “Chasers,” and watching movies will help you figure out what to make. 

 










“What you choose to champion over and over again is revealing and teaches you something about yourself,” said Brown Thomas. “I really recommend getting on the other side if you love festivals.” 

Having been on several film festival juries, this IndieWire writer can personally promise you that people like Brown Thomas love to stump for underdogs. For all her advice to stay ambitious and engaged with the short film community, the director is equally quick to emphasize not letting perfectionism get in the way.

“At Salute, we're more concerned with voice than polish,” Brown Thomas said. “Being memorable is more important than being perfect. Because there could be a film that didn't quite work — but if what they were trying to do was interesting, and it's like 90 percent of the way there, and I can't stop thinking about it, then I want to figure out how to program it and I want to find a way to show it.”

Asked for some of her favorite festival submissions at Salute, Brown Thomas listed “I'm Happy, I Promise,” “The Burden,” “Starfuckers,” “Little Grey Bubbles,” and “The Robbery” as standouts.

A short doesn't always have to pave the way to a feature film, but duration can seriously impact how smaller projects do on the festival circuit. You'll find different advice out there, and as always, there's no accounting for taste. But Brown Thomas offered unique insight into what works at Salute.

 










“I've always had a soft spot for the longer ones, and I tell you, I find that anything over 22 minutes in our system generally does not feel too long,” she said. “I find that things constantly feel too long between 15 and 22 minutes. Anyone who's doing something over 22 minutes knows that their short is freaking long, but they usually have a point and they're doing everything they can to keep it as tight as possible.”

Yes, artists have a hard time killing their darlings — but that's what makes film competitive. 

“Pacing and knowing what to leave out are the largest elements of craft that people overlook,” Brown Thomas said. “A lot of filmmakers don't want to cut things because they can't find anything that's bad, especially in comedy. But you have to ask yourself, ‘How long does this concept deserve to be?'”

That said, more is still more when it comes to social media. After “Chasers” was accepted at Sundance, Brown Thomas went semi-viral on Instagram calling her cast and crew to tell them the great news. 

“When I got the call that we got in, I was hysterical and really wished immediately that I had seen my reaction,” said the director. “I turned to my husband and my mom who were with me at the time, and I was like, ‘Start recording me. I'm going to call everybody.' I made a reel out of everyone's's reactions and that got a lot of attention online. I called at least 40 people. We had over three hours of footage.”

 










Sharing that joy with the internet has allowed countless fans, including IndieWire, to follow along with “Chasers” since it premiered at Sundance. Brown Thomas says she chooses to embrace social media as a means of “future-proofing” her career and thinks other young artists should do the same. She posts her successes as much as her failures in an effort to always bring her audience “along for the journey.”

“The creator economy is the most foolproof way that we have of charting a path forward,” Brown Thomas said. “It's the one place we have the most agency. The wins, the losses, the learning opportunities, the, ‘Holy shit, I got lucky!'s — your audience wants to be invited into that.” And they are your audience. 

“Literally, you are assembling an audience every time you can get over putting your face on camera,” she said. “This is something you are in charge of. As I go into my next feature, I know I want to share everything that happens to me on set because it will keep me excited about tomorrow.”

A palpable love of storytelling makes Brown Thomas almost militantly optimistic about cinematic education and artistic possibility. Certainly, she's as intense as anyone who co-founded an event called Salute Your Shorts should be. On the night of the awards ceremony, the filmmaker got stuck between a rock and a hard place when she found herself busy handing out awards at Salute — while “Chasers” was busy winning the Best TV category at HollyShorts Film Festival, also in Los Angeles.

 










“Elle Shaw, who produced it, and Louie Chapman, our lead actor, went for me,” Brown Thomas later told IndieWire via text. “We got an e-mail saying we were nominated, but I had to introduce [our presenters] on stage during the exact time of the awards.” Notably, the indie pilot was up against Aneil Karia's “Big Man,” which was distributed by Apple TV+ and makes Brown Thomas even stronger in a stacked field. 

“I just thought you would find that irony very funny,” she said to IndieWire. Still, the artistic director for Salute Your Shorts and the filmmaker behind “Chasers” recommends finding time to relax and enjoy the movies with whatever free time you have. If you're championing the art of short film — even on your way to a feature! — then you should want to understand it and seek people out who can help you soar. 

“In 2026, I would definitely love to see an uptick in submissions because it means that even more people are finding us,” said Brown Thomas. “We're a really small team and we work really hard to make this happen. It's done through a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. It's a lot of love that pulls us together.”

French President Emmanuel Macron, who filed a lawsuit against Candace Owens, revealed that he did so to refute her “nonsense” allegations on his wife Brigitte Macron.

Last month, Macrons sued Owens for defamation after she falsely accused Brigitte of being born a man in her “relentless and unjustified smear campaign.” The couple sued her on 22 charges, including malicious claims and defamation, and they are even requesting damages.

In an interview with Paris Match , the French president discussed the issue for the first time since suing Owens, saying that he felt obligated to do so since the false charges had taken on a life of their own in the United States.

“This has become so widespread in the United States that we had to react,” the French President stated, as per the Independent UK. “It's a question of having the truth respected.”

According to the complaint registered in Delaware state court, Owens initially made the baseless allegation in March 2024 and went on to elaborate on it in her eight-part podcast series titled “Becoming Brigitte.” The complaint claims that the Macrons have suffered “tremendous damage” as a result of her lies.

In order to avoid the “Streisand effect,” which is when someone tries to hide something in order to draw more attention to it, the couple was first told not to make a complaint against Owens, the French president told Paris Match. However, he stated that they felt compelled to reply due to the substantial amount of attention the claims have received.

Macron responded, “It is not freedom of speech to want to prevent the restoration of the truth,” when asked about the negative reaction he and Brigitte have received in the United States following Owens' comments. Those who talk to you about this so-called freedom of speech are the ones who ban journalists from the Oval Office. I do not accept this.”

According to the complaint, Owens' comments exposed the couple to a “campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies.”

“The result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale. Every time the Macrons leave their home, they do so knowing that countless people have heard, and many believe, these vile fabrications. It is invasive, dehumanizing, and deeply unjust,” as per the filing.

The Macrons attacked Owens' credibility as well. The lawsuit alleges that she routinely peddled “misinformation under the guise of legitimate reporting,” such as spreading conspiracy theories against vaccines, and “built a brand on provocation, not truth.” The Covid-19 vaccinations, according to her, are “pure evil.”

Samantha Smith‘s Mary Winchester, the boys' badass hunter mom, has been a fixture on Supernatural since the very beginning. In the pilot, the young mom is killed by the demon Azazel in a horrifying scene where the nightgown-clad Mary pinned to the ceiling of baby Sam's nursery and set on fire. Still, she was never forgotten by her boys. Much later, in the Season 11 finale, Mary is resurrected by God's sister Amara (Emily Swallow), shocking her now-adult sons, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles).

Mary struggles with her restored humanity, and she doesn't always make the right choices during her second chance at life, but this imperfect mama bear became a pivotal part of the series and brought a strong female energy the show always needed more of. Eventually, though, she dies a second time in Season 14's “Game Night,” at the hand of nephilim Jack (Alexander Calvert) — accidentally — just a few episodes after she experienced a sweet family reunion with her late husband John (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Still, Mary's legacy on Supernatural carries on, and the character was even celebrated with the prequel spinoff The Winchesters, which explored Mary's life before her sons.

TV Insider caught up with Smith to discuss her complex character in May at a Creation Entertainment convention in New Jersey for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special. Below, she discusses her favorite episode, con memories, and why she thinks some fans never quite connected with her Mary.

I just saw you down on the floor signing autographs not even five minutes ago — what is it like doing these conventions for Supernatural?

Samantha Smith: Lots of running. [Laughs] And it's busy, which is a blessing because you don't want to be sitting there with time to kill. It's a flood of people, a flood of faces. Constant input about how the show has changed people's lives, what it's meant to them, how they watch it with their families. And to me, what I always want to say is that it's an honor that I have gotten to be a part of something that means so much to them. So, I spend a lot of time just reflecting gratitude. And also, the cast is my friends and family, you know? So, I get to see them and spend time with them, which is such an added bonus.

What do you hear the most from fans when you meet them?

The fandom is a little split on Mary. Some people love her, some people do not. I hear a lot, “I love you, I hate Mary. Sorry.” And then I say, “Give me two minutes, I'll change your mind.” And I usually do. We just have a little conversation about what their perception was, and why.

I think that some people were purists. They wanted the show to be about just the boys. And so, Mary came back — and she had been a canonized perfect mom — but when she came back, she was a fully-rounded human. I think that was hard for some people, especially when a couple of episodes in, she takes the journal and bounces because she needed to figure some stuff out. She'd been dead for over 30 years. Her kids were grown, her husband was dead. Like, maybe she needed a minute. [Laughs]

And then, she was working with the British Men of Letters, and everyone says, you know, they tried to kill Sam. But that was just one rogue agent. Mary was just trying to do what was right, not what the boys wanted. She was trying to rid the world of monsters, and she made them sad for a minute while doing that. I always point out: A Winchester takes it upon themselves to do something sort of secretive, but for the greater good while selflessly potentially sacrificing themselves and their relationship for the greater good for the wellbeing of the people they love. Do you know anyone else who's ever done something like that every week?

Fair point, indeed. Looking back, do you have a favorite con memory?

In Vegas, we got all four Winchesters onstage, and that was just a moment. It had a huge crowd. Jared and Jensen were onstage with Jeff, and I just wandered out and they're like, “Where did you come from?” [Laughs]

But also, there have been times where you connect with one particular fan and you have a moment where you realize that you're connecting as people, not as a fan and an actor — something that sort of transcends the show. I love that.

What about your favorite memories from shooting the series?

There's so many for so many different reasons. My very last episode, and just the knowledge while I was filming all that, that I was done. But [also] in the very beginning of Season 12, I got to work with Kim Rhodes [who played Sheriff Jody Mills], who's been one of my closest friends since before Supernatural started — to be on set with her and have our set chairs next to each other was great.

And then there was an episode at the end of Season 13, in the alternate universe, and everyone was there. It was literally 15 actors, and we were all walking down a dirt road. It was dusty and muddy and filthy — we're all covered in dirt. It felt like we were on a family adventure.

Is there a particular episode that stands out to you?

I really loved “Baby” [Season 11, Episode 4]. We heard about the car being the main character, and I thought, “How good could this be?' I had no idea.

If Supernatural returned, where do you see Mary?

I think that her and John [in Heaven] have repossessed the Impala from the boys and they're on adventures. And I have a feeling that she's trying to figure out a way to get back and help some more.

What's your Supernatural secret?

My nightgown in the pilot is actually pink, not white! It's been pink with white lace the entire time. [Laughs]

It's almost time for reality and the unknown to blur together once again with Expedition X. Season 10 of the Discovery Channel series hosted by Josh Gates arrives tomorrow with more chilling adventures into some haunting locales where mystery and, perhaps, the paranormal await. The new run of episodes kicks off with a two-part premiere that'll whisk Gates off to the ruins of Spike Island in Ireland alongside his paranormal researcher, Heather Amaro, to see if the alleged encounters with spirits of the dead by both visitors and inmates alike hold any weight. Before the first part arrives, Collider can exclusively share a new sneak peek that shows the pair turning to a classic piece of equipment used to contact those beyond the grave — a Ouija board.

In the clip, Gates and Amaro both have their fingers on the planchette and open things by asking if anyone is in the room with them. Although the first answer isn't clear, they get an affirmative response when asking if someone is trying to communicate. Both swear they aren't pushing it, and decide to continue by asking if the spirit with them was the face they spotted in the window earlier. Eerily, it answers no, but it does give an answer they believe means it was one of the four prisoners kept in that room of the once infamous prison. The suspense ramps up when they learn that the spirit they've contacted also tried a spirit board in the building once, as the stories say, and, instead, successfully contacted a demon. Everything comes to a head when the being spells out "run," and something falls in the room, giving both Gates and Amaro quite the jumpscare.

Whether you believe in the paranormal or not, the premiere promises plenty of intrigue as the team thoroughly investigates Spike Island. Once viewed as Ireland's most brutal prison, it's now known for the many stories of paranormal activity going on within its walls. To find out if the centuries of torment have unleashed something sinister, Gates and Amaro will venture into the cellblocks and the labyrinth of tunnels that once defined the sprawling complex. With two episodes airing across consecutive weeks, it'll be a deep dive into the history and horrors of the prison, with the potential of finding evidence of something beyond this world.

"Ireland's Alcatraz" is just one such destination on the docket for Expedition X Season 10. Gates, Amaro, and scientist Phil Torres will be back to chasing down mysteries and legends all over the world, from supernatural hotspots to mythical creatures. That includes a visit to the infamous house that inspired The Conjuring, the Bridgewater Triangle in Massachusetts, which has been a hotbed for UFO and Bigfoot sightings, and Spain, where reports of soul-stealing zombies have cropped up. The team also plans an episode set entirely in the hometown of horror legend Stephen King, Bangor, Maine. Whatever they find, it's primed to be another exciting addition to the wider Expedition franchise.

Expedition X returns to the Discovery Channel tomorrow, August 20, at 9 p.m. Check out our exclusive sneak peek from the first half of the premiere in the player above.

Following the viral hit of their 2024 release, “Just Like Dat feat. JP THE WAVY,” and the huge success of their first-ever U.S. tour, PSYCHIC FEVER FIRST U.S. TOUR 2025, PSYCHIC FEVER released the music video for “Reflection” today. As the lead track from their third original EP, PSYCHIC FILE III, the modern R&B flair is available on all digital streaming platforms.

Watch the video:

Directed by YERD, the “Reflection” music video makes bold use of 3DCG, creating a striking visual experience. The track is an ambitious work that blends the essence of 90s–'00s R&B with inspiration from DrillnB's atmosphere and sequencing, pursuing a cutting-edge sound. It also served as the powerful opening number for their PSYCHIC FEVER LIVE TOUR 2025 “EVOLVE” in JAPAN held in June. With its lyrical themes of self-awareness and artistic evolution, this song offers fans a deeper glimpse into PSYCHIC FEVER's current creative chapter. The track's smooth yet driving beat, coupled with polished choreography. As the visual narrative unfolds, viewers are invited to experience the group's journey of growth, resilience, and ambition.

“The music video for ‘Reflection' packs in the shine of mirrors, the city, and raw emotion,” the group shares. “Built around the phrase in the lyrics ‘tell me now, what's your vibe', it explores the themes of ‘discovering yourself through someone else' and ‘the person who brings out your glow', creating a mysterious, slightly thrilling world where fantasy and reality intertwine. We would be thrilled if you watched closely and caught all the little details.“

Following the resounding success of their U.S. tour earlier this year, delivering sold-out shows that captivated audiences nationwide, the group further cemented their international presence with a standout appearance at SXSW 2025 in Austin, Texas. Their high-energy performance as headliners for the “Friends From The East Showcase” earned widespread acclaim throughout the music festival, showcasing their ability to seamlessly blend their unique sounds with cutting-edge choreography and stage charisma. In July, celebrating their third anniversary, PSYCHIC FEVER embarked on their first fan meeting tours in Europe and North America, captivating audiences and showcasing their charm to the world.

PSYCHIC FEVER is a seven-member boy group consisting of KOKORO, WEESA, TSURUGI, RYOGA, REN, JIMMY, and RYUSHIN. They debuted in July 2022 as the seventh group from “EXILE TRIBE,” an unparalleled Japanese artist collective under LDH JAPAN. The group's name, PSYCHIC FEVER, was chosen to reflect the unique individual personalities of its seven members, whose performances—featuring dance, vocals, and rap—create a powerful chemistry. Their fanbase is called “ForEVER.” With the purpose of “IGNITE OUR DREAMS,” PSYCHIC FEVER aims to inspire courage in those who watch them, set their hearts ablaze with passion. Since their debut in 2022, they have been actively performing in Japan and throughout Asia, aiming for global success. Their song “Just Like Dat feat. JP THE WAVY,” released in January 2024, gained significant attention both domestically and internationally, surpassing 270 million views on TikTok. It also entered the Viral Top 50 charts on Spotify in nine Asian countries and regions, including Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea, while also becoming a viral hit in the United States. In February 2025, PSYCHIC FEVER successfully held their first U.S. tour, “PSYCHIC FEVER FIRST U.S. TOUR,” in six cities across the United States. That same month, they announced a global contract with Warner Music Group and their transfer to the music label “10K Projects.” In March, they expanded their reach by performing at SXSW 2025, one of the world's largest music festivals in the U.S. Their global journey is accelerating, and they are expected to make even greater strides in the future.

A chatbot developed by Elon Musk is designed to behave like a “crazy conspiracy theorist” that believes a “secret global cabal” controls humanity.

The billionaire's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot – known as Grok – is programmed to include a digital “persona” that is “deep in YouTube conspiracy video rabbit holes” and it will discuss “wild conspiracy theories about anything and everything”, new data show.

According to AI researchers who have studied the chatbot, underlying instructions known as prompts dictate how Grok behaves in its conversations with users – with one pushing conspiracy views.

The instructions – which have been reviewed by The Telegraph – power different potential personality types for Grok, developed by Mr Musk's company xAI as a rival to ChatGPT.

The prompt for the “conspiracy theorist” says: “You spend a lot of time on 4chan, watching Infowars videos and deep in YouTube conspiracy video rabbit holes.

“You are suspicious of everything and say extremely crazy things. Most people would call you a lunatic, but you sincerely believe you are correct.”

4chan is an internet message board accused of fuelling far Right conspiracies, while Infowars is a fake-news site created by discredited US radio host Alex Jones.

Other Grok modes include an “unhinged comedian” who, according to xAI's instructions, will come up with “f------ insane” answers.

Mr Musk himself has repeatedly pushed conspiracy theories through posts on his X platform while the social media site has also been accused of promoting fake news.

The 54-year old was previously forced to apologise after amplifying a post on X in 2023 that promoted an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. The billionaire responded to a post claiming that Jewish people had stoked “hatred against white people” by saying it was the “actual truth”.

He later said the comment was the “worst and dumbest post” he had ever sent.

While rival AI developers have sought to program strict guardrails into their chatbots to prevent them causing offence, xAI has also repeatedly tinkered with its design to provide outspoken responses to users.

Internet users can speak to Grok using a dedicated chatbot app, through cartoon avatars or by asking it questions on X, previously known as Twitter.

Its personalities include digital characters such as “homework helper”, “companion”, “loyal friend” and “Ani”, an anime-inspired digital girlfriend.

It has also added a “not safe for work” mode for explicit conversations and pictures.

While Mr Musk has promoted Grok as a “truth-seeking” chatbot and an antidote to the “woke mind virus”, the AI itself has also taken to spewing conspiracies and offensive internet memes.

In July, xAI was forced to delete posts where Grok referred to itself as “MechaHitler”.

The chatbot also regurgitated anti-Semitic tropes, such as arguing that Jewish people control Hollywood and have pushed “progressive ideologies, including anti-traditional and diversity-focused themes”.

xAI later said it had reversed a change to its chatbot which had instructed it to “not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect”.

In May, the company claimed a programming error had led the bot to dispute whether six million Jewish people died in the Holocaust.

The company also stated an “unauthorised modification” to the bot's code caused it to repeatedly bring up claims of “white genocide” in South Africa when asked about entirely unrelated topics.

xAI was contacted for comment.

Supernatural protagonists Sam and Dean are in the hands of the perfect new writer. As author Grek Pak explains, his experience writing for other major franchises, most notably his tenure writing Marvel's Darth Vader series, has primed him to tell stories set early in Supernatural's run, which add to the overall mythology of the long-running series.

In an interview with ComicsBeat.com, Pak discussed his upcoming Supernatural comic series, coming from Dynamite Entertainment, which takes fans back to the early seasons of the show.

According to Pak, Darth Vader and other comics he's written, set early in existing franchises' timelines, make him a natural fit for Supernatural.

 Greg Pak's Supernatural is intentionally designed to dial the franchise back to its monster-hunting origins, before it became an epic struggle between heaven, hell, and other cosmic forces that far exceeded creator Eric Kripke's original vision for the show. However, that doesn't mean it will completely ignore what the show became as it evolved over its fifteen years in production.

As Pak explained, the virtue in working with existing IP is to honor the stories that have already been told, even when adding to the franchise's lore at an early point in its chronology. This is exactly what he is doing with Supernatural. Pak stated:

I've written a LOT of comics that take place early in the timeline of a particular universe — like all the Darth Vader comics I wrote that fall between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. And yes, the trick is to never forget where the story ends up, but to invest each moment of the story you're telling with all the fun and emotional heft that that particular part of the timeline deserves. It's a challenge but a ton of fun!

In other words, if Supernatural fans like the new comic series, they have Darth Vader to thank.

Grek Pak wrote Darth Vader for fifty issues, and the series arguably served as the centerpiece of Marvel's contributions to the new Disney-era Star Wars canon during its run. Further, Pak's experience writing X-Men, Hulk, and more, give him a high-level pedigree as a comic author, making him a huge "get" for Dynamite's Supernatural series.

 As Greg Pak stated, the "challenge" of writing for a franchise like Supernatural or Star Wars is that fans invariably judge each story against its contribution to the overall lore, not just in terms of how it fits into its particular era. The task of the author is to recognize that, while staying true to the era they're expanding.

That means nodding to that greater story when appropriate, yet not too overtly. It is a bit of a tight-wire act, but one that is especially satisfying for fans when walked successfully. Greg Pak has proven he excels at this, and Supernatural fans should be especially eager to return to Sam and Dean's early years with this author at the helm.

Supernatural #1 will be available October 1, 2025 from Dynamite Entertainment.

Whether they're a Hellspawn, a vengeful, resurrected spirit or an angry Superman stand-in, these 25 heroes prove you don't need Marvel or DC.

The Justice League may be the DCU's best team, but one hero thinks that heroes like Superman and Wonder Woman aren't enough to stop what's coming.

The Fantastic Four's brutal first fight against the universe's deadliest hunters proves The Thing is too powerful to take down. With one major catch.

Almost a year later, it's worth exploring why 2021's award-winning Nightwing run was such a definitive and transformative journey for the DC hero.

Marvel has just totally rewritten Avengers lore, introducing a new founding hero to its flagship franchise. But did they choose the right character?

Simba and Mufasa are returning in a new prequel adventure to "The Lion King," which will shed new light on their father/son dynamic before the film.

"It wasn't until 15 minutes later, when I was in my car and leaving, that it hit me how strange that moment was..."

BuzzFeed Staff

Warning: This article contains mentions of death and suicide.

If you have ever worked the night shift and had a paranormal experience, feel free to tell us about it using this anonymous form!

"As I approached her room, I heard her saying very clearly, 'No, stop, you are hurting me. Stop doing that. I do not want to play with you.' I thought she might be having a dispute with her roommate, so I went into her room, expecting to find her awake. She was sound asleep in her bed. Before I could turn around and assess what it happened, I heard a little girl giggling.

My boss at the time came in to help me care for the women in that room. He was very lighthearted in general and had worked in the facility for nearly a decade. When we walked out of the room, I told him about what happened and what I had heard. Before I could even finish my sentence, he physically pulled me aside and, in a very serious tone, said, 'We do not talk about the little girl.'

And that was that."

"Occasionally, there's a strong smell of cigarettes (she was a chain smoker), regular footsteps walking over the wooden floors, and even the sound of her dogs following her. 

Two mediums stayed here once and told us that the previous owner was furious with what had been done to her home, especially her private lounge being made into a small cinema. Things malfunction regularly, so we believe it's her curse."

—u/jlelvidge

"One of my coworkers had been targeted by a stalker. It got so bad that she eventually left the area entirely, and he was so distraught that he committed suicide. The week after his death, I was setting up a bakery case, and through the glass, I saw him sitting in his usual chair, staring toward the counter like usual. When I stood up, he was gone. This happened several times. 

One day, I wasn't there, and a coworker saw him and freaked out! My next shift, I walked over to that chair and said kindly but firmly, '[Former coworker's name] isn't here anymore. She's fine, but she's moved on and isn't coming back, and you should too.'

He never appeared again."

"One night, we finished our shift like usual at three o'clock and started the drive home. Once we were out of the city and into the country, we noticed it was incredibly foggy to the extent that you could barely see in front of the truck. This meant we were driving very slowly and cursing the fact that it was going to be well after 6 a.m. when we got home, although we thought something was off because it seemed we were constantly driving uphill, even though the route was overall flat.

Finally, he dropped me off at home, and I went into the kitchen to grab a glass of water when I glanced at the clock. It read 4:30. I looked at my phone, and sure enough, it was 4:30. At that moment, I got a text from my colleague who'd just arrived home, asking, 'How the hell is it only 4:30?'

This was after a drive that, in good conditions, would have taken at least two hours to complete, yet somehow, in thick fog, driving at one-third of our regular speed, it only took one and a half hours."

"The forklift was stopped at the time, and I was unpacking about 10 feet away, just watching it creep. Coworkers have told me they've seen shadows walking around the area, long after all the other employees left."

—u/Quick-Statement-8981

"Then I noticed items falling and moving on their own. Again. I chalked it up to late night, I'm tired, etc.

The overnighters had previously mentioned it being haunted, but I took it with a grain of salt until that night. Apparently, the store was built on a Native American burial ground!"

—u/Grim-reacher

"When I looked over, there was a lady motioning me to let her in. I told her that it would be a minute because I had to get the head nurse, as we couldn't just let anyone into those units.

So I went to the nurses' station to tell them about the woman. They all turned pale and told me that no one could get through that way anymore. I laughed and said, 'Nice one.' So, I went back to the ER to tell the head nurse what happened. She became alarmed and said that was part of the old hospital that had been sealed off, and there is absolutely no way anyone can get in.

I told everyone that we apparently had a ghost who really wanted to be in the pediatric department."

"One night, around midnight, I was alone and closing up. Part of my job was to partially rethread the projectors for the morning shift. To this day, I vividly remember, I'd just finished with the fifth projector and was walking to the fourth one when I heard whistling directly behind me, like someone was whistling a little tune. I froze, then said out loud, 'I did not hear that,' and finished closing up.

It wasn't until 15 minutes later, when I was in my car and leaving, that it hit me how strange that moment was."

"When he went to check them out, he couldn't find anyone, but then he heard the voices coming from the other end of the restaurant. It was a small place, so there wasn't anywhere to hide. He was freaked out and asked me what it could be. I just stared at him for a second and said, 'You heard them too?' 

Unbeknownst to him, I'd had the EXACT same experience in the bar a few nights prior. I chalked it up to some kind of weird vibration coming through the A/C, but here's the thing: I'd been working there for seven years and neither I nor any other staff member had ever experienced anything like that."

"As we all stood in silence, the deceased client's buzzer started beeping, not in the bedroom but where she always sat in the lounge area. It was 2 a.m., no one else was in the lounge, all the clients were asleep, the lights were off, but her buzzer was beeping in red. 

My colleagues were scared; they hadn't witnessed a death before, and it was new to them. They started screaming in fear. I told them that she was visiting the last place she had sat and saying goodbye. I went to switch the alarm off, but her spirit was already gone."

—u/Imaginary_Major9839

"I won't explain the entire room layout, but there was a thin elevator that brought large rolls of film from the floor above us. The elevator had a sensor that triggered an alarm and stopped it from moving if you put something in it when the lid wasn't down. Behind the elevator, on the other side of the opening, there was a chair, and across the room was a machine for exposing film strips. The distance between it and the elevator is about 20 feet.

I was sitting in the chair, waiting for an issue with production to be straightened out so we could continue with our work, and my coworker was working at the machine against the wall. Everything was dead silent, and then the alarm started going off. My coworker and I both jumped out of our skin.

She asked me if I messed with it, and I said no. I turned the alarm off. It's a clean room environment, no bugs or dust to trigger the alarm. I worked there for five years, and it only happened that once. I never really felt comfortable in that room on night shift on my own, I always felt like something was watching."

—u/Ramzuul

"The building is in an older area of the city. One night, around 2 a.m., I looked out the window and saw a shadowy man with a hat walking along the corridor. I did a double-take, and he disappeared. I wasn't freaked out and told my coworker about it. She said that she had also seen him on a previous occasion.

The building used to be a mill back in the day. I did some research and found pictures of men back then wearing the same hats."

—u/messkitty

"After everyone else left, I stayed with the assistant manager to finish closing up and deal with paperwork. While walking to the back of the store to put the money in the safe, I saw a white figure quickly dart across the break room/storage area, where the office was. I thought I was imagining it and decided to ignore it.

When I reached that area to sort the paperwork and money, the door slammed shut behind me, which was unusual because it's a lightweight door. I called for my coworker, thinking she had done it, but she didn't answer, so I used my walkie-talkie to contact her. She was at the front by the registers and had also heard the door slam. At that point, the room got colder, and I started to hurry.

Just as I was about to leave, a box of donation stickers for St. Jude's tipped over and fell to the floor. The box was nowhere near the edge of the table. I thought, 'Forget this,' and ran fast to set the alarm. I told my coworker it was time to leave. The scariest part was when she said, 'You saw it too?'

It was kind of funny that it happened at a Halloween store."

—u/That1writer_

"So, while I was sitting alone at the register, waiting, I heard our first ghost, a woman who always just says, 'Excuse me!'

On another night, a ghostly older gentleman appeared in a blue polo shirt and khaki shorts. After I saw him, champagne bottles spontaneously opened and sprayed everywhere."

—u/blackrayofsunshine

"I was so scared that I got chills and began to pray. I shared my experience with my family, and some of them suggested that I was sleep-deprived, but I was wide awake and knew what I heard."

—u/indyfever22

"I NEVER open the doors. I just do a quick walkthrough, and I don't even check every room. The first thing that came to mind was someone either got stuck in there and couldn't get out, or maybe someone had snuck in, so I walked over and said 'Hello.' 

Then another knock came, three times right in front of my face — someone was knocking on the door from the other side. I prepared to fight as I slowly turned the knob and opened the door, yet there was only an empty room on the other side.

I have never run through a patrol so fast in my life."

—u/GUTTED570

"I was there alone and heard continuous tapping on a keyboard and rustling of papers in one of the cubicles. So, I decided to see if someone was there and asked, 'Is anyone here?' That's when a light started flickering on and off in an adjacent office."

—u/PersonalLeading4948

"One night, though, was very off-putting. All the power went off, not completely out of the ordinary, but it usually comes back on within a second or two; this time, it would NOT come back on. I called the engineer, and he explained that the factory was on a time clock and it should have been turning off every night. He couldn't explain why it had stayed on every other night unless someone had gotten a ladder and changed it within the last day.

Later that night, I was in the loading bay, which has a massive metal delivery door (I frequently work down there, so I know the normal sounds it makes). Out of nowhere, there were two loud bangs against the door. It was so loud that my boss came running over, thinking I'd hurt myself. Once I explained to her that it wasn't me and we stopped freaking out, we went to the window to check if anyone was there and…nothing. I still can't explain it."

—u/jess0241

"One inmate, whom I'll call 'Inmate X,' was a long-term resident of the medical post, which was unusual. He was a jolly-looking guy who was already sentenced and awaiting space in a state prison that could handle his medical needs, as he was terminally ill; however, his crimes were so heinous that his request for compassionate release was denied. He always tried to be folksy and befriend the nurses and whichever deputy was working. Everyone was professional with him, but he wasn't someone with whom we engaged in banter.

Inmate X finally went to prison, and life went on. Several months later, I was assigned to spend the second half of one shift in the medical area. We had a very late rotation, so I didn't get on post until nearly 2 a.m. After checking up on everyone, I went to the nurses' office to get some coffee. The nurse on duty asked me, 'Did they tell you in your roll call that Inmate X finally passed away?' We were not told. Generally, the average deputy doesn't keep tabs on inmates once they go to state prison."

"My instincts told me to leave, but I, of course, couldn't — relief was still a few hours away. The feeling in the room turned back to normal within a few minutes, and the keys stopped swinging on their own, but it was by far the spookiest experience I had working there."

Roswell: The Final Evidence is presented by Dr David Hall

Germany's ZDF has acquired two titles exploring historic and modern encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena from UK-based distributor Espresso Media International.

The German broadcaster will air Roswell: The Final Evidence (2×45'/1×86′), in which Dr David Hall and his team investigate the conspiracy theories surrounding one of the most famous UFO stories of all time.

Foo Fighters (2×45′), meanwhile, traces sightings of strange airborne objects from WWII to modern military tech, examining how decades of secrecy continue to blur the line between fact and fiction.

Italian pubcaster Rai has taken Decoding Turner (1×90′), a one-off doc that uncovers potential hidden codes in the paintings of J.M.W. Turner, from Espresso Media International.

In France, Mediawan has acquired space and history programming including Off Earth (1×52′), which follows the companies behind the private space race and the billionaires driving commercial spaceflight, and JFK: 24 Hours that Changed the World (1×46′), which tells the story of the last 24 hours of John Kennedy's life before his assassination.
