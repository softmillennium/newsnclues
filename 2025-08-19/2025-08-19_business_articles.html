                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The data analytics software vendor said Tuesday that it's raising a funding round that values the company at over $100 billion. That would make Databricks just the fourth private company to eclipse the $100 billion mark, following SpaceX, ByteDance and OpenAI, according to data from CB Insights. Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi told CNBC's Brian Sullivan that the total round will exceed $1 billion. The company was last valued by private investors at $62 billion in a $10 billion financing round late last year. In June, Databricks executives told investors the company was forecasting $3.7 billion in annualized revenue by July, with 50% year-over-year growth. Snowflake, one of Databricks' top rivals, is expected to generate $4.5 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January, representing annual growth of 25%, according to LSEG. Snowflake currently has a market cap of about $65 billion. Other competitors include cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft, which are also Databricks partners. Ghodsi said he heard from a lot of interested investors following Figma's IPO late last month. Shares of the design software company more than tripled in their New York Stock Exchange debut, a sign that public investors are seeking out tech offerings after in extended lull in the IPO market. "My phone was blowing up," Ghodsi said on Tuesday. "So yes, there's definitely been a big push from outside." Figma shares have since retreated from their initial $115.50 closing price. Ghodsi said the round will help Databricks invest in products that clients can tap when using artificial intelligence models. Existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Insight Partners Thrive Capital and WCM Investment Management are buying shares, a spokesperson said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration has quietly expanded its 50% steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 additional product categories, vastly increasing the reach and impact of this arm of its trade agenda. The tariff list now covers products such as fire extinguishers, machinery, construction materials and specialty chemicals that either contain, or are contained in, aluminum or steel. "Auto parts, chemicals, plastics, furniture components—basically, if it's shiny, metallic, or remotely related to steel or aluminum, it's probably on the list," Brian Baldwin, vice president of customs at Kuehne + Nagel International AG wrote on LinkedIn of the expanded list. "This isn't just another tariff—it's a strategic shift in how steel and aluminum derivatives are regulated," he wrote. For example, the Commerce Department identifies the product category of fire extinguishers only as "8424.10.0000," a 10-digit code buried among hundreds of other 10-digit codes. This format makes it very difficult for the public to get a full picture of all the products that are affected by Monday's expanded tariffs. But experts say the impact will be enormous. "By my count, the steel and aluminum tariffs now affect at least $320 billion of imports based on 2024's general customs value of imports," Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, wrote on LinkedIn. "This will add more inflationary cost-push pressures to already climbing prices that domestic producers are charging as picked up by July's PPI data," he continued. Trump has repeatedly relied on sector-specific tariffs to enact his sweeping trade agenda. In June, Trump announced that he was doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% for most countries, creating widespread uncertainty for businesses and U.S. trading partners reliant on the valuable commodities. The White House said that the tariffs on additional products should "not come as a surprise." "The President called for a new steel and aluminum product inclusions process in February," White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. "[The Bureau of Industry and Security] established the new product inclusions process in April, and companies submitted requests for product inclusions in mid-May," he said. "Thus, it has been clear for many months that new products could be treated as steel and aluminum derivatives." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Intel must give the U.S. government an equity stake in the company in return for CHIPS Act funds. "We should get an equity stake for our money," Lutnick said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." We'll get equity in return for it." Intel and SoftBank announced on Monday that the Japanese conglomerate will make a $2 billion investment in the chipmaker. Lutnick said any potential arrangement wouldn't provide the government with voting or governance rights in Intel. "It's not governance, we're just converting what was a grant under Biden into equity for the Trump administration, for the American people," Lutnick said. Lutnick also suggested that President Donald Trump could seek out similar deals with other CHIPS recipients. Intel said last fall that it had finalized a nearly $8 billion grant from the law to build its factories. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was awarded $6.6 billion under the legislation to boost chip fabrication at its Arizona facilities. Trump has called for more reshoring of U.S. manufacturing to reduce the country's reliance on companies like Samsung and TSMC to manufacture chips. Intel has been spending billions near Columbus, Ohio, to build a series of chip factories that the company previously called the "Silicon Heartland." Intel has said that the factory complex would be able to produce the most advanced chips, including AI chips. But in July, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a memo to employees that there would be "no more blank checks," and that it was slowing down the construction of its Ohio factory complex, depending on market conditions. The first factory is now scheduled to start operations in 2030. The law committed the U.S. government to fund chip development and research and was estimated to cost about $53 billion. "The Biden administration literally was giving Intel for free, and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies just giving them money for free," Lutnick said. "Donald Trump turns that into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money. Intel has struggled to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom in advanced semiconductors and has spent heavily to stand up a manufacturing business that's yet to secure a significant customer. Intel tapped Lip-Bu Tan to be its CEO in March after his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was ousted in December. Tan met with Trump at the White House last week after the president called for his resignation, alleging he had ties to China. -- CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple has reportedly boosted iPhone production in India as the country faces pressure from the White House over its Russian oil purchases. "We have planned to up the tariffs on India," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Tuesday. "These are secondary tariffs for buying the sanctioned Russian oil." Bessent accused India of "profiteering" by purchasing cheap Russian oil and reselling it during the Ukraine war, "which is unacceptable." Earlier this month, President Donald Trump hiked tariffs on India to 50%. The president said in July that he would impose secondary tariffs "at about 100%" on Russia's trading partners if a peace deal isn't reached with Ukraine by September. His comments came as Bloomberg reported that technology giant Apple has reportedly upped production at five of its factories in India as it readies for the launch of its new iPhone 17 models. Apple is also looking to create a new iPhone 17e in India next year, according to the report. In recent years, Apple has shifted more production to India as it looks to reduce its reliance on China, especially in the wake of recent trade tensions. Data from Canalys in May estimated that iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. grew 76% in May as trade restrictions loomed. That includes a $100 billion spending expansion this month, which included a $2.5 billion investment to expand iPhone glass maker Corning's production. This commitment to building in the U.S. should put Apple in the clear on India-related tariffs. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia said Tuesday that it is evaluating several products following a report that the company is working on a new artificial intelligence chip for China that is more powerful than the currently available H20. The new product, tentatively called the B30A, is expected to be based on Nvidia's Blackwell chip architecture, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the company's plans. "We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow," the company told CNBC in a statement. "Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use." Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and said he wouldn't be surprised if Huang wants to sell a new chip to China. "I've listened to him pitch the president, and the president listens to our great technology companies, and he'll decide how he wants to play it." Earlier this month, Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their sales in China, in exchange for permission to resume selling chips in the region. The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns. Nvidia built its China-specific H20 chip after the Biden administration implemented export controls on AI chips in 2023, while AMD developed the MI308 chip for the Chinese market. President Donald Trump said last week that he originally requested a 20% cut of Nvidia's sales, but that Huang negotiated the number down to 15%. Trump suggested at the time that he would be open to Nvidia selling a significantly scaled-down version of its advanced Blackwell chip in China. "In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it." — CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos contributed to this report. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Viking Therapeutics plunged Tuesday after the company released midstage trial data on its obesity pill that disappointed investors. The biotech company's stock price dropped to about $23.80 as of Tuesday morning, from $42.09 at Monday's close, a roughly 43% plunge. The results could be a blow to Viking, which was once seen as a hot M&A target as pharmaceutical companies scramble to join the booming market for obesity and diabetes drugs. Jared Holz, Mizuho health care equity strategist, said in an email Tuesday that the data "probably shutters hope for [Viking] to be a bigtime player in the oral obesity market over the near to medium term." The race to develop a more convenient obesity pill has been fraught, as companies such as Pfizer have had to scrap previous contenders and bring forward new ones. Viking's once-daily pill helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their weight at around three months. The company also said that weight loss didn't plateau, which means patients could lose even more in a longer-term study. It's difficult to directly compare the pill's phase two trial data with the results of oral drugs further along in development, including treatments developed by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Holz added that the results on Viking's pill "look inferior" to those of Eli Lilly's oral drug "on almost all metrics." Holz pointed to the high rate of patients who discontinued Viking's drug for any reason over 13 weeks, which was around 28%. Meanwhile, around a quarter of people discontinued Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, for any reason over 72 weeks. That's "a much longer trial and therefore [Lilly] looks far better head-to-head," Holz said. Viking said the most common reasons for patients to discontinue treatment were gastrointestinal side effects, the majority of which were mild to moderate in severity and observed earlier in treatment. But around 58% of patients reported experiencing nausea and 26% experienced vomiting, compared with 48% and 10%, respectively, among those who took a placebo. Those side effect rates over a shorter trial period appear to be worse than those seen in trials on Eli Lilly's pill and the oral version of Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy. Viking's treatment works by imitating two naturally produced gut hormones called GLP-1 and GIP. Eli Lilly's pill and the oral version of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy both target GLP-1, but the latter has dietary restrictions. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday accused India of profiteering from cheap Russian oil imports during the war in Ukraine, describing the practice as "arbitrage" and condemning it as unacceptable. They are reselling," Bessent told CNBC's "Squawk Box" in an interview. "This is what I would call the Indian arbitrage — buying cheap Russian oil, reselling it as product." India buys Russian oil at a discount due to sanctions, refines it into gasoline and diesel, and then sells the product back to regions that have sanctioned Moscow such as Europe, said Matt Smith, an oil market analyst at Kpler. India's imports of Russian oil have surged since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Before the attack, India imported a minuscule amount of Russian crude. India is now Russia's biggest customer importing 1.5 million barrels per day in July, according to data from Kpler. China is the second-largest buyer of Russian oil, importing about 1 million bpd last month. President Donald Trump earlier this month ordered an additional 25% tariff on India's exports to the U.S. to punish New Delhi for buying Russian oil. Trump is threatening what he calls "secondary tariffs" on Russian oil buyers like India to pressure the Kremlin to reach a negotiated settlement with Ukraine. So far, however, the U.S. has spared China from secondary tariffs over its imports of Russian crude. When asked about China's imports, Bessent suggested that Beijing's imports were less egregious in the eyes of the Trump administration because it was also a major buyer before Russia invaded Ukraine. But India actually started purchasing Russian oil in a major way at the behest of the U.S., said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy and a former advisor to President George W. Bush. The Biden administration had asked India to accept Russian crude as other countries imposed bans in order to prevent a major oil price spike after the invasion of Ukraine that would result in high gasoline prices in the U.S., McNally told CNBC. "India played a key role in the price cap sanction mechanism designed by the U.S. and its European allies to ensure Russian oil still flowed while trying to crimp the revenue Moscow earned," McNally said.CNBC has reached out to the Indian Embassy in the U.S. for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday he will begin interviewing candidates for Federal Reserve chair as soon as the White House whittles down what has suddenly become a crowded field. In a CNBC "Squawk Box" interview, Bessent confirmed the race to replace current Chair Jerome Powell is between 11 candidates, an array that includes past and present central bank officials as well as economists, a White House advisor and a few Wall Street market experts. "In terms of the interview process, we've announced 11 very strong candidates. That list is believed to include current Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, White House economist Kevin Hassett and former Governor Kevin Warsh. Strategists Rick Rieder of BlackRock and David Zervos of Jefferies also are part of the group, as well as economist Marc Sumerlin, former Governor Larry Lindsey and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard. Though Powell's term does not end until May 2026, the White House is keen to get the process moving as it pushes an urgent need for interest rate cuts. Bessent repeated the administration's desire for easing, saying it would help the moribund U.S. housing market. Sales and new building have been weak, with low inventory pushing prices higher. "If we keep constraining home building, then what kind of inflation does that create one or two years out?" "So a big cut here could facilitate a boom or a pickup in home building, which will keep prices down one two years down the road." The Fed does not have a policy meeting again until Sept. 16-17, where it is widely expected to approve its first quarter percentage point reduction since December 2024. Bessent said he was not concerned about a producer price index reading for July that showed the largest monthly increase in three years, as he attributed much it to a rise in portfolio fees tied to higher stock market values. Before then, Powell on Friday will give what is likely his final keynote address at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. That speech could focus on a review the central bank does every five years of its policy, but Powell also may choose to tip the Fed's hand on the September vote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nicholas Gilpin, a 38-year-old stay-at-home dad and entrepreneur from Fair Oaks, California. The following has been edited for length and clarity. When I was an information technology consultant at KPMG, there were some weeks when I worked almost 100 hours across all seven days. Now, I spend those hours with my sons — a very different environment. Almost three years since becoming a full-time stay-at-home dad, I'm glad to invest this time I can't get back with my sons. She was also working full-time as a case manager at a health insurance company, but needed to take time off before the birth to keep up with doctor's visits. Supporting my wife and keeping up with client demands became too much. We felt it made sense for me to take a break from working, so two weeks before my first son was born, I clocked out of the corporate world and clocked in as a full-time dad. So, when our first son was born through IVF, and our second two years later naturally, it was a gift we didn't want to take for granted. We'd always planned for one of us to stay home with the kids. Ultimately, we saw having a parent home as more valuable than maintaining two full-time incomes. We don't know what a day care or babysitter might be teaching our kids, and the time spent driving them to and from those programs may negate the benefit of sending them there in the first place. Are you a working parent not paying for childcare? Fill out this quick form or email bdelk@businessinsider.com to share your story. My first son is almost 3 years old now, so he requires much more attention and play time, while my other son, almost 6 months old now, spends more time with his mom. Thankfully, my wife and I worked hard early in our careers, and she can support us through her private mental health counseling practice. We also bought a duplex and rented out half of it to help cover our mortgage. We've really had to get intentional about what matters most. Personally, I don't buy anything unless it's essential — supplements, a gym membership, and basic toiletries. We rarely go out to eat, and I cook nearly all of our meals at home. My mom has also helped provide essentials for our boys, and my wife's parents have contributed financially since our youngest was born. We're making it work — but every dollar has a job. Society's expectation for fathers has always hinged on them being providers. While this era of parents is evolving away from stereotypical parenting roles, I still feel a sense of guilt for not providing as much while our sons grow up. I have to remind myself that I'm doing enough for my family through the hours of spending time with them, potty training, going on walks around the neighborhood, playing in the backyard, and making them breakfast. This has been my biggest challenge when trying to have it all as a dad. It can feel isolating, and like I'm regressing in my career or missing out on the latest tech advancements. Seeing the way AI has been implemented to outsource work, code, and handle menial tasks around the office makes me feel like I'm missing out on a major tech advancement in my field. But staying home has also given me the space to build my own business and work on the book I'm writing, "Thriving Dad," during my sons' naps or after their bedtimes. AI models have leveled the playing field for entrepreneurs like me as I try to rebuild my career a couple of hours at a time, since 100% of my day is invested in my boys. I use ChatGPT as a personal assistant to help manage all the tasks and coding I want to get done during the day, and chip away at the business I want to sculpt. I find spending time with my sons incredibly rewarding. Time is invaluable when children are young, and I want to pour this experience into my sons while I stay home. While it's difficult to pinpoint the most rewarding experience of being a dad, recently, my oldest said, "I love you, daddy," for the first time. Seeing these milestones for both of them and seeing parts of myself in them, I am immensely grateful to give them what I couldn't have and what I needed as a child.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>America's biggest bank by assets has been promising that its new office tower at 270 Park Avenue will be loaded with "intelligent technology" since it announced the project in 2022. New details of the $3 billion project obtained by Business Insider reveal just how tech-forward the building will be. The 14,000 employees who will be housed at the New York tower will be able to activate coffee machines using QR codes and swipe into the building using biometric palm scanners. The details, gleaned from internal communications shared with Business Insider, offer a glimpse of what it's like to work at the bank behemoth, which earlier this year called back all of its more than 300,000 employees to the office five days a week. JPMorgan has also been spending billions on tech at the direction of CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been seeking to protect the bank from payment apps and other financial startups. "We have to compete with the best in AI and technology," Jamie Dimon said at the bank's 2024 Investor Day. With some employees' move-in set to start this year and continue into 2026, here's the lowdown on how the bank plans to use tech to keep workers happy and efficient as it calls them back to the office five days a week. One option to get past the turnstiles — besides your physical or mobile JPM badge — is "biometric authentication," which employees can already enroll in, according to employee communications shared on an internal bank portal. From there, you can go up to your floor or take the escalator down to 13 for a bite to eat," the bank said, adding, "If you're a trader, you can take an elevator directly to the trading floors from the lobby." The bank has a mobile app they call "Work at JPMC" to help employees with the move and to sign up for things like bike storage. It also has maps of the office to help people figure out what is where, and stores a digital version of your work badge. The communications, which come just weeks after a tragic shooting at another Park Avenue office tower, suggest the bank plans to lean on tech to bolster building security. One example: primary bathrooms on each floor will have emergency locks that, when activated, alert building security, according to the portal. Under its emergency information, the bank says "primary bathrooms on each floor are equipped with an emergency lock that, when used, will alert building security. Security will assess the situation and respond, as appropriate." In addition to having four cafes in the building and "work cafes" on every floor, break rooms will have coffee machines "powered by QR codes" — symbols that open up apps or webpages when viewed through one's phone camera. The communications reviewed by Business Insider show that JPMorgan will use tech to try and make the office experience more natural. In addition to windows that will allow 30% more daylight than a typical office building, the bank said the tower will have "circadian lighting and design elements" that incorporate nature and "help reduce sensory overload."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you wanted a signal that we've truly entered the AI era and left mobile behind, this is it: iPhones are no longer Foxconn's most important business. For investors and industry watchers, this is a pivotal moment. The company best known as Apple's factory floor has become an AI-first manufacturer. In the second quarter of 2025, Cloud & Networking revenue jumped 47% year-over-year to NT$731.8 billion, eclipsing the NT$634.5 billion generated from Smart Consumer Electronics, according to Barclays research. More than half of that cloud revenue now comes from AI servers, which grew more than 60% in the second quarter alone. "The company has grown from its legacy business of building smartphones or assembling computers for the likes of Apple to being a critical player in not only AI servers but also in emerging new product categories such as EVs and humanoid robots," Barclays analysts Jiong Shao, Lian Xiu Duan, and Xinyao Song, wrote in a note to investors on Monday. This surge marks a tectonic shift: Apple, long Foxconn's most important customer, is no longer its primary growth driver. Instead, Foxconn is rapidly positioning itself as an AI infrastructure heavyweight. The firm has increased its market share in AI servers, including specialized ASIC variants, and is working closely with partners such as Nvidia on next-gen server architectures and humanoid robotics integration. Mexico remains a primary base, but the growing US footprint reflects strategic repositioning for North American customers, including the big cloud providers. Beyond AI servers, Foxconn is diversifying into electric vehicles, semiconductors, and healthcare robotics. Meanwhile, Foxconn expects no growth in its iPhone-heavy consumer electronics business.</p>
