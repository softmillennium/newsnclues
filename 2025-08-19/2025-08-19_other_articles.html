                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French President Emmanuel Macron, who filed a lawsuit against Candace Owens, revealed that he did so to refute her “nonsense” allegations on his wife Brigitte Macron. Last month, Macrons sued Owens for defamation after she falsely accused Brigitte of being born a man in her “relentless and unjustified smear campaign.” The couple sued her on 22 charges, including malicious claims and defamation, and they are even requesting damages. Carrollton teen charged with killing mom and stepdad, denied bond in hearing According to the complaint registered in Delaware state court, Owens initially made the baseless allegation in March 2024 and went on to elaborate on it in her eight-part podcast series titled “Becoming Brigitte.” The complaint claims that the Macrons have suffered “tremendous damage” as a result of her lies. Those who talk to you about this so-called freedom of speech are the ones who ban journalists from the Oval Office. According to the complaint, Owens' comments exposed the couple to a “campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies.” “The result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale. Every time the Macrons leave their home, they do so knowing that countless people have heard, and many believe, these vile fabrications. It is invasive, dehumanizing, and deeply unjust,” as per the filing. The lawsuit alleges that she routinely peddled “misinformation under the guise of legitimate reporting,” such as spreading conspiracy theories against vaccines, and “built a brand on provocation, not truth.” The Covid-19 vaccinations, according to her, are “pure evil.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Samantha Smith‘s Mary Winchester, the boys' badass hunter mom, has been a fixture on Supernatural since the very beginning. Still, she was never forgotten by her boys. Much later, in the Season 11 finale, Mary is resurrected by God's sister Amara (Emily Swallow), shocking her now-adult sons, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles). Mary struggles with her restored humanity, and she doesn't always make the right choices during her second chance at life, but this imperfect mama bear became a pivotal part of the series and brought a strong female energy the show always needed more of. Eventually, though, she dies a second time in Season 14's “Game Night,” at the hand of nephilim Jack (Alexander Calvert) — accidentally — just a few episodes after she experienced a sweet family reunion with her late husband John (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). TV Insider caught up with Smith to discuss her complex character in May at a Creation Entertainment convention in New Jersey for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special. Below, she discusses her favorite episode, con memories, and why she thinks some fans never quite connected with her Mary. I just saw you down on the floor signing autographs not even five minutes ago — what is it like doing these conventions for Supernatural? [Laughs] And it's busy, which is a blessing because you don't want to be sitting there with time to kill. Constant input about how the show has changed people's lives, what it's meant to them, how they watch it with their families. So, I spend a lot of time just reflecting gratitude. So, I get to see them and spend time with them, which is such an added bonus. The fandom is a little split on Mary. We just have a little conversation about what their perception was, and why. I think that some people were purists. I think that was hard for some people, especially when a couple of episodes in, she takes the journal and bounces because she needed to figure some stuff out. And then, she was working with the British Men of Letters, and everyone says, you know, they tried to kill Sam. But that was just one rogue agent. She was trying to rid the world of monsters, and she made them sad for a minute while doing that. I always point out: A Winchester takes it upon themselves to do something sort of secretive, but for the greater good while selflessly potentially sacrificing themselves and their relationship for the greater good for the wellbeing of the people they love. Do you know anyone else who's ever done something like that every week? Looking back, do you have a favorite con memory? In Vegas, we got all four Winchesters onstage, and that was just a moment. But also, there have been times where you connect with one particular fan and you have a moment where you realize that you're connecting as people, not as a fan and an actor — something that sort of transcends the show. What about your favorite memories from shooting the series? My very last episode, and just the knowledge while I was filming all that, that I was done. But [also] in the very beginning of Season 12, I got to work with Kim Rhodes [who played Sheriff Jody Mills], who's been one of my closest friends since before Supernatural started — to be on set with her and have our set chairs next to each other was great. And then there was an episode at the end of Season 13, in the alternate universe, and everyone was there. It was literally 15 actors, and we were all walking down a dirt road. It felt like we were on a family adventure. Is there a particular episode that stands out to you? If Supernatural returned, where do you see Mary? I think that her and John [in Heaven] have repossessed the Impala from the boys and they're on adventures. And I have a feeling that she's trying to figure out a way to get back and help some more. My nightgown in the pilot is actually pink, not white! It's been pink with white lace the entire time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's almost time for reality and the unknown to blur together once again with Expedition X. Season 10 of the Discovery Channel series hosted by Josh Gates arrives tomorrow with more chilling adventures into some haunting locales where mystery and, perhaps, the paranormal await. The new run of episodes kicks off with a two-part premiere that'll whisk Gates off to the ruins of Spike Island in Ireland alongside his paranormal researcher, Heather Amaro, to see if the alleged encounters with spirits of the dead by both visitors and inmates alike hold any weight. Before the first part arrives, Collider can exclusively share a new sneak peek that shows the pair turning to a classic piece of equipment used to contact those beyond the grave — a Ouija board. Although the first answer isn't clear, they get an affirmative response when asking if someone is trying to communicate. Both swear they aren't pushing it, and decide to continue by asking if the spirit with them was the face they spotted in the window earlier. Eerily, it answers no, but it does give an answer they believe means it was one of the four prisoners kept in that room of the once infamous prison. Once viewed as Ireland's most brutal prison, it's now known for the many stories of paranormal activity going on within its walls. With two episodes airing across consecutive weeks, it'll be a deep dive into the history and horrors of the prison, with the potential of finding evidence of something beyond this world. "Ireland's Alcatraz" is just one such destination on the docket for Expedition X Season 10. Gates, Amaro, and scientist Phil Torres will be back to chasing down mysteries and legends all over the world, from supernatural hotspots to mythical creatures. That includes a visit to the infamous house that inspired The Conjuring, the Bridgewater Triangle in Massachusetts, which has been a hotbed for UFO and Bigfoot sightings, and Spain, where reports of soul-stealing zombies have cropped up. The team also plans an episode set entirely in the hometown of horror legend Stephen King, Bangor, Maine. Expedition X returns to the Discovery Channel tomorrow, August 20, at 9 p.m. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Be the first to post your thoughts. Only the live-action series will return in 2026. Are streamers testing viewers' patience too much? From start to finish, you can't go wrong.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Program's underlying instructions for its conversations with users include promotion of ‘wild theories' The billionaire's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot – known as Grok – is programmed to include a digital “persona” that is “deep in YouTube conspiracy video rabbit holes” and it will discuss “wild conspiracy theories about anything and everything”, new data show. According to AI researchers who have studied the chatbot, underlying instructions known as prompts dictate how Grok behaves in its conversations with users – with one pushing conspiracy views. The instructions – which have been reviewed by The Telegraph – power different potential personality types for Grok, developed by Mr Musk's company xAI as a rival to ChatGPT. The prompt for the “conspiracy theorist” says: “You spend a lot of time on 4chan, watching Infowars videos and deep in YouTube conspiracy video rabbit holes. “You are suspicious of everything and say extremely crazy things. 4chan is an internet message board accused of fuelling far Right conspiracies, while Infowars is a fake-news site created by discredited US radio host Alex Jones. Other Grok modes include an “unhinged comedian” who, according to xAI's instructions, will come up with “f------ insane” answers. Mr Musk himself has repeatedly pushed conspiracy theories through posts on his X platform while the social media site has also been accused of promoting fake news. The 54-year old was previously forced to apologise after amplifying a post on X in 2023 that promoted an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Internet users can speak to Grok using a dedicated chatbot app, through cartoon avatars or by asking it questions on X, previously known as Twitter. While Mr Musk has promoted Grok as a “truth-seeking” chatbot and an antidote to the “woke mind virus”, the AI itself has also taken to spewing conspiracies and offensive internet memes. xAI later said it had reversed a change to its chatbot which had instructed it to “not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect”. The company also stated an “unauthorised modification” to the bot's code caused it to repeatedly bring up claims of “white genocide” in South Africa when asked about entirely unrelated topics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As author Grek Pak explains, his experience writing for other major franchises, most notably his tenure writing Marvel's Darth Vader series, has primed him to tell stories set early in Supernatural's run, which add to the overall mythology of the long-running series. In an interview with ComicsBeat.com, Pak discussed his upcoming Supernatural comic series, coming from Dynamite Entertainment, which takes fans back to the early seasons of the show. According to Pak, Darth Vader and other comics he's written, set early in existing franchises' timelines, make him a natural fit for Supernatural. Greg Pak's Supernatural is intentionally designed to dial the franchise back to its monster-hunting origins, before it became an epic struggle between heaven, hell, and other cosmic forces that far exceeded creator Eric Kripke's original vision for the show. However, that doesn't mean it will completely ignore what the show became as it evolved over its fifteen years in production. As Pak explained, the virtue in working with existing IP is to honor the stories that have already been told, even when adding to the franchise's lore at an early point in its chronology. I've written a LOT of comics that take place early in the timeline of a particular universe — like all the Darth Vader comics I wrote that fall between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. In other words, if Supernatural fans like the new comic series, they have Darth Vader to thank. Grek Pak wrote Darth Vader for fifty issues, and the series arguably served as the centerpiece of Marvel's contributions to the new Disney-era Star Wars canon during its run. As Greg Pak stated, the "challenge" of writing for a franchise like Supernatural or Star Wars is that fans invariably judge each story against its contribution to the overall lore, not just in terms of how it fits into its particular era. It is a bit of a tight-wire act, but one that is especially satisfying for fans when walked successfully. Greg Pak has proven he excels at this, and Supernatural fans should be especially eager to return to Sam and Dean's early years with this author at the helm. Supernatural #1 will be available October 1, 2025 from Dynamite Entertainment. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Whether they're a Hellspawn, a vengeful, resurrected spirit or an angry Superman stand-in, these 25 heroes prove you don't need Marvel or DC. The Justice League may be the DCU's best team, but one hero thinks that heroes like Superman and Wonder Woman aren't enough to stop what's coming. Almost a year later, it's worth exploring why 2021's award-winning Nightwing run was such a definitive and transformative journey for the DC hero. Marvel has just totally rewritten Avengers lore, introducing a new founding hero to its flagship franchise. Simba and Mufasa are returning in a new prequel adventure to "The Lion King," which will shed new light on their father/son dynamic before the film.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warning: This article contains mentions of death and suicide. If you have ever worked the night shift and had a paranormal experience, feel free to tell us about it using this anonymous form! I do not want to play with you.' She was sound asleep in her bed. My boss at the time came in to help me care for the women in that room. When we walked out of the room, I told him about what happened and what I had heard. Before I could even finish my sentence, he physically pulled me aside and, in a very serious tone, said, 'We do not talk about the little girl.' "Occasionally, there's a strong smell of cigarettes (she was a chain smoker), regular footsteps walking over the wooden floors, and even the sound of her dogs following her. Two mediums stayed here once and told us that the previous owner was furious with what had been done to her home, especially her private lounge being made into a small cinema. Things malfunction regularly, so we believe it's her curse." "One of my coworkers had been targeted by a stalker. It got so bad that she eventually left the area entirely, and he was so distraught that he committed suicide. The week after his death, I was setting up a bakery case, and through the glass, I saw him sitting in his usual chair, staring toward the counter like usual. When I stood up, he was gone. My next shift, I walked over to that chair and said kindly but firmly, '[Former coworker's name] isn't here anymore. "One night, we finished our shift like usual at three o'clock and started the drive home. This meant we were driving very slowly and cursing the fact that it was going to be well after 6 a.m. when we got home, although we thought something was off because it seemed we were constantly driving uphill, even though the route was overall flat. Finally, he dropped me off at home, and I went into the kitchen to grab a glass of water when I glanced at the clock. I looked at my phone, and sure enough, it was 4:30. At that moment, I got a text from my colleague who'd just arrived home, asking, 'How the hell is it only 4:30?' This was after a drive that, in good conditions, would have taken at least two hours to complete, yet somehow, in thick fog, driving at one-third of our regular speed, it only took one and a half hours." "The forklift was stopped at the time, and I was unpacking about 10 feet away, just watching it creep. Coworkers have told me they've seen shadows walking around the area, long after all the other employees left." "Then I noticed items falling and moving on their own. The overnighters had previously mentioned it being haunted, but I took it with a grain of salt until that night. Apparently, the store was built on a Native American burial ground!" "When I looked over, there was a lady motioning me to let her in. I told her that it would be a minute because I had to get the head nurse, as we couldn't just let anyone into those units. She became alarmed and said that was part of the old hospital that had been sealed off, and there is absolutely no way anyone can get in. I told everyone that we apparently had a ghost who really wanted to be in the pediatric department." "One night, around midnight, I was alone and closing up. To this day, I vividly remember, I'd just finished with the fifth projector and was walking to the fourth one when I heard whistling directly behind me, like someone was whistling a little tune. "When he went to check them out, he couldn't find anyone, but then he heard the voices coming from the other end of the restaurant. He was freaked out and asked me what it could be. I just stared at him for a second and said, 'You heard them too?' I chalked it up to some kind of weird vibration coming through the A/C, but here's the thing: I'd been working there for seven years and neither I nor any other staff member had ever experienced anything like that." My colleagues were scared; they hadn't witnessed a death before, and it was new to them. I went to switch the alarm off, but her spirit was already gone." "I won't explain the entire room layout, but there was a thin elevator that brought large rolls of film from the floor above us. The elevator had a sensor that triggered an alarm and stopped it from moving if you put something in it when the lid wasn't down. I was sitting in the chair, waiting for an issue with production to be straightened out so we could continue with our work, and my coworker was working at the machine against the wall. Everything was dead silent, and then the alarm started going off. My coworker and I both jumped out of our skin. It's a clean room environment, no bugs or dust to trigger the alarm. I worked there for five years, and it only happened that once. I never really felt comfortable in that room on night shift on my own, I always felt like something was watching." One night, around 2 a.m., I looked out the window and saw a shadowy man with a hat walking along the corridor. I did a double-take, and he disappeared. I wasn't freaked out and told my coworker about it. I did some research and found pictures of men back then wearing the same hats." "After everyone else left, I stayed with the assistant manager to finish closing up and deal with paperwork. When I reached that area to sort the paperwork and money, the door slammed shut behind me, which was unusual because it's a lightweight door. I called for my coworker, thinking she had done it, but she didn't answer, so I used my walkie-talkie to contact her. At that point, the room got colder, and I started to hurry. Just as I was about to leave, a box of donation stickers for St. Jude's tipped over and fell to the floor. I thought, 'Forget this,' and ran fast to set the alarm. I told my coworker it was time to leave. The scariest part was when she said, 'You saw it too?' "So, while I was sitting alone at the register, waiting, I heard our first ghost, a woman who always just says, 'Excuse me!' After I saw him, champagne bottles spontaneously opened and sprayed everywhere." The first thing that came to mind was someone either got stuck in there and couldn't get out, or maybe someone had snuck in, so I walked over and said 'Hello.' Then another knock came, three times right in front of my face — someone was knocking on the door from the other side. I have never run through a patrol so fast in my life." "I was there alone and heard continuous tapping on a keyboard and rustling of papers in one of the cubicles. So, I decided to see if someone was there and asked, 'Is anyone here?' That's when a light started flickering on and off in an adjacent office." All the power went off, not completely out of the ordinary, but it usually comes back on within a second or two; this time, it would NOT come back on. I called the engineer, and he explained that the factory was on a time clock and it should have been turning off every night. He couldn't explain why it had stayed on every other night unless someone had gotten a ladder and changed it within the last day. Later that night, I was in the loading bay, which has a massive metal delivery door (I frequently work down there, so I know the normal sounds it makes). Out of nowhere, there were two loud bangs against the door. It was so loud that my boss came running over, thinking I'd hurt myself. "One inmate, whom I'll call 'Inmate X,' was a long-term resident of the medical post, which was unusual. He was a jolly-looking guy who was already sentenced and awaiting space in a state prison that could handle his medical needs, as he was terminally ill; however, his crimes were so heinous that his request for compassionate release was denied. Several months later, I was assigned to spend the second half of one shift in the medical area. We had a very late rotation, so I didn't get on post until nearly 2 a.m. After checking up on everyone, I went to the nurses' office to get some coffee. The nurse on duty asked me, 'Did they tell you in your roll call that Inmate X finally passed away?' Generally, the average deputy doesn't keep tabs on inmates once they go to state prison." "My instincts told me to leave, but I, of course, couldn't — relief was still a few hours away. Note: Some responses have been edited for length and/or clarity.</p>

Roswell: The Final Evidence is presented by Dr David Hall

Germany's ZDF has acquired two titles exploring historic and modern encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena from UK-based distributor Espresso Media International.

The German broadcaster will air Roswell: The Final Evidence (2×45'/1×86′), in which Dr David Hall and his team investigate the conspiracy theories surrounding one of the most famous UFO stories of all time.

Foo Fighters (2×45′), meanwhile, traces sightings of strange airborne objects from WWII to modern military tech, examining how decades of secrecy continue to blur the line between fact and fiction.

Italian pubcaster Rai has taken Decoding Turner (1×90′), a one-off doc that uncovers potential hidden codes in the paintings of J.M.W. Turner, from Espresso Media International.

In France, Mediawan has acquired space and history programming including Off Earth (1×52′), which follows the companies behind the private space race and the billionaires driving commercial spaceflight, and JFK: 24 Hours that Changed the World (1×46′), which tells the story of the last 24 hours of John Kennedy's life before his assassination.</p>
