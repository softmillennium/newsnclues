                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, Reuters reported that three US Navy destroyers and some 4,000 military personnel would arrive at the edge of Venezuela's territorial waters within the next 36 hours. On Tuesday, however, a US Department of Defense official said there are currently no US ships in the area and nor have the ships received orders to head there. Venezuelan territory has almost 2,500 miles of coastline. “This week I am going to activate a special plan to guarantee coverage with more than 4.5 million militiamen throughout the national territory. Militias prepared, activated, and armed,” Maduro said during a televised meeting with the country's governors and mayors. The president described the “extravagant, bizarre and outlandish” US threats as “rotten rehashes,” without specifying what he was referring to. No empire will touch the sacred soil of Venezuela, nor should it touch the sacred soil of South America,” he emphasized in his speech. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked Tuesday about a possible troop deployment to Venezuela following reports of the military buildup. “President (Donald) Trump has been very clear and consistent. She also reiterated the US government's position that Maduro “is not a legitimate president.” Washington and Caracas have not had formal bilateral diplomatic relations since 2019. The Venezuelan government rejected Washington's accusation of drug trafficking, saying in a statement that the US was resorting to “threats and defamation.” Maduro said he will move forward with a plan to activate peasant and worker militias “in all factories and workplaces in the country.” “Missiles and rifles for the working class, to defend our homeland,” he said. The Global Fire Power website, which specializes in military analyses and uses official statistics or makes estimates when they are not available, ranks Venezuela 50th in military power in the 2025 ranking, among 145 countries. The United States ranks first, Russia second, and China third. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello has said that the Cartel de los Soles is an “invention” of the US, and the Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López has ‘categorically' rejected Washington's “ridiculous” accusations. CNN's Michael Rios and Haley Britzky contributed to this report.</p>

Anti-corruption protests rocked the Serbian capital of Belgrade as student-led demonstrators clashed with supporters of President Aleksandar Vucic and his political party, demanding new elections. Violent clashes between anti-government protesters and Serbian security forces have intensified over the last week, with protesters setting fire to an office building belonging to the ruling party in Novi Sad. We will use everything at our disposal to restore law, peace and order," President Vucic said in an address to the nation Saturday night. Demonstrators stand in clouds of tear gas during anti-government protests in Belgrade on August 16. The canopy at the railway station collapsed Nov. 1 after renovations led by two Chinese companies. In his speech, Vucic said that justice must be served for all those responsible for the 16 victims of the Novi Sad rail station collapse. Critics have called out the heavy-handed response used against protesters. Alan Berset, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, said in a post on X that he was concerned with the rising violence. Students and anti-government demonstrators light the flashlights of their mobile phones during a protest, which has become a national movement for change following the deadly November 2024 Novi Sad railway station roof collapse, in Belgrade, Serbia, March 15. "I call for calm and respect of the right to peaceful assembly. Serbian authorities must uphold Council of Europe standards. The rule of law and respect for human rights must prevail," Berset said. Serbia's foreign minister, Marko Djuric, responded to the criticism in a statement to Fox News Digital. "We respect and protect peaceful protest—it is part of our democratic fabric. "This is by far the biggest threat Vucic has faced in the last 13 years, and it is very unlikely that Vucic will weather the storm without elections," Helena Ivanov, senior fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital. The only way out of the problem is to hold free and fair elections as soon as possible. "Everything else will further destabilize the situation, which could have devastating consequences," Ivanov added. Serbian riot police clash with anti-government protesters in Belgrade on August 13. What originally started as spontaneous protests voicing dissatisfaction with the government's failed response to the railway catastrophe transformed into a movement opposing widespread corruption and the erosion of the rule of law under Vucic. Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City in 2019. Vucic said he accidentally voted against Russia in a Ukrainian resolution because he was "probably tired." Serbia's then-Prime Minister Milos Vucevic announced his resignation in January amid the nationwide protests, making him the most senior government member to step down. To this day, no one has been held accountable," Filip Ubović, a student from the University of Belgrade and protest participant on the ground in Belgrade, told Fox News Digital.

(AP Photo/Matt York, File) A U.S. appeals court has temporarily blocked the transfer of federal forest land in Arizona to a pair of international companies that plan to mine one of the largest copper deposits in North America. But a panel of judges with the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals issued a temporary injunction late Monday in response to last-minute appeals by a Native American tribe and environmentalists. The land includes Oak Flat — an area used for centuries for religious ceremonies, prayer and gathering of medicinal plants by the San Carlos Apache people and other Native American tribes. The fight over Oak Flat has spanned two decades, with the latest legal wrangling centered on a required environmental review that was released by the U.S. Forest Service earlier this summer and an appraisal of the land to be mined by Resolution Copper about 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Phoenix. Before the land exchange can happen, the plaintiffs argued that the federal government must prepare a comprehensive review that covers “every aspect of the planned mine and all related infrastructure.” They said the government failed to consider the potential for a dam breach, pipeline failure and if there was an emergency plan for a tailings storage area. “This injunction comes in a desperate time of asking for miracles, all over the country and all over the world,” Wendsler Nosie Sr. of the group Apache Stronghold said in a statement shared on social media. Nosie, a former tribal chairman, described the land and water at Oak Flat as precious. Apache Stronghold, the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other plaintiffs having been fighting for years to save what tribal members call Chi'chil Bildagoteel. The area is dotted with oak groves and traditional plants the Apaches consider essential to their religion. “We will continue praying that the court understands the grave injustice of trading our sacred grounds to foreign mining companies that seek to destroy Chí'chil Biłdagoteel to extract copper that will be exported overseas,” Tribal Chairman Terry Rambler said in statement. Resolution Copper — a subsidiary of international mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP — estimates the mine will generate $1 billion a year for Arizona's economy and create thousands of jobs. Resolution Copper has said the project underwent an extensive review by the U.S. Forest Service that has included consultation with tribes that have ancestral ties to the land. “The collaborative process has directly led to major changes to the mining plan to preserve and reduce potential impacts on tribal, social, environmental and cultural interests,” the company stated. The Forest Service has argued in court filings that it has no discretion because the land exchange was mandated by Congress when language was included in a must-pass national defense spending bill that was signed into law in 2014 by then-President Barack Obama. There have been unsuccessful legislative attempts in the years since to withdraw the Oak Flat area from mining activity.</p>

Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang joins ‘Fox News Live' to explain how a potential peace deal between Ukraine and Russia could be viewed in Asia, particularly by China and North Korea. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un called for the rapid buildup of his nation's nuclear arsenal on Tuesday, reacting to joint military operations by the U.S. and South Korea. Kim called the military exercises an "obvious expression of their will to provoke war," according to North Korean state media. The U.S. and South Korea began their annual military drills, dubbed Ulchi Freedom Shield, this week and operations will continue sporadically through September. "Through this move, North Korea is demonstrating its refusal to accept denuclearization and the will to irreversibly upgrade nuclear weapons," Hong Min, a North Korea analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told Reuters. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un called on his country to "rapidly expand" its nuclear arsenal. The rise in tensions comes just days after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung announced plans to end some military activities along its border with North Korea, as well as restore a 2018 military agreement with its neighbor. It also ended military drills near the border and removed some guard posts along the Demilitarized Zone. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung says his government is taking "gradual steps" to reduce tensions with North Korea. The deal was signed at an inter-Korean summit in 2018, but it eventually fell apart as cross-border tensions ensued. South Korea also dismantled its speakers along the border that had broadcast anti-North Korea messaging for years, a move Pyongyang reciprocated. Col. Lee Sung-jun, left, public affairs director of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Col. Ryan Donald, public affairs director of the United Nations Command, attend the press briefing for the Ulchi Freedom Shield exercise at the Defense Ministry on Aug. 7, 2025, in Seoul, South Korea. Lee said his government would continue to make "gradual steps to restore the September 19 Military Agreement." "I hope that North Korea will reciprocate our efforts to restore trust and revive dialogue," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microphones picked up conversations that U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders had as they gathered for talks at the White House. Vice President Joe Biden whispers “This is a big f------ deal,” to President Barack Obama after introducing Obama during the health care bill ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, March 23, 2010. U.S. President Barack Obama, left, and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev chat during a bilateral meeting at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, March, 26, 2012. The magnifier of sound, a descendant of 150-year-old technology, on Monday added to its long history of cutting through the most scripted political spectacles when it captured more than two minutes of U.S. President Donald Trump and eight European leaders chit-chatting around a White House news conference on their talks to end Russia's war in Ukraine. The standout quote came from Trump himself to French President Emmanuel Macron even before anyone sat down. The American president, reflecting his comments after meeting in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin: “I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand, as crazy as it sounds.” As public figures, they've long known what the rest of us are increasingly learning in the age of CCTV, Coldplay kiss cams and social media: In public, no one can realistically expect privacy. “Whenever I hear about a hot mic moment, my first reaction is that this is what they really think, that it's not gone through the external communications filter,” said Bill McGowan, founder and CEO of Clarity Media Group in New York. Hot mics, often leavened with video, have bedeviled aspiring and actual leaders long before social media. “My fellow Americans,” Reagan quipped, not realizing the practice run was being recorded. We begin bombing in five minutes.” The Soviet Union didn't find it funny and condemned it given the consequential subject at hand. Putin, too, has fallen prey to the perils of a live mic. In 2006, he was quoted in Russian media joking about Israel's president, who had been charged with and later was convicted of rape. The Kremlin said Putin was not joking about rape and his meaning had been lost in translation. Sometimes a hot mic moment involves no words at all. Presidential candidate Al Gore was widely parodied for issuing exasperated and very audible sighs during his debate with George W. Bush in 2000. In others, the words uttered for all to hear are profane. “This is a big f———- deal,” then-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden famously said, loudly enough to be picked up on a microphone, as President Barack Obama prepared to sign his signature Affordable Care Act in 2010. Obama was caught on camera in South Korea telling Dmitri Medvedev, then the Russian president, that he'll have “more flexibility” to resolve sensitive issues — “particularly with missile defense” — after the 2012 presidential election, his last. Live mics have picked up name-calling and gossip aplenty even in the most mannerly circles. In 2022, Jacinda Ardern, then New Zealand's prime minister, known for her skill at debating and calm, measured responses, was caught on a hot mic tossing an aside in which she referred to a rival politician as “such an arrogant pr—-” during Parliament Question Time. In 2005, Jacques Chirac, then president of France, was recorded airing his distaste for British food during a visit to Russia. Speaking to Putin and Gerhard Schroder, he was heard saying that worse food could only be found in Finland, according to widely reported accounts. He can be heard grousing: “Oh, God, I hate this!” and muttering, “I can't bear this bloody thing … every stinking time.” It wasn't the first pen that had troubled him. The British ability to poke fun at oneself, he said in a speech the next year, is well known: “Just as well, you may say, given some of the vicissitudes I have faced with frustratingly failing fountain pens this past year.” But even he had trouble putting a lid on comments he made before he was a candidate to “Access Hollywood” in tapes that jeopardized his campaign in the final stretch of the 2016 presidential race. Trump did not appear to know the microphone was recording. Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News and aired just two days before his debate with Hillary Clinton. With major supporters balking, Trump issued an apology “if anyone was offended,” and his campaign dismissed the comments as “locker room banter.” Dismissed unceremoniously from the White House in March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now sat at the table with Trump and seven of his European peers: Macron, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Finland's President Alexander Stubb, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Stubb asked Trump if he's “been through this every day?”</p>

Flanagan's Aug. 14 arrest was captured in body cam footage that the Newport Police Department released to the public. In the video, Flanagan is heard repeatedly telling officers that she is “an AG.” After Flanagan is handcuffed and placed into the back of a police car, she criticizes the arresting officer for not reciting her Miranda rights. “You're going to regret this,” Flanagan says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is deploying three Aegis guided-missile destroyers to the waters off Venezuela as part of President Donald Trump's effort to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels, according to a U.S. official briefed on the planning. A Defense Department official confirmed that the military assets have been assigned to the region in support of counter narcotics efforts. The official, who was not authorized to comment about military planning, said the vessels would be deployed “over the course of several months.” The deployment of U.S. destroyers and personnel comes as Trump has pushed for using the U.S. military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into American communities and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities. Trump has also pressed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically being more aggressive in pursuit of Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Trump and others of intervention by the U.S. military. Trump in February designated Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, MS-13 in El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations. His Republican administration has also stepped up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members. The designation is normally reserved for groups like al-Qaida or the Islamic State group that use violence for political ends — not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels. Venezuela's Communication Ministry didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said the U.S. had increased its threats against Venezuela and announced he was going to order the deployment of more than 4.5 million militia members around the country. The militias were created by then-President Hugo Chávez to incorporate volunteers who could assist the armed forces in the defense of external and domestic attacks. “The empire has gone mad and has renewed its threats to Venezuela's peace and tranquility,” Maduro said at an event in Caracas, without mentioning any specific action. Earlier this month, the Trump government announced it was doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine. Maduro was indicted in a New York federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. Back then, the U.S. offered a $15 million reward for his arrest.</p>

JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson during a visit to Illinois on Aug. 8, 2025. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) invoked President Franklin Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II as the Trump administration was set to open a massive detention center at Fort Bliss in Texas on Monday. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) torched the comparison, with a top official left wondering why an organization with such a name "care[s] more about illegal aliens than U.S. citizens," in comments to Fox News Digital. "Comparisons of illegal alien detention centers to internment camps used during World War II are deranged and lazy. The ACLU's smears against our brave ICE law enforcement are no doubt contributing to the more than 1,000% increase in assaults against them," Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. 70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges in the U.S. — that doesn't even include known or suspected terrorists, foreign gang members, convictions for violent crimes in foreign countries, or INTERPOL notices." "The renewed use of this base to detain immigrants and stage deportations comes as the Trump administration continues to misuse military resources to deport long-standing residents and other immigrants," the release read, calling the president's mass-deportation agenda "dystopian." "President Trump's use of Fort Bliss for the nation's largest immigrant detention site is cruel and a reminder of a shameful detention legacy," added Sarah Mehta, a top official in the ACLU's Equality Division – who also called on Congress to stop DHS' agenda. "Thousands of people, including our neighbors and loved ones, will be torn from their communities while this administration enlists the military to rubberstamp its abusive agenda." Fort Bliss — named after the son-in-law of Mexican-American War hero and later President Zachary Taylor — also held a small number of German and Italian immigrants during World War II. In 1942, Roosevelt initiated an executive order targeting Americans descended from countries representing the Axis powers. The Democrat ushered in the incarceration of about 120,000 Japanese-Americans and smaller numbers of Italian and German descendants. While Fort Bliss was not a main "internment camp," it did hold small numbers of interred U.S. citizens, including as many as 70 "Issei," or first-generation Japanese-Americans living along the Pacific Coast. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, toured Fort Bliss' new detention facility last week and told El Paso's NBC affiliate that the people who will be held there are already on their way out of the U.S. The U.S. Army Fort Bliss base stands in El Paso, Texas,. "These are people under final orders of deportation ... They have no legal right to be here," Cornyn said. El Paso's member of Congress, Democrat Veronica Escobar, disagreed. Escobar argued the $1 billion price tag would "enrich" private contractors and siphon funds from other needs in her district. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Starting in the 2027–2028 school year, Illinois will be the first state to force annual mental health screenings on all public school kids in grades 3-12. It sounds noble, but I'm not sold. This plan raises red flags that could spell more trouble than solutions. First off, the idea of shifting mental healthcare from reactive to preventive sounds great on paper. Who doesn't want to stop problems before they spiral? According to Wirepoints, only 39% of students—1.1 million kids—read at grade level. If schools can't teach kids to read and write properly, why should we trust them to play therapist? I'd argue that building confidence through real academic success—pushing kids to excel, not just pass—does more for their mental health than any questionnaire ever could. No two kids are alike, and a one-size-fits-all tablet quiz can't capture that. They're not equipped to dig into the root of a kid's struggles… The state says these will be "age-appropriate," but kids, especially young ones, aren't exactly known for nuance. A third-grader might check "sad" because they lost their favorite pencil, or a teen might exaggerate home issues out of frustration. The state promises privacy and follow-ups by professionals, but with thousands of kids screened, who's ensuring every case is handled right? One slip-up, and families could face real consequences. A true psychologist must investigate these issues to get to the root of the problem and that takes time. Also, there has been a shortage of mental health professionals in this country. Look at the Uvalde, Texas, shooting in 2022—mental health professionals were in short supply then, and the American Psychological Association reported a nationwide shortage of school psychologists as recently as 2024. Illinois schools are already stretched thin with counselors; who's handling the fallout when a kid is flagged? They're not trained for this, and piling on more work isn't fair or feasible. The data angle is another red flag. These screenings will churn out sensitive info—moods, behaviors, maybe family dynamics. In today's world, information is power, and this data could be sliced up by race, gender or income to spotlight disparities. The state's push for health equity, as seen in its Beacon Portal, suggests they'll use this to argue certain groups need more help. J.B. Pritzker speaks at the office of the Center for American Progress (CAP) Action Fund on March 18, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Parents already worry about schools overstepping; handing over this kind of data doesn't build trust. No two kids are alike, and a one-size-fits-all tablet quiz can't capture that. They're not equipped to dig into the root of a kid's struggles, and with professional shortages, many kids flagged by screenings might not get the help they need. Here's a better way: use the state's budget to boost academic programs that build kids' confidence alongside targeted mental health support for those who need it. That respects families, eases the burden on overworked schools, and avoids the risk of sensitive data being mishandled or misused. Illinois can't afford to get this wrong.

For all the talk of a new, lasting multiracial coalition that helped elect President Donald Trump, there are clues that this support may be wavering, particularly among Latino voters. Polls show the president's approval rating with this group has plummeted since the last election, and a third of Latinos who voted for him say they are unlikely to back a Republican candidate in the next one. Latino voters are souring not only on the president generally, but also on his handling of key issues like immigration and the economy — the very topics that boosted his support with them initially. Instead, many Latino voters express dissatisfaction with both parties. This shifting dynamic suggests that both parties have been operating on flawed assumptions over the last few years. Democrats made the mistake of treating Latinos as a monolithic group, focusing on social justice issues while failing to address economic concerns that were pushing these voters toward the GOP. Now, Republicans may be poised to make a similar mistake. They have largely viewed these voters as Republicans-in-waiting, banking on a rightward drift that they assume extends to the most extreme parts of the conservative social agenda. This approach risks alienating a large segment of the Latino electorate. Ultimately, both parties are learning a crucial lesson: Demographics aren't destiny, and they need a more nuanced understanding of this diverse and rapidly changing group of voters. Working-class, non-college educated, and male Latinos, as well as those from Florida and the Southwest, began to drift away from Democrats, particularly at the national level. They were more intrigued by Republican pitches centered around the economy, small business growth, and affordability. Democrats, it turns out, misread Latino voters' priorities and beliefs, gradually losing support from the peak they had from 2012 to 2016 (when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton enjoyed 40-point margins). The party largely approached Latinos as “voters of color,” marginalized minorities who could be mobilized through appeals to identity, immigrant solidarity, and social justice. For some time, this worked, but Latinos weren't behaving like a monolithic group. Instead, Latinos would fracture and become more dissimilar during this time, with various kinds of evangelicals, border residents, naturalized immigrants, and working-class Latinos remaining or becoming more conservative as the Democratic Party and its white, college-educated base became more progressive. In 2021, the Pew Research Center found that the most liberal, educated, and politically engaged Democrats exerted outsized influence on their party. Republicans sought to make the old Reagan line, that “Hispanics are conservatives, [but] they just don't know it yet,” come true by hammering home the idea that Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party were too radical and out of touch. Latinos concerned with immigration and the economy shifted to Republicans, and Trump posted a double-digit boost in support among Latinos, shrinking the Democratic advantage another 20 points. An array of data suggests that this advantage is looking more short-lived, largely because Republicans aren't taking into account the nuances of Latino voters. Latino voters are rapidly changing, existing as both a racial minority and an assimilating, formerly immigrant generation. The most recent evidence for this divergence comes from two research projects undertaken by the Democratic-aligned Equis Research group. In the spring, they tracked growing dissatisfaction among Latino voters with Trump's handling of the economy, cost of living, and immigration. Even among what Equis calls “Biden defectors,” those former Democrats who switched to supporting Trump in 2024, a slight majority were beginning to turn on Trump's economic policies. This dynamic extended to immigration, where an overwhelming majority of all Latino voters thought the administration's actions were “going too far and targeting the types of immigrants who strengthen our nation.” Some 36 percent of Trump-voting Latinos said the same thing, and a majority of Biden defectors, some 64 percent, felt the same way. This suggests some degree of remaining immigrant solidarity among these swingier, evolving segments of the Latino electorate and disapproval over how mass deportations and aggressive anti-immigrant policies will affect law-abiding immigrants and their families. Nearly two-thirds of Latinos in Equis' polling believe that the Trump administration's actions “will make it difficult for hardworking Latinos to feel safe, by increasing racial profiling and harassing all Latinos regardless of immigration status.” In other words, there is a limit to what various kinds of Latino voters are willing to stomach. Biden defectors, Equis finds, are net negative on Trump's economic policies: -6 percent of support in May and -8 percent in July. Whether this dynamic not only hurts the GOP but also helps Democrats is unclear. Instead, they increasingly distrust both parties on this question. But together, these signs suggest that the GOP is going too far with their policy and ideological mission in Trump's second term, turning off the new converts they won to their coalition over the last 10 years. The two major parties are making errors with Latino voters. Latinos do have some things that bind them together, and they are not just like white voters who can ignore discrimination and scapegoating and uprooting of their extended community's lives (as immigration enforcement is showing). Democrats tried to do this in 2024, moderating on immigration, dropping the usage of the term “Latinx,” and investing in hyper-specific, hyper-local campaigning with various kinds of Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans, and others. But there was only so much campaigning they could do when facing a wave of anti-Biden, anti-incumbent electoral sentiment. Some of this nuanced campaigning did carry over to 2024, but it focused more on young and male Latinos in general. Latino voters are rapidly changing, existing as both a racial minority and an assimilating, formerly immigrant generation. A liberal writer explains her journey through intellectual MAGAland. But could corporate fear of Trump retaliation also play a role? Trump's DC police takeover doesn't poll well. But the public continues to distrust Democrats on crime. Progressives can't afford to trust their guts. ﻿Trump emerged from talks with little to show for it.</p>

South Korean military soldiers arrive for an anti-terror drill as a part of the annual Ulchi exercise at the government building in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025. Members of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Rapid Response Team from South Korean soldiers check up their gears upon their arrival for an anti-terror drill as a part of the annual Ulchi exercise at the government building in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025. SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un condemned South Korean-U.S. military drills and vowed a rapid expansion of his nuclear forces to counter rivals, state media said Tuesday, as he inspected his most advanced warship being fitted with nuclear-capable systems. Kim's visit to the western port of Nampo on Monday came as the South Korean and U.S. militaries kicked off their annual large-scale summertime exercise to bolster readiness against growing North Korean threats. The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, which the allies describe as defensive, will mobilize 21,000 troops, including 18,000 South Koreans, for computer-simulated command post operations and field training. North Korea has long denounced the allies' joint drills as invasion rehearsals and Kim has often used them to justify his own military displays and testing activities aimed at expanding his nuclear weapons program. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war, divided by the Demilitarized Zone into North Korea and South Korea. While inspecting the warship Choe Hyon, a 5,000-ton-class destroyer first unveiled in April, Kim said the allies' joint military drills show hostility and their supposed “will to ignite a war,” the North's Korean Central News Agency said. He claimed that the exercises have grown more provocative than before by incorporating a “nuclear element,” requiring the North to respond with “proactive and overwhelming” countermeasures. Kang Yu-jung, spokesperson for South Korea's new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, who wants to improve ties with the North, said Seoul has “always regarded the Ulchi exercises as defensive” but offered no further comment on Kim's remarks. South Korea's Defense Ministry said it had no immediate new assessments to share regarding the North Korean warship's capabilities. Kim has hailed the development of his naval destroyer, Choe Hyon, as a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military. State media said the destroyer, which is being prepared to enter active duty next year, is designed to handle various weapons systems, including antiair and anti-naval weapons, as well as nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. During Monday's visit to Nampo, Kim also reviewed North Korean efforts to complete a third destroyer by October, KCNA said. While inspecting Choe Hyon, Kim expressed satisfaction with the progress of the warship's weapons tests and its integrated operations system, saying the navy's modernization and move toward nuclear-capable capabilities are proceeding as planned. He instructed officials to carry out performance tests in October, KCNA said. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened in recent years as Kim accelerated his military nuclear program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. His government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Washington and Seoul to revive negotiations aimed at winding down his nuclear and missile programs, which derailed in 2019 following a collapsed summit with U.S. President Donald Trump during his first term. But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea's launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume front-line military activities and propaganda campaigns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was the best day Ukraine has had in a very long time. But it's still hard to see how the war unleashed by Russia's brutal invasion ends any time soon. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House on Monday and, unlike last time, there wasn't a blow-up in the Oval Office. President Donald Trump offered tantalizing glimpses of how he could approach presidential greatness by saving Ukraine, securing Europe and genuinely deserving the Nobel Peace Prize. A phalanx of European leaders who came to support Zelensky were impressive and unusually unified despite their wide ideological divergences. They took turns in on-camera remarks to try to invest Trump with a political and emotional rationale for standing with Ukraine. This is how the West is supposed to work, with an American president leading powerful Europeans who share common goals. It is a measure of the fracture in the transatlantic alliance and Trump's brittle temperament that avoiding disasters is seen as serious progress, especially after the president's concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin at their unctuous summit in Alaska last week. By evening, Trump was posting on social media about a potential three-way summit he'd host soon that would also include Zelensky and Putin that could be preceded by a one-on-one between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said such a meeting could happen within two weeks, suggesting accelerating diplomatic momentum. Finnish President Alexander Stubb told Trump that “in the past two weeks, we've probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three and a half years.” For once, this wasn't a foreign leader indulging in self-abasement to ingratiate themselves with a US president who craves adulation. But the day also served to expose the questions that will become increasingly evident in the coming weeks that could scupper Trump's push for peace and shatter Western unity — in a way that would delight Putin. There was a lot of happy talk over the need to give Ukraine security guarantees after any peace deal. Trump even signaled he'd send support from the US military. But no one has yet explained how this would work — and, more importantly, what Russia would stomach as part of a deal. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni raised one proposal for a set of guarantees by Western nations modeled on NATO's Article 5 mutual defense pledge. This would be outside formal alliance structures but might work the same way. But, despite Trump's assurance after Alaska that Putin is open to security guarantees for Ukraine, this is a long shot. The Russian leader is fighting a war to crush his neighbor's NATO aspirations. And how strong would such guarantees be anyway? And how would Trump's MAGA base view such a new foreign commitment? The buzzword in the president's nascent peace process is “land swaps” — to create a new demarcation between an expanded Russia and a newly diminished Ukraine. Trump even gave Zelensky a map, for which he was suitably grateful, as if he doesn't already realize the tough choices ahead over land soaked in Ukrainian blood. According to officials briefed on Trump's summit with Putin, the Russian leader seeks to capture land through negotiations that his troops have failed to seize, including in the economic and industrial powerhouse region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine. This area is also the line of steel, concrete and heavily defended cities that Ukraine has built to hold Russia at bay and that it would need to deter future attacks. Ukraine would, under the Russian plan, essentially be engaging in bargaining for different parts of its own territory. Putin would get valuable strategic areas and offer, other less critical districts he's already seized elsewhere inside Ukraine. It doesn't seem much of a deal. Land swaps create epochal upheaval and seed future feuds — as the Middle East shows. There are some formulations that could withhold official recognition over disputed areas to postpone the critical decisions on sovereignty and freeze the war in place. “I think everybody is in a happy mood, and I think that is better than not being in a happy mood, I suppose,” former Trump first-term national security adviser John Bolton told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Every major peace effort looks hopeless at the start. So Trump's rush to hold summits may make sense. Perhaps he can quickly drive everyone so far along the road to peace, it will be impossible to go back. But, at some point, impossible gaps must be bridged. But Trump has now invested significant personal credibility and political capital into his push to end a war he now admits is far more complex than he'd understood when he vowed to quiet the guns within 24 hours. On Monday, Trump mostly restrained his temper in an Oval Office press event with Zelensky when reporters from conservative networks seemed to be goading him into an outburst. Then, he played the traditional convening role of a US president surrounded by transatlantic allies. He often treats friends like foes, but seems to have genuine respect for allied leaders. For once, he was squarely in the internationalist tradition of presidents like Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan or George H.W. “We're all working for the same goal, very simple goal — we want to stop the killing, get this settled,” Trump said. Several jarring moments, however, fueled concerns about Trump's true loyalties in the peace process. This kind of behavior was exactly why Trump's European counterparts rushed across the Atlantic at a weekend's notice. If there's ever a peace deal, it will probably be because Trump wielded his charisma and America's power. It's a highly unorthodox approach that may not work. Kimmage, for example, warned that Trump's strategy could shatter over its inner contradictions. “There are no details to what is happening. “You just wonder how long President Trump can juggle all these balls.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a statement, the Air Force said its top commander would retire “on or about Nov. 1.” His retirement will be accompanied by a “formal retirement ceremony with full honors” sometime in the fall. In return, Allvin would be allowed to announce the decision. Despite the pressure under which he left, Allvin thanked President Donald Trump and Hegseth in his retirement announcement. “I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve as the 23rd Air Force chief of staff, and I'm thankful for Secretary Meink, Secretary Hegseth, and President Trump's faith in me to lead our service,” Allvin said in a statement. “More than anything, I'm proud to have been part of the team of Airmen who live out our core values of integrity, service, and excellence every day as we prepare to defend this great nation.” Other Air Force figures celebrated his service in reaction. “The Air Force is fortunate to have leaders like General Dave Allvin. During his tenure, the Air Force has undertaken transformational initiatives that will enable Airmen to answer their nation's call for decades to come,” Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink, a Trump appointee confirmed in May, said. Among the main areas of contention was dissatisfaction with his oversight over a possible security crisis involving China. In June, he headed the Air Force Global Strike Command and oversaw parts of Operation Midnight Hammer.</p>
