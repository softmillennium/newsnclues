                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Black August, Mireille Fanon Mendès-France sets the record straight on her father's revolutionary legacy. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. Public gatherings this week in Jackson, Mississippi and New Orleans, Louisiana — featuring an especially distinctive guest — will honor the legacy of revolutionary psychiatrist Frantz Fanon (1925-1961). The Black Alliance for Peace, an African internationalist organization committed to peace and opposition to war and imperialism, and Cooperation Jackson, which is building a solidarity economy anchored by worker-owned co-ops in West Jackson, are co-hosting several Black August events with Fanon's eldest daughter. Mireille Fanon Mendès-France is a jurist, an educator, and an anti-racism expert who passionately shares her father's commitment to rebellion against colonialism in its many forms. She founded the Frantz Fanon Foundation in 2007 to connect his theoretical work to ongoing anti-colonialist struggles like those Black communities throughout the Deep South are facing, especially the kind of ongoing mass displacement that occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina 20 years ago. Kali Akuno of Cooperation Jackson told Truthout that Fanon Mendès-France has a great deal to share about her father's contributions in raising consciousness about what it takes to fight against fascism, “because that is what we are staring down.” Later, he fought for independence against the reactionary colonial regime in Algeria, which, Akuno said, used Nazi tactics against the national liberation movement. “We are doing this consciousness raising in a period where they are deliberately erasing all oppositional history and knowledge, and they're doing it very intentionally under the color of law. If we don't recall the lessons of our earlier generations who fought against colonial erasure, who fought against white supremacy, then we're gonna lose this battle before it even begins.” Akuno explained that a backdrop to all this is the ongoing genocide in Palestine; Fanon Mendès-France is directly tied into the struggle of Arab and North African/Southwest Asian people. “There's many intersections that we're trying to get at this year, and she's one of the best people who encapsulates it all.” Shortly before her travels to the U.S., Mireille Fanon Mendès-France spoke to Truthout by phone about combating disinformation about her father's work, her eagerness to be in community in the U.S. with anti-colonial activists, and why defeatism is not an option. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Frances Madeson: The centenary of Frantz Fanon has inspired commemorative events all over the world — in Martinique, the Caribbean island where he was born on July 20, 1925, into French colonial dominance in the region; across Europe, where he studied psychiatry and began to write explicitly about the anti-Black racism he encountered there; in Africa, where he lived and was engaged during the bloody struggle for Algerian independence from colonial France; and in the United States, where he died prematurely from leukemia on December 6, 1961, at only 36 years old. His main books — The Wretched of the Earth (1961) and Black Skin, White Masks (1952) — are still in print and have been translated into more than 25 languages. His singular contributions to anti-colonial psychiatry and humanism are widely studied and deeply embedded in the practices of a growing cadre of Fanonian psychoanalysts who deploy his insights in the service of fostering anti-colonial consciousness in the Palestine solidarity movement and beyond. The work of decolonial emancipation remains to be done. One was presented on March 15, 2025, by an organization founded by the Békés — who are descendants of former colonizers and enslavers who continue to control the island's economy. Their aim was to demonstrate that the philosophy of Tous Créoles is in line with Frantz Fanon's by extracting certain quotes and taking them out of context, thereby reinforcing their positions: “I am not a slave to the slavery that dehumanized my fathers. … I, a man of color, want only one thing: that the instrument never dominate man.” The use of these quotes supports their argument. There is a struggle for the triumph of human dignity, for the disappearance of human humiliation, whatever the origin of that humiliation.” These quotes can be interpreted in any way one wishes if one remains on the surface, but above all, they can be used to demonstrate that Frantz Fanon was not in contradiction with the dominant colonial thinking, particularly that of the Békés, who for several years have been trying to reverse the burden of proof by demonstrating, through this kind of instrumentalization of Frantz Fanon's thinking, among other things, that they stand alongside the descendants of enslaved people. These Békés are trying to do what successive Israeli governments have tried to do with the Palestinian people, victims of an illegal occupation that constitutes a war crime and genocide. The Békés try to impose their own agenda by showing their credentials to those they despise, because their colonizer's unconscious has never abandoned the coloniality of power that led them to consider Black bodies as unimportant because they are commodifiable. In twisting Fanon's thinking to a message that descendants of enslavers and the enslaved should live together in harmony without any reckoning, this is an instrumentalization of Fanonian thinking, and part of a disturbing tendency toward normalization of institutional racism, négrophobia, and colonialism which we see constantly since October 7, 2023. Why does Fanon become compatible with the most racist white thinking, which continues to enrich itself on the backs of Black people? Let us not forget that Frantz Fanon was a man of rupture, no compromise with the enemy: as presented by the Békés, he becomes consensual, stripping him of his radicalism to make him acceptable to those who rejected him for decades, criticizing him for resigning from his position as chief physician at the Blida hospital and for committing himself intellectually, physically, politically, and in solidarity to the struggle for liberation of a people who had suffered under colonial rule for over a century. In another event, organized by the Cercle Frantz Fanon, one of their speakers said that Fanon's ideas are no longer accurate or relevant because in Martinique, or in Guadeloupe, which are overseas French colonies, there is no more colonialism. As proof, he said, “Have you ever seen a colonizer giving monthly social services to the colonized people? Have you seen in a colonized country, one family having two or even three cars! ?” What is the benefit for participants at a conference organized as part of the centenary celebrations to listen to such statements? What does this thinker say to him about his difficulty in understanding the current world, which is part of a colonization that has never been abandoned but is truly violent? Fortunately, there was another event, a conference sponsored by the Caribbean Philosophical Association (CPA), and the Frantz Fanon Foundation organized one plenary. The foundation has close ties and works with grassroots organizations fighting for their rights while questioning their practices in the light of leaders who have reflected on the nature of anti-colonialist engagement from a decolonial approach. In Martinique just last fall there was an economic riot: the Vie Chère protests against the high cost of living, during which 140 protesters were arrested and four were killed. I'm reluctant to share this with you, but since you're coming to the U.S., I think you should know: A KKK flyer was distributed in Cincinnati, Ohio, widely enough that a city councilman felt compelled to issue a dignified rebuttal in a Facebook post. In it, he entreats state politicians to stop fanning damaging flames of racism about his city. What are you hoping to build with them? We have no choice but to build alliances between dominated victims of négrophobia; alliances based on ethical principles considering that the fight against institutional racism and for land and human dignity are essential if we want to change the world. The essential principle on which we must agree is that no change will be possible within the racist, capitalist, and liberal system. The poster you sent me, “Arm yourselves, white citizens of Cincinnati,” speaks loudly about this return to the future. We really need to be concerned and prepare ourselves. That is why meeting, exchanging ideas, sharing thoughts, and perhaps setting up an alert platform is part of the resistance struggle. One might wonder if it is not too late, but in this fight, defeatism has no place. Kali Akuno told Truthout that one of his aims for your joint events is to link the legacy of resistance and sacrifice in Africa with the history of struggle and resistance that came out of Hurricane Katrina, which he says is downplayed. Areas in the green dots would be left as open space in a bold land grab to create a “New” New Orleans — smaller, whiter and more affluent. Yet, the center's sustained role has been erased in dominant media narratives and the city's militant history has not been widely celebrated in Katrina commemorations. I agree with Kali; I'm also interested in discussing Fanon's thinking, his thinking in action, with people touched by the Katrina disaster. Are the outcomes of willful climate inaction — the terrifying wildfires, smoke-filled summer air, droughts, and floods and storms like Katrina — related to coloniality? Even as we're talking, there's a palpable dread of imminent mass death in Gaza because the U.S. and Israel are actively starving the people. If we want to get our emancipation, we have to try to invert the relation of power, because until now, the capitalist system has been stronger than the social movement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump escalated his campaign to purge cultural institutions of materials that conflict with his political directives on Tuesday, alleging museums were too focused on highlighting negative aspects of American history, including “how bad slavery was.” In a Truth Social post, Trump directed his attorneys to conduct a review of museums, comparing the effort to his crackdown on universities across the country. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future,” Trump wrote. The initiative, a trio of top Trump aides wrote in a letter to Smithsonian Institution secretary Lonnie Bunch III last week, “aims to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.” Exhibits at the Smithsonian take years of planning and are heavily evaluated by teams of scholars and curatorial experts before they make their debut. “Nobody could provide those kinds of materials in such a comprehensive way, in that short amount of time, and so it's just an impossible task,” she said. The White House has asked the Smithsonian to provide an array of materials, from internal emails and memos to digital copies of all placards and gallery labels currently on display. The Smithsonian declined to comment on Trump's latest remarks. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order that put Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, in charge of stopping government spending on exhibits that don't align with the administration's agenda. He also tasked a former member of his legal team, attorney Lindsey Halligan, with helping to root out “improper ideology” at the Smithsonian. The institution told CNN in July that it was committed to an “unbiased presentation of facts and history” and that it would “make any necessary changes to ensure our content meets our standards.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recent meeting with a cross-party group of British MPs in Washington, I was struck by the outright defeatism on display over the Chagos Islands surrender. I was told that Sir Keir Starmer's shameful agreement in May to hand over the British Indian Ocean Territory to Chinese ally Mauritius was a done deal, and it was pointless to even discuss it. Several of the MPs agreed that the Labour Government's decision was absolutely awful, but the overriding feeling was that nothing could be done to stop it. As the Chagos agreement is a treaty that cedes sovereign British territory, legal experts note that it must be ratified first by Westminster. And it would surely be extremely difficult for the Prime Minister to defend the agreement in Parliament if Britain's closest friend and partner stepped in to oppose it. Indeed, the Chagos issue is far from over in Washington, and major red flags are being raised in the US, despite a large-scale PR offensive waged by the Foreign Office earlier this year. There is a very real possibility that Mauritius could, a few years from now, break the agreement with the UK over Diego Garcia under pressure from Beijing, find a reason to end the lease with London, and cut an even more lucrative deal with Communist China. What if the Chinese offered Mauritius double or triple what the British Government is offering to pay? This would be a nightmare scenario for the US, resulting in the loss of an incredibly vital American base. Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana has been a prominent opponent of the UK giving the Chagos Islands away, and other Members of Congress are now weighing in. In a highly significant development this month on Capitol Hill, the powerful Republican-led House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations directly raised the issue of the Chagos Islands deal between the UK and Mauritius, urging the US Secretary of State to engage further with the British Government on assurances that vital US strategic interests are protected. This is one of the biggest deceptions by a British government in modern times, and also one of the most dangerous, with massive implications for US and British national security interests on the world stage. Significantly, the US State Department backed the Chagos deal in a statement in May, but there has never been an official declaration issued by the White House. By doing so, he would be defending vital American strategic interests, denying China a major long-term victory, and protecting a crucial military base at the heart of the US/UK Special Relationship Nile Gardiner is Director of The Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of different goods just got a lot more expensive to import into the United States, now that President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum has kicked in. Butter knives, baby strollers, spray deodorants and fire extinguishers, considered “derivative” steel and aluminum products, were previously excluded from the 50% tariff, though they were still subject to the higher country-specific tariffs Trump enacted over the last several months. However, on Friday, US Customs and Border Protection and a division of the US Commerce Department published notices informing US importers that 407 categories of goods containing steel and aluminum would immediately be subject to the 50% tariffs at 12:01 a.m. The abrupt move leaves many US-based importers between a rock and a hard place, with goods they already paid for currently in transit. If they decide to accept the goods, the importers will have to pay considerably higher tariffs. But if they, for instance, tell cargo operators not to unload their orders at US ports to avoid paying tariffs, they'll likely lose money. “Today's action expands the reach of the steel and aluminum tariffs and shuts down avenues for circumvention – supporting the continued revitalization of the American steel and aluminum industries,” Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Jeffrey Kessler said in a statement on Tuesday. As is the case with any tariff in place, businesses may not pass on the entire tariff expense they've paid to consumers by raising prices. But the chances of businesses absorbing a tariff as high as 50% will likely be slimmer compared to goods tariffed at lower rates. In addition to the 50% tariff on copper-based goods that recently took effect, the levies “will likely ripple through the manufacturing supply chain, raising production costs across construction, automotive, and electronics sectors,” analysts at the Telsey Group said in a note on Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president says it's possible Russian leader does not want to make deal Donald Trump has ruled out the deployment of American troops in Ukraine in his first interview since yesterday's White House meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. “You have my assurance, and I'm president,” Trump told Fox News talkshow Fox & Friends in a phone interview on Tuesday, when pressed on whether US forces could be sent to defend against another Russian incursion. The US president reiterated that Ukraine would not be admitted into Nato under his watch, but said that Kyiv would still receive security guarantees. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is due to hold a news briefing shortly where she'll no doubt be asked about Ukraine. I'll bring you any relevant lines here, my colleague Shrai Popat will also be covering it in full over on our US politics blog: The US president, Donald Trump, has ruled out the deployment of American troops in Ukraine, but appeared to hint at possibility of US air security guarantees. Trump today repeated his warning that Vladimir Putin would face a “rough situation” if he did not cooperate in the peace process, while Volodymyr Zelenskyy had to “show some flexibility”, PA reported. Vladimir Putin has agreed to face-to-face talks with Zelenskyy, according to Trump and European leaders, and the Ukrainian president has welcomed the news, calling a “big step forward” towards securing a peace deal. British prime minister Keir Starmer described the European leaders' talks at the White House as “good and constructive” and said they produced “real progress”. The trilateral meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy, Putin ‘can bring breakthrough on path to peace,' Ukraine's foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. Geneva is emerging as a potential location for a peace summit between Putin and Zelenskyy, as first floated by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Speaking to reporters after his White House visit, Macron said the summit should be hosted by “a neutral country, maybe Switzerland – I'm pushing for Geneva – or another country.” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said the EU would continue targeting Russia's war economy and that the next sanctions package against Moscow should be ready by next month. Italian admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone posted that the military head of Nato's forces in Europe, US General Alexus Grynkewich, would give an update “on the current security environment” as “diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Ukraine progress”, AFP reports. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said the EU would continue targeting Russia's war economy and that the next sanctions package against Moscow should be ready by next month. She was speaking after a virtual European Council summit of about the war in Ukraine, a day after an extraordinary meeting of Ukrainian and several EU leaders with U.S. president Donald Trump in Washington. Kallas said “unity among EU leaders in today's virtual summit was palpable” and that she had placed the topics of Ukraine security and Russia sanctions at the top of the agenda for talks next week among EU foreign and defence ministers. “[Vladimir] Putin cannot be trusted to honour any promise or commitment. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given Donald Trump a golf club belonging to a wounded serviceman during his visit to Washington this week, Kyiv said on Tuesday. The warm exchange marks a turnaround from February, when Zelenskyy left the White House early after a televised shouting match with Trump and US vice-president JD Vance. The club belonged to Kostiantyn Kartavtsev, a soldier who “had lost a leg in the first months of Russia's full-scale invasion while saving his brothers-in-arms”, it added. Later on Tuesday, Ukrainian veteran organisation United by Golf published a video of Trump holding the club and thanking Kartavtsev. I know a lot about golf and your swing is great,” Trump said. Zelenskyy also brought a letter for Melania Trump from his wife, Olena, thanking the US first lady for writing to Vladimir Putin and urging him to save children's lives. The EU has dropped its calls for a “ceasefire” in Ukraine and is instead demanding that Russia “stop the killing”, in a semantic shift that aims to grab the ear of US President Donald Trump, according to AFP. Her remarks echoed EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, who stood alongside Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Brussels on Sunday. Yet at the White House summit on Monday, European leaders made clear their basic demands had not changed. “I can't imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire, so let's work on that and let's try to put pressure on Russia,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan and US secretary of state Marco Rubio discussed potential steps to end the Ukraine war in a phone call on Tuesday, a Turkish foreign ministry source said. Donald Trump has ruled out the deployment of American troops in Ukraine in his first interview since yesterday's White House meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. “You have my assurance, and I'm president,” Trump told Fox News talkshow Fox & Friends in a phone interview on Tuesday, when pressed on whether US forces could be sent to defend against another Russian incursion. The US president reiterated that Ukraine would not be admitted into Nato under his watch, but said that Kyiv would still receive security guarantees. Vladimir Putin suggested holding a possible meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, in Moscow, according to two sources familiar with a phone call between US president Donald Trump and Putin. “Putin mentioned Moscow” during their call on Monday, one of the sources told AFP, adding that Zelensky had said “no” in response. What security guarantees might Ukraine get in return for a peace deal? As western leaders meet, four key questions remain about the steps they could take to prevent any future Russian aggression: Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding breaks down each one in this explainer: Slovak prime minister Robert Fico, who repeatedly clashed with Ukraine in the past and sought to block or delay some EU sanctions on Russia, also spoke in the last few minutes. “Equally important is the factual understanding that without a discussion about territorial changes in Ukraine, no progress can be made,” he said. Fico also rejected the suggestion that EU countries could take part in buying €100bn-worth of military equipment for Ukraine, saying it sounded “like a bad joke.” He said he could not imagine a siutation in which Slovakia spends money on US weapons to send them to Ukraine for free. Unsuprisingly, he's also “sceptical” about the idea of further sanctions against Russia. But he said he hoped for peace “as soon as possible” and was ready to support Ukraine's ambitions to join the European Union instead. We are just getting a line from Reuters that a meeting between Nato military leaders on Ukraine is provisionally expected to take place tomorrow. “We will work together with the United States on concrete and essential security guarantees. Ukraine's future also lies in the prosperity and stability that EU membership can provide.” The leaders also talked about “how further pressure – including through sanctions – could be placed on Putin until he showed he was ready to take serious action to end his illegal invasion.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia has resumed grain shipments to Syria from within occupied Crimea, transporting stolen grain from Ukraine's occupied territories, reported Kateryna Yaresko, a journalist with the Ukrainian SeaKrime project that tracks Russia's illegal shipping activity. The Comoros-flagged bulk carrier Damas Wave, listed in databases under its former name Golden Yara, operates regular routes between occupied Feodosia in Crimea and Syria's Tartous port, carrying grain shipments. "Regular bilateral trade relations between Russian occupiers and Syria are now underway, with stolen Ukrainian grain shipments to Syria resuming," Yaresko wrote on her X social media page. Russian forces compel farmers in temporarily occupied territories to sell grain at fixed prices significantly below market rates. In April 2025, Ukraine's security service seized a foreign vessel loaded with approximately 5,000 tons of wheat, allegedly involved in transporting stolen Ukrainian grain from Russian-occupied territories. Earlier investigations by The Kyiv Independent revealed how Russia systematically exports stolen Ukrainian coal from occupied territories through Mariupol port to global markets. Yana holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv and completed a year as an exchange student at the University of Zurich. Now, she is pursuing a master's degree in International Finance and Investment at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Aug. 19 that U.S. soldiers will not be on the ground in Ukraine to ensure security guarantees are upheld, deflecting the responsibility to European allies. The European Union's 19th package of sanctions against Russia is expected to be ready in September, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas announced on Aug. 19, as the EU ramps up its pressure on Moscow in hopes that it will push Russia to end its war in Ukraine. Russia has resumed grain shipments to Syria from within occupied Crimea, transporting stolen grain from Ukraine's occupied territories, reported Kateryna Yaresko, a journalist with the Ukrainian SeaKrime project that tracks Russia's illegal shipping activity. NATO military leaders are scheduled to meet virtually on Aug. 20 to discuss the alliance's support for Ukraine as European leaders continue negotiations with Kyiv and Washington on security agreements for the embattled country. The Kyiv Independent's deputy chief editor, Toma Istomina, sits down with Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania's former foreign minister, to discuss why the White House meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and European leaders brought little progress in stopping Russia's war. Russia launched a wave of missile and drone attacks against Ukrainian cities late on Aug. 17, mere hours before President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet for peace talks with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. In the Oval Office, Zelensky said Ukraine wants to end the war and welcomed Trump's signal of openness to trilateral negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. As president said, it's a good signal about trilateral," Zelensky told reporters. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has blocked or delayed military aid to Ukraine, maintained ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and echoed Kremlin narratives.</p>

However, Escobar said she remains concerned about conditions at the privately-run jail. “People detained there will almost certainly have their basic rights violated while caged in tents under the brutal West Texas sun, with extreme heat that puts their lives at risk,” said Savannah Kumar, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Texas. We will continue to monitor the operation of Fort Bliss so that this human and civil rights catastrophe is neither hidden from the public nor ignored by those in power.” Under President Joe Biden, immigrant children were detained at Fort Bliss in a shelter for unaccompanied minors run by Health and Human Services. Whistleblowers said the children were held in crowded tents filled with sand and dust, and supervised by people who did not speak Spanish, did not interact with them, and had no experience in childcare. The company's lackluster website states, “Site maintenance in progress.” El Paso County Commissioner Jackie Butler introduced a resolution opposing the facility, which passed unanimously. “The people of El Paso deserve transparency when a billion-dollar, taxpayer-funded facility is placed in their backyard,” Butler said. “We don't know who will staff this facility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nato's ever-cheerful secretary general, Mark Rutte, set the tone as he addressed Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the gathered European leaders. Much of what unfolded at the White House looked less like serious planning to end the conflict than a performance for an audience of one: persuading Trump that Russia was the obstacle to peace. The conversation in Washington soon moved to security guarantees. European leaders made clear they were prepared to go further than before in pledging protection for Ukraine – from article 5-style mutual defence commitments to talk of a British-backed “reassurance force” under a settlement. Putin insists Zelensky is not a legitimate leader and has said that any meeting with him would only take place to sign a final peace deal. “Most of their [European] optimistic statements aren't true beliefs, but meant to influence Trump. Europeans hype up expectations to create a reality in which Putin disappoints,” Janis Kluge, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, wrote on X. “Europeans (hopefully) know that Putin will never agree to Nato troops in Ukraine. They know that Putin doesn't want to meet Zelenskyy. But they pretend all that is a realistic possibility to make Putin look as bad as he really is, to undermine Putin's own narratives,” Kluge added. In remarks after his Alaska summit with Trump, the Russian president warned that Kyiv and European capitals should not “throw a wrench in the works” by pursuing back-room dealings that could derail the “agreements” he reached with Trump. Trump's team has presented Putin's core concession as agreeing to US and European security guarantees for Ukraine – though even that remains murky. Moscow is reported to have floated a different idea: that China, Russia's ally, act as one of the guarantors of Ukraine's security, reviving a proposal first tabled by Russian negotiators during talks in Turkey in spring 2022. For now, Europe's tactic seems to have paid off: Trump has temporarily refrained from attacking Zelenskyy or demanding that Ukraine hand over territory on the spot. “That way Moscow can deflect claims Putin won't meet Zelenskyy, while signalling that any talks depend on Kyiv's willingness to concede,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre. But Europe's far-reaching promises, designed in part to draw a reaction from Putin, may prove unrealistic once Ukraine needs clarity about what support it can truly expect. “Security guarantees come in lots of shapes and sizes. But let's be clear: there's not going to be a US or European commitment to go to war with Russia if it reinvades Ukraine,” said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at Rand, a nonprofit global policy thinktank. “This conversation is becoming divorced from reality,” Charap added.</p>

"The destruction of enemy ammunition directly helps our soldiers, who are bravely holding back Russian assaults," SBU said, adding that operations to "demilitarize" Russian depots would continue. Bilokurakyne lies about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory and remains under Russian occupation.

MOSCOW, August 19. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has dismissed as childish the European leaders' allegations that Russia launched an unprovoked attack on Ukraine.

"[There is] a clear understanding by both [US] President Donald] Trump and his team that this conflict has a reason. And that the talk that some presidents and prime ministers from Europe are indulging in about Russia attacking Ukraine without provocation is all childish. I can't find another word," Lavrov said in an interview with the Rossiya-24 TV channel.

"The main thing is that they continue to say this," Lavrov noted. "And they continue, as their meeting in Washington with President Trump, where Vladimir Zelensky was also summoned, to demand an immediate ceasefire. At least some of them, such as Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, continue to say that it is necessary to put pressure on Russia with sanctions. None of these gentlemen even mentioned the phrase 'human rights.'"</p>

"We do not reject any working formats - neither bilateral, nor trilateral, the president has repeatedly mentioned this," the top Russian diplomat said. He added that it is important that any format be used not for the sake of media hype but for gradual preparations for summits, step by step, beginning with the expert level. "We will always support such a serious approach," the Russian foreign minister noted. Lavrov also emphasized that any interaction involving top figures must be extremely thoroughly planned. US President Donald Trump held a meeting with Vladimir Zelensky and several European leaders on resolving the Ukraine conflict in the White House on August 18. The talks involved Finnish President Alexander Stubb, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. In addition, Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the meeting. According to the US leader, they discussed, among other things, the prospects for a meeting between Putin and Zelensky, followed by trilateral talks. Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov said that the leaders of Russia and the United States spoke in favor of continuing direct talks between Moscow and Kiev, including the possibility of elevating their level.</p>

By Monday they had brought in all the outdoor furniture and made sure their daughter and her boyfriend, who are the innkeepers, had generators, extra water and flashlights as they stayed behind to keep an eye on the property. Otherwise you wouldn't live at the beach,” said Andrzejewski, who will also remain on the island, at her home about a 15-minute drive away. Erin lashed part of the Caribbean with rain and wind Monday. Forecasters are confident it will curl north and away from the eastern U.S., but tropical storm and surge watches were issued for much of the Outer Banks. Hurricanes are growing more intense along Atlantic seaboard, study finds Officials at the Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, North Carolina, reported to the National Weather Service rescuing at least 60 swimmers from rip currents Monday. By Tuesday morning, Erin had lost some strength from previous days and dropped to a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 kilometres an hour, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It was about 1,070 km southwest of Bermuda and 1,150 km south-southeast of Cape Hatteras and was moving northwest at a slower 11 km/h. But Erin's tropical storm winds could be felt for 320 kilometres. On North Carolina's Outer Banks, coastal flooding was expected to begin Tuesday and continue through Thursday. A year ago, Hurricane Ernesto stayed hundreds of miles offshore yet still produced high surf and swells that caused coastal damage. This time there are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway. Hurricane Erin neared North Carolina's Outer Banks on Tuesday and threatened to whip up wild waves and tropical force winds. He's optimistic this storm won't be as destructive. I felt the same way about Dorian and we really got smacked,” he said. By then, waters could swell up to seven metres. “Surfers, swimmers and boaters must resist the temptation to go out. The waters will be very dangerous and lives will be placed at risk,” acting Minister of National Security Jache Adams said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. DAN WANG is a Research Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and the author of Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future. A decade ago, planners in Beijing unveiled Made in China 2025, an ambitious scheme to take leadership of the industries of the future. The plan identified ten sectors for investment, including energy, semiconductors, industrial automation, and high-tech materials. The government backed this vision with enormous financial support, spending one to two percent of GDP each year on direct and indirect subsidies, cheap credit, and tax breaks. It not only leads the world in electric vehicles and clean technology power generation; it is also dominant in drones, industrial automation, and other electronics products. Its lock on rare-earth magnets produced a quick trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. Chinese firms are on track to master the more sophisticated technological goods produced by the United States, Europe, and other parts of Asia. Lavish funding, they point out, has led to waste and corruption. It has created industries in which dozens of competitors manufacture similar products and struggle to make a profit. The resulting deflation makes companies wary of hiring new staff or raising wages, leading to lower consumer confidence and weaker growth. Beijing's industrial policy succeeded not simply because planners picked the right sectors and subsidized them. It created an innovation ecosystem centered on powerful electricity and digital networks, and it established a massive workforce with advanced manufacturing knowledge. This approach has enabled China to develop new technologies and scale them up faster than any other country. Its model is unlikely to be pushed off course by sluggish economic growth or U.S. sanctions. China's industrial and technological strength is now a permanent feature of the world economy. The United States should compete with China to keep its overall technological leadership and sustain the industries needed for broad-based prosperity and national security. But American policymakers must recognize that their current playbook—export controls, tariffs, and scattershot industrial policy—is ineffective. Simply trying to slow China down will not work. Washington must instead focus on building up its own systems of industrial strength by making patient, long-term investments not just in select, key industries but in energy, information, and transportation infrastructure. If it doesn't, the United States will face more deindustrialization and lose its technological leadership. The cars that have typically performed best are designed by celebrated German companies such as BMW, Porsche, and Mercedes, or by long-established manufacturers in Italy, Japan, and South Korea. It was set by Xiaomi, a Chinese company better known for its moderately priced smartphones and rice cookers. It produced its first car only a year before. Xiaomi's triumph on the racetrack was a symbol of China's surprisingly swift rise to clean energy dominance. It has a lock on the solar supply chain. The standard explanation for China's technological success is that the central government targeted various industries for support; provided hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, tax breaks, and low-interest loans to get these sectors going; and helped Chinese firms steal or copy technology from other states. China succeeded not only because it subsidized particular industries but also because it invested in the deep infrastructure—underlying physical systems and human expertise—that enables innovation and efficient production. But if China had stopped there, it would not have reached today's technological heights. In its infancy, the Internet was widely thought to corrode authoritarian regimes because it removed their monopoly on information and made it easier for ordinary people to organize across large distances. In 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared that controlling the Internet was like “trying to nail Jell-O to a wall.” But China's leadership concluded the opposite. They bet that high-quality data infrastructure would strengthen the government by enabling it to better monitor and manage public opinion, as well as track people's movements, while hugely benefiting the country's industrial sectors and creating a high-tech ecosystem. It built a domestic Internet that rapidly connected virtually the entire population while blocking what its people could see from abroad. Top platforms such as Byte-Dance, Alibaba, and Tencent became world-class innovators. The next key infrastructure system behind China's prowess is its electric grid. The country has invested heavily in ultrahigh voltage transmission lines, which can carry electricity efficiently over long distances, and in all types of battery storage. This abundant power supply has enabled the rapid growth of electricity-reliant transport systems, namely high-speed rail and electric vehicles. China has overcome the obstacles that long prevented electricity from becoming the world's main energy and supplanting the direct combustion of fossil fuels: that it was hard to move, hard to store, and ineffective at fueling transport. As a result, China is well on its way to becoming the world's first economy powered mainly by electricity. Electricity accounts for 21 percent of energy use in the world as a whole and 22 percent of energy use in the United States. China's electrification did not arise out of a master plan. Instead, it was the product of technocratic responses to discrete issues such as power shortages in industrial zones and the need to free up rail capacity for purposes other than moving coal. Now, however, rapid electrification serves a clear strategic purpose. It is a motor of industrial innovation—“powering the future,” as Damien Ma and Lizzi Lee put it in a July Foreign Affairs article. China's most subtle piece of deep infrastructure is its more than 70-million-person industrial workforce—the largest in the world. Thanks to the country's intense buildup of complex manufacturing supply chains, Chinese factory managers, engineers, and workers have decades of “process knowledge”—hands-on knowledge, gained from experience—about how to make things and how to make them better. This process knowledge enables iterative innovation, or constantly tweaking products so that they can be made more efficiently, at better quality, and with lower costs. It also enables scaling: Chinese factories can rally a large, experienced workforce behind making almost any new product. Finally, and most important, process knowledge allows China to create entire new industries. A factory worker in Shenzhen might assemble iPhones one year and Huawei Mate phones the next and then move on to build drones for DJI or electric vehicle batteries for CATL. Process knowledge in the Chinese workforce may be Beijing's greatest economic asset. Some analysts believe that China is the country that assembles most of the world's smartphones and other electronics because its workforce costs are low. In reality, the country remains the world's leader because its workforce has proved its worth in sophistication, scale, and speed. Analysts also miss the red-hot ambition of China's entrepreneurs. Xiaomi's legendary founder, Lei Jun, gambled on EVs in 2021, announcing that his company, then valued at $80 billion, would invest $10 billion in them and that it would be his “last major entrepreneurial project.” On the German racetrack, it paid off. Lei was able to plug into an electronics ecosystem, battery partners, and an experienced workforce to make high-speed EVs in just a few years' time. By conventional measures, it also had greater technological sophistication. Meanwhile, the American EV champion, Tesla, faces declining sales in all of its top markets, including China. But the country does face serious economic challenges, many of which arise at least in part from the very industrial policies that have led to its triumphs. China's technocrats have steered resources not just into high-productivity infrastructure but also into state-owned enterprises that contribute little to the country's vibrant tech ecosystem, rack up huge debts, and drag down the economy's efficiency. A prime example is China's semiconductor industry, which has received over $100 billion in direct state industrial policy support since 2014. Some of the projects funded by this money were outright frauds. Other projects were legitimate, but both businesspeople and government officials stole from them. More than a dozen senior chip industry figures have been jailed for corruption since 2022, including the head of Tsinghua Unigroup (which operates several important chipmakers) and the chief of China's national integrated circuit fund. Two sitting ministers of industry and information technology were fired for graft. Generous manufacturing spending helps promote the tech ecosystem, but it also enables less efficient firms to stay in business far longer than they would in a more market-driven economy. That lowers profits for everyone, as companies continually cut their prices to maintain market share. This, in turn, means that manufacturing companies cannot spend as much on research and development. In fact, they need to be cautious about hiring new staff or raising wages. The same is true for manufacturers of EVs, smartphones, and many other products, with too many companies making similar products at paper-thin margins. If China is too generous with tech and manufacturing businesses, then it is not generous enough with those providing services. Beijing chronically overregulates service sectors, cracking down on Internet companies that the government sees as engaging in monopolistic practices or threatening political or social instability. As a result, job growth in these sectors has been weak, which means job growth in China as a whole has greatly suffered. Even in this industry-centric country, services employ about 60 percent of the urban workforce and have accounted for all net job creation in the past decade. With jobs hard to come by, wages rising little or at all, and the price of houses—which are most Chinese people's main asset—falling, Chinese consumers have become reluctant to spend. Private businesses, seeing weak demand, have in turn become even more reluctant to hire or raise wages. China's current model, then, virtually guarantees slower economic growth. Thanks to the vicious circle Beijing has created, the economy now routinely struggles to reach its annual growth target of five percent and is constantly battling deflation. Meanwhile, because domestic demand is sluggish, more and more of the output of China's prodigiously productive manufacturing sector will need to be exported, leading to ever larger trade surpluses. China's trade surplus is already almost a trillion dollars, more than double the figure of just five years earlier. Slower growth means that the economy could become less dynamic, and tech firms could lose the ability or drive to keep innovating. Smaller and less efficient players will exit the market. As for protectionism, most countries will find that there are simply no cost-effective alternatives to the products China exports. There are also ways to evade tariff barriers, such as by shipping goods through third countries or by setting up assembly plants in other states (as the Chinese car manufacturer BYD is doing in Brazil and Hungary). Chinese officials, for their part, seem to believe that the costs of lower growth, deflation, and irritated trade partners are worth paying. The message was clear: Beijing's main goal is not fast growth but self-sufficiency and technological progress. Washington has not stood idly by as China's tech and manufacturing sectors progress. U.S. officials realized that China was highly dependent on Western technology inputs, such as leading-edge semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. They thus gambled that a full blockade of these technologies would severely slow China's technological engine. This was a bipartisan proposition: when U.S. President Joe Biden came into office, in 2021, he maintained his predecessor's restrictions. And yet the success of these controls has been mixed at best. In 2018, two big Chinese tech companies, ZTE and Fujian Jinhua, nearly collapsed after being cut off from American technology. But more capable businesses, aided by Washington lawyers and lobbyists, have been able to bounce back. Huawei was clearly battered after the Commerce Department sanctioned it in 2019. But by 2025, the firm announced that its previous year's revenues had recovered to 2019 levels. It is still recognizably the same company, one that excels at making 5G equipment and handsets. Other companies have done an even better job of weathering U.S. restrictions. SMIC, one of China's most important chip foundries, has doubled its revenues since it was sanctioned in 2020. It still lags far behind the industry-leading TSMC in profitability, but it has made certain technological breakthroughs, learning to produce seven-nanometer chips—a technological breakthrough that was considered unlikely after its sanctions. Similarly, restrictions on AI technology did little to prevent the rise of DeepSeek, which has produced an AI reasoning model matched by only a few other firms, all in Silicon Valley. Chinese AI firms may not have access to the same leading-edge chips that American ones do, but they do have plentiful access to excellent talent, mature chips, as well as pools of data. They also have a near-unlimited supply of cheap electricity—something their U.S. competitors lack. As a result, according to global technical benchmarks, Chinese large language models are, at most, six months behind American leaders, a gap that is steadily shrinking. Some American officials realize that the United States cannot win just by attacking China's industries. The Biden administration's economic planners, for instance, created an industrial policy designed to help the United States advance its own strategic sectors. The United States has not built up enough deep infrastructure of its own. But this “Internet for All” plan had not connected anyone before he left office. There is still no national network of EV charging stations, even though Congress earmarked billions to create one. And Washington has failed to dismantle the bureaucratic and regulatory barriers to building electric transmission systems, which make it hard for energy companies to take advantage of the tax credits the Inflation Reduction Act created for solar and wind projects. Trump's July budget reconciliation bill phases out his predecessor's solar and wind subsidies for most projects that haven't begun by the end of 2026. Manufacturers depend on imports for many of their inputs, and they have proved reluctant to make big investment decisions based on Trump's wavering pronouncements. In fact, the country shed over 10,000 manufacturing jobs between April and July alone, just after Trump announced his plan to impose high tariffs on virtually every country. Trump, of course, is hardly unique in his failure to deliver. American politicians love to celebrate whenever a new mine or semiconductor facility opens. But the U.S. industrial sector continues to shrink amid product delays, layoffs, and falling production quality. Real manufacturing output, which had risen steadily until the 2008 financial crisis, plunged then and has never recovered. Despite an influx of cash, almost every class of U.S. naval ship under construction is behind schedule, some by as much as three years. Producers of artillery shells are only slowly ramping up manufacturing, even though Washington has depleted its stockpiles to help Ukraine. And U.S. efforts to wean its military off Chinese rare-earth minerals have faltered. The United States does retain its advantage over China in several critical areas: software, biotech, and AI, as well as in its university-driven innovation ecosystem. Since returning to office, Trump has set about defunding scientific research and depriving the country of skilled labor. Meanwhile, Trump's hostility toward immigrants has driven researchers who would come to the United States to look for positions at companies and universities elsewhere. But competing effectively against China requires more than just removing self-imposed restraints. Washington's failings extend across administrations for a reason: American officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, have not taken China's competence seriously. “China doesn't innovate—it steals,” wrote Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton on social media in April, epitomizing how Americans trivialize Chinese accomplishments. Too many U.S. leaders continue to believe that a more exquisite export control regime will halt China's technological momentum. They need to realize that no matter how hard the United States squeezes, it will not break China's industrial and technological system. What Washington should do is strengthen its own capacity. Washington should not try to replicate Beijing's massive and often wasteful investments in all systems. But it should do better than Biden's ad-hoc, sector-by-sector approach. And it must abandon Trump's strategy of hoping that the tariff cudgel will force a reshoring of industry, and his focus on old heavy industries such as steel. Instead, policymakers must start to think in ecosystem terms, as China has. Large-scale infrastructure projects can stimulate demand for different technologies and create the process knowledge needed to build them, which are crucial first steps in rebuilding the manufacturing base. A top priority should be building a bigger and better electricity system that makes use of nuclear power, natural gas, and renewable energy sources. To maximize its use of renewables, the United States should invest in building more battery storage and high-voltage transmission lines. Because it is a rich country with high wages and labor and environmental standards, it will never be able to compete with China or India in terms of availability of low-cost labor, and it should not try. Yet so is permitting reform that eliminates the excessive regulatory costs of new construction, ample government funding for basic research and development, and liberal immigration policies that enable companies to source the best talent from anywhere in the world. Much of that knowledge now exists abroad, and the United States must be willing to import it. Above all, Washington should not underestimate what it is up against. Beijing has made achieving technological supremacy a top political priority. China's model has worked because its policymakers have gotten a lot of things right and have given Chinese entrepreneurs the conditions for success. The country may have problems, but it will continue to be effective. If the United States is to compete effectively, its policymakers must spend less time worrying about how to weaken their rival and more time figuring out how to make their country the best and most vigorous version of itself.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. HENRY FARRELL is Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute Professor of International Affairs at Johns Hopkins University. ABRAHAM NEWMAN is John Powers Chair in International Business Diplomacy at the School of Foreign Service and a Professor in the Department of Government at Georgetown University. When Washington announced a “framework deal” with China in June, it marked a silent shifting of gears in the global political economy. This new era will be shaped by weapons of economic and technological coercion—sanctions, supply chain attacks, and export measures—that repurpose the many points of control in the infrastructure that underpins the interdependent global economy. For over two decades, the United States has unilaterally weaponized these chokepoints in finance, information flows, and technology for strategic advantage. But market exchange has become hopelessly entangled with national security, and the United States must now defend its interests in a world in which other powers can leverage chokepoints of their own. That is why the Trump administration had to make a deal with China. Administration officials now acknowledge that they made concessions on semiconductor export controls in return for China's easing restrictions on rare-earth minerals that were crippling the United States' auto industry. U.S. companies that provide chip design software, such as Synopsys and Cadence, can once again sell their technology in China. And the U.S. firm Nvidia can again sell H20 chips for training artificial intelligence to Chinese customers. The administration had come to realize “that our industrial capability is deeply dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China, who can hold it over our head,” shifting the “nature of geopolitics,” in “one of the great challenges of the new century.” Although Rubio emphasized self-reliance as a solution, the administration's rush to make a deal demonstrates the limits of going it alone. The United States is ratcheting back its own threats to persuade adversaries not to cripple vital parts of the U.S. economy. Other powers, too, are struggling to figure out how to advance their interests in a world in which economic power and national security are merging, and economic and technological integration have turned from a promise to a threat. Washington had to remake its national security state after other countries developed the atomic bomb; in a similar way, it will have to rebuild its economic security state for a world in which adversaries and allies can also weaponize interdependence. In short, economic weapons are proliferating just as nuclear weapons did, creating new dilemmas for the United States and other powers. China has adapted to this new world with remarkable speed; other powers, such as European countries, have struggled. Now, the Trump administration seems to be actively undermining those sources of strength. As China rapidly adapts to the new realities of weaponized interdependence, it is building its own alternative “stack” of mutually reinforcing high-tech industries centered on the energy economy. Europe is floundering at the moment, but over time, it may also create its own alternative suite of technologies. The United States, uniquely, is flinging its institutional and technological advantages away. After the Cold War ended, businesses built an interdependent global economy on top of U.S.-centered infrastructure. Global financial systems also combined thanks to dollar clearing, in which businesses directly or indirectly use U.S. dollars for international deals; correspondent banks that implement such transactions; and the SWIFT financial messaging network. U.S.-centered semiconductor manufacturing was spun out into a myriad of specialized processes across Europe and Asia, but key intellectual property, such as semiconductor software design, remained in the hands of a few U.S. companies. Each of these systems could be understood as its own “stack,” interconnected complexes of related technologies and services that came to reinforce one another, so that, for example, buying into the open Internet increasingly meant buying into U.S. platforms and e-commerce systems, too. At a time when geopolitics seemed the stuff of antiquated Cold War thrillers, few worried about becoming dependent on economic infrastructure provided by other countries. Over two decades of cumulative experimentation, U.S. authorities expanded their ambitions and reach. The United States graduated from exploiting financial chokepoints against terrorists to deploying sanctions to target banks and, in time, to cutting entire countries, such as Iran, out of the global financial system. The Internet was transformed into a global surveillance apparatus, allowing the United States to demand that platforms and search companies, which were regulated by U.S. authorities, hand over crucial strategic information on their worldwide users. European governments found themselves largely unable to protect their own companies against U.S. power. By that point, many of the most important economic networks underpinning globalization—communications, finance, production—had become so highly centralized that a small number of key firms and economic actors effectively controlled them. Governments that could assert authority over these firms, most notably the U.S. government, could tap them for information about their adversaries or exclude rivals from access to these vital points in the global economy. Over two decades, the United States had built institutions to assert and direct this authority in response to a series of particular crises. Our primary purpose, however, was to expose the ugly underbelly of such weaponization. Instead, it was riddled with hierarchy, power relations, and strategic vulnerabilities. Smaller powers might seek to use less accountable or transparent channels of exchange, effectively building dark spaces into the global economy. As others weaponized interdependence, the connecting fabric of the global economy would be rewoven according to a new logic, creating a world based more on offense and defense than on common commercial interest. U.S. President Joe Biden also used weaponization as an everyday tool of statecraft. One former official complained of a “relentless, never-ending, you-must-sanction-everybody-and-their-sister . Policy experts warned that technology restrictions encouraged China to escape the grasp of the United States and develop its own ecosystem of advanced technologies. If this worked, it would ensure a long-term American advantage in AI. Although the Trump administration abandoned this grand technocratic master plan, it certainly has not abandoned the goal of U.S. dominance and control of chokepoints. Instead, they are building the economic and institutional means to resist. The weapons of interdependence have been proliferating for several years and are now being deployed to counter U.S. power. As China and the European Union began to understand their risks, they, too, tried to shore up their own vulnerabilities and perhaps take advantage of the vulnerabilities of others. By contrast, Europe's internal institutional weaknesses force it to vacillate, putting it in a dangerous position vis-à-vis the United States and China. Previously, Beijing had viewed technological independence as an important long-term goal. After Snowden, it saw dependence on U.S. technology as an urgent short-term threat. As our work with the political scientists Yeling Tan and Mark Dallas has shown, articles in Chinese state media began to trumpet the crucial role of “information security” and “data sovereignty” to China's national security. The real wake-up call came when the first Trump administration threatened to cut off ZTE, a major Chinese telecommunications company, from access to U.S. technology and then weaponized export controls against Huawei, which the administration had come to see as an urgent threat to U.S. tech dominance and national security. These fears translated into policy actions as the Chinese Communist Party developed a “whole-of-nation system” to secure China's technological independence, calling for “breakthroughs in major ‘chokepoint' technologies and products.” China also began to think about how it could better exploit its advantages in rare-earth mining and processing, where it had gained a stranglehold as U.S. and other companies fell out of the market. China's power in this sector comes not from a simple monopoly over the minerals, which the country doesn't fully possess, but from its domination of the economic and technological ecosystem necessary to extract and process them. Notably, these critical minerals are used for a variety of high-tech industrial purposes, including producing the specialized magnets that are crucial to cars, planes, and other sophisticated technologies. This was followed in 2024 by new regulations restricting the export of dual-use items. In short order, China built a bureaucratic apparatus to turn chokepoints into practical leverage. China also realized that in a world of weaponized interdependence, power comes not from possessing substitutable commodities but from controlling the technological stack. China did not use its new export control system simply to retaliate against Trump but to squeeze Europe and discourage it from siding with the United States. China's long-term problem is that its state is too powerful and too willing to intervene in the domestic economy for purely political purposes, hampering investment and potentially strangling innovation. Still, in the short term, it has built the critical capacity to reimpose controls as it deems necessary to resist further U.S. demands. That is unlikely to happen in the short to medium term, unless the nascent “EuroStack” project, which aims to secure Europe from foreign interference by building an independent information technology base, really takes off. Even though Europe woke up to the danger of weaponized interdependence during the first Trump administration, it quickly fell back asleep. In fairness, the EU's weaknesses also reflect its unique circumstances: it depends on an outside military patron. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has heightened Europe's short-term dependence on the United States, even as European countries struggle to bolster their defensive capacities. The Biden administration put a friendly gloss on economic coercion, coordinating with European governments such as the Netherlands to limit exports of ASML's machinery to China. When China imposed a series of export restrictions on Lithuania to punish it for its political support of Taiwan in 2021, German companies pressed the Lithuanian government to de-escalate. At the same time, measures to increase economic security are repeatedly watered down by EU member states or qualified by trade missions to Beijing, which are full of senior officials eager to make deals. Most profoundly, Europe finds it nearly impossible to act coherently on economic security because its countries jealously retain individual control over national security, whereas the EU as a whole manages trade and key aspects of market regulation. There are many highly competent officials scattered throughout the European Commission's trade directorate and the national capitals of member states but few ways for them to coordinate on large-scale actions combining economic instruments with national security objectives. Although European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned of “the risk of weaponization of interdependencies,” and her commission has prepared a genuinely sophisticated strategy for European economic security, it doesn't have the bureaucratic tools to deliver results. One immediate test is whether Europe will use its purported big bazooka, the “anti-coercion instrument,” or let it rust into obsolescence. The instrument was conceived as a response to the threat of Trump's first administration and hastily retrofitted to provide a means of pushing back against China. From the beginning, however, European officials made it clear that they hoped they would never have to actually use the anti-coercion instrument, believing that its mere existence would be a sufficient deterrent. That has turned out to be a grave misjudgment. The anti-coercion instrument is encumbered with legalistic safeguards intended to ensure that the European Commission will not deploy it without sufficient approval from EU member states. Those safeguards make other powers such as China and the United States doubt that it will ever be used against them. Its lengthy deployment process will give them the opportunity they need to disarm any enforcement action, using threats and promises to mobilize internal opposition against it. As with earlier European efforts to block sanctions, China and the United States can usually bet on the EACO principle that “Europe Always Chickens Out” in geoeconomic confrontations. Europe lacks the information, institutional clout, and internal agreement to do much else. In contrast, European officials talk incessantly about their doomsday device, but Europe's adversaries feel sure that it will never be deployed; that certainty encourages them to coerce European companies and countries at their leisure. Europe is hampered by structural weaknesses, but the United States' difficulties largely result from its own choices. This is in part an unintended consequence of domestic politics. The second Trump administration imposed a hiring freeze across the federal government, hitting many institutions including the Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which oversees OFAC, and leaving key positions unfilled and departments understaffed. Initial budget proposals anticipate an overall reduction in funding for the office, even as the number of sanctions-related programs has continued to rise. Although U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has expressed support for his department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which is chiefly responsible for export controls, the agency lost over a dozen employees as part of the government's sweeping force reductions. Other countries had no equivalent to OFAC's maps of global finance or the detailed understanding of semiconductor supply chains developed by key officials on Biden's National Security Council. Such institutional decay is the inevitable consequence of Trumpism. In Trump's eyes, all institutional restraints on his power are illegitimate. This has led to a large overhaul of the apparatus that has served to direct economic security decisions over the last decades. As the journalist Nahal Toosi has documented in Politico, the National Security Council, which is supposed to coordinate security policy across the federal government and agencies, has cut its staff by more than half. The State Department has been decimated by job cuts, while the traditional interagency process through which policy gets made and communicated has virtually disappeared, leaving officials in the dark over what is expected of them and allowing adventurous officials to fill the vacuum with their own uncoordinated initiatives. Instead, policy is centered on Trump himself and whoever has last talked to him in the uncontrolled cavalcade of visitors streaming through the Oval Office. As personalism replaces bureaucratic decision-making, short-term profit trumps long-term national interest. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently warned that “the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony.” U.S. federal courts, which have long been exceedingly deferential to the executive when it comes to national security issues, may be having second thoughts. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade issued a striking decision, holding that the United States had overstepped its authority when it invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act—the legal bedrock for much of U.S. coercive power—to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Notably, the trade case resulted from a complaint filed by conservative and libertarian lawyers. Across core sectors—finance, technology, and energy—the administration is making the United States less central than it used to be. And the bipartisan American love affair with stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency, is pushing China and Europe to accelerate their efforts to develop alternative payment systems. Most recently, the spending bill that Trump and his congressional allies pushed through earlier this summer effectively cedes control of next-generation energy technology to China by doubling down on the carbon economy. Even as Washington works to counteract Chinese influence over critical minerals, it is eliminating measures aimed at minimizing U.S. dependence on Chinese supply chains in the crucial areas of renewable energy and battery development and radically defunding its investment in science. One might have expected that the United States would respond to the age of weaponized interdependence as it responded to the earlier era of nuclear proliferation: by recalibrating its long-term strategy, building the institutional capabilities necessary to make good policy, and strengthening its global position. This does not just affect Washington's ability to coerce others; it also undermines the attractiveness of key U.S. economic platforms. When used wisely, weaponization advanced slowly and within boundaries that others could tolerate. Now, however, the United States is spiraling into a rapid and uncontrollable drawdown of its assets, pursuing short-term goals at the expense of long-term objectives. It is increasingly using its tools in a haphazard way that invites miscalculations and unanticipated consequences. And it is doing so in a world in which other countries are not only developing their own capacities to punish the United States but also building technological stacks that may be more appealing to the world than the United States'. If China leaps ahead on energy technology, as seems likely, other countries are going to be pulled into its orbit. Dark warnings from the United States about the risks of dependence on China will ring hollow to countries that are all too aware of how willing the United States is to weaponize interdependence for its own selfish purposes. In the first decades of the nuclear age, American policymakers faced enormous uncertainty about how to achieve stability and peace. The current U.S. administration recognizes that the United States is not only able to exploit others' economic vulnerabilities but also deeply vulnerable itself. The main problem is that as national security and economic policy merge, governments have to deal with excruciatingly complex phenomena that are not under their control: global supply chains, international financial flows, and emerging technological systems. Nuclear doctrines focused on predicting a single adversary's responses; today, when geopolitics is shaped in large part by weaponized interdependence, governments must navigate a terrain with many more players, figuring out how to redirect private-sector supply chains in directions that do not hurt themselves while anticipating the responses of a multitude of governmental and nongovernmental actors. Successful strategy in an age of weaponized interdependence requires building up these very institutions to make them more flexible and more capable of developing the deep expertise that is needed to understand an enormously complex world in which Washington's adversaries now hold many of the cards. Washington has focused more on thinking about how best to use these weapons than on when they ought not be used. Other countries have been willing to rely on U.S. technological and financial infrastructure despite the risks because they perceived the United States as a government whose self-interest was constrained, at least to some extent, by the rule of law and a willingness to consider the interests of its allies. That calculus has shifted, likely irreversibly, as the second Trump administration has made it clear that it views the countries that the United States has historically been closest to less as allies than as vassal states. Without clear and enforceable limits on U.S. coercion, the most dominant U.S.-based multinational firms, such as Google and J. P. Morgan, will find themselves trapped in the no man's land of a new war zone, taking incoming fire from all sides. There is “a growing acceptance of fragmentation” in the global economy, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has warned, and “maybe even more troubling—I think there's a growing sense that ours may not be the best fragment to be associated with.” It enjoyed the advantages of an international economy based on multilateral institutions and a technological regime built around its self-image as a liberal power, even while acting in unilateral and sometimes illiberal ways to secure its interests as it saw fit. Just a year ago, some American intellectuals and policymakers hoped that this system could survive into the indefinite future, so that unilateral U.S. coercive strength and liberal values would continue to go hand in hand. The United States is faced with a choice: a world in which aggressive American coercion and U.S. hegemonic decline reinforce each other or one in which Washington realigns itself with other liberal-minded countries by forswearing the abuse of its unilateral powers. Such assumptions now seem outdated, as other countries gain these weapons, too. As during the nuclear era, the United States needs to turn away from unilateralism, toward détente and arms control, and, perhaps in the very long term, toward rebuilding an interdependent global economy on more robust foundations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The false positivity of the Trump-Europe talks ignores that Nato security guarantees for Ukraine are worthless when Russia is your enemy Let's be clear, there is no “guarantee” from Russian dictator Vladimir Putin that will ensure he does not invade Ukraine again. Ukrainian officials well remember in 1994 former Russian leader Boris Yeltsin pledging that Russia would respect Ukraine's national boundaries in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear arsenal. Since then, Ukraine has been invaded by Russian forces twice, in 2014 and in 2022, while it was subject to Russian political warfare from 2005 to 2013, corrupting the country's business, political and security elites. Already, Russia is trying to throw a spanner into the progress that was made at Monday's talks in the White House. Russia's Foreign Ministry said that it would reject “any scenarios” involving Nato troops in Ukraine, threatening, in a now predictable way, “uncontrolled escalation” with “unpredictable consequences”. So much for Western boots on the ground – even if the Americans are involved, as Trump suggested would be possible yesterday. The Foreign Ministry also seemed determined to drive a wedge between the US and UK, claiming that Britain was undermining talks. The level of mind games and psychological warfare emanating from Moscow has been extraordinary. It's generally known as reflexive control, a theory of psychological manipulation whereby your target does your bidding while all the while believing himself to be in control of his actions. The Russians clearly believe that it has an effect. Having hooked Trump on the idea of a deal, the Kremlin is now trying to dictate terms, and will steadily try to unpick Western red lines to isolate Ukraine from its allies and the US from Europe. That process started at the Alaska summit, when Putin ran circles around Donald Trump. It's apt that George Orwell's Animal Farm, that cautionary allegorical novel about the corruption of power and truth in Soviet Russia, was published 80 years ago this week. It's clear what Putin wants; more strategically valuable Ukrainian land and with it at least three cities that it would take years for Russian troops to conquer, if at all, and which could be used as a potentially strategic springboard should there be another round of the war. If Ukraine accepts, millions would have to be evacuated. They will not want to live under Russian brutal occupation, with its lawless brutality and rapacious secret police. Should any peace deal hold, Russia would undoubtedly do what it is now trying to do in Georgia and Moldova, using Kremlin-friendly oligarchs and leaders to undermine the independence of those states and bring them gradually into Moscow's orbit. While we don't see political, economic and information conflict as a form of war, Russian military doctrine does. It is easy to be brave with someone else's life. It will take years to rebuild the mental and physical damage of this war. But despite the bonhomie and faux positivity at the White House, it remains difficult to see a road to lasting peace. Any final deal, Trump has said, will rest with talks between Putin and Zelensky, which he now says he is going to arrange. Putin has thus far only shown himself willing to accept a deal that leaves Ukraine vulnerable to Russia's predatory gaze and its murderous army. On their behalf, Zelensky now faces a dilemma that may save his nation – or condemn it to future destruction.</p>
