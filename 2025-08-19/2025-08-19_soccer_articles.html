                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LOUGHBOROUGH, England (Aug. 19, 2025) – The U.S. Women's Cerebral Palsy (CP) National Team utilized goals from seven different players, including a second-half hat trick from Joey Martin and braces from Kaia Spencer, Jesslyn Kuhnel and Echo Yale, to earn a 12-1 win against Nepal in the team's opening match of the 2025 IFCPF Intercontinental Cup at Loughborough University. Spencer tallied a first-half brace just four minutes in, sandwiched around captain Cassidy Leake's second minute goal. Echo Yale earned their debut by starting the match between the sticks, while Janie Richardson collected her first cap when she replaced Kuhnel just before halftime. That lone strike was the interval between another onslaught of U.S. goals, as Richardson tallied on her U.S. debut to make it 7-1 in the 38th minute. Yale followed suit with her first goal in a U.S. shirt three minutes later. Second half substitute Martin scored her first off a feed from Richardson in the 44th, before setting up Yale for their second in the 47th minute. Now with a 10W-2L-2D all-time record, the CP WNT is back in action Wednesday when it faces Denmark. Kick off from Loughborough, England is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast live via the IFCPF YouTube channel. Match: United States Women's CP National Team vs. Nepal</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOUSTON — We are less than a year away now from the 2026 FIFA World Cup coming to Houston, which means hundreds of thousands of fans pouring into the city. The Texas Department of Transportation is turning up the pressure on one of its projects to beautify a major Houston freeway. TxDOT is sprucing up the gateways into downtown starting along I-69 near Hazard Street. “We're going to paint the walls a light tan with some accent colors, and then we'll also fill in the gaps with new vines where we're missing them so they can all grow up over time,” said TxDOT landscape architect Ethan Beeson. It's part of a project that began more than 25 years ago when Houstonians asked for more green space along freeways. And with the World Cup coming, TxDOT says now is the time to bring that vision back to life. We spent a lot of time over the years trying to make the freeways look as good as they can.” As a matter of fact, it's already started. The vines, however, will take years to fully grow back, but officials say the wait will be worth it. TxDOT hopes to keep these improvements in place well beyond the World Cup for Houstonians and visitors alike to enjoy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fort Lauderdale is moving funds previously considered for the FIFA World Cup to its homelessness budget instead. It comes just weeks after a Miami-Dade commissioner asked for a halt to $46 million in county funds for the World Cup, on the back of major cuts to county services and staffing in the proposed budget for next year. READ MORE: Miami-Dade mayor was at World Cup party that broke up after Border agent arrived: ‘Troubling' “Personally, I don't see any gain from it when nothing's happening in Fort Lauderdale. Nothing's happening in Chase Stadium of consequence,” Trantalis said at a June 17 workshop meeting. The only time teams will be playing in Broward County during the tournament, Trantalis said, will be for practice at Chase Stadium. The stadium, which hosts Inter Miami's games, is not large enough to accommodate World Cup matches and fans. Instead of World Cup events, the funding will be spent on one-time purchases, “including vehicles and equipment that will support City personnel in engaging directly with homeless individuals,” said Ashley Doussard, a spokesperson for Fort Lauderdale. The FIFA host committee has struggled to solicit public funds for World Cup programs in Broward County. At a Tourism Development Council (TDC) meeting in May, the committee requested $2.5 million from Broward County for “fan festival” watch events, advertising inclusion and exclusive events, according to its request. Currently, no money has been allocated from Broward County for the FIFA World Cup, she said — not even the quarter of a million dollars from Visit Lauderdale.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Things may not be going according to plan for Wrexham on the pitch at the start of the season, however, there is some exciting news off it. Wrexham fans were disappointed with Danny Ward for his performance during the 3-2 defeat to West Brom with many fans calling for Arthur Okonkwo to be reinstated as the number one goalkeeper. Phil Parkinson thought his side were ‘too soft' in their defending for the three goals and has demanded change ahead of their crucial next fixture at home to Sheffield Wednesday. However, the Red Dragons are continuing to build their profile off the pitch and owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are considering a move to bring the club into the spotlight of a FIFA competition. READ MORE: Wrexham's Conor Coady shares what he told Ryan Reynolds after meeting him for the first time “What Ryan and Rob are doing is amazing. “The city and the club have a chance to bring a World Cup to north Wales. What a legacy for Ryan and Rob to leave Wrexham.” The Racecourse Ground is no stranger to international football and in fact new signings Nathan Broadhead and Kieffer Moore both scored for Wales at the stadium. Wrexham need to be in line with FIFA guidelines on the stadium before they can host any international tournament, something that Michael Williamson is determined to make happen.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea took to the pitch for their opening Premier League match with a noticeable change to their kit that differed from what was seen during their pre-season tour. The gold FIFA Club World Cup champion badge has been repositioned on the chest. During pre-season matches, the gold CWC badge was positioned centrally, sitting directly between the Nike Swoosh and the Chelsea club crest. Many feel the higher position looks awkward or unbalanced. This discussion is often linked to the general dissatisfaction with the current circular CWC badge compared to the more traditional, and fan-favorite, shield-shaped version used in previous years, which many believe was better designed and easier to integrate into a kit's layout. Following their win in the historic first Club World Cup with the new format, Chelsea will have the badge on their kit for the next three seasons.
