                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shooting begins later this month with two actors from the filmmaker's 'Rebel Moon' movies. Starting later this month, Snyder will begin filming The Last Photograph, a drama that he originated and has been developing since the mid-2000s. Stuart Martin and Fra Free, both of whom appeared in Snyder's Rebel Moon movies, will star in the feature, an indie whose budget will be significantly lower than many of the epics Snyder has captained before. Also producing will be Gianni Nunnari and his Hollywood Gang Productions company. Executive producers include the Spanish company Mediaset España, through its film production arm Telecinco Cinema, as well as William Doyle and Columbia's Jaguar Bite, which is run by  Juan Pablo Solano and Simon Beltran. True North serves as the production service company in Iceland. Photograph is qualifying for Colombia's CINA incentive (Audiovisual Investment Certificate), which is a tax discount equivalent to 35 percent of the expenditure on audiovisual services in the country. Snyder also has his composers lined up as well: Hans Zimmer, Steven Doar and Omer Benyamin. Their journey into the unknown takes them further and further away from civilization, bringing into question everything they believe, while slowly eroding the distinction between real and surreal.” The project has gone under some changes during its 20 years or so in development. For one, the setting used to be Afghanistan and centered on a war correspondent being the lone survivor of an attack on a group of Americans. In the early 2010s, Christian Bale and Sean Penn were attached to star, before Snyder took a detour into his DC movies. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Zack Snyder's long-awaited passion project, The Last Photograph, is ready for its closeup. The Rebel Moon director has set the drama as his next film and cast Stuart Martin and Fra Fee to star. The film begins production this month and will shoot through November in Iceland, Colombia and Los Angeles .Snyder will direct the film from a screenplay by Kurt Johnstad, with Snyder having a story-by credit. Zack Snyder, Deborah Snyder and Wesley Coller will produce through Stone Quarry and continue their creative partnership with Gianni Nunnari who is producing through Hollywood Gang Productions along with co-producer Alisha Stickney. Executive producers include Mediaset España, through its film production arm Telecinco Cinema, William Doyle and Jaguar Bite. True North serves as the production service company in Iceland, while Jaguar Bite, run by Juan Pablo Solano and Simon Beltran, serves as the Colombian production service company. Hans Zimmer, Steven Doar and Omer Benyamin are handling the score. “The idea of taking camera in hand and simply making a movie in an intimate way is very appealing to me,” said Snyder. “The Last Photograph is a meditation of life and death, embodying some of the trials that I have experienced in my own life and the exploration of those ideas through image making.” The story follows an ex-DEA operative who must return to the mountains of South America in an effort to find his missing niece and nephew, following the brutal murders of their diplomat parents. Their journey into the unknown takes them farther and farther away from civilization, bringing into question everything they believe, while slowly eroding the distinction between real and surreal. Snyder has long wanted to make The Last Photograph, but his busy schedule directing big-budget tentpoles has always led to having table the film. Recently, he not only saw a window to fit the film in before focusing on another large production and also had the actors he wanted to star in it after the three had a strong bond working on Rebel Moon together. He is repped by CAA and Sloane Offer Weber & Dern. Martin's star has been on the rise for some time with not only key roles in Snyder's two Rebel Moon pics but the Snyder-produced heist thriller Army of Thieves. He is repped by UTA, Independent Talent Group, Untitled Entertainment and Sloane Offer Weber Dern. He is repped by Paradigm Talent Agency, 42, Untitled Entertainment and Goodman Genow Schenkman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this week's Legal Beat newsletter, Diddy wins another lawsuit, Young Thug takes his property back, federal regulators sue bot scalpers and much more. THE BIG STORY: Six weeks after Sean “Diddy” Combs was largely acquitted on federal criminal charges, he won another court victory dismissing most of a $60 million civil sexual assault lawsuit filed by “Making the Band 2” contestant Sara Rivers. Digital Marketing Agency That Reps Ken Jeong Launches Two Platforms to Make Comedians Social Media Superstars Even after his recent courtroom wins, Diddy is hardly out of the woods. And he's still going to be sentenced in October on the lesser criminal charges on which he was convicted – counts that could still send him to prison for years. You're reading The Legal Beat, a weekly newsletter about music law from Billboard Pro, offering you a one-stop cheat sheet of big new cases, important rulings and all the fun stuff in between. To get the newsletter in your inbox every Tuesday, go subscribe here. BOT CRACKDOWN – The Federal Trade Commission launched a crackdown on alleged scalpers, filing a lawsuit accusing ticket broker Key Investment Group of using “illegal means” to purchase more than 379,000 event tickets on Ticketmaster and then re-selling them at massively-inflated prices. More than 2,000 of those tickets were allegedly for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour – the poster child for the problem of bot-scalpers and eye-watering secondary prices. FORFEITURE FIGHT – Young Thug won a court ruling ordering the return of property seized by law enforcement during his Atlanta gang trial, including nearly $150,000 in cash, several cars and numerous pieces of jewelry. CARTEL SENTENCING – Music executive Ángel Del Villar was sentenced to 48 months (4 years) in prison following his conviction on felony charges of doing business with a concert promoter linked to Mexican drug cartels. Prosecutors alleged that Del Villar repeatedly arranged concerts with Jesus Pérez Alvear, a promoter with ties to Mexican cartels – even though he knew he had been sanctioned by federal authorities. They told the panel that Lanez's trial was “riddled with errors,” including misleading statements about DNA evidence and a key witness they were not allowed to properly cross examine. UNSURPRISING DIVORCE – Kate Bowman, the wife of founding Maroon 5 bassist Mickey Madden, filed for divorce, just two weeks after she sought a restraining order in which she accused the musician of beating her during a confrontation about disturbing and sexual texts he'd sent to teenage girls. seeking the sanctions against the duo (Daniel W. Isaacs and Peter J. Gleason), Dylan's lawyers said they made “heinous and false allegations” without sufficient vetting and then repeatedly violated a court order by failing to get their client to turn over key evidence. UGLY ACCUSATIONS – Priscilla Presley's former business partners (Brigitte Kruse and Kevin Fialko) fired back at her recent allegations of elder abuse against them, filing a countersuit that included the shocking accusation that Elvis Presley's widow “pulled the plug” on Lisa Marie Presley against her late daughter's wishes. Priscilla's attorney — veteran entertainment lawyer Martin Singer — quickly called the case a “disgusting publicity stunt” and “one of the most shameful, ridiculous, salacious, and meritless lawsuits I have seen in my practice.” Allen has denied those accusations, but a judge ruled that he had forfeited his right to defend himself by flouting multiple court-imposed deadlines and orders in the lawsuit. GEFFEN RESPONDS – Music and film mogul David Geffen filed his first response to a bombshell abuse lawsuit from his estranged husband Donovan Michaels, calling them “a ludicrous and contrived attempt to humiliate Geffen in the court of public opinion and extract an out-of-court settlement.” The case from Michaels, a former exotic dancer 50 years Geffen's junior, claimed that the Hollywood powerhouse treated him as a “sexual commodity” for years. KINGSTON SENTENCING – Sean Kingston was sentenced to 42 months (3.5 years) in prison and three years probation after being convicted of federal wire fraud over a scheme involving over $1 million in high-end cars, jewelry and other luxury goods. Kingston, who topped the charts with his 2007 “Beautiful Girls,” was convicted in March alongside his mother for essentially conning vendors into giving him merch – including a Cadillac Escalade and a massive LED television — by falsely promising payment. The suit claims that Young “never spoke to anyone” about Doechii and had only “preliminary conversations” about locking down SiR for the festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His recent orders have focused on ramping up his efforts to embolden law enforcement across the country, as well as attempting to ban mail-in voting and allow law enforcement to displace and institutionalize unhoused people. Meanwhile, these critical and consequential decisions are being made in the ugliest room in the White House, according to musician Jack White. “Look at how disgusting trump has transformed the historic White House,” White shared on Instagram, where he published an image of Trump's recent meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky. Following a recent redesign, the Oval Office is now covered in harsh yellow-gold accents, like Halloween costume jewelry from a Party City clearance bin. “It's now a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler's dressing room.

Barbara Res, who previously oversaw construction as the former vice president at Trump Organization, told the publication that Trump “used the word ‘class' a lot, and it was a high-class thing for him. “Look at his disgusting taste, would you even buy a used car from this conman, let alone give him the nuclear codes?” the musician asked. “A gold plated trump bible would look perfect up on that mantle with a pair of trump shoes on either side wouldn't it?

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Every year, fans, critics, and industry artists complain about one or two shows stealing a spotlight that's capable of covering many, many more programs. And every year, the problem only seems to get worse. Then, just last year, “The Bear” topped itself with 11 wins and “Shōgun” won 18 times! I love “Shōgun,” and it was a particularly weak year for drama nominees (if anything, it deserved one more win — for Tadanobu Asano), but still: Only four other shows had at least 18 nominations. Hearing the same thank you's from the same cast and creators, over and over, is a problem, sure, but it's not what's keeping the Emmys from higher ratings. People who make television may not have enough time to watch television — Hollywood, by and large, can be a) very busy, and b) shockingly disinterested in its own creations — but the tens of thousands of TV Academy members who vote on the Emmys have a responsibility to broaden their horizons whenever possible. As in years past, we're putting a frontrunner under the spotlight — in this case, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's “The Studio” — to assess just how big a night it deserves to have. It would have to top 11 wins, which is very well could do, given it's competing in 18 categories and there's quite a bit of love out there for the show, its cast, creators, and crew. Voters can use this article as a handy resource — a study guide for the responsible among you who've already watched everything, and a cheat sheet for the truly time-crunched who may not know why people are buzzing about Bryan Cranston's finale performance or Adam Newport-Berra's “Oner” cinematography. Meanwhile, non-voters can better prepare for Emmy night. While your friends take to Bluesky with extreme reactions to “The Studio” over-performing or underperforming, you can lay out exactly why the final tally ended up where it did, with logic and evidence. And for those of you mainly interested in who will win, rather than who should, make sure to keep checking IndieWire Awards Editor Marcus Jones' Emmy predictions. Maybe you'll disagree with a few picks. Maybe you'll be surprised by a few others. But we'll all be better informed come Emmys night — and hopefully voters long before that. Style note: For categories where each nominated program consists of multiple individual artists, not all names are listed. Full credits can be found on the Emmys' website. Oners will likely win the day — and I, too, often find myself entranced by all the moving pieces coming together so naturally, and looking so good while doing it — but the same could be said of Nathan Fielder's work on “The Rehearsal,” especially in the nominated episode, “Pilot's Code.” Fans remember it as “The Sully Episode,” in which the writer, director, and star becomes heralded pilot Sully Sullenberger for reasons that defy succinct explanation, yet come to life with moving clarity and absolute hilarity in one of the year's best pieces of entertainment (and yet it's only the second or third best episode of “The Rehearsal” Season 2). It's a testament to Fielder's vision that any of his markedly ambitious show works, let alone thrives, so I'm giving this one to Fielder — though I fully expect the TV Academy to reward Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, which is fine! Nominees: – “Emily in Paris” (Seamus Tierney) – “Georgie and Mandy's First Mariage” (Buzz Feltshans IV) – “Hacks” (Adam Bricker) – “The Righteous Gemstones” (Paul Daley) – “The Studio” (Adam Newport-Berra) At IndieWire, we're big fans of “The Righteous Gemstones” and its Civil War era Season 4 opener, so if Paul Daley can snag the HBO comedy's first Emmy here, we're not going to complain. But yeah, sorry, it should probably go to “The Studio.” Its nominated episode is, of course, “The Oner,” which reflects Matt's anxiety and excitement over shooting a pivotal scene as a long, continuous shot (a “oner”) by capturing the entire episode in the same fashion. Nominees: – “Abbott Elementary” (Quinta Brunson) – “Hacks” (Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs, Jen Statsky) – “The Rehearsal” (Nathan Fielder, Carrie Kemper, Adam Locke-Norton, Eric Notarnicola) – “Somebody Somewhere” (Hannah Bos, Paul Thureen, Bridget Everett) – “The Studio” (Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory, Frida Perez) – “What We Do in the Shadows” (Sam Johnson, Sarah Naftalis, Paul Simms) “The Studio” isn't even nominated for its best episode — “Casting” is elite comedy writing — and while I respect the tradition to recognize a new series' premiere episode, it doesn't stack up to the killer competition. “The Rehearsal's” Sully entry is mind-bendingly exquisite, “What We Do in the Shadows'” finale is a clever triumph, and “Somebody Somewhere” ends with such an emotional wallop, I forgive its inclusion despite not being all that funny. I'm sure “Emily in Paris” does plenty of wild ‘dos, and “The White Lotus” had to overcome unbearable humidity to keep everyone looking that good, but I find myself routinely transfixed by Kathryn Hahn's fauxhawk-ponytail hairstyle in “The Studio.” It's not so elaborate that it distracts from the plot, but it's just advanced enough to be exactly what her character would want — edgy, exclusive, and impeccable (not to mention impossible for a rube like me to properly identify). While trying to avoid bias toward whatever nominee did the most editing, this one has to go to Yana Gorskaya and Dane McMaster for the “What We Do in the Shadows” finale, right? Not only does the clever, layered conclusion balance a number of delicate tonal shifts, but it also shot and inserted three different “perfect endings” to support the idea that Nadja hypnotized the audience into seeing whatever dream ending they desired. Randomly dropping in a spoof of “Newhart,” “Rosemary's Baby,” or “The Usual Suspects” isn't some grand innovation in editing, but it does speak to how much love and creativity went into making every scene in every episode of this brilliant sitcom. Plus, it's one more joke to land for an editing team that amplified so many. Nominees: – “Andor” (Brandon Roberts) – “Based on a True Story” (Sherri Chung) – “Cobra Kai” (Leo Birenberg and Zach Robinson) – “Severance” (Theodore Shapiro) – “The Studio” (Antonio Sanchez) – “The White Lotus” (Cristobal Tapla de Veer) Before this year's three nominations, he had two nods— for “Ozark” in 2022 and “The White Lotus” in 2023 — the latter of which he won for. Yes, I think so, though my vote is for “The Righteous Gemstones,” a comedy whose curated song selections span quite a range of eras and styles, while offering up plenty of toe-tapping favorites. Do you value the chemistry found in a core ensemble like “Shrinking” and “Hacks”? Great, but “The Studio's” series regulars had to bond on the fly, with no room for error — all those long takes — and they've coalesced nicely in just one season. Plus, Melissa Kostenbauder and Francine Maisler snagged so many stars from this year's other Emmy-nominated shows, including “Hacks” co-creators Jen Statsky and Lucia Aniello, as well as its star, Jean Smart. If you're going to make a meta show about modern Hollywood and promise movie stars, you have to overdeliver — with big names and cinephile favorites alike. “The Studio” did that, and then some. Nominees: – “Hacks” (Rob Tokarz) – “Mid-Century Modern” (Greg Grande) – “Only Murders in the Building” (Patrick Howe) – “The Studio” (Julie Berghoff) – “What We Do in the Shadows” (Shayne Fox) With all due respect to the difficulty of designing around so many long takes, this one has to go to “What We Do in the Shadows.” The four-time nominee for Outstanding Production Design has yet to win, falling to “The Mandalorian” in 2020 and “Only Murders in the Building” in both 2023 and 2024. Patrick Howe's inventive work merits reconsideration more than your typical repeat winner, as “Only Murders” finds clever and eye-catching ways to incorporate each season's themes (from Broadway to Hollywood), but the team behind “What We Do in the Shadows” is long overdue, and the final season features exciting settings like Guillermo's office, Nandor's war room, and everything in the penultima episode, “Come Out and Play.” FX's excellent sitcom benefits greatly from its inspired design work. Voters shouldn't miss their last chance to recognize as much. With no animated titles nominated this year, my priority turns to soundscapes that have been built largely (not entirely) from scratch, and that favors “The Acolyte” and “Agatha All Along.” Both require their audio engineers to invent nonexistent sounds, whether it's force battles or witchcraft, and the standards set by these franchises' big-screen predecessors means there's a lot to live up to. As a reminder: Sound Mixing recognizes work done almost completely in post-production, where created, added, and recorded sounds are balanced against each other. “The Bear” has won two years in a row (which I advocated for last year), and another trophy would be more than warranted. But given “The Studio's” preference for long takes, I have to imagine there's a lot of tricky ADR work that can't be as easily masked with an edit. Layer on the noises from a busy casino (in full operation), fully-finished scenes from a variety of fake movies, and the crowds at CinemaCon and the Golden Globes, and “The Studio” team had their work cut out for them. Kravitz is fun in “The Studio,” but there's a little too much self-awareness in her comedic scenes (especially when her character is tripping on mushrooms). In comparison, Julianne Nicholson is fiercely, courageously committed to the bit, and her drug-addled performance benefits greatly from going all-in. Still, I gotta go with Cynthia Erivo. Not only does she play multiple parts with razor-sharp specificity, but she understands the baked-in sense of humor her heavily accented roles require. She lives in just the right zone, making it easy to enjoy her “Poker Face” episode as much as her work in it. Bryan Cranston gives the best performance (and the most substantial, given his screen time and significance to the story), but Martin Scorsese would be a worthy winner, too. (And sorry, but Bernthal — as the only not “Studio” nominee — isn't in a comedy, nor is he giving a comedic performance, so there's no good argument there.) As much as everyone would love to see Barinholtz take the stage and recreate Sal Saperstein's Golden Globes moment, this one has to go to one of two other people: Harrison Ford, who's doing some of the best work of his career on an otherwise forgettable sad-com, or Jeff Hiller, whose endearing breakthrough on the best show of 2024 demands a shelf filled with awards. Personally, I'd vote Hiller (and, side note, I do believe he can win), but for the purposes of this exercise, “The Studio's” submission is at least third on the ballot. “The War” is a Top 3 “Studio” episode!) It physically pains me to say this, but no. Nominees: – Liza Colón-Zayas, “The Bear” – Hannah Einbinder, “Hacks” – Kathryn Hahn, “The Studio” – Janelle James, “Abbott Elementary” – Catherine O'Hara, “The Studio” – Sheryl Lee Ralph, “Abbott Elementary” – Jessica Williams, “Shrinking” If Kathryn Hahn wins her first Emmy or Catherine O'Hara wins her third Emmy, both for “The Studio,” I will be thrilled. They give the best performances on a series filled with memorable, enthusiastic work, and they're both icons in their own right. But Hannah Einbinder is looooooong overdue for her “Hacks” Emmy, and she's going to be the rightful pick every year until she's handed a trophy. (Others are bothered by what they see as category fraud, arguing Einbinder should be considered in Lead Actress… but while Ava may be a co-lead with Deborah, in no way can Einbinder and Jean Freaking Smart be seen on equal footing, especially dating back to when the series first began, which is when Max/HBO/HBO Max had to pick their categories. First and foremost, I want to acknowledge the naysayers. Are the demands in terms of emotional dexterity placed upon Jeremy Allen White, Jason Segel, and Adam Brody greater than those required of Rogen? But White already has two Emmys in this category, and the only thing that matters to him (and everyone) in 2025 is that he nails his Bruce Springsteen biopic. Segel sure gets weepy and loud in “Shrinking,” but he's also the biggest impediment to enjoying the series, so he's out, and Brody could handle playing a rom-com's hot rabbi in his sleep. None of them, really, are comedic leads anyway, so the only real competition for Rogen is Short, who I would love to see win, but this year — and likely only this year — we have to consider the burden on each actor. Short has been tearing through “Only Murders” for four years now, getting ever more comfortable in a character just as tailor-made to his talents as Rogen's fretful studio boss is his. Meanwhile, Rogen is the lead of a heavily scrutinized, semi-meta comedy filled with massive stars and built on many, many lengthy takes. From an execution level, the difficulty is high, and expectations are even higher; he has to be good enough that audiences are eager to keep watching him, rather than suffering through his scenes while they wait for the next A-lister to show up. “The Studio” never feels that way, and Rogen's lead performance is a big reason why. That leaves “The Studio” to square off with “Shadows,” and seven stellar seasons of real-life vampires trumps one solid season of vampiric movie executives. Final Tally: “The Studio” should win six (6) Emmys at the 77th Annual Emmy Awards (out of 18 categories and 23 total nominations). Oddly enough, that's the exact same number of wins we said “The Bear” deserved last year — from the same number of categories and the same number of nominations — when it ended up with a record-setting 11 Emmys. So come September 14, “The Studio” should feel pretty good about making history! We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Marlon Wayans is adapting the popular Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation's S. Korean game show Midnight Horror Story for U.S. audiences, with his producing partner Rick Alvarez, through their Ugly Baby Productions and Craig and Clara Plestis of Smart Dog Media (The Masked Singer). Smart Dog Media is collaborating for a second time with MBC Korea to bring a popular S. Korean game show to the States, building on their success with Fox's The Masked Singer (known originally as King of Mask Singer). The U.S. version will feature well-known actors who, in each episode, will deliver chilling yet comedic stories, brought to life through immersive, cinematic reenactments, according to the official logline. MBC's Midnight Horror Story premiered with a 1.8% nationwide rating, according to Nielsen Korea, for both parts of its first episode, outperforming competing programs in the same time slot. The episode featured hosts Shin Dong-yup, Kim Sook, Park Na-rae, Hwang Je-seong, and Heo Anna sharing viewer-submitted ghost stories. The game show, now in its fifth season, continues to be popular with viewers, and it has expanded significantly into the digital space. The core audience is younger viewers, who primarily watch via OTT and YouTube rather than live TV, MBC touts. Seventy-nine clips of Midnight Horror Story have surpassed 1 million views on YouTube, with the most popular reaching 3.94 million views. “With the success of Scary Movie and the ‘A Haunted House' franchise, Rick and I have always had an affinity for the mash-up of horror and comedy. This project fits perfectly in our wheelhouse,” shared Wayans. The duo launched Ugly Baby Productions in 2013 to produce filmed entertainment with an entrepreneurial spirit that reaches large global audiences. They have had three #1 global hits on Netflix: Naked, Sextuplets, and The Curse of Bridge Hollow; the indie franchise A Haunted House; Marlon Wayans: Good Grief on Amazon Prime Video; the documentary Unraveling George; and three comedy specials on HBO Max: Marlon Wayans: God Loves Me, Marlon Wayans: You Know What It Is, and Marlon Wayans Presents: The Headliners. Their TV credits include the NBC comedy Marlon, the NBC celebrity competition show I Can Do That, and the TBS comedy competition series Funniest Wins, among others. Next up, Ugly Baby Productions will produce the sixth installment of the “Scary Movie” franchise for Paramount and Miramax. The film is set to hit theaters on June 12, 2026. Wayans is repped by 3 Arts, UTA, and Yorn, Levine. Alvarez is repped by 3 Arts, UTA, and Yorn, Levine. Emmy award-winning Smart Dog Media, with the Plestises at the helm, is looking to replicate their huge global success with The Masked Singer with Midnight Horror Story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Few stories have influenced the canon of Western storytelling more than Miguel de Cervantes' “Don Quixote,” but its author has never received his own moment in the cinematic spotlight. That changes this fall with Alejandro Amenábar's new film “The Captive,” which follows Cervantes as a 28-year-old sailor in the Spanish Navy who discovers his love of storytelling while confined as a prisoner of war. The film is set to have its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, and IndieWire can exclusively reveal its new trailer. An official synopsis for the film reads: “1575 — Algiers, Miguel de Cervantes (Julio Peña), a wounded 28-year-old Spanish Navy soldier, is held prisoner by Ottoman corsairs. Suspicions rise amidst growing tensions in the city, and Cervantes, driven by an unwavering sense of optimism, devises a daring plan to escape.” Related Stories Easy Does It: Keith Carradine Looks Back on the Three '70s Classics He Made with Robert Altman ‘Ballad of a Small Player' Teaser: Colin Farrell Is Having a Bad Time with This Whole Gambling Thing “The Captive” is written and directed by Alejandro Amenábar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the back-to-back, high-stakes meetings between the warring leaders and their regional partners are aimed at finally bringing in an end to Russia's war against Ukraine, Trump can't seem to stop undermining the delicate negotiations by publicly parroting Kremlin talking points. In a Tuesday morning interview with Fox News, Trump falsely claimed that Putin and Russia had “gotten” Crimea “from Obama,” describing Russia's annexation of the territory as a “real estate deal.” Crimea, a peninsula in the north of the Black Sea, was invaded and occupied by Russia in 2014. “That was given — not a shot fired —- by President Obama in perhaps the worst real estate deal I've ever seen.” It was really Obama's, that was pure and simple Obama's fault, what a terrible thing,” Trump added. In the same interview, Trump declared that it was “insulting” that Ukraine — which has now been invaded by Russia twice in little more than a decade — had sought to join NATO. Trump rolled out the literal red carpet to receive Putin in Alaska on Friday, even granting the Russian authoritarian a ride in the presidential limousine — an  unprecedented honor rarely granted to foreign dignitaries, much less internationally wanted war criminals. Judging by Trump's statements following the summit, Putin spent much of their private discussions stroking the president's ego. “Vladimir Putin said something — one of the most interesting things — he said, ‘your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting,'” Trump recounted. “He said … ‘it's impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections.” Days later, Trump announced that he would seek to eliminate mail-in voting at a national level, despite lacking the constitutional authority to make any such change to state voting laws.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this Nightcrawler-like thriller of social and professional escalation, a cold-blooded nobody seizes his moment near a pop star and refuses to let go. Matthew (Théodore Pellerin) doesn't necessarily look like a starfucker. He's square, a white and gawky retail worker at a fashionable L.A. boutique who conspicuously throws Nile Rodgers on the store playlist when the mononymous Oliver (Archie Madekwe) rolls in with his posse. From this tiny, obviously engineered detail, a row of increasingly sinister dominos begin to fall as Matthew ingratiates himself with Oliver, proves he can hang backstage at a concert, and worms his way into the large home that the entourage crashes at. Oliver's other hangers-on—ranging from his quiet videographer (Daniel Zolghadri) to his goof-around pals (Zack Fox and Wale Onayemi, both rappers who've worked with Kenny Beats, who provides the film's score)—regard the newcomer with skepticism. They've managed to stick around during Oliver's meteoric rise because they know how to, and, like veteran reality TV performers, they can sniff out when someone's not there for the right reasons. As Matthew attempts to carve out a place in this unofficial organization, the camera gets up close and personal when documenting the ground-level work of pure ambition. Pellerin's bulging eyes and empty smile start as uncomfortable, but become more transparently hungry as the plot unveils itself—the open mouth of a leech faced with a buffet. In the always-be-posting era, playing the game inherently looks a little silly—and much of it is captured in amateurish handheld, like a behind-the-scenes music doc or music video B-roll—which gives Russell's screenplay the wiggle room it needs to find an icky honesty in its appearance-forward reality. The ensuing rise-and-fall trajectory of the story isn't new or unexpected, but Russell and his leads complicate things both through cultural specificity (this is a film obsessed with the weightless successes of handles and stories and follows) and by making it clear that, to an extent, the target of all these plots knows what he's doing. It's not that Lurker blames Oliver for attracting a group of striving lackeys, but that it's smart enough to know that being a pop star also means knowing how to wield power—how to play those underlings against each other and exploit his own sex appeal. It's when Russell stops trusting his leads and leans hard into the shock, into what heinous schemes someone close to you could pull off, that Lurker shakes its audience free of its spell. The strength of Lurker, though, is when it's operating as a slick, slimy social-engineering thriller that anyone could relate to.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Because Kennedy (the cousin of Pratt's mother-in-law) has jumped “on the bandwagon with who is the most divisive president ever”—a polite way to describe Donald Trump—it makes sense to the actor that Kennedy is “made to look terrible,” Pratt says during an appearance on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast. “And so I don't know what to believe.” If only there was some way to make an informed judgement about Kennedy's policies. If other people are making RFK Jr. look terrible, how else is Pratt supposed to determine the truth? He can't just ask the man himself, despite the fact that he's “spent a number of occasions hanging with him, just in a strictly family dinner kind of vibe,” Pratt says. “It's not like I say to Bobby, ‘Let's talk about this' while we're playing cards or having fun or having dinner. If Pratt can't ask Bobby himself, but he also can't trust anyone else's word on the subject, then there's simply no way of knowing what's going on in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But please don't imagine Pratt lives in complete ignorance, because he does have some vague idea of Kennedy's beliefs. “There's certain things [that RFK Jr.] oversees that seem to be supported in a bipartisan way—like getting terrible toxic stuff out of our kids' food. Unfortunately, Kennedy is not just doing that, but Pratt wouldn't know about it given he apparently doesn't believe stuff like news outlets or words directly from Kennedy's mouth. “I'd hate to be so mired in hatred for the president that any success from his administration is something I'd be having an allergic reaction to. It would be good to have mRNA vaccines, which helped end the pandemic, but Kennedy canceled $500 million in contracts for vaccine development; it would be good to have a division of the CDC monitoring lead exposure levels among children and managing prevention across the country, but that's one of the many important programs Kennedy cut; it would be good to have no dead bears dumped in Central Park trash cans, but, well, you know how that one ends. Pratt says he “got along really well” with RFK Jr. during cozy family gatherings. Of the entire Trump administration, he declared, “I want them all to be successful.” What Trump, RFK Jr., and the whole gang consider “successful” might end up being disastrous for the country, but again, there's no way for Chris Pratt to figure that out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She has been on her own healing journey while trying to support Teddi Mellencamp through stage 4 cancer, and then Tamra jumped back into the Bravo TV mix. Outside looking in, it all seemed like a perfect storm of stressors that could easily lead to precisely the kind of meltdown that Tamra has had. Luckily, Tamra has a great support system in place, beginning with her ride or die husband, Eddie Judge. And he's always there for me, so I can't complain.” “You guys are watching my emotional journey happen right here on The Real Housewives of Orange County. Tamra's breaking point in filming came during a cast trip to New Orleans, the last place that she had traveled to with Teddi. She stormed off and then ended up in a car on the phone with Eddie, asking him to book her a flight home. “I feel not loved and not wanted, and I just don't think there's a place for me in this group,” Tamra later explained in a confessional. While she appeared to quit the series, Andy Cohen recently gave an update on Tamra's status on “Watch What Happens Live.” Andy asked Heather, “Did you truly believe she was quitting?” Heather then replied with, “Yes and no.” Andy then confirmed that Tamra did not quit the series. Do you think that Eddie's rock-solid support will be enough to anchor Tamra through another season on RHOC?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madonna celebrated her 67th birthday in spectacular fashion by fulfilling a longtime dream to attend the historic Palio di Siena horse race in Italy, surrounded by her children and boyfriend Akeem Morris during an unforgettable Tuscan getaway. The Queen of Pop marked her special day on August 16 by experiencing one of Italy's most treasured traditions, sharing the moments with her family while staying at a luxurious 16th-century villa in the heart of Tuscany's wine country. Madonna's birthday celebration centered around attending the legendary Palio di Siena, a horse race that has entertained audiences since medieval times. “My Dream for many years has been to watch the Palio horse race in Sienna that takes place on my birthday, August 16, since 1482! !” Madonna shared on Instagram, in a reel of the spectacular celebration. She concluded her heartfelt message by stating, “Dreams do come true.” Madonna watched the historic race from a balcony overlooking the track, accompanied by her children, including daughter Lourdes, 28, son Rocco, 25, and her adopted twin daughters Stella and Estere, 12. Her boyfriend, Akeem Morris, 28, also joined the family celebration. The luxury property sits on 900 acres of picturesque vineyards and is available for private rental, reportedly costing £18,000 for two nights, according to the Daily Mail. A source told the Daily Mail: “Everyone turned out to support Madonna and she had an amazing trip. She loves to celebrate her birthday in Italy and this was one of the best yet. She's been friends with Sting for years so I'm sure he will have sorted her out mates rates for his huge estate.” One of the celebration's most talked-about elements was Madonna's birthday cake, which featured a pink Labubu doll design complete with her iconic conical bra look. Celebrity friends, including Andy Cohen, who wrote “Happy birthday Queen,” Katy Perry, who added “MY QUEEN,” and Justin Trudeau, Former Prime Minister of Canada, who added, “Happy happy birthday,” joined in wishing Madonna well on social media.</p>
