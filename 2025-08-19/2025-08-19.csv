Editor's Note:  Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters. In the US, call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Globally, the International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world.



            Aubrey Plaza is opening up about her life after the death of her husband, Jeff Baena.



            The “White Lotus” star is a guest on the latest episode of her friend and former “Parks and Recreation” costar Amy Poehler's podcast, “Good Hang.”



            Baena, a writer and director, died by suicide in January. He was 47.
    


            “On behalf of all the people who feel like they know you, and the people who do know you, how are you feeling today?” Poehler asked Plaza.
    


            “In this very, very present moment, I feel happy to be with you,” Plaza responded.
    


            “I'm here and I'm functioning,” she continued. “I feel really grateful to be moving through the world. I think I'm okay, but it's like a daily struggle, obviously.”
    


            Baena was well known in Hollywood for several projects, including co-writing the 2004 film, “I Heart Huckabees.
    


            He and Plaza worked together on the 2014 horror-comedy, “Life After Beth,” the 2021 comedy series, “Cinema Toast,” and the 2022 film, “Spin Me Round.”
    


            On the podcast, Plaza compared her grief to the recent film “The Gorge,” which stars Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy, among others.
    


            “It's like [an] alien movie or something with Miles Teller,” Plaza said. “In the movie, there's like a cliff on one side and there's a cliff on the other side, then there's gorge in between and it's filled with all these like monster people that are trying to get them.”
    


            “I swear when I watched it, I was like that feels like what my grief is like,” she added.
    


            Her grief, Plaza explained, feels like “a giant ocean of awfulness, that's like right there and I can see it.”
    


            “Sometimes I just want to dive into it and just like be in it,” she said. “Then sometimes I just look at it, and sometimes I try to get away from it. But, it's always there.”
    


            Plaza and Baena began dating in 2011 and she revealed in 2021 on social media that they had married.

            A $25 million pink diamond that was stolen in an elaborate heist in Dubai has been recovered by police just a few hours later.
    


            The “exceptionally” rare diamond was stolen from a jeweler by thieves posing as intermediaries for a prospective buyer, Dubai Police said in a statement Monday.
    


            Weighing 21.25 carats, the large diamond “boasts exceptional clarity, symmetry, and polish,” and has a unique purity rating, said police.
    


            Its rarity made it an attractive target for the gang, which police said had worked for more than a year to take the stone.
    


            After tracking the diamond's arrival in Dubai from Europe, the gang devised a “sophisticated plan,” in order to steal it. The thieves passed themselves off as wealthy dealers by renting luxury cars and holding meetings in high-end hotels. They even went as far as to hire a diamond expert to authenticate the stone, said police.
    


            “Eventually, the gang lured the merchant to a villa under the pretext of introducing him to the ‘buyer,'” reads the police statement. “Once the diamond was brought out, they nabbed it and fled.”
    


            Nonetheless, police quickly identified three suspects, tracked them down, and arrested them, recovering the diamond before it could be smuggled out of Dubai.

            The jeweler said the speed of the authorities' response was “astonishing.”
    


            “To my surprise, the very next morning, they called to say the suspects had been arrested and the diamond recovered,” he said in the police statement, before urging others in the diamond trade to follow official safety guidelines set by Dubai authorities.
    


            Dubai has become a global hub for the diamond trade in recent years, partly thanks to its minimal tax demands and convenient location between producer countries in Africa and major sales markets such as India.

US President Donald Trump has received a formal invitation to visit Moscow, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has confirmed. During last week's summit in Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin extended the invitation to Trump in person.

In an interview with the television channel Rossiya 24 on Tuesday, Lavrov stated that Trump “has an invitation” and recalled that during the summit, the US president had indicated that the idea of him visiting Russia is “interesting.”

During their joint press conference with Putin last week, Trump admitted, however, that he could “get a little heat” for traveling to Moscow. Nevertheless, he said he can “see it possibly happening.”

Putin and Trump met in person for the first time since 2019 in Anchorage, Alaska to discuss ways of resolving the Ukraine conflict as well as normalizing relations between Moscow and Washington.

Both leaders have described the summit positively, with Putin calling it “frank” and “substantive” and Trump hailing it as “productive.”

On Monday, Trump met with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, several European leaders and the heads of NATO and the European Commission to discuss the conditions for a peace deal with Russia.

Following the meeting, Trump announced that he had once again spoken by phone with Putin and said he would work to arrange a meeting between the Russian president and Zelensky, followed by a trilateral summit.

US President Donald Trump has said that he believes that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin is really interested in settling the Ukraine conflict.

Trump made the statement after meeting with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky at the White House on Monday. Zelensky had been summoned to Washington following the US president's summit with Putin in Alaska last week.

The US leader said that during the talks in Anchorage, he had a “good” discussion with Putin on stopping the fighting between Moscow and Kiev. “And I think there is a possibility that something could come out of it,” he added.

Trump suggested that a trilateral meeting between Putin, Zelensky and him could be organized in the near future and “there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.”

“I know the president. I know myself, and I believe Vladimir Putin wants to see it [the conflict] ended,” he claimed.

Zelensky said that Kiev is also ready for a trilateral meeting, adding “It is a good signal about trilateral. I think this is very good.”

Trump phoned Putin on Monday to inform him about the progress in negotiations with Zelensky and the Western European leaders who had come to Washington to support him.

Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said later that the call lasted 40 minutes and both presidents expressed a readiness to discuss a resolution to the Ukraine conflict with Zelensky.

Putin said after the summit in Alaska that it brings “us closer” to peace. However, he reiterated that the elimination of the root causes of the crisis would be key to the settlement of the conflict.

According to Moscow, in order for a lasting peace to be achieved, Ukraine should renounce its ambitions for NATO membership, demilitarize, and recognize the current territorial realities, including the status of Crimea and the four formerly Ukrainian regions which voted to join Russia in 2022.

Ukraine has proposed that its European backers spend $100 billion providing it with American weapons, the Financial Times reported. Kiev continues to seek security guarantees from Washington. 

Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and the heads of several Western European states held talks with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday to discuss the ongoing conflict and diplomatic attempts to resolve it.

Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the previous administration's unconditional aid to Kiev, announced last month that Washington's NATO allies would effectively pay for the US-made weapons being sent to Ukraine.

In addition to the weapons procurement proposal, Ukraine is preparing a $50 billion deal to produce drones domestically, FT reported, citing four people familiar with the matter and a document Kiev reportedly shared with the US.

Although the document contains limited details, FT said Ukraine intends to purchase at least 10 Patriot air defense missile systems.

Ukraine's European supporters have struggled to ramp up production to meet Kiev's needs, as Ukrainian forces have steadily been losing ground to the Russian army.

After a one-on-one meeting in Alaska on Friday, Trump claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ready to agree to security guarantees for Ukraine, though he did not provide specifics.

Ukraine has previously urged the West to provide security guarantees equivalent to NATO's collective defense, while several European states have offered to deploy peacekeepers. Russia, however, has stressed that it will not tolerate any Western troops in Ukraine.

Broadcaster says family wants ‘to wait a bit longer', after film about singer's final years pulled from Monday's listings

The BBC has revealed it delayed an hour-long documentary about Ozzy Osbourne at the last minute at the request of his family.

The film about the musician's final years was suddenly pulled from listings on Monday, with the corporation making no comment about the decision. Its scheduled screening was less than a month after Osbourne's death. It was also less than three weeks after his wife, Sharon, and their children appeared before crowds in his home city of Birmingham.

In a new statement, the corporation suggested the delay had come after a request from the musician's family. “Our sympathies are with the Osbourne family at this difficult time,” a BBC spokesperson said. “We are respecting the family's wishes to wait a bit longer before airing this very special film. The new [broadcast] date will be confirmed shortly.”

The BBC had recently stated that the film would go ahead. Clare Sillery, head of commissioning for BBC Documentaries, said earlier this month that the film, Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home, captured “family moments, humour, reflection and shows the enduring spirit that made Ozzy a global icon. We hope it brings comfort and joy to Ozzy's fans and viewers as they remember and celebrate his extraordinary life”.

The programme is not the only documentary in the offing about the life of the late star. Paramount+ has also made a feature-length film, Ozzy Osbourne: No Escape From Now, about his struggles since a serious fall in LA in 2019. It had been slated to run later this year.

The BBC's documentary had already been completely overhauled as Osbourne's health deteriorated. It was originally envisaged as a much wider, 10-part series called Home to Roost, which followed Ozzy and Sharon's attempt to restart their lives back in the UK.

It has now been re-edited into a one-off film, showing Osbourne's battling attempts to become strong enough to perform and his struggles with ill-health. Osbourne died last month, aged 76, just weeks after performing from a throne on stage at Villa Park. The singer had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2019.

The BBC film includes interviews with Osbourne family members, including Sharon, Kelly and Jack. It had been due to air on BBC One on Monday night, but was removed from the schedule earlier in the day. The broadcaster initially stated it had been “moved in the schedules” and replaced it with an episode of Fake Or Fortune?","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The US president hosted European leaders at short notice amid intense political efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Here are four key points to what was achieved

Ukraine war: live updates

Full report: Trump arranging Zelenskyy-Putin meeting as European leaders push for US security guarantees

Donald Trump has hosted leaders from across Europe as part of a flurry of diplomacy to find a path to peace in Ukraine. Coming just days after a disappointing summit with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska, the pressure was on to make headway in a years-long conflict that the US president once said he could solve in 24 hours.

Below are some key points arising from the US president's range of bilateral and multilateral talks with the leaders of Ukraine, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato.

A bilateral meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin is something the Russian president has always resisted, urging for a list of conditions to be met first, but the possibility may now be nearer than ever.

Donald Trump said after the White House talks: “I called President Putin, and began the arrangements for a meeting, at a location to be determined, between President Putin and President Zelenskyy. After that meeting takes place, we will have a Trilat, which would be the two presidents, plus myself.”

According to the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, Putin told Trump in a call during Monday's White House meeting that he was ready to meet Zelenskyy “within the next two weeks”. For his part, Zelenskyy reiterated on Monday that he was ready for talks with Putin.

Merz and the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, both offered some pointed language on the topic, saying in separate press conferences that it remained to be seen if the Russian president had the “courage” to go ahead with the meeting. Stubb said: “Putin is rarely to be trusted.”

So far, the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov has said only that Putin and Trump discussed the idea of “raising the level of representatives” at Ukraine talks. Ushakov, in his comments late on Monday, did not specify what he meant by raising the level at meetings, and did not address the possibility of a trilateral meeting between the leaders.

Although Trump poured cold water on the importance of a ceasefire, he did offer hope on US involvement in helping guarantee Ukraine's future security. After welcoming Zelenskyy to the White House, he said: “When it comes to security, there's going to be a lot of help,” even if European countries need to be “a first line of defence”.

Later, Trump said in a post that these guarantees would be “coordinated” with the US.

On Monday morning, Zelenskyy described security guarantees as “a key issue, a starting point towards ending the war” and appreciated Trump's indication that the US was ready to be part of that guarantee.

Zelenskyy said those guarantees would be “formalised in some way in the next week or 10 days”, which can prove to be a long time when it comes to diplomacy involving Trump's White House.

In a social media post late on Monday, Trump said the White House talks included plans for European countries to provide security assurances to Ukraine, with the US acting as “coordinator”.

As western leaders discussed security guarantees at the White House, Russia's foreign ministry issued a statement rejecting any prospect of Nato personnel being deployed in Ukraine. “We reaffirm our categorical opposition to any scenarios involving the stationing of a Nato contingent in Ukraine,” the ministry said.

The US president's desire for a Nobel peace prize is well known – who can forget the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity” established as part of a peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan this month – and it seemed clearly in his mind during his Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy.

The “peacemaker-in-chief” said he had ended six wars since he became president, with his administration claiming to have helped settle the conflicts between Israel and Iran, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, Cambodia and Thailand, India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia. But, as Andrew Roth explains, it is a claim that stretches the realities on the ground.

Trump's approach to foreign crises is peppered with efforts to find a way to establish economic opportunity for US industry, and Ukraine may be no different if a deal is finalised. Zelenskyy has, after all, previously had to negotiate the US president's desire for Ukraine's critical minerals as part of his rivalry with China.

On Monday, Zelenskyy indicated that the price of obtaining security guarantees from the US included a pledge to buy $90bn of US weapons, primarily aircraft and air defence systems.

He added that the US would also buy into Ukraine's drone program, an area in which it has made significant strides since Russia's full-scale invasion began. Earlier, the Financial Times reported that the drone deal was worth $50bn.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US president says it's possible Russian leader does not want to make deal

Donald Trump has ruled out the deployment of American troops in Ukraine in his first interview since yesterday's White House meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.

“You have my assurance, and I'm president,” Trump told Fox News talkshow Fox & Friends in a phone interview on Tuesday, when pressed on whether US forces could be sent to defend against another Russian incursion.

The US president reiterated that Ukraine would not be admitted into Nato under his watch, but said that Kyiv would still receive security guarantees. These, he suggested, European allies would “front load”. Trump said France, Germany and the UK were among the countries considering sending their own troops to bolster Ukraine's defences.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is due to hold a news briefing shortly where she'll no doubt be asked about Ukraine. I'll bring you any relevant lines here, my colleague Shrai Popat will also be covering it in full over on our US politics blog:

I'm now handing the blog over to Lucy Campbell, but before I go, here is a quick roundup of today's headlines so far:

The US president, Donald Trump, has ruled out the deployment of American troops in Ukraine, but appeared to hint at possibility of US air security guarantees.

Trump today repeated his warning that Vladimir Putin would face a “rough situation” if he did not cooperate in the peace process, while Volodymyr Zelenskyy had to “show some flexibility”, PA reported. “I hope President Putin is going to be good and if he's not, that's going to be a rough situation,” Trump said. “And I hope that Zelensky, President Zelensky, will do what he has to do. He has to show some flexibility.”

Vladimir Putin has agreed to face-to-face talks with Zelenskyy, according to Trump and European leaders, and the Ukrainian president has welcomed the news, calling a “big step forward” towards securing a peace deal.

The “Coalition of the Willing” met virtually today to debrief after last night's talks at the White House, it emerged.

British prime minister Keir Starmer described the European leaders' talks at the White House as “good and constructive” and said they produced “real progress”.

The trilateral meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy, Putin ‘can bring breakthrough on path to peace,' Ukraine's foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said.

On the back of last night's meeting with Trump and European allies at the White House, Zelenskyy confirmed that the allies were “already working on the concrete content of the security guarantees.”

Geneva is emerging as a potential location for a peace summit between Putin and Zelenskyy, as first floated by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Speaking to reporters after his White House visit, Macron said the summit should be hosted by “a neutral country, maybe Switzerland – I'm pushing for Geneva – or another country.”

Military planners to meet in US to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, UK said. The UK prime minister's office released a short statement after the meeting of the Coalition of the Willing on Ukraine, co-chaired by Starmer and Macron.

Ukraine need to be open to discuss territorial changes, not join Nato, the Slovak PM, Robert Fico, said. Fico, who repeatedly clashed with Ukraine in the past and sought to block or delay some EU sanctions on Russia, insisted that “the first basic prerequisite for ending the conflict is the understanding that Ukraine cannot become a member state of Nato.”

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said the EU would continue targeting Russia's war economy and that the next sanctions package against Moscow should be ready by next month.

The military chiefs of staff of Nato's 32 member countries will hold a video meeting tomorrow to discuss developments concerning Ukraine, the head of the alliance's military committee has said.

Italian admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone posted that the military head of Nato's forces in Europe, US General Alexus Grynkewich, would give an update “on the current security environment” as “diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Ukraine progress”, AFP reports.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said the EU would continue targeting Russia's war economy and that the next sanctions package against Moscow should be ready by next month.

She was speaking after a virtual European Council summit of about the war in Ukraine, a day after an extraordinary meeting of Ukrainian and several EU leaders with U.S. president Donald Trump in Washington.

Kallas said “unity among EU leaders in today's virtual summit was palpable” and that she had placed the topics of Ukraine security and Russia sanctions at the top of the agenda for talks next week among EU foreign and defence ministers.

“[Vladimir] Putin cannot be trusted to honour any promise or commitment. Therefore, security guarantees must be strong and credible enough to deter Russia from re-grouping and re-attacking,” Kallas said in a post on X.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given Donald Trump a golf club belonging to a wounded serviceman during his visit to Washington this week, Kyiv said on Tuesday.

Trump, an avid golfer who owns several courses, accepted the gift and presented Zelenskyy with symbolic keys to the White House in return, the Ukrainian leader's office said.

The warm exchange marks a turnaround from February, when Zelenskyy left the White House early after a televised shouting match with Trump and US vice-president JD Vance. Since then, Zelenskyy has sought to repair ties, praising Trump's efforts to secure peace.

“The president of Ukraine presented the president of the United States with a golf club,” Zelenskyy's office said. The club belonged to Kostiantyn Kartavtsev, a soldier who “had lost a leg in the first months of Russia's full-scale invasion while saving his brothers-in-arms”, it added. Zelenskyy also showed Trump a video of Kartavtsev.

Later on Tuesday, Ukrainian veteran organisation United by Golf published a video of Trump holding the club and thanking Kartavtsev. “I just watched your swing. I know a lot about golf and your swing is great,” Trump said. “You're an amazing person, and you just keep playing golf and doing all of the other things. Your country is a great country. We're trying to bring it back to health.”

Zelenskyy also brought a letter for Melania Trump from his wife, Olena, thanking the US first lady for writing to Vladimir Putin and urging him to save children's lives.

The EU has dropped its calls for a “ceasefire” in Ukraine and is instead demanding that Russia “stop the killing”, in a semantic shift that aims to grab the ear of US President Donald Trump, according to AFP.

European Commission spokesperson Arianna Podestà told reporters: “The message for us is: stop the killing. Anything that stops the killing is welcome.”

Her remarks echoed EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, who stood alongside Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Brussels on Sunday. “The effect must be stop the killing,” she said. “That's the most important part. Whether we call it a ceasefire or a peace deal, stop the killing.”

European sources said Trump now disliked the term “ceasefire”, and the intention was to avoid antagonising the US president on a matter of form as high-stakes negotiations on Ukraine and European security were under way.

Yet at the White House summit on Monday, European leaders made clear their basic demands had not changed.

“I can't imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire, so let's work on that and let's try to put pressure on Russia,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

French President Emmanuel Macron summed it up by saying that “a truce, a ceasefire or at least, to stop the killings” was “a necessity”.

Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan and US secretary of state Marco Rubio discussed potential steps to end the Ukraine war in a phone call on Tuesday, a Turkish foreign ministry source said.

The source said the two also discussed the outcomes of talks between the U.S. and Russian presidents in Alaska and a meeting in Washington involving European leaders, Ukraine and the US, according to Reuters.

Fidan and Rubio also discussed ceasefire efforts in Gaza and the latest situation in Syria, the source said, adding Fidan had called for an immediate truce in Gaza and unhindered access of humanitarian aid.

Donald Trump has ruled out the deployment of American troops in Ukraine in his first interview since yesterday's White House meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.

“You have my assurance, and I'm president,” Trump told Fox News talkshow Fox & Friends in a phone interview on Tuesday, when pressed on whether US forces could be sent to defend against another Russian incursion.

The US president reiterated that Ukraine would not be admitted into Nato under his watch, but said that Kyiv would still receive security guarantees. These, he suggested, European allies would “front load”. Trump said France, Germany and the UK were among the countries considering sending their own troops to bolster Ukraine's defences.

Vladimir Putin suggested holding a possible meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, in Moscow, according to two sources familiar with a phone call between US president Donald Trump and Putin.

“Putin mentioned Moscow” during their call on Monday, one of the sources told AFP, adding that Zelensky had said “no” in response.

What security guarantees might Ukraine get in return for a peace deal?

As western leaders meet, four key questions remain about the steps they could take to prevent any future Russian aggression:

What security guarantees might Ukraine get?

How might the US contribute?

What does Russia say?

What does history tell us?

Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding breaks down each one in this explainer:

I'm handing the blog over to Matthew Pearce, who will guide you through the late afternoon in Europe.

Slovak prime minister Robert Fico, who repeatedly clashed with Ukraine in the past and sought to block or delay some EU sanctions on Russia, also spoke in the last few minutes.

In a three-minute video posted on his social media channels, recorded after his participation in the European Council meeting on Ukraine, he insisted that “the first basic prerequisite for ending the conflict is the understanding that Ukraine cannot become a member state of Nato.”

He noted that he expressed this view before, and faced heavy criticism.

He also said:

“Equally important is the factual understanding that without a discussion about territorial changes in Ukraine, no progress can be made,” he said.

He added that he was disappointed that the EU “had to wait for Donald Trump to show us the path towards peace,” praising the US president's initiative as “enormous personal success.”

Fico also rejected the suggestion that EU countries could take part in buying €100bn-worth of military equipment for Ukraine, saying it sounded “like a bad joke.”

He said he could not imagine a siutation in which Slovakia spends money on US weapons to send them to Ukraine for free.

Unsuprisingly, he's also “sceptical” about the idea of further sanctions against Russia.

But he said he hoped for peace “as soon as possible” and was ready to support Ukraine's ambitions to join the European Union instead.

We are just getting a line from Reuters that a meeting between Nato military leaders on Ukraine is provisionally expected to take place tomorrow.

We will bring you a confirmation once we have it.

European Council president António Costa told Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the EU was united in its “unwavering support for Ukraine” when the pair spoke on the phone this afternoon.

The former Portuguese prime minister added the bloc was also committed to maintaining pressure on Russia to get it to discuss and agree to ending the war in Ukraine.

“Our top priorities are to stop the killing, advance the exchange of prisoners, and secure the return of the thousands of children abducted by Russia,” he said.

He added:

“We will work together with the United States on concrete and essential security guarantees. Together with President Zelenskyy and the US, we will prepare the next steps to achieve a just and lasting peace.

We must continue to support the Ukrainian people and move forward with the enlargement process. Ukraine's future also lies in the prosperity and stability that EU membership can provide.”

The UK prime minister's office has just released a short statement after the meeting of the Coalition of the Willing on Ukraine, co-chaired by Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron.

It looks like the focus was on planning the next steps on security guarantees and potential sanctions to push Putin's Russia even further.

The statement said the participating countries agreed on a meeting of planning teams with their US counterparts “in the coming days to further strengthen plans to deliver robust security guarantees and prepare for the deployment of a reassurance force if the hostilities ended.”

The leaders also talked about “how further pressure – including through sanctions – could be placed on Putin until he showed he was ready to take serious action to end his illegal invasion.”

The coalition gathered over 30 international leaders, No10 said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukrainian drones struck an oil refinery in Russia's Volgograd Oblast overnight on Aug. 19, regional governor Andrei Bocharov said. 

The refinery, Russian oil company Lukoil's second-largest, is a major producer of petroleum products in Russia's Southern Federal District. According to Bocharov, a fire broke out at the site following the attack.

Residents told Russian pro-government media outlet Shot that they heard between four and 10 explosions, with drones flying at low altitude and bright flashes visible in the night sky.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed 13 Ukrainian drones were shot down over the region.

Lukoil's Volgograd refinery, which has an annual capacity of 14.8 million tons, had already been forced to halt production after earlier strikes on Aug. 13-14. Reuters reported on Aug. 18 that the damaged units together accounted for the plant's entire refining capacity.

Volgograd Oblast, along the lower Volga River, is roughly 470 miles (290 kilometers) from Ukraine-controlled territory and shares a border with Kazakhstan to the southeast.

The extent of the damage is not yet known. Ukraine has not commented on the attack.

Ukraine has repeatedly used long-range drones to strike industrial and military targets deep inside Russia, focusing in particular on oil infrastructure that fuels Moscow's war effort. 

At least three Russian refineries suspended or cut operations this month due to such attacks, including Rosneft's Saratov facility and refineries in Ryazan and Novokuibyshevsk.

The strikes have contributed to soaring fuel prices in Russia, with the Moscow Times reporting on Aug. 18 that wholesale gasoline reached ""historic highs"" following the shutdowns.

Ukrainian long-range drones destroyed two Russian ammunition depots in occupied Luhansk Oblast, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on Aug. 19.

The strikes hit warehouses in the village of Bilokurakyne, located on a key railway line supplying Russian forces on the Pokrovsk front, where Moscow is focusing its primary offensive efforts.

According to the SBU, the drones hit the sites at least seven times, sparking a massive fire later confirmed by FIRMS, a NASA public satellite service that tracks real-time fire activity.

""The destruction of enemy ammunition directly helps our soldiers, who are bravely holding back Russian assaults,"" SBU said, adding that operations to ""demilitarize"" Russian depots would continue.

Bilokurakyne lies about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory and remains under Russian occupation. Moscow currently controls nearly all of Luhansk Oblast.

Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian logistics hubs in occupied areas and inside Russia to weaken Moscow's front-line capacity. 

On July 2, Ukraine struck a Russian ammunition depot in occupied Khartsyzk, Donetsk Oblast, and on May 17, an attack on a depot near Perevalne in occupied Crimea caused an explosion and fire.

Editor's note: This item has been updated to include a statement from Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.

Talks between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin could be held in Hungary, Reuters reported on Aug. 19, citing a U.S. administration source.

The meeting would mark the first encounter between Zelensky and Putin since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The two leaders last met in Paris in December 2019 as part of Normandy Format talks mediated by France and Germany. 

In April, Hungary's parliament voted to approve the country's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), potentially allowing Putin to visit the country despite his arrest warrant issued in 2023 over the abduction of Ukrainian children.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose government is widely seen as authoritarian, has blocked or delayed military aid to Ukraine, maintained ties with Putin, and echoed Kremlin narratives.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Aug. 18, after a meeting with Zelensky and European allies, that preparations were underway for a face-to-face summit. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who joined the talks, said the meeting could take place within two weeks.

Russian authorities have not yet officially announced that they have agreed to such a meeting.  

French President Emmanuel Macron, who was also present during the White House talks, said on Aug 19 that the summit should be held in Europe, adding that he favored Geneva as a neutral venue.

""It will be a neutral country, so perhaps Switzerland, I'm advocating for Geneva or another country. The last time there were bilateral discussions was in Istanbul,"" Macron told French broadcaster LCI.

Switzerland's long-standing neutrality has made it a preferred host for international negotiations, where parties can meet without the perception of bias.

Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said the country is willing to host the summit, emphasizing the country's experience in organizing such events, Swissinfo reported.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also proposed Turkey as a possible venue in July. Ukrainian and Russian delegations previously held three rounds of direct peace talks in the country.

Zelensky has repeatedly voiced readiness for direct negotiations. On Aug. 18, he said he was prepared to discuss territorial issues with Putin personally. 

The Russian president has so far avoided meeting Zelensky despite claiming openness to talks.

Tropical storm and surge watches were issued for much of the Outer Banks.The Associated Press

Holly Andrzejewski hadn't yet welcomed her and her family's first guests to the Atlantic Inn on Hatteras Island when she had to start rescheduling them, as Hurricane Erin neared North Carolina's Outer Banks on Tuesday and threatened to whip up wild waves and tropical force winds.

Although the storm is expected to stay offshore, evacuations were ordered on such barrier islands along the Carolina coast as Hatteras as authorities warned the storm could churn up dangerous rip currents from Florida to the New England coast.

Andrzejewski and her husband purchased the bed-and-breakfast, known as the oldest inn on the island, less than a week ago. By Monday they had brought in all the outdoor furniture and made sure their daughter and her boyfriend, who are the innkeepers, had generators, extra water and flashlights as they stayed behind to keep an eye on the property.

“It's just one of those things where you know this is always a possibility and it could happen, and you just make the best out of it. Otherwise you wouldn't live at the beach,” said Andrzejewski, who will also remain on the island, at her home about a 15-minute drive away.

Erin lashed part of the Caribbean with rain and wind Monday. Forecasters are confident it will curl north and away from the eastern U.S., but tropical storm and surge watches were issued for much of the Outer Banks.

Hurricanes are growing more intense along Atlantic seaboard, study finds

Officials at the Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, North Carolina, reported to the National Weather Service rescuing at least 60 swimmers from rip currents Monday.

By Tuesday morning, Erin had lost some strength from previous days and dropped to a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 kilometres an hour, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It was about 1,070 km southwest of Bermuda and 1,150 km south-southeast of Cape Hatteras and was moving northwest at a slower 11 km/h.

But Erin's tropical storm winds could be felt for 320 kilometres. Forecasters expect it will grow larger as it moves through the Atlantic.

“We're concerned about those structures right along the beach,” the hurricane centre's Richard Pasch said.

A tropical storm warning remained in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands, where government services were suspended, some ports were closed and residents were ordered to stay home.

On North Carolina's Outer Banks, coastal flooding was expected to begin Tuesday and continue through Thursday.

The evacuations on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke came at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that jut into the Atlantic Ocean and are increasingly vulnerable to storm surges.

A year ago, Hurricane Ernesto stayed hundreds of miles offshore yet still produced high surf and swells that caused coastal damage.

This time there are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway. Some routes could be impassible for days.

Hurricane Erin neared North Carolina's Outer Banks on Tuesday and threatened to whip up wild waves and tropical force winds.

The Associated Press

This is the first evacuation for Ocracoke since Hurricane Dorian in 2019 caused the most damage in the island's recorded history.

Tommy Hutcherson, who owns the community's only grocery store, said the island has mostly bounced back. He's optimistic this storm won't be as destructive.

“But you just never know. I felt the same way about Dorian and we really got smacked,” he said.

Scientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to climate change. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures, and warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.

Bermuda will experience the most severe threat Thursday evening, said Phil Rogers, director of the Bermuda Weather Service. By then, waters could swell up to seven metres.

“Surfers, swimmers and boaters must resist the temptation to go out. The waters will be very dangerous and lives will be placed at risk,” acting Minister of National Security Jache Adams said.

Interested in more careers-related content? Check out our new weekly Work Life newsletter. Sent every Monday afternoon.

I am new to a job managing a team of mostly teenagers and people in their early 20s working in a food service environment. There is definitely a culture here of indifference and doing the bare minimum, which I understand because most of these people are being paid minimum wage and it's a part-time job for them. But I'm getting frustrated at times when having to instruct a staff member to hold the door open for a customer with a stroller or clean up a drink that a customer spilt on their table. How can I motivate them to be more service-minded? 

Simran Sidhu, HR and talent consultant, PocketHR, Toronto

In part-time roles that pay minimum wage, most staff aren't motivated by the job itself. They're motivated by feeling respected, supported and part of a team. So, start by building buy-in rather than just enforcing rules. It's important to explain why things like holding the door or wiping a table matter. Focus less on compliance and more on how these small actions create a better experience for customers and make the workplace feel more human. And when someone does go above the bare minimum, recognize it. A simple kudos or shoutout goes a long way.

Another approach is to give team members small but visible responsibilities. Instead of directing everything, ask someone to be the “go-to” for keeping the front area tidy or for showing new hires the basics of good service. You're helping staff see themselves not just as clocking in, but as people others rely on. This can create a sense of ownership and pride around their work.

Most importantly, lead by example and with enthusiasm. Your attitude and actions set the tone. If you treat customers with warmth and approach even small tasks with care, your team is far more likely to follow suit.

Culture shifts take time. But when people feel valued, supported and understand the ‘why' behind what they're doing, they often rise to the occasion and even start caring more than you expect.

Jarren MacDougall, co-director, Harc Creative Inc., Vancouver

Most people want to do a good job. They just need to know what that looks like and feel supported getting there.

If your team hasn't been shown what excellent service feels like, how can they be expected to deliver it? One thing I've found helpful is taking junior team members to a local business that really has their service dialled in – where customer needs are anticipated and care is seamless. Let them experience what great service feels like. It builds empathy and gives them a clear picture to work from.

Then set clear expectations. Model the tone and behaviour you want to see. Be specific. Holding the door for someone with a stroller isn't always common sense. It's a teachable moment. And motivation often comes after someone feels capable and trusted, not before.

Focus on shaping how your team works together every day. Regular conversations about expectations and feedback can make a big difference.

You could bring in a trainer or offer refreshers over time. And when someone still isn't stepping up, that's when follow-through matters. Sometimes, it's a coaching conversation. Other times, it's recognizing that the person may not be a fit for the role or the team, and making a change.

Kindness and accountability aren't opposites. They work best when they show up together.

What has wheels and crawls along at half a kilometer an hour? A church in Sweden, of course! A convoy of remote-controlled flatbed trailers is transporting a 113-year-old church to the new city center of Kiruna.

What happens when the world's largest underground iron ore mine threatens to swallow the town? You relocate, of course, starting with the century-old church.

Sweden on Tuesday began two days of relocating one of its most famous wooden churches, moving the 113-year-old Kiruna Church about 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) down the road to a new city center to allow for the expansion of an underground iron ore mine.

The 672-ton Lutheran church, often voted Sweden's most beautiful building, was lifted onto a convoy of remote-controlled flatbed trailers.

At least 10,000 people are expected to be in attendance for this historic event in the town of 18,000 people to see the church chugging along at a pace of half-a-kilometer an hour.

Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf will be among the attendees to witness the slow march of the church.

The operation is part of a decadeslong project to move much of the Arctic town of Kiruna after mining weakened the ground beneath its historic center.

Mine operator LKAB is financing the relocation of the church estimated at 500 million kronor (€45 million, $52 million), for which it also had to get the roads widened to accommodate the church.

Broadcaster SVT will be streaming the slow-moving spectacle live, calling it ""The Great Church Walk,"" with Sweden's 2025 Eurovision entry, KAJ, performing for the crowds.

""The church is Kiruna's soul in some way, and in some way it's a safe place,"" Lena Tjarnberg, the vicar of Kiruna, told Reuters news agency. ""For me, it's like a day of joy. But I think people also feel sad because we have to leave this place.""

Designed by Swedish architect Gustaf Wickman, the 40 meters (131 feet) tall structure includes designs inspired by the region's indigenous Sami people on the pews.

While the move has been celebrated as an awe-inspiring feat of engineering, the feelings are not the same for the Sami community, which has herded reindeer there for thousands of years.

They warn that the mine's further expansion threatens traditional migration routes of the animal and fear this will imperil the livelihood of indigenous herders in the area.

Around 3,000 homes and about 6,000 people will need to move as part of the relocation, LKAB said.

Far more big names have left the Bundesliga this offseason than have come to Germany's top football league. So does the Bundesliga have a problem?

There is no denying that the Bundesliga has experienced a significant loss of talent over the summer.  Florian Wirtz has moved from Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool; Bayern Munich legend Thomas Müller chose to wind down his career at the Vancouver Whitecaps, and Kingsley Coman, who  scored the winner in the final the last time Bayern won the Champions League in 2020, has moved on to Al-Nassr of the Saudi Pro League.

Each move had its own logic: The 22-year-old Wirtz was looking to take the next step in his career, while the now-35-year-old Müller chose Vancouver, a city regularly ranked as one of the best places in the world to live, after sliding down the pecking order at Bayern. Coman, 29, stands to increase his already generous annual income from a reported €17 million ($19.8 million) to around €20 million – net.

However, viewed collectively, these three transfers are symptomatic of an issue for the Bundesliga. In return, only one player with a global profile has moved to Germany from abroad; Colombian forward Luis Diaz, joined Bayern from Liverpool.

This came after Bayern had failed in its attempts to lure a number of other stars to Munich, including Wirtz and Spanish youngster Nico Williams, who elected to extend his contract with Athletic Bilbao rather than join the serial German champions. Bayern sporting director Max Eberl bristles at the suggestion that this could more than just a blip.

""Anyone who claims that FC Bayern has lost its international appeal for top stars doesn't know the market,"" Eberl told the ""Sport-Bild"" weekly.

""FC Bayern can get any player it wants if it is willing to pay the asking price.""

Former Bayern chairman Oliver Kahn, though, is sounding the alarm, saying the Bundesliga has long since lost its prestige and that its supposed appeal is ""deceptive.""

""The Premier League and La Liga stand out clearly,"" Kahn told ""Kicker"" magazine. ""Everyone knows the stars and teams.""

The fact that Florian Wirtz decided against Bayern and for Liverpool should also give us food for thought, said the former Bayern and Germany goalkeeper.

""This shows that the Premier League has established itself as an exceptional player, not only in sporting terms but also in terms of business. It's the most exciting place to be if you want to compete at the highest level – sportingly, financially, and media-wise.""

In sporting terms, the Bundesliga has lost ground in Europe. In the past decade, German clubs have only won two major international titles: Bayern Munich won in the Champions League in 2020, and Eintracht Frankfurt the Europa League in 2022.

In the five-year ranking of European football's governing body UEFA, which reflects the performance of club teams, the Bundesliga currently ranks only fourth behind the Premier League, Serie A, and La Liga.

Financially, things don't look quite as bleak. According to the German Football League (DFL), which operates the Bundesliga, the league generated record revenue of €4.8 billion in the 2023-34 season. This was good enough for second place in Europe – but well behind the Premier League, which generated €7.4 billion.

The Premier League is also in the driver's seat in terms of revenue from television rights. In the 2025-26 season, the division's 20 clubs, will collect around €1.95 billion. In the Bundesliga, the TV revenue totals €1.12 billion and is distributed among the 36 clubs in the Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2.

For years, the Bundesliga boasted the highest attendance figures in Europe. But here, too, the Premier League is now in first place. Last season, the average attendance in the English top flight was 40,474, while in the Bundesliga, it was 38,662. Attendance in Bundesliga stadiums is declining overall. The total number of spectators fell from 13.1 million in the 2022-23 season to 12.1 million in 2023-24 and 11.8 million in 2024-25.

Among the others sounding the alarm is another former national team player, Matthias Sammer, who won Euro 96 with Germany and was named 1996 European Footballer of the Year.

""When I watch German football right now, I ask myself the question: What does German football actually stand for today?"" Sammer told ""Kicker.""

""I can't see it."" German football must ""again learn not to try to sell average as world class.""

Should the Bundesliga fail to heed Sammer's words, even more stars are bound to leave.

Let's be clear, there is no “guarantee” from Russian dictator Vladimir Putin that will ensure he does not invade Ukraine again.

Ukrainian officials well remember in 1994 former Russian leader Boris Yeltsin pledging that Russia would respect Ukraine's national boundaries in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear arsenal. Since then, Ukraine has been invaded by Russian forces twice, in 2014 and in 2022, while it was subject to Russian political warfare from 2005 to 2013, corrupting the country's business, political and security elites.

Already, Russia is trying to throw a spanner into the progress that was made at Monday's talks in the White House. Russia's Foreign Ministry said that it would reject “any scenarios” involving Nato troops in Ukraine, threatening, in a now predictable way, “uncontrolled escalation” with “unpredictable consequences”. So much for Western boots on the ground – even if the Americans are involved, as Trump suggested would be possible yesterday.

The Foreign Ministry also seemed determined to drive a wedge between the US and UK, claiming that Britain was undermining talks. The level of mind games and psychological warfare emanating from Moscow has been extraordinary. It's generally known as reflexive control, a theory of psychological manipulation whereby your target does your bidding while all the while believing himself to be in control of his actions. The Russians clearly believe that it has an effect.

Having hooked Trump on the idea of a deal, the Kremlin is now trying to dictate terms, and will steadily try to unpick Western red lines to isolate Ukraine from its allies and the US from Europe. Russia's negotiation tactics are to divide and conquer. That process started at the Alaska summit, when Putin ran circles around Donald Trump. Despite rolling out the red carpet for the Russian dictator, Trump again ended up repeating Putin's talking points, as if it was Ukraine's fault for being invaded and Russia the victim. It's apt that George Orwell's Animal Farm, that cautionary allegorical novel about the corruption of power and truth in Soviet Russia, was published 80 years ago this week.

It's clear what Putin wants; more strategically valuable Ukrainian land and with it at least three cities that it would take years for Russian troops to conquer, if at all, and which could be used as a potentially strategic springboard should there be another round of the war. If Ukraine accepts, millions would have to be evacuated. They will not want to live under Russian brutal occupation, with its lawless brutality and rapacious secret police. Putin will refuse Nato troops. He will build up his forces again.

Putin has studied Western leadership and considers it to be short-termist, weak and unwilling to stand up to protect what it believes in. Western deterrence no longer deters. Putin believes he has strategic patience, and can wear down Ukraine and the West over time. How many of the Western leaders who were negotiating in Washington will be in place in five years?

Should any peace deal hold, Russia would undoubtedly do what it is now trying to do in Georgia and Moldova, using Kremlin-friendly oligarchs and leaders to undermine the independence of those states and bring them gradually into Moscow's orbit. While we don't see political, economic and information conflict as a form of war, Russian military doctrine does. Conflict is about the use of military and non-military tactics to bend an adversary to your will.

In such a case, the Ukraine conflict would not have ended but merely moved to a new phase.

I have many Ukrainian friends. Almost all have lost someone close. Others daily pray for the relatives on the frontlines. Ukraine's army, like Russia's, is tired. It is easy to be brave with someone else's life. For their sake, I hope there is at the very least a ceasefire, preferably a lasting peace. It will take years to rebuild the mental and physical damage of this war.

But despite the bonhomie and faux positivity at the White House, it remains difficult to see a road to lasting peace. Any final deal, Trump has said, will rest with talks between Putin and Zelensky, which he now says he is going to arrange. Putin has thus far only shown himself willing to accept a deal that leaves Ukraine vulnerable to Russia's predatory gaze and its murderous army. He refuses to see Zelensky as an equal and Ukraine as a nation.

Up till now at least, Ukrainians have reluctantly said, better no peace than a bad peace. On their behalf, Zelensky now faces a dilemma that may save his nation – or condemn it to future destruction.

HUD's deputy secretary says the agency will speak in “one language” to fulfill its mission to help those in need.

In an effort to advance the Trump administration's white supremacist, anti-immigrant agenda, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will only produce materials in English, according to an internal memo obtained by the New York Post. 

“All HUD communications, correspondence, and physical and digital published materials will be produced exclusively in English,” the memo states. The agency will also “no longer offer non-English translation services.”

The memo, authored by HUD deputy secretary Andrew Hughes, directed staff to “immediately remove all printed or digital collateral about non-English translation services currently displayed in HUD offices or HUD-funded facilities.” 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

The memo continued: “HUD will continue to ensure that all persons have meaningful access to HUD programs and services” and that the agency “will continue to provide communication services to the hearing and seeing impaired, and persons with related disabilities.”

“We are one people, united, and we will speak with one voice and one language to deliver on our mission of expanding housing that is affordable, helping those in need, caring for our most vulnerable Americans, and revitalizing rural, tribal, and urban communities,” Hughes wrote.

The federal housing agency administers housing assistance and community development programs, and works to ensure compliance with local, state, and federal laws that prohibit discrimination in housing. 

According to the Post, Hughes's directive was created in response to the president's executive order designating English as the official language of the United States, although the order did not require agencies “to amend, remove, or otherwise stop production of documents, products, or other services prepared or offered in languages other than English.” 

It seems likely that other agencies will follow HUD's lead as Congress has confirmed Trump loyalists to head up numerous federal agencies, such as HUD Secretary Scott Turner, who has said “government dependency” is to blame for “perpetual homelessness.” In April, he posted on social media: “Helping our nation's most vulnerable starts with giving them the tools they need to achieve self-sufficiency, not endless government handouts.”

As part of the same executive order, Trump rescinded a 25-year-old presidential directive that had required federal agencies and recipients of federal funding provide people with “Limited English Proficiency” (LEP) access to services and programs. Under the directive, refusing to do so would constitute a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans discrimination on the basis of national origin.

In July, the Department of Justice (DOJ) rescinded “all prior guidance” to federal funding recipients regarding the Civil Rights Act's “prohibition against national origin discrimination affecting limited English proficient persons.” 

However, people with LEP are still protected by state and federal anti-discrimination laws, as well as statutes that require programs to provide translation services and multilingual materials. 

“Federal civil rights laws, like Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, remain unchanged,” the National Immigration Forum pointed out in its analysis of Trump's order and DOJ's memo, which was published prior to HUD's memo. “[I]t is still illegal for recipients of federal funding to discriminate based on national origin and use language as a vehicle to do so.”

The National Immigration Law Center's analysis also emphasized the rights of people with LEP: “Everyone still retains a legal right to obtain language assistance, such as qualified interpreters and translated documents from recipients of federal funding.” 

While significant protections still exist, plenty of damage may still be done to the more than 25 million people who have difficulty communicating in English.

“[L]ifting language access requirements means that agencies now have the freedom to rethink their policies around the services that they offer,” the National Immigration Forum said. “Without language support, non-English speakers may be effectively barred from critical government services, such as accessing healthcare or educational resources to learn English, or interfere with their ability to vote, making their ability to adapt and assimilate into the U.S. much more difficult.”

Over the objections of several local officials, an immigration jail has opened at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.

Despite local opposition, the Trump administration has opened what's expected to be the largest immigration jail in the country, on the grounds of the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas. In addition to Fort Bliss, the Trump administration also plans to detain immigrants on military bases in New Jersey and Indiana.

On August 18, Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), whose district includes most of El Paso and part of Fort Bliss, was the first federal lawmaker to conduct an oversight tour of the jail, which is expected to eventually hold about 5,000 people. 

At a press conference held outside the jail, Escobar told reporters that she did not speak with any of the approximately 1,000 people detained at the “massive tent city.” The jail, known as Camp East Montana, contains “a very highly sophisticated medical unit,” hard floors, and walls that don't reach the ceiling.

However, Escobar said she remains concerned about conditions at the privately-run jail. For-profit lock-ups, she said, “far too frequently are operating with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Advocates have raised concerns about how the area's punishing climate — extreme heat and sandstorms — will affect people held at the base. 

“People detained there will almost certainly have their basic rights violated while caged in tents under the brutal West Texas sun, with extreme heat that puts their lives at risk,” said Savannah Kumar, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Texas. “This is not just dangerous — it's cruel. We will continue to monitor the operation of Fort Bliss so that this human and civil rights catastrophe is neither hidden from the public nor ignored by those in power.”

This is not the first time immigrants have been held at the military base. Under President Joe Biden, immigrant children were detained at Fort Bliss in a shelter for unaccompanied minors run by Health and Human Services. Whistleblowers said the children were held in crowded tents filled with sand and dust, and supervised by people who did not speak Spanish, did not interact with them, and had no experience in childcare. The whistleblowers' attorneys said that “the conditions they witnessed caused physical, mental and emotional harm affecting dozens of children.” 

The contract for building and operating the jail, reportedly valued at more than a billion dollars, went to the Acquisition Logistics Company. 

The Richmonder reported that the company's headquarters is listed as a residential house in Richmond, Virginia. Their investigation also revealed that, prior to the Fort Bliss deal, the company had received just over $48 million in federal contract and grant funding since it was founded in 2008, with the majority of its funding coming from contracts with the Department of Defense. The company's lackluster website states, “Site maintenance in progress.” 

The construction of the new jail faced widespread opposition from human rights groups and local elected officials. El Paso County Commissioner Jackie Butler introduced a resolution opposing the facility, which passed unanimously.

“The people of El Paso deserve transparency when a billion-dollar, taxpayer-funded facility is placed in their backyard,” Butler said. “We don't know who will staff this facility. We don't know how detainees will be treated. And we don't know how our local law enforcement, infrastructure, and community services will be affected. That's unacceptable.”

Escobar said that money spent on the jail could have funded services that would benefit the El Paso community. 

“If it was spent on access to child care, if it was spent on universal pre-K, if it was spent on health care,” she said. “There is a tremendous amount of good that money could do for El Paso but it is instead being used to fund mass deportation by the Trump administration.”

A decade ago, planners in Beijing unveiled Made in China 2025, an ambitious scheme to take leadership of the industries of the future. The plan identified ten sectors for investment, including energy, semiconductors, industrial automation, and high-tech materials. It aimed to upgrade China's manufacturing in these sectors and others, reduce the country's dependence on imports and foreign firms, and improve the competitiveness of Chinese companies in global markets. The overarching goal was to transform China into a technological leader and turn China's national champion firms into global ones. The government backed this vision with enormous financial support, spending one to two percent of GDP each year on direct and indirect subsidies, cheap credit, and tax breaks.

China has been wildly successful in these efforts. It not only leads the world in electric vehicles and clean technology power generation; it is also dominant in drones, industrial automation, and other electronics products. Its lock on rare-earth magnets produced a quick trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. Chinese firms are on track to master the more sophisticated technological goods produced by the United States, Europe, and other parts of Asia.

And yet China's model still has many skeptics. Lavish funding, they point out, has led to waste and corruption. It has created industries in which dozens of competitors manufacture similar products and struggle to make a profit. The resulting deflation makes companies wary of hiring new staff or raising wages, leading to lower consumer confidence and weaker growth. China's economy, which once looked poised to overtake the United States' as the world's biggest, is mired in a slowdown and may never match the American one in total output.

These problems are not trivial. But it is a serious error to think they are big enough to derail China's technological momentum. Beijing's industrial policy succeeded not simply because planners picked the right sectors and subsidized them. It worked because the state built out the deep infrastructure needed to become a resilient technological powerhouse. It created an innovation ecosystem centered on powerful electricity and digital networks, and it established a massive workforce with advanced manufacturing knowledge. Call it an all-of-the-above technology strategy. This approach has enabled China to develop new technologies and scale them up faster than any other country. Its model is unlikely to be pushed off course by sluggish economic growth or U.S. sanctions.

China's industrial and technological strength is now a permanent feature of the world economy. The United States should compete with China to keep its overall technological leadership and sustain the industries needed for broad-based prosperity and national security. But American policymakers must recognize that their current playbook—export controls, tariffs, and scattershot industrial policy—is ineffective. Simply trying to slow China down will not work. Washington must instead focus on building up its own systems of industrial strength by making patient, long-term investments not just in select, key industries but in energy, information, and transportation infrastructure. If it doesn't, the United States will face more deindustrialization and lose its technological leadership.

The notoriously difficult Nürburgring racetrack is nicknamed the Green Hell for its twisting, 13-mile course through the mountains in western Germany. It is a track that tests even the steeliest drivers and the most advanced vehicles. The cars that have typically performed best are designed by celebrated German companies such as BMW, Porsche, and Mercedes, or by long-established manufacturers in Italy, Japan, and South Korea.

But in June 2025, the course saw a new speed record for electric vehicles, and the car that set it was not made by the typical champions. It was set by Xiaomi, a Chinese company better known for its moderately priced smartphones and rice cookers. It produced its first car only a year before. But Xiaomi nonetheless made the third-fastest car—electric or otherwise—ever to race through the Green Hell.

Xiaomi's triumph on the racetrack was a symbol of China's surprisingly swift rise to clean energy dominance. China made nearly three-quarters of the world's electric vehicles in 2024 and accounted for 40 percent of global EV exports. It has a lock on the solar supply chain. Chinese companies make most of the world's batteries, both for EVs and for other uses. And the country produces 60 percent of the electrolyzers used to extract hydrogen from water, which is the most effective way to produce clean hydrogen-based power.



The standard explanation for China's technological success is that the central government targeted various industries for support; provided hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, tax breaks, and low-interest loans to get these sectors going; and helped Chinese firms steal or copy technology from other states. This is part of what took place. But that story misses the bigger picture. China succeeded not only because it subsidized particular industries but also because it invested in the deep infrastructure—underlying physical systems and human expertise—that enables innovation and efficient production.

Some of this infrastructure consists of transportation systems, such as roads, railways, and ports. Over the last 30 years, China has built a national expressway network twice the length of the American interstate system, a high-speed train network with more miles of track than the rest of the world combined, and a formidable network of ports, the largest of which, in Shanghai, moves more cargo in some years than all U.S. ports put together.

But if China had stopped there, it would not have reached today's technological heights. Other infrastructure systems have proved crucial. One is China's digital network. In its infancy, the Internet was widely thought to corrode authoritarian regimes because it removed their monopoly on information and made it easier for ordinary people to organize across large distances. In 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared that controlling the Internet was like “trying to nail Jell-O to a wall.” But China's leadership concluded the opposite. They bet that high-quality data infrastructure would strengthen the government by enabling it to better monitor and manage public opinion, as well as track people's movements, while hugely benefiting the country's industrial sectors and creating a high-tech ecosystem.

So China nailed Jell-O to the wall. It built a domestic Internet that rapidly connected virtually the entire population while blocking what its people could see from abroad. The gamble paid off. Thanks to Beijing's early and aggressive promotion of mobile phones, Chinese firms helped pioneer the mobile Internet. Top platforms such as Byte-Dance, Alibaba, and Tencent became world-class innovators. Huawei became the world's leading producer of 5G equipment. The Chinese population now uses smartphones constantly, and the Communist Party remains very much in charge.

The next key infrastructure system behind China's prowess is its electric grid. Over the past quarter century, China has led the world in building power plants, adding the equivalent of the United Kingdom's total supply every year. It now generates more electricity each year than the United States and the European Union combined. The country has invested heavily in ultrahigh voltage transmission lines, which can carry electricity efficiently over long distances, and in all types of battery storage. This abundant power supply has enabled the rapid growth of electricity-reliant transport systems, namely high-speed rail and electric vehicles.

China has overcome the obstacles that long prevented electricity from becoming the world's main energy and supplanting the direct combustion of fossil fuels: that it was hard to move, hard to store, and ineffective at fueling transport. As a result, China is well on its way to becoming the world's first economy powered mainly by electricity. Electricity accounts for 21 percent of energy use in the world as a whole and 22 percent of energy use in the United States. In China, electricity is nearly 30 percent of energy use, more than in any other large country except Japan. And this share is growing fast: about six percent a year, compared with 2.6 percent for the world as a whole and 0.6 percent for the United States.

China's electrification did not arise out of a master plan. Instead, it was the product of technocratic responses to discrete issues such as power shortages in industrial zones and the need to free up rail capacity for purposes other than moving coal. Now, however, rapid electrification serves a clear strategic purpose. It is a motor of industrial innovation—“powering the future,” as Damien Ma and Lizzi Lee put it in a July Foreign Affairs article. And the government is keenly aware that abundant, cheap electricity provides the country with a crucial edge in the power-intensive industries of the future, most obviously artificial intelligence. Beijing thus strives to ensure that its electricity system remains the biggest and best in the world.



China's most subtle piece of deep infrastructure is its more than 70-million-person industrial workforce—the largest in the world. Thanks to the country's intense buildup of complex manufacturing supply chains, Chinese factory managers, engineers, and workers have decades of “process knowledge”—hands-on knowledge, gained from experience—about how to make things and how to make them better. This process knowledge enables iterative innovation, or constantly tweaking products so that they can be made more efficiently, at better quality, and with lower costs. It also enables scaling: Chinese factories can rally a large, experienced workforce behind making almost any new product. Finally, and most important, process knowledge allows China to create entire new industries. A factory worker in Shenzhen might assemble iPhones one year and Huawei Mate phones the next and then move on to build drones for DJI or electric vehicle batteries for CATL.

Process knowledge in the Chinese workforce may be Beijing's greatest economic asset. But it is hard to quantify. That is one reason why the rest of the world has persistently underestimated China's capabilities. Some analysts believe that China is the country that assembles most of the world's smartphones and other electronics because its workforce costs are low. In reality, the country remains the world's leader because its workforce has proved its worth in sophistication, scale, and speed.

Analysts also miss the red-hot ambition of China's entrepreneurs. The country is full of businesspeople with the optimism, the daring, or the foolishness to try disrupting sectors. Xiaomi's legendary founder, Lei Jun, gambled on EVs in 2021, announcing that his company, then valued at $80 billion, would invest $10 billion in them and that it would be his “last major entrepreneurial project.” On the German racetrack, it paid off. Lei was able to plug into an electronics ecosystem, battery partners, and an experienced workforce to make high-speed EVs in just a few years' time.

To see why American companies often struggle to do the same, compare Xiaomi's experience with that of Apple. In 2014, the computing giant considered developing electric vehicles. It was hardly a crazy idea. Apple had a market capitalization of $600 billion and a cash hoard of $40 billion, giving it far deeper pockets than Xiaomi. By conventional measures, it also had greater technological sophistication. But the United States does not have the energy system or the manufacturing capacity of China, so there was no easy infrastructure for Apple to tap into. As a result, in 2024, the company's board pulled the plug on a decade of EV development. That same year, Xiaomi expanded its manufacturing capacity and repeatedly raised its delivery target. Meanwhile, the American EV champion, Tesla, faces declining sales in all of its top markets, including China. Chinese buyers now believe that domestic brands are more innovative than Tesla, and more in tune with fast-changing consumer tastes.

It is a mistake to underestimate China. But the country does face serious economic challenges, many of which arise at least in part from the very industrial policies that have led to its triumphs. China's technocrats have steered resources not just into high-productivity infrastructure but also into state-owned enterprises that contribute little to the country's vibrant tech ecosystem, rack up huge debts, and drag down the economy's efficiency. The politically driven constraints on some of the country's most creative entrepreneurs, such as Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, and Zhang Yiming, the co-founder of Byte-Dance—who were humiliated when Beijing expanded its power over the consumer Internet—have chilled private-sector confidence.

Unregulated subsidies, meanwhile, have led to widespread graft. A prime example is China's semiconductor industry, which has received over $100 billion in direct state industrial policy support since 2014. Some of the projects funded by this money were outright frauds. Other projects were legitimate, but both businesspeople and government officials stole from them. More than a dozen senior chip industry figures have been jailed for corruption since 2022, including the head of Tsinghua Unigroup (which operates several important chipmakers) and the chief of China's national integrated circuit fund. Two sitting ministers of industry and information technology were fired for graft.

China's subsidies may also, at times, suppress innovation. Generous manufacturing spending helps promote the tech ecosystem, but it also enables less efficient firms to stay in business far longer than they would in a more market-driven economy. That lowers profits for everyone, as companies continually cut their prices to maintain market share. This, in turn, means that manufacturing companies cannot spend as much on research and development. In fact, they need to be cautious about hiring new staff or raising wages.



The solar industry is a case in point. Owning the solar supply chain is a strategic triumph for the state, but companies producing solar modules mostly sell undifferentiated products, fighting for minuscule profits while cutting prices to the bone. The same is true for manufacturers of EVs, smartphones, and many other products, with too many companies making similar products at paper-thin margins. China's tech sectors are global success stories, but the companies in them are often miserable.

If China is too generous with tech and manufacturing businesses, then it is not generous enough with those providing services. Beijing chronically overregulates service sectors, cracking down on Internet companies that the government sees as engaging in monopolistic practices or threatening political or social instability. It tightly controls finance, health care, and education. As a result, job growth in these sectors has been weak, which means job growth in China as a whole has greatly suffered. Even in this industry-centric country, services employ about 60 percent of the urban workforce and have accounted for all net job creation in the past decade. With jobs hard to come by, wages rising little or at all, and the price of houses—which are most Chinese people's main asset—falling, Chinese consumers have become reluctant to spend. Private businesses, seeing weak demand, have in turn become even more reluctant to hire or raise wages.

China's current model, then, virtually guarantees slower economic growth. Thanks to the vicious circle Beijing has created, the economy now routinely struggles to reach its annual growth target of five percent and is constantly battling deflation. Meanwhile, because domestic demand is sluggish, more and more of the output of China's prodigiously productive manufacturing sector will need to be exported, leading to ever larger trade surpluses. China's trade surplus is already almost a trillion dollars, more than double the figure of just five years earlier.



The risks for Beijing are obvious. Slower growth means that the economy could become less dynamic, and tech firms could lose the ability or drive to keep innovating. Ever-rising trade surpluses could trigger much more severe and coordinated protectionism from the rest of the world, with dozens of countries joining the United States in erecting tariff barriers to Chinese imports.

But Beijing is likely to overcome these risks, just as it has overcome many challenges in the past. It has begun to recognize that subsidies are too high and has started withdrawing them. Smaller and less efficient players will exit the market. Consolidation is already visible in the electric vehicle sector, in which the number of companies has fallen from 57 to 49 since 2022. A third of EV producers now sell at least 10,000 cars a month, up from less than a quarter of producers three years ago. As for protectionism, most countries will find that there are simply no cost-effective alternatives to the products China exports. There are also ways to evade tariff barriers, such as by shipping goods through third countries or by setting up assembly plants in other states (as the Chinese car manufacturer BYD is doing in Brazil and Hungary).

Chinese officials, for their part, seem to believe that the costs of lower growth, deflation, and irritated trade partners are worth paying. “We must recognize the fundamental importance of the real economy . . . and never deindustrialize,” said Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2020, a year in which China's manufacturers met the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic by surging the production of medical equipment and consumer goods. The message was clear: Beijing's main goal is not fast growth but self-sufficiency and technological progress.

Washington has not stood idly by as China's tech and manufacturing sectors progress. Alarmed by the ambitions of Made in China 2025, the first Trump administration breathed life into some of the most moribund offices inside the Department of Commerce, summoning a powerful bureaucratic apparatus to choke off China's access to critical materials. U.S. officials realized that China was highly dependent on Western technology inputs, such as leading-edge semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. They thus gambled that a full blockade of these technologies would severely slow China's technological engine. This was a bipartisan proposition: when U.S. President Joe Biden came into office, in 2021, he maintained his predecessor's restrictions. In fact, the Biden administration tightened export controls on advanced chips, especially those essential for artificial intelligence, and on semiconductor equipment.

And yet the success of these controls has been mixed at best. In 2018, two big Chinese tech companies, ZTE and Fujian Jinhua, nearly collapsed after being cut off from American technology. But more capable businesses, aided by Washington lawyers and lobbyists, have been able to bounce back. (Trump recently lifted restrictions on leading-edge AI chips made by Nvidia, allowing the company to again sell its products to China.) Huawei was clearly battered after the Commerce Department sanctioned it in 2019. But by 2025, the firm announced that its previous year's revenues had recovered to 2019 levels. It is still recognizably the same company, one that excels at making 5G equipment and handsets. Except now, it is also one of China's leading semiconductor innovators, after it invested billions in replacing American chips.

Other companies have done an even better job of weathering U.S. restrictions. SMIC, one of China's most important chip foundries, has doubled its revenues since it was sanctioned in 2020. It still lags far behind the industry-leading TSMC in profitability, but it has made certain technological breakthroughs, learning to produce seven-nanometer chips—a technological breakthrough that was considered unlikely after its sanctions. Similarly, restrictions on AI technology did little to prevent the rise of DeepSeek, which has produced an AI reasoning model matched by only a few other firms, all in Silicon Valley.



DeepSeek's success is not hard to understand. Chinese AI firms may not have access to the same leading-edge chips that American ones do, but they do have plentiful access to excellent talent, mature chips, as well as pools of data. They also have a near-unlimited supply of cheap electricity—something their U.S. competitors lack. As a result, according to global technical benchmarks, Chinese large language models are, at most, six months behind American leaders, a gap that is steadily shrinking. Far from blocking China's progress, U.S. tech restrictions have triggered a Sputnik moment in China. Its companies are bigger, meaner, and significantly less dependent on U.S. companies than they were just a decade earlier.

Some American officials realize that the United States cannot win just by attacking China's industries. The Biden administration's economic planners, for instance, created an industrial policy designed to help the United States advance its own strategic sectors. The country passed the CHIPS Act, which beefed up semiconductor production, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which subsidized clean technologies. But despite earmarking hundreds of billions of dollars, these endeavors have mostly foundered.

The reason for these failures is simple. The United States has not built up enough deep infrastructure of its own. Toward the beginning of his term, Biden unveiled an ambitious proposal to deliver Internet service to almost every American. But this “Internet for All” plan had not connected anyone before he left office. There is still no national network of EV charging stations, even though Congress earmarked billions to create one. And Washington has failed to dismantle the bureaucratic and regulatory barriers to building electric transmission systems, which make it hard for energy companies to take advantage of the tax credits the Inflation Reduction Act created for solar and wind projects.



Now, those credits are poised to disappear. Trump's July budget reconciliation bill phases out his predecessor's solar and wind subsidies for most projects that haven't begun by the end of 2026. The CHIPS Act remains on the books, but the president has derided the law as “horrible” and “ridiculous.” Trump's tariffs, meanwhile, have caused deep uncertainty among manufacturers, who are pausing investments while scrambling to maintain their supply chains. The White House claims that the tariffs will force manufacturers to make their goods on American soil once the restrictions take full effect. But the administration's analysis is faulty. Manufacturers depend on imports for many of their inputs, and they have proved reluctant to make big investment decisions based on Trump's wavering pronouncements. In fact, the country shed over 10,000 manufacturing jobs between April and July alone, just after Trump announced his plan to impose high tariffs on virtually every country.

Trump, of course, is hardly unique in his failure to deliver. American politicians love to celebrate whenever a new mine or semiconductor facility opens. But the U.S. industrial sector continues to shrink amid product delays, layoffs, and falling production quality. Real manufacturing output, which had risen steadily until the 2008 financial crisis, plunged then and has never recovered. This shriveling is happening even in defense manufacturing. Despite an influx of cash, almost every class of U.S. naval ship under construction is behind schedule, some by as much as three years. Producers of artillery shells are only slowly ramping up manufacturing, even though Washington has depleted its stockpiles to help Ukraine. And U.S. efforts to wean its military off Chinese rare-earth minerals have faltered.

The United States does retain its advantage over China in several critical areas: software, biotech, and AI, as well as in its university-driven innovation ecosystem. But these institutions face an uncertain future. Since returning to office, Trump has set about defunding scientific research and depriving the country of skilled labor. Government agencies are now scrutinizing top universities, including Harvard and Columbia, and yanking government grants and threatening to revoke universities' tax-exempt status over exaggerated charges of anti-Semitism. The White House has slashed funding for the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Meanwhile, Trump's hostility toward immigrants has driven researchers who would come to the United States to look for positions at companies and universities elsewhere. Aggressive deportations are hurting America's construction industry. The country simply has not set up its innovation ecosystem well for the years ahead.

The United States can, and should, reverse Trump's spending cuts and immigration restrictions as soon as is feasible. But competing effectively against China requires more than just removing self-imposed restraints. Washington's failings extend across administrations for a reason: American officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, have not taken China's competence seriously. “China doesn't innovate—it steals,” wrote Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton on social media in April, epitomizing how Americans trivialize Chinese accomplishments. Too many U.S. leaders continue to believe that a more exquisite export control regime will halt China's technological momentum. They are sending lawyers into an engineering fight. They need to realize that no matter how hard the United States squeezes, it will not break China's industrial and technological system.

What Washington should do is strengthen its own capacity. That means starting the hard work of building up the United States' deep infrastructure. Washington should not try to replicate Beijing's massive and often wasteful investments in all systems. But it should do better than Biden's ad-hoc, sector-by-sector approach. And it must abandon Trump's strategy of hoping that the tariff cudgel will force a reshoring of industry, and his focus on old heavy industries such as steel.

Instead, policymakers must start to think in ecosystem terms, as China has. The United States has long-standing strengths in entrepreneurship and finance, so state-led investments in modern deep infrastructure are likely to have big payoffs, just as investments in railroads and highways did in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Large-scale infrastructure projects can stimulate demand for different technologies and create the process knowledge needed to build them, which are crucial first steps in rebuilding the manufacturing base. A top priority should be building a bigger and better electricity system that makes use of nuclear power, natural gas, and renewable energy sources. To maximize its use of renewables, the United States should invest in building more battery storage and high-voltage transmission lines.



The United States will also need to find ways to reduce cost structures throughout its industries. Because it is a rich country with high wages and labor and environmental standards, it will never be able to compete with China or India in terms of availability of low-cost labor, and it should not try. But to be serious about rebuilding industry, Washington must display a commitment to making its markets attractive for capital-intensive sectors. Eliminating Trump's ruinous tariffs, which will make American manufacturing prohibitively expensive, is essential, as is providing abundant, cheap energy. Yet so is permitting reform that eliminates the excessive regulatory costs of new construction, ample government funding for basic research and development, and liberal immigration policies that enable companies to source the best talent from anywhere in the world. The last is not strictly a cost measure, but it is essential to rebuilding U.S. process knowledge. Much of that knowledge now exists abroad, and the United States must be willing to import it.

Above all, Washington should not underestimate what it is up against. Beijing has made achieving technological supremacy a top political priority. The subsidies it used to push technological progress produced plenty of waste, but that was a side-effect of achieving leadership in the industries of the future. To compete, the United States must also make a commitment to leading in these industries, and it must be more willing to accept mistakes and some waste as the price of success.

China's model has worked because its policymakers have gotten a lot of things right and have given Chinese entrepreneurs the conditions for success. The country may have problems, but it will continue to be effective. And the longer it succeeds, the more the United States and its allies will deindustrialize under pressure from Chinese firms in energy, industrial goods, and perhaps even artificial intelligence. If the United States is to compete effectively, its policymakers must spend less time worrying about how to weaken their rival and more time figuring out how to make their country the best and most vigorous version of itself.

 Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman

   

When Washington announced a “framework deal” with China in June, it marked a silent shifting of gears in the global political economy. This was not the beginning of U.S. President Donald Trump's imagined epoch of “liberation” under unilateral American greatness or a return to the Biden administration's dream of managed great-power rivalry. Instead, it was the true opening of the age of weaponized interdependence, in which the United States is discovering what it is like to have others do unto it as it has eagerly done unto others.

This new era will be shaped by weapons of economic and technological coercion—sanctions, supply chain attacks, and export measures—that repurpose the many points of control in the infrastructure that underpins the interdependent global economy. For over two decades, the United States has unilaterally weaponized these chokepoints in finance, information flows, and technology for strategic advantage. But market exchange has become hopelessly entangled with national security, and the United States must now defend its interests in a world in which other powers can leverage chokepoints of their own.

That is why the Trump administration had to make a deal with China. Administration officials now acknowledge that they made concessions on semiconductor export controls in return for China's easing restrictions on rare-earth minerals that were crippling the United States' auto industry. U.S. companies that provide chip design software, such as Synopsys and Cadence, can once again sell their technology in China. This concession will help the Chinese semiconductor industry wriggle out of the bind it found itself in when the Biden administration started limiting China's ability to build advanced semiconductors. And the U.S. firm Nvidia can again sell H20 chips for training artificial intelligence to Chinese customers.

In a little-noticed speech in June, Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted at the administration's reasoning. China had “cornered the market” for rare earths, putting the United States and the world in a “crunch,” he said. The administration had come to realize “that our industrial capability is deeply dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China, who can hold it over our head,” shifting the “nature of geopolitics,” in “one of the great challenges of the new century.”

Although Rubio emphasized self-reliance as a solution, the administration's rush to make a deal demonstrates the limits of going it alone. The United States is ratcheting back its own threats to persuade adversaries not to cripple vital parts of the U.S. economy. Other powers, too, are struggling to figure out how to advance their interests in a world in which economic power and national security are merging, and economic and technological integration have turned from a promise to a threat.

Washington had to remake its national security state after other countries developed the atomic bomb; in a similar way, it will have to rebuild its economic security state for a world in which adversaries and allies can also weaponize interdependence. In short, economic weapons are proliferating just as nuclear weapons did, creating new dilemmas for the United States and other powers. China has adapted to this new world with remarkable speed; other powers, such as European countries, have struggled. All will have to update their strategic thinking about how their own doctrines and capabilities intersect with the doctrines and capabilities of other powers, and how businesses, which have their own interests and capabilities, will respond.

The problem for the United States is that the Trump administration is gutting the very resources that it needs to advance U.S. interests and protect against countermoves. In the nuclear age, the United States made historic investments in the institutions, infrastructure, and weapons systems that would propel it to long-term advantage. Now, the Trump administration seems to be actively undermining those sources of strength. As the administration goes blow for blow with the Chinese, it is ripping apart the systems of expertise necessary to navigate the complex tradeoffs that it faces. Every administration is forced to build the plane as it flies, but this is the first one to pull random parts from the engine at 30,000 feet.

As China rapidly adapts to the new realities of weaponized interdependence, it is building its own alternative “stack” of mutually reinforcing high-tech industries centered on the energy economy. Europe is floundering at the moment, but over time, it may also create its own alternative suite of technologies. The United States, uniquely, is flinging its institutional and technological advantages away. A failure by Washington to meet the changes in the international system will not only harm U.S. national interests but also threaten the long-term health of U.S. firms and the livelihoods of American citizens.

Weaponized interdependence is an unanticipated byproduct of the grand era of globalization that is drawing to a close. After the Cold War ended, businesses built an interdependent global economy on top of U.S.-centered infrastructure. The United States' technological platforms—the Internet, e-commerce, and, later, social media—wove the world's communications systems together. Global financial systems also combined thanks to dollar clearing, in which businesses directly or indirectly use U.S. dollars for international deals; correspondent banks that implement such transactions; and the SWIFT financial messaging network. U.S.-centered semiconductor manufacturing was spun out into a myriad of specialized processes across Europe and Asia, but key intellectual property, such as semiconductor software design, remained in the hands of a few U.S. companies. Each of these systems could be understood as its own “stack,” interconnected complexes of related technologies and services that came to reinforce one another, so that, for example, buying into the open Internet increasingly meant buying into U.S. platforms and e-commerce systems, too. At a time when geopolitics seemed the stuff of antiquated Cold War thrillers, few worried about becoming dependent on economic infrastructure provided by other countries.

That was a mistake for Washington's adversaries and, eventually, for its allies, too. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the United States began using these systems to pursue terrorists and their backers. Over two decades of cumulative experimentation, U.S. authorities expanded their ambitions and reach. The United States graduated from exploiting financial chokepoints against terrorists to deploying sanctions to target banks and, in time, to cutting entire countries, such as Iran, out of the global financial system. The Internet was transformed into a global surveillance apparatus, allowing the United States to demand that platforms and search companies, which were regulated by U.S. authorities, hand over crucial strategic information on their worldwide users.

The infrastructure of economic interdependence was turned against both the United States' enemies and its friends. When the first Trump administration pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which the United States and other major countries, including in Europe, had negotiated with Iran in 2015 to limit its nuclear program, the United States threatened to sanction Europeans who continued to do business with the Islamic Republic. European governments found themselves largely unable to protect their own companies against U.S. power.

This was the context in which we first wrote about weaponized interdependence in 2019. By that point, many of the most important economic networks underpinning globalization—communications, finance, production—had become so highly centralized that a small number of key firms and economic actors effectively controlled them. Governments that could assert authority over these firms, most notably the U.S. government, could tap them for information about their adversaries or exclude rivals from access to these vital points in the global economy. Over two decades, the United States had built institutions to assert and direct this authority in response to a series of particular crises.

Some of Trump's senior officials happened on our academic research and, to our amazement, liked what they saw. According to the historian Chris Miller's 2022 book, Chip War, when the administration wanted to squeeze the Chinese telecommunications manufacturer Huawei harder, one senior official seized on the idea of weaponized interdependence as a playbook to strengthen export controls against semiconductors, describing the concept as a “beautiful thing.”



Our primary purpose, however, was to expose the ugly underbelly of such weaponization. The world that globalization made was not the flat landscape of peaceful market competition that its advocates had promised. Instead, it was riddled with hierarchy, power relations, and strategic vulnerabilities.

Moreover, it was fundamentally unstable. American actions would invite reactions by targets and counteractions by the United States. The biggest powers could play offense, looking for vulnerabilities that they, too, could exploit. Smaller powers might seek to use less accountable or transparent channels of exchange, effectively building dark spaces into the global economy. The more the United States turned interconnections against its adversaries, the more likely it was that these adversaries—and even allies—would disconnect, hide, or retaliate. As others weaponized interdependence, the connecting fabric of the global economy would be rewoven according to a new logic, creating a world based more on offense and defense than on common commercial interest.

U.S. President Joe Biden also used weaponization as an everyday tool of statecraft. His administration took Trump's semiconductor export controls to a new level, deploying them first against Russia, in order to weaken Moscow's weapons program, and then against China, denying Beijing access to the high-end semiconductors it needed to efficiently train artificial intelligence systems. According to The Washington Post, a document drafted by Biden administration officials intended to limit the use of sanctions to urgent national security problems inexorably shriveled from 40 pages to eight pages of toothless recommendations. One former official complained of a “relentless, never-ending, you-must-sanction-everybody-and-their-sister . . . system” that was “out of control.”

Similar worries plagued export controls. Policy experts warned that technology restrictions encouraged China to escape the grasp of the United States and develop its own ecosystem of advanced technologies. That did not stop the Biden administration, which in its final weeks announced an extraordinarily ambitious scheme to divide the entire world into three parts: the United States and a few of its closest friends as a chosen elite, the large majority of countries in the middle, and a small number of bitter adversaries at the bottom of the heap. Through export controls, the United States and its close partners would retain access to both the semiconductors used to train powerful AI and the most recent “weights”—the mathematical engines that drive frontier models—while denying them to U.S. adversaries and forcing most countries to sign up to general restrictions. If this worked, it would ensure a long-term American advantage in AI.

Although the Trump administration abandoned this grand technocratic master plan, it certainly has not abandoned the goal of U.S. dominance and control of chokepoints. The problem for the United States is that others are not sitting idly by. Instead, they are building the economic and institutional means to resist.

The weapons of interdependence have been proliferating for several years and are now being deployed to counter U.S. power. As China and the European Union began to understand their risks, they, too, tried to shore up their own vulnerabilities and perhaps take advantage of the vulnerabilities of others. For these great powers, as for the United States, simply identifying key economic chokepoints is not enough. It is also necessary to build the state apparatus that can gather sufficient information to grasp the immediate benefits and risks and then put that information to use. China's approach is coming to fruition as it presses on the United States' vulnerabilities to force it to the negotiating table. By contrast, Europe's internal institutional weaknesses force it to vacillate, putting it in a dangerous position vis-à-vis the United States and China.

For China, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's 2013 exposure of U.S. surveillance practices demonstrated both the reach of the United States and the mechanics of the new era. Previously, Beijing had viewed technological independence as an important long-term goal. After Snowden, it saw dependence on U.S. technology as an urgent short-term threat. As our work with the political scientists Yeling Tan and Mark Dallas has shown, articles in Chinese state media began to trumpet the crucial role of “information security” and “data sovereignty” to China's national security.

The real wake-up call came when the first Trump administration threatened to cut off ZTE, a major Chinese telecommunications company, from access to U.S. technology and then weaponized export controls against Huawei, which the administration had come to see as an urgent threat to U.S. tech dominance and national security. Chinese state media began to focus on the risks posed by “chokepoints” and the need for “self-reliance.”



These fears translated into policy actions as the Chinese Communist Party developed a “whole-of-nation system” to secure China's technological independence, calling for “breakthroughs in major ‘chokepoint' technologies and products.” China also began to think about how it could better exploit its advantages in rare-earth mining and processing, where it had gained a stranglehold as U.S. and other companies fell out of the market. China's power in this sector comes not from a simple monopoly over the minerals, which the country doesn't fully possess, but from its domination of the economic and technological ecosystem necessary to extract and process them. Notably, these critical minerals are used for a variety of high-tech industrial purposes, including producing the specialized magnets that are crucial to cars, planes, and other sophisticated technologies.

China had already threatened to cut back its rare-earth supply to Japan during a 2010 territorial dispute, but it lacked the means to exploit this chokepoint systematically. After it woke up to the threat of the United States' exploitation of chokepoints, China stole a page from the American playbook. In 2020, Beijing put in place an export control law that repurposed the basic elements of the U.S. system. This was followed in 2024 by new regulations restricting the export of dual-use items. In short order, China built a bureaucratic apparatus to turn chokepoints into practical leverage. China also realized that in a world of weaponized interdependence, power comes not from possessing substitutable commodities but from controlling the technological stack. Just as the United States restricted the export of chip manufacturing equipment and software, China forbade the export of equipment necessary to process rare earths. These complex regulatory systems provide China not only with greater control but also with crucial information about who is buying what, allowing it to target other countries' pain points with greater finesse.

This is why American and European manufacturers found themselves in a bind this June. China did not use its new export control system simply to retaliate against Trump but to squeeze Europe and discourage it from siding with the United States. German car manufacturers such as Mercedes and BMW worried as much as their U.S. competitors that their production lines would grind to a halt without specialized magnets. When the United States and China first reached a provisional deal, Trump announced on Truth Social that “FULL MAGNETS, AND ANY NECESSARY RARE EARTHS, WILL BE SUPPLIED, UP FRONT, BY CHINA,” recognizing the urgency of the threat to the U.S. economy. China's long-term problem is that its state is too powerful and too willing to intervene in the domestic economy for purely political purposes, hampering investment and potentially strangling innovation. Still, in the short term, it has built the critical capacity to reimpose controls as it deems necessary to resist further U.S. demands.

Whether Europe can withstand pressure from Beijing—and, for that matter, from Washington—remains an open question. Europe has many of the capacities of a geoeconomic superpower but lacks the institutional machinery to make use of them. The SWIFT system, after all, is based in Belgium, as is Euroclear, the settlement infrastructure for many euro-based assets. European companies—including the Dutch semiconductor lithography giant ASML, the German enterprise software firm SAP, and the Swedish 5G provider Ericsson—occupy key chokepoints in technology stacks. The European single market is by some measures the second largest in the world, potentially allowing it to squeeze companies that want to sell goods to European businesses and consumers.

But that would require Europe to build its own comprehensive suite of institutions and independent stack of technologies. That is unlikely to happen in the short to medium term, unless the nascent “EuroStack” project, which aims to secure Europe from foreign interference by building an independent information technology base, really takes off. Even though Europe woke up to the danger of weaponized interdependence during the first Trump administration, it quickly fell back asleep.

In fairness, the EU's weaknesses also reflect its unique circumstances: it depends on an outside military patron. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has heightened Europe's short-term dependence on the United States, even as European countries struggle to bolster their defensive capacities. The Biden administration put a friendly gloss on economic coercion, coordinating with European governments such as the Netherlands to limit exports of ASML's machinery to China. At the same time, the United States provided Europe with the detailed intelligence that it needed to wield financial sanctions and export controls against Russia, obviating the need for Europe to develop its own abilities.

Europe's lassitude is heightened by internal divisions. When China imposed a series of export restrictions on Lithuania to punish it for its political support of Taiwan in 2021, German companies pressed the Lithuanian government to de-escalate. Again and again, Europe's response to the threat of Chinese economic coercion has been kneecapped by European companies desperate to maintain their access to Chinese markets. At the same time, measures to increase economic security are repeatedly watered down by EU member states or qualified by trade missions to Beijing, which are full of senior officials eager to make deals.



Most profoundly, Europe finds it nearly impossible to act coherently on economic security because its countries jealously retain individual control over national security, whereas the EU as a whole manages trade and key aspects of market regulation. There are many highly competent officials scattered throughout the European Commission's trade directorate and the national capitals of member states but few ways for them to coordinate on large-scale actions combining economic instruments with national security objectives.

The result is that Europe has a profusion of economic security goals but lacks the means to achieve them. Although European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned of “the risk of weaponization of interdependencies,” and her commission has prepared a genuinely sophisticated strategy for European economic security, it doesn't have the bureaucratic tools to deliver results. It has no equivalent of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is capable of gathering information and targeting measures against opponents, or of China's new export control machinery.

One immediate test is whether Europe will use its purported big bazooka, the “anti-coercion instrument,” or let it rust into obsolescence. This complex legal mechanism—which allows the EU to respond to coercion through a broad set of tools, including limiting market access, foreign direct investment, and public procurement—is supposed to allow Brussels to retaliate against allies and adversaries. The instrument was conceived as a response to the threat of Trump's first administration and hastily retrofitted to provide a means of pushing back against China.

From the beginning, however, European officials made it clear that they hoped they would never have to actually use the anti-coercion instrument, believing that its mere existence would be a sufficient deterrent. That has turned out to be a grave misjudgment. The anti-coercion instrument is encumbered with legalistic safeguards intended to ensure that the European Commission will not deploy it without sufficient approval from EU member states. Those safeguards make other powers such as China and the United States doubt that it will ever be used against them. Its lengthy deployment process will give them the opportunity they need to disarm any enforcement action, using threats and promises to mobilize internal opposition against it. As with earlier European efforts to block sanctions, China and the United States can usually bet on the EACO principle that “Europe Always Chickens Out” in geoeconomic confrontations. Europe lacks the information, institutional clout, and internal agreement to do much else.

The anti-coercion instrument is the exact opposite of the “Doomsday Machine” in the film Dr. Strangelove, the classic Cold War satire. That machine was a disaster because it automatically launched nuclear missiles in response to an attack but was kept a closely guarded secret until an attack was launched. In contrast, European officials talk incessantly about their doomsday device, but Europe's adversaries feel sure that it will never be deployed; that certainty encourages them to coerce European companies and countries at their leisure.

Europe is hampered by structural weaknesses, but the United States' difficulties largely result from its own choices. After decades of slowly building the complex machinery of economic warfare, the United States is ripping it apart.

This is in part an unintended consequence of domestic politics. The second Trump administration imposed a hiring freeze across the federal government, hitting many institutions including the Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which oversees OFAC, and leaving key positions unfilled and departments understaffed. Initial budget proposals anticipate an overall reduction in funding for the office, even as the number of sanctions-related programs has continued to rise. Although U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has expressed support for his department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which is chiefly responsible for export controls, the agency lost over a dozen employees as part of the government's sweeping force reductions. OFAC and the BIS were never as all-seeing as their reputations suggested and sometimes made mistakes. Nonetheless, they provided Washington with an extraordinary edge. Other countries had no equivalent to OFAC's maps of global finance or the detailed understanding of semiconductor supply chains developed by key officials on Biden's National Security Council.

Such institutional decay is the inevitable consequence of Trumpism. In Trump's eyes, all institutional restraints on his power are illegitimate. This has led to a large overhaul of the apparatus that has served to direct economic security decisions over the last decades. As the journalist Nahal Toosi has documented in Politico, the National Security Council, which is supposed to coordinate security policy across the federal government and agencies, has cut its staff by more than half. The State Department has been decimated by job cuts, while the traditional interagency process through which policy gets made and communicated has virtually disappeared, leaving officials in the dark over what is expected of them and allowing adventurous officials to fill the vacuum with their own uncoordinated initiatives. Instead, policy is centered on Trump himself and whoever has last talked to him in the uncontrolled cavalcade of visitors streaming through the Oval Office. As personalism replaces bureaucratic decision-making, short-term profit trumps long-term national interest.

This is leading to pushback from allies—and from U.S. courts. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently warned that “the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony.” U.S. federal courts, which have long been exceedingly deferential to the executive when it comes to national security issues, may be having second thoughts. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade issued a striking decision, holding that the United States had overstepped its authority when it invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act—the legal bedrock for much of U.S. coercive power—to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico. That decision has been appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but the judgment is likely just the first of many challenges. Notably, the trade case resulted from a complaint filed by conservative and libertarian lawyers.

The Trump administration's assault on state institutions is weakening the material sources of American power. Across core sectors—finance, technology, and energy—the administration is making the United States less central than it used to be. Trump and his allies are aggressively pushing cryptocurrencies, which are more opaque and less accountable than the traditional greenback, and forswearing enforcement actions against cryptocurrency platforms that enable sanctions evasion and money laundering. In April, the U.S. government lifted sanctions against Tornado Cash, a service that had laundered hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stolen cryptocurrency for North Korea, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. And the bipartisan American love affair with stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency, is pushing China and Europe to accelerate their efforts to develop alternative payment systems.



In some instances, the Trump administration has reversed Biden's policies and promoted the diffusion of previously controlled technology. In a remarkable deal with the United Arab Emirates, the Trump administration agreed to facilitate the massive expansion of data centers in the region using advanced U.S. semiconductors despite continued relations between the UAE and China and warnings from policy experts that the United States should not depend on the Middle East for AI.

Most recently, the spending bill that Trump and his congressional allies pushed through earlier this summer effectively cedes control of next-generation energy technology to China by doubling down on the carbon economy. Even as Washington works to counteract Chinese influence over critical minerals, it is eliminating measures aimed at minimizing U.S. dependence on Chinese supply chains in the crucial areas of renewable energy and battery development and radically defunding its investment in science. The result is that the United States will face the unenviable choice between relying on Chinese energy technology or trying its best to make do with the moribund technologies of an earlier age.

One might have expected that the United States would respond to the age of weaponized interdependence as it responded to the earlier era of nuclear proliferation: by recalibrating its long-term strategy, building the institutional capabilities necessary to make good policy, and strengthening its global position. Instead, it is placing its bets on short-term dealmaking, gutting institutional capacity to analyze information and coordinate policy, and poisoning the economic and technological hubs that it still controls.

This does not just affect Washington's ability to coerce others; it also undermines the attractiveness of key U.S. economic platforms. The use of weaponized interdependence always exploited the advantages of the “American stack”: the mutually reinforcing suite of institutional and technological relationships that drew others into the United States' orbit. When used wisely, weaponization advanced slowly and within boundaries that others could tolerate.

Now, however, the United States is spiraling into a rapid and uncontrollable drawdown of its assets, pursuing short-term goals at the expense of long-term objectives. It is increasingly using its tools in a haphazard way that invites miscalculations and unanticipated consequences. And it is doing so in a world in which other countries are not only developing their own capacities to punish the United States but also building technological stacks that may be more appealing to the world than the United States'. If China leaps ahead on energy technology, as seems likely, other countries are going to be pulled into its orbit. Dark warnings from the United States about the risks of dependence on China will ring hollow to countries that are all too aware of how willing the United States is to weaponize interdependence for its own selfish purposes.

In the first decades of the nuclear age, American policymakers faced enormous uncertainty about how to achieve stability and peace. That led them to make major investments in institutions and strategic doctrines that could prevent nightmare scenarios. Washington, now entering a similar moment in the age of weaponized interdependence, finds itself in a particularly precarious position.

The current U.S. administration recognizes that the United States is not only able to exploit others' economic vulnerabilities but also deeply vulnerable itself. Addressing these problems, however, would require the administration to act counter to Trump's deepest instincts.

The main problem is that as national security and economic policy merge, governments have to deal with excruciatingly complex phenomena that are not under their control: global supply chains, international financial flows, and emerging technological systems. Nuclear doctrines focused on predicting a single adversary's responses; today, when geopolitics is shaped in large part by weaponized interdependence, governments must navigate a terrain with many more players, figuring out how to redirect private-sector supply chains in directions that do not hurt themselves while anticipating the responses of a multitude of governmental and nongovernmental actors.

Making the United States capable of holding its own in the age of weaponized interdependence will require more than just halting the rapid, unscheduled disassembly of the bureaucratic structures that constrain seat-of-the-pants policymaking and self-dealing. Successful strategy in an age of weaponized interdependence requires building up these very institutions to make them more flexible and more capable of developing the deep expertise that is needed to understand an enormously complex world in which Washington's adversaries now hold many of the cards. That may be a difficult sell for a political system that has come to see expertise as a dirty word, but it is vitally necessary to preserve the national interest.



Washington has focused more on thinking about how best to use these weapons than on when they ought not be used. Other countries have been willing to rely on U.S. technological and financial infrastructure despite the risks because they perceived the United States as a government whose self-interest was constrained, at least to some extent, by the rule of law and a willingness to consider the interests of its allies. That calculus has shifted, likely irreversibly, as the second Trump administration has made it clear that it views the countries that the United States has historically been closest to less as allies than as vassal states. Without clear and enforceable limits on U.S. coercion, the most dominant U.S.-based multinational firms, such as Google and J. P. Morgan, will find themselves trapped in the no man's land of a new war zone, taking incoming fire from all sides. As countries work to insulate themselves from U.S. coercion (and American infrastructure), global markets are experiencing deep fragmentation and fracturing. There is “a growing acceptance of fragmentation” in the global economy, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has warned, and “maybe even more troubling—I think there's a growing sense that ours may not be the best fragment to be associated with.”

That, in turn, suggests a deeper lesson. The United States benefited from its ability to weaponize interdependence over the last quarter century. It enjoyed the advantages of an international economy based on multilateral institutions and a technological regime built around its self-image as a liberal power, even while acting in unilateral and sometimes illiberal ways to secure its interests as it saw fit. Just a year ago, some American intellectuals and policymakers hoped that this system could survive into the indefinite future, so that unilateral U.S. coercive strength and liberal values would continue to go hand in hand.

That now seems extremely unlikely. The United States is faced with a choice: a world in which aggressive American coercion and U.S. hegemonic decline reinforce each other or one in which Washington realigns itself with other liberal-minded countries by forswearing the abuse of its unilateral powers. Not too long ago, American officials and many intellectuals perceived the age of weaponized interdependence and the age of American hegemony as one and the same. Such assumptions now seem outdated, as other countries gain these weapons, too. As during the nuclear era, the United States needs to turn away from unilateralism, toward détente and arms control, and, perhaps in the very long term, toward rebuilding an interdependent global economy on more robust foundations. A failure to do so will put both American security and American prosperity at risk.

To the Editor:

In “Dispensable Nation” (July/August 2025), Kori Schake makes a compelling case against U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy, which she argues is jeopardizing the rules-based global order the United States crafted after World War II. But Schake's description goes too far. Despite Trump's tirades against allies, his administration's foreign policy remains quite conventional.

The U.S. global force posture under Trump is nearly identical to what it was under President Joe Biden, with Trump leaving the approximately 200,000 U.S. troops and hundreds of U.S. bases worldwide mostly as they were before he took office. Not a single U.S. alliance has been ruptured, and to the extent that disagreements occur between the United States and its allies, they center less on how those relationships should function and more on how much the allies are spending on their own militaries. Far from searching for alternatives to American power, allies in Europe and Asia are begging the United States to maintain its current level of support.

Instead of worrying about the end of U.S. dominance in global affairs, one should question whether the juice of this dominance is worth the squeeze. Schake believes it is, but she neglects to mention any of the costs associated with continuing the status quo, foremost among them an unwillingness on the part of American officials to prioritize what issue is worthy of U.S. involvement. Other strains include a massive overextension of the U.S. military, an American defense-­industrial complex unable to meet its work orders, and the propping up of security dependents rather than capable allies. None of that should just be swept under the rug.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Why Trump deserves credit for his Ukraine push — and why it may all fall apart","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/politics/trump-zelensky-meeting-oval-office-putin-war-analysis","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:00:00 GMT","


            It was the best day Ukraine has had in a very long time. But it's still hard to see how the war unleashed by Russia's brutal invasion ends any time soon.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House on Monday and, unlike last time, there wasn't a blow-up in the Oval Office.
    


            President Donald Trump offered tantalizing glimpses of how he could approach presidential greatness by saving Ukraine, securing Europe and genuinely deserving the Nobel Peace Prize.
    


            A phalanx of European leaders who came to support Zelensky were impressive and unusually unified despite their wide ideological divergences. They took turns in on-camera remarks to try to invest Trump with a political and emotional rationale for standing with Ukraine.
    


            A historic day echoed great political gatherings that ended World War II and built the modern world. This is how the West is supposed to work, with an American president leading powerful Europeans who share common goals.
    


            But is it too good to last?
    


            It is a measure of the fracture in the transatlantic alliance and Trump's brittle temperament that avoiding disasters is seen as serious progress, especially after the president's concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin at their unctuous summit in Alaska last week.
    


            Everyone at the remarkable meetings in the White House, Trump included, was ostentatiously doing everything to stress possibilities and to avoid specific discussions of issues that could blow the day apart.
    


            By evening, Trump was posting on social media about a potential three-way summit he'd host soon that would also include Zelensky and Putin that could be preceded by a one-on-one between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said such a meeting could happen within two weeks, suggesting accelerating diplomatic momentum.
    


            Finnish President Alexander Stubb told Trump that “in the past two weeks, we've probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three and a half years.” For once, this wasn't a foreign leader indulging in self-abasement to ingratiate themselves with a US president who craves adulation.
    


            It was the truth.
    


            Monday's meetings were the most compelling sign yet that the president really means it when he says he wants to stop the killing in Ukraine. He may deserve more credit than he gets for his energy and commitment so far.
    


            But the day also served to expose the questions that will become increasingly evident in the coming weeks that could scupper Trump's push for peace and shatter Western unity — in a way that would delight Putin.
    


            There was a lot of happy talk over the need to give Ukraine security guarantees after any peace deal. Trump even signaled he'd send support from the US military. But no one has yet explained how this would work — and, more importantly, what Russia would stomach as part of a deal.
    


            Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni raised one proposal for a set of guarantees by Western nations modeled on NATO's Article 5 mutual defense pledge. This would be outside formal alliance structures but might work the same way. But, despite Trump's assurance after Alaska that Putin is open to security guarantees for Ukraine, this is a long shot. The Russian leader is fighting a war to crush his neighbor's NATO aspirations. Why would he accept an arrangement that would offer pseudo-alliance status to Ukraine?
    


            And how strong would such guarantees be anyway? Would European nations who put troops into a Ukraine “reassurance force' really fight a war against Russia, to save Ukraine from a new Russian invasion? The subtext of the current war has been the anxiety of both the Biden and Trump administrations over potentially being dragged into a war with nuclear-armed Russia.
    


            And how would Trump's MAGA base view such a new foreign commitment?
    


            Then there's the issue of territory.
    


            The buzzword in the president's nascent peace process is “land swaps” — to create a new demarcation between an expanded Russia and a newly diminished Ukraine. Trump even gave Zelensky a map, for which he was suitably grateful, as if he doesn't already realize the tough choices ahead over land soaked in Ukrainian blood.
    


            According to officials briefed on Trump's summit with Putin, the Russian leader seeks to capture land through negotiations that his troops have failed to seize, including in the economic and industrial powerhouse region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine. This area is also the line of steel, concrete and heavily defended cities that Ukraine has built to hold Russia at bay and that it would need to deter future attacks.
    


            The term “land swap” is the kind of phrase that conceals its true meaning. Ukraine would, under the Russian plan, essentially be engaging in bargaining for different parts of its own territory. Putin would get valuable strategic areas and offer, other less critical districts he's already seized elsewhere inside Ukraine. It doesn't seem much of a deal.
    


            Land swaps create epochal upheaval and seed future feuds — as the Middle East shows. In this case, they would mean telling thousands of Ukrainians they have must leave home or become Russians. And Zelensky would have to explain to parents of fallen young Ukrainians why they died for territory to be given to Putin.
    


            There are some formulations that could withhold official recognition over disputed areas to postpone the critical decisions on sovereignty and freeze the war in place. This would create a situation like the one between North and South Korea or in the divided Germany during the Cold War. But these are still choices that may be impossible for Zelensky to sell to his people.
    


            This explains why Monday's discussions were surreal.
    


            “I think everybody is in a happy mood, and I think that is better than not being in a happy mood, I suppose,” former Trump first-term national security adviser John Bolton told CNN's Anderson Cooper. “I think the focus on meetings underscores the lack of substance on all this.”
    


            Every major peace effort looks hopeless at the start. Sometimes the only way to push past intractable issues is to create an inner impetus. So Trump's rush to hold summits may make sense. Perhaps he can quickly drive everyone so far along the road to peace, it will be impossible to go back.
    


            But, at some point, impossible gaps must be bridged.
    


            “I don't think what we are living through at this moment, where everybody seems a party to fantasy diplomacy, — I don't think it is sustainable,” the Wilson Center's Michael Kimmage, author of the book “Collisions: The Origins of the War in Ukraine and the New Global Instability,” told Richard Quest on CNN International.
    


            When Trump returned to office, many supporters of Ukraine feared he'd leave it to its fate. The president still balks at the kind of massive US military aid packages that saved the country after Putin's vicious invasion in 2022.
    


            But Trump has now invested significant personal credibility and political capital into his push to end a war he now admits is far more complex than he'd understood when he vowed to quiet the guns within 24 hours. Underscoring the point, air raid sirens wailed over Kyiv while the diplomacy got going in the White House.
    


            On Monday, Trump mostly restrained his temper in an Oval Office press event with Zelensky when reporters from conservative networks seemed to be goading him into an outburst. Then, he played the traditional convening role of a US president surrounded by transatlantic allies. He often treats friends like foes, but seems to have genuine respect for allied leaders. For once, he was squarely in the internationalist tradition of presidents like Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan or George H.W. Bush.
    


            “We're all working for the same goal, very simple goal — we want to stop the killing, get this settled,” Trump said.
    


            Several jarring moments, however, fueled concerns about Trump's true loyalties in the peace process. He was caught on a hot mic telling French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin “wants to make a deal for me.” This shows a dangerous naivete about a Russian leader who launched a murderous unprovoked war and is bent on reviving a myth of Russian greatness.
    


            Trump then suspended talks with European leaders to go off to speak to Putin on the phone.
    


            This kind of behavior was exactly why Trump's European counterparts rushed across the Atlantic at a weekend's notice. Suspicion lingers about his capabilities and his commitment to Western security.
    


            Still, no one else can position himself between Zelensky and the leaders of Europe and Putin. If there's ever a peace deal, it will probably be because Trump wielded his charisma and America's power.
    


            It's a highly unorthodox approach that may not work.
    


            Kimmage, for example, warned that Trump's strategy could shatter over its inner contradictions. Trump is “trying to be all things to all people, he is meeting with Putin and welcoming him with open arms and seeming to come to some agreement. He is speaking about security commitments to Ukraine; he is praising European leaders for supporting Ukraine.”
    


            “There are no details to what is happening. It's all promises, and the promises on the surface contradict each other.”
    


            “You just wonder how long President Trump can juggle all these balls.”
    


            Thousands of lives depend on the answer.

LONDON (AP) — Behold the power of the humble hot mic.

The magnifier of sound, a descendant of 150-year-old technology, on Monday added to its long history of cutting through the most scripted political spectacles when it captured more than two minutes of U.S. President Donald Trump and eight European leaders chit-chatting around a White House news conference on their talks to end Russia's war in Ukraine. The standout quote came from Trump himself to French President Emmanuel Macron even before anyone sat down. The American president, reflecting his comments after meeting in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin: “I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand, as crazy as it sounds.”

How politics and diplomacy sound when the principals think no one is listening can reveal much about the character, humor and humanity of our leaders — for better and sometimes for worse. As public figures, they've long known what the rest of us are increasingly learning in the age of CCTV, Coldplay kiss cams and social media: In public, no one can realistically expect privacy.

“Whenever I hear about a hot mic moment, my first reaction is that this is what they really think, that it's not gone through the external communications filter,” said Bill McGowan, founder and CEO of Clarity Media Group in New York. “That's why people love it so much: There is nothing more authentic than what people say on a hot mic.”




Hot mics, often leavened with video, have bedeviled aspiring and actual leaders long before social media. During a sound check for his weekly radio address in 1984, U.S. President Ronald Reagan famously joked about attacking the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.

“My fellow Americans,” Reagan quipped, not realizing the practice run was being recorded. “I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.” The Soviet Union didn't find it funny and condemned it given the consequential subject at hand.

Putin, too, has fallen prey to the perils of a live mic. In 2006, he was quoted in Russian media joking about Israel's president, who had been charged with and later was convicted of rape. The Kremlin said Putin was not joking about rape and his meaning had been lost in translation.

Sometimes a hot mic moment involves no words at all. Presidential candidate Al Gore was widely parodied for issuing exasperated and very audible sighs during his debate with George W. Bush in 2000. In others, the words uttered for all to hear are profane.

Bush was caught telling running mate Dick Cheney that a reporter for The New York Times was a “major-league a--hole.” 

“This is a big f———- deal,” then-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden famously said, loudly enough to be picked up on a microphone, as President Barack Obama prepared to sign his signature Affordable Care Act in 2010.

Obama was caught on camera in South Korea telling Dmitri Medvedev, then the Russian president, that he'll have “more flexibility” to resolve sensitive issues — “particularly with missile defense” — after the 2012 presidential election, his last. Republican Mitt Romney, Obama's rival that year, called the exchange “bowing to the Kremlin.”

“Sometimes it's the unguarded moments that are the most revealing of all,” Romney said in a statement, dubbing the incident “hot mic diplomacy.”

Live mics have picked up name-calling and gossip aplenty even in the most mannerly circles. 

In 2022, Jacinda Ardern, then New Zealand's prime minister, known for her skill at debating and calm, measured responses, was caught on a hot mic tossing an aside in which she referred to a rival politician as “such an arrogant pr—-” during Parliament Question Time.

In 2005, Jacques Chirac, then president of France, was recorded airing his distaste for British food during a visit to Russia. Speaking to Putin and Gerhard Schroder, he was heard saying that worse food could only be found in Finland, according to widely reported accounts. 

Britain's King Charles III chose to deal with his hot mic moment with humor. In 2022, shortly after his coronation, Charles lost his patience with a leaky pen while signing a document on a live feed. He can be heard grousing: “Oh, God, I hate this!” and muttering, “I can't bear this bloody thing … every stinking time.” 

It wasn't the first pen that had troubled him. The British ability to poke fun at oneself, he said in a speech the next year, is well known: “Just as well, you may say, given some of the vicissitudes I have faced with frustratingly failing fountain pens this past year.”

The American president is famously uncontrolled in public with a penchant for “saying it like it is,” sometimes with profanity. That makes him popular among some supporters.

But even he had trouble putting a lid on comments he made before he was a candidate to “Access Hollywood” in tapes that jeopardized his campaign in the final stretch of the 2016 presidential race. Trump did not appear to know the microphone was recording.

Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News and aired just two days before his debate with Hillary Clinton. The celebrity businessman boasted “when you're a star, they let you do it,” in a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show.

With major supporters balking, Trump issued an apology “if anyone was offended,” and his campaign dismissed the comments as “locker room banter.” 

On Monday, though, the chatter on both ends of the East Room press conference gave observers a glimpse of the diplomatic game. 

Dismissed unceremoniously from the White House in March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now sat at the table with Trump and seven of his European peers: Macron, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Finland's President Alexander Stubb, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Trump complimented Macron's tan. He said Stubb is a good golfer. He asked if anyone wanted to ask the press questions when the White House pool was admitted to the room — before it galloped inside. The European leaders smiled at the shouting and shuffling.

Stubb asked Trump if he's “been through this every day?”

Trump replied, “All the time.”

Meloni said she doesn't want to talk to the Italian press. But Trump, she noted, is game. 

“He loves it. He loves it, eh?” she said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is deploying three Aegis guided-missile destroyers to the waters off Venezuela as part of President Donald Trump's effort to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels, according to a U.S. official briefed on the planning.

The USS Gravely, the USS Jason Dunham and the USS Sampson are expected to arrive soon, said the official, who was not authorized to comment and spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. 

A Defense Department official confirmed that the military assets have been assigned to the region in support of counter narcotics efforts. The official, who was not authorized to comment about military planning, said the vessels would be deployed “over the course of several months.”

The deployment of U.S. destroyers and personnel comes as Trump has pushed for using the U.S. military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into American communities and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities.

Trump has also pressed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically being more aggressive in pursuit of Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Trump and others of intervention by the U.S. military.

Trump in February designated Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, MS-13 in El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations. His Republican administration has also stepped up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members.




The designation is normally reserved for groups like al-Qaida or the Islamic State group that use violence for political ends — not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels.

But the Trump administration argues the international connections and operations of the groups — including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory — warrant the designation.

Venezuela's Communication Ministry didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.

On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said the U.S. had increased its threats against Venezuela and announced he was going to order the deployment of more than 4.5 million militia members around the country. The militias were created by then-President Hugo Chávez to incorporate volunteers who could assist the armed forces in the defense of external and domestic attacks.

“The empire has gone mad and has renewed its threats to Venezuela's peace and tranquility,” Maduro said at an event in Caracas, without mentioning any specific action.

Earlier this month, the Trump government announced it was doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.

Maduro was indicted in a New York federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. Back then, the U.S. offered a $15 million reward for his arrest.

President Donald Trump on Monday vowed more changes to the way elections are conducted in the U.S., but based on the Constitution there is little to nothing he can do on his own.

Relying on false information and conspiracy theories that he's regularly used to explain away his 2020 election loss, Trump pledged on his social media site that he would do away with both mail voting — which remains popular and is used by about one-third of all voters — and voting machines — some form of which are used in almost all of the country's thousands of election jurisdictions. These are the same systems that enabled Trump to win the 2024 election and Republicans to gain control of Congress.

Trump's post marks an escalation even in his normally overheated election rhetoric. He issued a wide-ranging executive order earlier this year that, among other changes, would have required documented proof-of-citizenship before registering to vote. His Monday post promised another election executive order to “help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm elections.”

The same post also pushed falsehoods about voting. He claimed the U.S. is the only country to use mail voting, when it's actually used by dozens, including Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Similar complaints to Trump's, when aired on conservative and conservative-leaning networks such as Newsmax and Fox News, have led to multimillion dollar defamation settlements, including one announced Monday, because they are full of false information and the outlets have not been able to present any evidence to support them. 




Trump's post came after the president told Fox News that Russian President Vladimir Putin, in their Friday meeting in Alaska, echoed his grievances about mail voting and the 2020 election. Trump continued his attack on mail voting and voting machines in the Oval Office on Monday, during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The announcement signals yet another way that Trump intends to stack the cards in his favor in the 2026 midterm elections, after he already has directed his attorney general to investigate a Democratic fundraising platform and urged states to redraw their congressional districts to help the GOP maintain its majority in the House of Representatives.

Here's a breakdown of Trump's latest election post and why Congress is the one entity that can implement national election rules.

Trump for years has promoted false information about voting, and Monday was no exception.

He claimed there is “MASSIVE FRAUD” due to mail voting, when in fact voting fraud in the U.S. is rare. As an example, an Associated Press review after the 2020 election found fewer than 475 cases of potential fraud in the six battleground states where he disputed his loss, far too few to tip that election to Trump.

Washington and Oregon, which conduct elections entirely by mail, have sued to challenge Trump's earlier executive order — which sought to require that all ballots must be received by Election Day and not just postmarked by then. The states argue that the president has no such authority, and they are seeking a declaration from a federal judge in Seattle that their postmark deadlines do not conflict with federal law setting the date of U.S. elections.

Trump also alleged that voting machines are more expensive than “Watermark Paper.” That's a little-used system that has gained favor and investments among some voting conspiracy theorists who believe it would help prevent fraudulent ballots from being introduced into the vote count. Watermarks would not provide a way to count ballots, so they would not on their own replace vote tabulating machines. 

While some jurisdictions still have voters use electronic ballot-marking devices to cast their votes, the vast majority of voters in the U.S. already vote on paper ballots, creating an auditable record of votes that provides an extra safeguard for election security.

In his post, Trump also claimed that states “are merely an ‘agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes” and must do what the federal government “as represented by the President of the United States” tells them to do.

Election lawyers said that's a misrepresentation of the U.S. Constitution. It also flies in the face of what had been a core Republican Party value of prioritizing states' rights.

Unlike in most countries, elections in the U.S. are run by the states. But it gets more complicated — each state then allows smaller jurisdictions, such as counties, cities or townships, to run their own elections. Election officials estimate there are as many as 10,000 different election jurisdictions across the country. 

A frequent complaint of Trump and other election conspiracy theorists is that the U.S. doesn't run its election like France, which hand counts presidential ballots and usually has a national result on election night. But that's because France is only running that single election, and every jurisdiction has the same ballot with no other races.

A ballot in the U.S. might contain dozens of races, from president on down to city council and including state and local ballot measures.

The Constitution makes the states the entities that determine the “time, place and manner” of elections, but does allow Congress to “make” or “alter” rules for federal elections.

Congress can change the way states run congressional and presidential elections but has no say in the way a state runs its own elections. The president is not mentioned at all in the Constitution's list of entities with powers over elections.

“The president has very limited to zero authority over things related to the conduct of elections,” said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Parts of Trump's earlier executive order on elections were swiftly blocked by the courts, on the grounds that Congress, and not the president, sets federal election rules. 

It's unclear what Trump plans to do now, but the only path to change federal election rules is through Congress.

Although Republicans control Congress, it's unclear that even his party would want to eliminate voting machines nationwide, possibly delaying vote tallies in their own races by weeks or months. Even if they did, legislation would likely be unable to pass because Democrats could filibuster it in the U.S. Senate.

Mail voting had bipartisan support before Trump turned against it during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, but it's still widely used in Republican-leaning states, including several he won last November — Arizona, Florida and Utah. It's also how members of the military stationed overseas cast their ballots, and fully eliminating it would disenfranchise those GOP-leaning voters.

The main significance of Trump's Monday statement is that it signals his continuing obsession with trying to change how elections are run. 

“These kinds of claims could provide a kind of excuse for him to try to meddle,” Hasen said. “Very concerned about that.”

The National Hurricane Center in Miami says Hurricane Erin is still expected to churn up dangerous waves and rip currents and could bring tropical force winds to North Carolina's Outer Banks.

Hurricane Erin was creating potentially deadly water conditions all along the East Coast days before the largest waves are expected, even as the strength of the storm weakened on Tuesday.

Erin lost some strength and dropped to a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

It was about 650 miles (1,050 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda and 690 miles (1,105 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Forecasters said Erin was moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph).

Although the weather center was confident Erin would not make direct landfall in the United States, authorities have warned that water conditions along the East Coast remain dangerous. Officials on a few islands along North Carolina's Outer Banks issued evacuation orders and warned that some roads could be swamped by waves of 15 feet (4.6 meters).

Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the southeast Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, the weather center said.

Here is what to know about Hurricane Erin:




Warnings about rip currents have been posted from Bermuda and Florida to the New England coast. The biggest threat is along the barrier islands of North Carolina's Outer Banks where evacuations have been ordered.

Nantucket was closest to Erin's anticipated path in New England and was likely to see the strongest winds, gusting about 25 to 35 mph (40 to 55 kph) at peak with waves potentially reaching a height of 10-13 feet (3-4 meters).

Some towns in New Jersey have closed beaches altogether, Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday.

In North Carolina on Monday, at least 60 people were rescued from rip currents in Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, officials said. 

Bermuda won't feel the full intensity of the storm until Thursday evening, and the island's services will remain open in the meantime, acting Minister of National Security Jache Adams said. But storm surge, which could reach up to 24 feet (7.3 meters) by Thursday, would make waters too dangerous to swim, surf or boat in, Adams said. 

Already this year, there have been at least 27 people killed from rip currents in U.S. waters, according to the National Weather Service. About 100 people drown from rip currents along U.S. beaches each year, according to the United States Lifesaving Association. And more than 80% of beach rescues annually involve rip currents.

Forecasters say Erin will turn northeast — and away — from the eastern U.S. Still, the storm is expected to bring tropical storm force winds, dangerous waves and rip currents to North Carolina's coast, said Dave Roberts of the National Hurricane Center. Coastal flooding in North Carolina is expected to begin Tuesday.

Evacuations were ordered on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island. The orders come at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that juts far into the Atlantic Ocean.

There are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway running along the barrier islands, the National Weather Service said. Some routes could be impassible for several days.

Storm surge is the level at which seawater rises above its normal level.

Much like the way a storm's sustained winds do not include the potential for even stronger gusts, storm surge doesn't include the wave height above the mean water level.

Surge is also the amount above what the normal tide is at a time, so a 15-foot storm surge at high tide can be far more devastating than the same surge at low tide.

A year ago, Hurricane Ernesto stayed hundreds of miles offshore from the U.S. Eastern Seaboard yet still produced high surf and swells that caused coastal damage.

Erin's strength has fluctuated significantly over the past week.

The most common way to measure a hurricane's strength is the Saffir-Simpson Scale that assigns a category from 1 to 5 based on a storm's sustained wind speed at its center, with 5 being the strongest.

Erin reached a dangerous Category 5 status late last week with 160 mph (260 kph) winds before weakening. It dropped to a Category 2 hurricane on Tuesday.

Although Erin is the first Atlantic hurricane of the year, there have been four tropical storms this hurricane season already. Tropical Storm Chantal made the first U.S. landfall of the season in early July, and its remnants caused flooding in North Carolina that killed an 83-year-old woman when her car was swept off a rural road.

And, at least 132 people were killed in floodwaters that overwhelmed Texas Hill Country on the Fourth of July.

Just over a week later, flash floods inundated New York City and parts of New Jersey, claiming two lives.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un condemned South Korean-U.S. military drills and vowed a rapid expansion of his nuclear forces to counter rivals, state media said Tuesday, as he inspected his most advanced warship being fitted with nuclear-capable systems.

Kim's visit to the western port of Nampo on Monday came as the South Korean and U.S. militaries kicked off their annual large-scale summertime exercise to bolster readiness against growing North Korean threats. The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, which the allies describe as defensive, will mobilize 21,000 troops, including 18,000 South Koreans, for computer-simulated command post operations and field training. 

North Korea has long denounced the allies' joint drills as invasion rehearsals and Kim has often used them to justify his own military displays and testing activities aimed at expanding his nuclear weapons program.

The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war, divided by the Demilitarized Zone into North Korea and South Korea.

While inspecting the warship Choe Hyon, a 5,000-ton-class destroyer first unveiled in April, Kim said the allies' joint military drills show hostility and their supposed “will to ignite a war,” the North's Korean Central News Agency said. He claimed that the exercises have grown more provocative than before by incorporating a “nuclear element,” requiring the North to respond with “proactive and overwhelming” countermeasures. 

“The security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day and the prevailing situation requires us to make a radical and swift change in the existing military theory and practice and rapid expansion of nuclearization,” KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying, using the initials of North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Kang Yu-jung, spokesperson for South Korea's new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, who wants to improve ties with the North, said Seoul has “always regarded the Ulchi exercises as defensive” but offered no further comment on Kim's remarks. South Korea's Defense Ministry said it had no immediate new assessments to share regarding the North Korean warship's capabilities.




South Korean and U.S. military officials say Ulchi Freedom Shield will focus on countering North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile threat and will include training to deter North Korean nuclear use and respond to its missile attacks. The exercise will also incorporate lessons from recent conflicts, including Russia's war in Ukraine and the clash between Israel and Iran, and address threats from drones, GPS jamming and cyberattacks. 

Kim has hailed the development of his naval destroyer, Choe Hyon, as a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military. State media said the destroyer, which is being prepared to enter active duty next year, is designed to handle various weapons systems, including antiair and anti-naval weapons, as well as nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. 

The North unveiled a second destroyer of the same class in May, but the vessel was damaged during a botched launching ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin, prompting an angry reaction from Kim, who called the failure “criminal.” The North has said the new destroyer, named Kang Kon, was relaunched in June after repair, but some outside experts have questioned whether the ship is fully operational.

During Monday's visit to Nampo, Kim also reviewed North Korean efforts to complete a third destroyer by October, KCNA said. While inspecting Choe Hyon, Kim expressed satisfaction with the progress of the warship's weapons tests and its integrated operations system, saying the navy's modernization and move toward nuclear-capable capabilities are proceeding as planned. He instructed officials to carry out performance tests in October, KCNA said.

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened in recent years as Kim accelerated his military nuclear program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. His government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Washington and Seoul to revive negotiations aimed at winding down his nuclear and missile programs, which derailed in 2019 following a collapsed summit with U.S. President Donald Trump during his first term. 

In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South's efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks.

The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between the Koreas, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes. But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea's launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume front-line military activities and propaganda campaigns. The step came after North Korea had already declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump hope that their critical meeting with European leaders at the White House could lead to three-party talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to his war on Ukraine.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday he's begun arrangements for a face-to-face meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a pathway to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while affirming that the U.S. would back European security guarantees aimed at preventing Moscow from reinvading its neighbor once the current conflict ends.

Details of the security guarantees and Trump's efforts to arrange peace talks were still evolving as an extended meeting among Trump, Zelenskyy and other European leaders wrapped up at the White House.

But as they emerged from their talks, the leaders expressed guarded optimism that Trump could be finding momentum in his quest to fulfill his campaign promise of ending the grinding war.

The “most important” outcome of the meeting was the “U.S. commitment to work with us on providing security guarantees,” French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters.

Trump said he would forge ahead with arrangements for a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin. He spoke by phone with Putin during Monday's talks with Zelenskyy and the leaders of Britain, Finland, France, Germany and Italy as well as the president of the European Commission and head of NATO.

The developments come amid a significant measure of trepidation on the continent that Trump is pressing Ukraine to make concessions that will only further embolden Putin after the U.S. leader hosted the Russian president for an Alaska summit last week.






“I called President Putin, and began the arrangements for a meeting, at a location to be determined, between President Putin and President Zelenskyy,” Trump said in a social media post. “After that meeting takes place, we will have a Trilat, which would be the two Presidents, plus myself. Again, this was a very good, early step for a War that has been going on for almost four years.” 

It was not clear if Putin has fully signed on to such talks.

Russia state news agency Tass cited Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov saying Putin and Trump “spoke in favor” of continuing direct talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations. Ushakov said they also discussed “the idea of raising the level of the direct Russian-Ukrainian negotiations.”

Zelenskyy told reporters following the White House meeting that if Russia does “not demonstrate a will to meet, then we will ask the United States to act accordingly.”

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in an appearance on Fox News that “if Russia is not playing ball” on direct talks with Ukraine, “the United States plus Europe will do more when it comes to tariffs and sanctions” on Moscow.

Zelenskyy previously had said he wanted Russia to agree to a ceasefire before any meeting between himself and Putin, but he said Monday that if the Ukrainians started setting conditions, the Russians would do the same.

“That's why I believe that we must meet without any conditions, and think about what development there can be of this path to the end of war,” Zelenskyy said.

Earlier, Trump said during talks with Zelenskyy and the European leaders that a potential ceasefire and who gets Ukrainian territory seized by Russia should be hashed out during a face-to-face meeting between the warring countries' two leaders.

“We're going to let the president go over and talk to the president and we'll see how that works out,” Trump said. 

That was a shift from comments Trump made soon after meeting Putin last week in which he appeared to tilt toward Putin's demands that Ukraine make concessions over land seized by Russia, which now controls roughly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory.



Trump stopped short of committing U.S. troops to a collective effort to bolster Ukraine's security. He said instead that there would be a “NATO-like” security presence and that all those details would be hashed out with EU leaders.

Zelenskyy said deep U.S. involvement in the emerging security guarantees is crucial.

“It is important that the United States make a clear signal, namely that they will be among the countries that will help to coordinate and also will participate in security guarantees for Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said.

Speaking Monday before the White House meetings took place, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova rejected the idea of a possible NATO peacekeeping force in Ukraine. She said such a scenario could lead to further escalation and “unpredictable consequences.”

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on an extraordinary show of diplomatic force at the White House today, with a visit by Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.

Trump's engagement with Zelenskyy had a strikingly different feel to their last Oval Office meeting in February. It was a disastrous moment that led to Trump abruptly ending talks with the Ukrainian delegation, and temporarily pausing some aid for Kyiv, after he and Vice President JD Vance complained that Zelenskyy had shown insufficient gratitude for U.S. military assistance.

At the start of Monday's meeting, Zelenskyy presented a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Trump's wife, Melania.






Zelenskyy faced criticism during his February meeting from a conservative journalist for appearing in the Oval Office in a long-sleeve T-shirt. This time he appeared in a dark jacket and buttoned shirt. Zelenskyy has said his typically less formal attire since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022 is to show solidarity with Ukrainian soldiers.

European leaders arrived in Washington looking to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. 

Ahead of Monday's meeting, Trump suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. 

Zelenskyy in his own post late Sunday, responded, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.”



European leaders suggested forging a temporary ceasefire is not off the table. Following his meeting with Putin on Friday, Trump dropped his demand for an immediate ceasefire and said he would look to secure a final peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine — a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin.

German and French leaders on Monday praised Trump for opening a path to peace, but they urged the U.S. president to push Russia for an immediate ceasefire.

“I would like to see a ceasefire from the next meeting, which should be a trilateral meeting,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Trump, for his part, reiterated that a broader, war-ending peace agreement between the two countries is “very attainable,” but “all of us would obviously prefer the immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace.”

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) invoked President Franklin Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II as the Trump administration was set to open a massive detention center at Fort Bliss in Texas on Monday.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) torched the comparison, with a top official left wondering why an organization with such a name ""care[s] more about illegal aliens than U.S. citizens,"" in comments to Fox News Digital.

""Comparisons of illegal alien detention centers to internment camps used during World War II are deranged and lazy. The ACLU's smears against our brave ICE law enforcement are no doubt contributing to the more than 1,000% increase in assaults against them,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

""[The ACLU] should change their name. The facts are ICE is targeting the worst of the worst—including murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, and rapists. 70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges in the U.S. — that doesn't even include known or suspected terrorists, foreign gang members, convictions for violent crimes in foreign countries, or INTERPOL notices.""

BIDEN TEAM LEFT THOUSANDS OF MIGRANT KIDS WITH UNVETTED SPONSORS, RECORDS REVEAL

On Sunday, before Fort Bliss' ""Camp East Montana"" center was to open at the historically pivotal military base near the U.S.–Mexico and New Mexico borders, the ACLU's regional affiliates released a joint statement calling the move ""another shameful chapter"" in the base's history.

""The renewed use of this base to detain immigrants and stage deportations comes as the Trump administration continues to misuse military resources to deport long-standing residents and other immigrants,"" the release read, calling the president's mass-deportation agenda ""dystopian.""

""President Trump's use of Fort Bliss for the nation's largest immigrant detention site is cruel and a reminder of a shameful detention legacy,"" added Sarah Mehta, a top official in the ACLU's Equality Division – who also called on Congress to stop DHS' agenda.

""Thousands of people, including our neighbors and loved ones, will be torn from their communities while this administration enlists the military to rubberstamp its abusive agenda.""

Fort Bliss — named after the son-in-law of Mexican-American War hero and later President Zachary Taylor — also held a small number of German and Italian immigrants during World War II.

UNION BOSS COMPARES ICE TO AL PACINO MOBSTER AS MORE DEMS PILE ON IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

In 1942, Roosevelt initiated an executive order targeting Americans descended from countries representing the Axis powers. The Democrat ushered in the incarceration of about 120,000 Japanese-Americans and smaller numbers of Italian and German descendants.

While Fort Bliss was not a main ""internment camp,"" it did hold small numbers of interred U.S. citizens, including as many as 70 ""Issei,"" or first-generation Japanese-Americans living along the Pacific Coast.

After the war, German scientist Wernher von Braun – a former Untersturmführer in the S.S. -- and other former Axis power-players worked there with the Americans to develop what eventually became the U.S. Space Program, now run by NASA.

Considered a 38,000-soldier ""megabase,"" it has also been a crucial staging ground for the War on Terror.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, toured Fort Bliss' new detention facility last week and told El Paso's NBC affiliate that the people who will be held there are already on their way out of the U.S.

""These are people under final orders of deportation ... They have no legal right to be here,"" Cornyn said.

El Paso's member of Congress, Democrat Veronica Escobar, disagreed.

Escobar argued the $1 billion price tag would ""enrich"" private contractors and siphon funds from other needs in her district.

As many as 5,000 detainees will be held at Fort Bliss, according to reports.

Hundreds of people may have been exposed to rabies while staying in bat-infested cabins in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park.

The potentially affected visitors reportedly came from 38 states and seven countries, according to Wyoming Public Media (WPM), which noted that employees were also being contacted over possible exposure.

""Grand Teton National Park staff are working closely with the NPS Office of Health and Safety, Wyoming Department of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Grand Teton Lodge Company to address potential guest exposures to bats in the Jackson Lake Lodge,"" Grand Teton National Park spokesperson Emily Davis told Fox News Digital.

Davis added that the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH) is leading the response and contacting individuals who stayed in the affected rooms between May 15 and July 27 ""to see if they meet the risk criteria for receiving rabies prevention treatment.""

The bat-infested cabins were found at Jackson Lake Lodge and may have impacted at least 200 guests, according to WPM. The outlet describes the lodge as ""cottage-style hotel rooms."" 

Following eight reports of run-ins with bats since June, the cabins were closed on July 27, WPM reported.

None of the bats found in some of the Jackson Lake Lodge cabins had tested positive for rabies as of Friday, according to the Associated Press. However, Wyoming State Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist told the AP that the bats tested represented only a small sample of what could be dozens colonizing the attic.

Forensics expert Joseph Scott Morgan joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the death of New York City designer Martha Nolan-O'Slatarra. 

Funeral arrangements have been announced for 33-year-old fashion designer Martha Nolan, a native of Ireland who launched a summerwear brand called East x East in New York before police found her dead aboard a 54-foot yacht in Montauk earlier this month.

A funeral Mass is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday local time at the Cathedral of the Assumption in Carlow, Ireland, followed immediately by her burial at St. Mary's Cemetery.

In lieu of flowers, her family is asking for donations in her honor to be made to the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust, a donor-funded charity that brings the remains of Irish nationals home for burial.

Her family was reportedly seeking a second autopsy before her remains were returned home.

Her official cause of death could not be determined after a preliminary investigation and autopsy, according to Suffolk County police. Authorities said they found no signs of violence and are expected to be awaiting the results of a toxicology report.

Arthur Aidala, a high-profile New York attorney hired by her family, said relatives met with homicide detectives and that a ""deep, deep"" investigation was underway to determine what happened to her before she died.

Aidala is disputing some reports that suggest a drug overdose is expected in Nolan's death, calling them premature and speculative. He urged patience as the family awaits more information and investigators continue to probe the incident.

Town of East Hampton police arrived at the Montauk Yacht Club around midnight on Aug. 5 in response to a report of an unconscious woman on a Sea Ray Sundancer 540 docked there, named the Ripple. When officers arrived, good Samaritans were attempting CPR, according to authorities. But first responders pronounced Nolan dead at the scene.

County homicide detectives took over the investigation later that morning.

Nolan was the founder of East x East, a boutique fashion company focused on beachwear and sunglasses. It also offered a Montauk-themed hoodie, emblazoned with the slogan, ""I only love you in Montauk.""

The yacht owner was reportedly an investor in Nolan's business. At the time of her death, she was also going through a divorce from her husband, Sam Ryan.

Acting I.C.E. director Todd Lyons discusses the recent arrest of a criminal illegal immigrant in Rhode Island, the work behind the 'Speedway Slammer,' the attempts to recruit new agents, and more on the 'Big Weekend Show.'

A Maine reserve police officer arrested by ICE for allegedly trying to buy a firearm illegally has agreed to leave the country, the agency said.

Jon Luke Evans, a reserve officer with the Old Orchard Beach Police Department, and a Jamaican national, was arrested on July 25 with help from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), according to ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO).

Evans was taken into custody after a firearm purchase attempt raised concerns tied to his immigration status.

A judge has now granted Evans voluntary departure, giving him the ability to leave the U.S. at his own expense rather than face deportation. 

Reports by federal authorities claim he legally entered the United States through Miami International Airport on Sept. 24, 2023. Evans was reportedly under a visa that required his departure by Oct. 1, 2023, but he failed to leave as required and has been in the U.S. unlawfully since.

Police Chief Elise Chard says they were told by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country and that proper documentation was submitted via the Department of Homeland Security's E-Verify program.

""The town reiterates its ongoing commitment to meeting all state and federal laws regarding employment,"" Chard said in a statement. ""We will continue to rely on the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form and the E-Verify database to confirm employment eligibility.""

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks says Illinois public schools shouldn't be allowed to 'play therapist' on children after failing math and reading scores.

Starting in the 2027–2028 school year, Illinois will be the first state to force annual mental health screenings on all public school kids in grades 3-12. Gov. J.B. Pritzker says it's about catching issues like anxiety and depression early to boost kids' well-being and keep them on track academically and socially. It sounds noble, but I'm not sold. This plan raises red flags that could spell more trouble than solutions.

First off, the idea of shifting mental healthcare from reactive to preventive sounds great on paper. Who doesn't want to stop problems before they spiral? But let's be real: Illinois schools are already dropping the ball on the basics. According to Wirepoints, only 39% of students—1.1 million kids—read at grade level. Math scores are even worse. If schools can't teach kids to read and write properly, why should we trust them to play therapist? I'd argue that building confidence through real academic success—pushing kids to excel, not just pass—does more for their mental health than any questionnaire ever could.

Mental health is deeply personal. No two kids are alike, and a one-size-fits-all tablet quiz can't capture that. Schools aren't therapy offices. They're not equipped to dig into the root of a kid's struggles…

Then there's the screening itself. They're using tablets that ask everything from your mood to your home life. The state says these will be ""age-appropriate,"" but kids, especially young ones, aren't exactly known for nuance. 

ILLINOIS GOV JB PRITZKER LAMBASTED FOR NEW ‘DISASTROUS POLICY' REQUIRING MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS FOR KIDS

A third-grader might check ""sad"" because they lost their favorite pencil, or a teen might exaggerate home issues out of frustration. Misinterpretations could lead to overreactions—think a parent getting a knock from DCFS over a kid's bad day. 

The state promises privacy and follow-ups by professionals, but with thousands of kids screened, who's ensuring every case is handled right? One slip-up, and families could face real consequences. Another slip-up: a school could let a child slip through the cracks. 

A true psychologist must investigate these issues to get to the root of the problem and that takes time. We're asking teachers and staff to add to their workload and that is not feasible. Also, there has been a shortage of mental health professionals in this country. Look at the Uvalde, Texas, shooting in 2022—mental health professionals were in short supply then, and the American Psychological Association reported a nationwide shortage of school psychologists as recently as 2024.

Illinois schools are already stretched thin with counselors; who's handling the fallout when a kid is flagged? Teachers? They're not trained for this, and piling on more work isn't fair or feasible.

The data angle is another red flag. These screenings will churn out sensitive info—moods, behaviors, maybe family dynamics. In today's world, information is power, and this data could be sliced up by race, gender or income to spotlight disparities. The state's push for health equity, as seen in its Beacon Portal, suggests they'll use this to argue certain groups need more help.

The problem with disparities is that race and other immutable characteristics are always blamed — it is never based on the individual but on the group. This could spiral into a mess that leaves the mental health issues of the individual student unsolved. Parents already worry about schools overstepping; handing over this kind of data doesn't build trust.

Mental health is deeply personal. No two kids are alike, and a one-size-fits-all tablet quiz can't capture that. Schools aren't therapy offices. They're not equipped to dig into the root of a kid's struggles, and with professional shortages, many kids flagged by screenings might not get the help they need. 

Here's a better way: use the state's budget to boost academic programs that build kids' confidence alongside targeted mental health support for those who need it. That respects families, eases the burden on overworked schools, and avoids the risk of sensitive data being mishandled or misused. Illinois can't afford to get this wrong. Do you trust a system that's failing at education to handle your kid's mental health?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Zelensky Wasn't Going to Repeat His Oval Office Disaster","https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/archive/2025/08/zelensky-trump-oval-office-europeans/683918/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 00:41:00 GMT","

The Ukrainian president had a new strategy—and backup from allies—during his meeting with Trump.

Sign up for National Security, a newsletter featuring coverage of rising authoritarianism, military intelligence, and geopolitical conflicts.

Volodymyr Zelensky clearly learned some lessons from his calamitous Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump back in February. That much was apparent today just from the Ukrainian leader's outfit. Back then, Zelensky took heat from Trump allies who felt that a suit—and not his trademark wartime ensemble—would have been more appropriate attire for an audience with the American president. Today, Zelensky showed up in a black blazer and a black collared shirt, earning praise from the same MAGA-aligned reporter who'd needled him about his sartorial choices six months ago—and from Trump himself.

Zelensky, who met with Trump in the Oval Office before he was flanked by European leaders for a broader discussion, adjusted more than his fashion. He also heeded the urgent advice of his continental counterparts: Show Trump gratitude, and don't take the bait. With everything at stake for his country, Zelensky began his meeting with Trump by thanking him and the first lady, Melania Trump, for delivering to Russia's Vladimir Putin a “peace letter” asking him to look out for the welfare of children amid war. Zelensky then handed Trump a note from Ukraine's first lady.

“It's not for you; it's for your wife,” said Zelensky, a former comedian, prompting laughs around the room. When reporters asked him about the losses his troops were suffering, he pivoted to praising the U.S. president for his leadership. Trump smiled.

It was a striking contrast to the meeting six months ago, when Trump, red-faced and angry, accused an agitated Zelensky of failing to show enough gratitude to the United States. The blowup was so heated that the Ukrainian delegation was sent from the White House without being allowed to eat their waiting lunch.



Trump, who is convinced that his dealmaking mojo is what's needed to finally bring an end to the war in Ukraine, three and a half years after the Russian invasion, has been sending mixed signals on the path to getting there. After months of largely siding with Putin, he soured on Moscow in recent weeks and threatened sanctions before rolling out a red carpet on Friday in Alaska for a man accused of war crimes. After the two leaders met, Trump announced that working toward a full peace deal—not an immediate cease-fire agreement, which Kyiv wants—would be the best path forward. This alarmed European leaders, who rushed to be by Zelensky's side in Washington today in a remarkable show of solidarity and an equally impressive feat of logistics.



Anne Applebaum: Trump has no cards



The Europeans hoped to reinforce the importance of future security guarantees for Ukraine while ensuring that the meeting with Trump didn't descend into chaos. They also wanted to restore a cease-fire deal to the top of the agenda.



That sticking point became something of a case study for how to manage Trump. The president gathered the Europeans into the White House's East Room in a manner reminiscent of how he typically assembles his Cabinet, with members taking turns praising him. A similar dynamic developed with the European leaders today. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni touted a new chance for peace, telling Trump, “Something has changed, thanks to you.” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, smiled politely when Trump veered offtrack and celebrated the U.S.'s recent trade deal with the European Union. One after another, the Europeans attested to the good-faith efforts of all involved to bring the war to an end. But then, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, after being sure to first thank Trump for his leadership, voiced the group's belief that another summit with Putin could not occur without a cease-fire. Trump appeared cool to the idea. ”In the six wars I have settled, I haven't had a cease-fire,” he replied.



Trump called Putin in between meetings with Zelensky and the European officials this afternoon to loop him in, hopeful that a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would be possible. Trump said that once those two have spoken, he wants a trilateral discussion in which he would take part.



Top European officials said that they remain cautiously optimistic at best about the prospects that U.S. mediation can end the Ukraine war, and some expressed skepticism with regard to Trump's abilities and intentions. Yet they have little choice but to follow his lead: An end to American support for Kyiv—as fickle as it may be—would prove devastating to the Ukrainian cause.



The Europeans were heartened by Trump's suggestion that the U.S. could offer some sort of security guarantee for Ukraine. But Trump was noncommittal about the details, including whether the U.S. would lend financial support and perhaps even boots on the ground to a European-led security force established in Ukraine to deter another invasion. And despite White House officials saying this past weekend that Putin was willing to accept some sort of peacekeeping force in Ukraine, the Russian foreign ministry released a statement today in which it offered “a categorical rejection of any scenarios involving the presence of a military contingent from NATO countries in Ukraine.”



In Alaska, Putin got applause and a warm handshake, a military flyover and a ride in the presidential limousine. By contrast, Zelensky was awarded little pomp and circumstance. The European leaders got even less: They were greeted on the White House driveway by the head of protocol, not by Trump himself.



At times this afternoon, Trump's attention seemed to wander from the matter at hand. He seized on the chance to speak to the media about far more than just the prospects for peace in Ukraine. He went on long tangents about his problems with mail-in election ballots and the failures, in his view, of Joe Biden. (Zelensky, having learned his lesson, just stared ahead blankly during these extended riffs.)



Thomas Wright: The only plausible path to end the war in Ukraine



The outlines of the deal Trump envisions are well known: Zelensky would need to surrender parts of Ukraine to Russia in exchange for an end to the fighting and security guarantees intended to dissuade Russia from attacking again. Trump's top advisers took to the airwaves yesterday to stress the need for concessions by both sides. That language irks Ukrainian and European diplomats who believe that Russia must withdraw from territory it has captured since February 2022, when it launched its full-scale invasion. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS's Face the Nation that “in order for there to be an end to the war, there are things that Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things that Ukraine wants that it's not going to get. Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table.”

Putin gave no indication on Friday that he was inclined to accept genuine reconciliation. And Russia shows no signs of stopping on the battlefield.

Letting schools pay revenue-generating athletes is long overdue. If that means letting squash and water polo die, so be it.

A few sports at a few U.S. universities generate billions of dollars in total. The rest hemorrhage money. For decades, this was an easy circle for schools to square: The money from football and basketball was spent on sports such as squash, water polo, rowing, tennis, golf, and field hockey.

But this system was monumentally unfair. The football and basketball players, disproportionately Black and poor, entranced millions of TV viewers and enriched their universities. Rather than compensating them, administrators turned around and spent much of the money subsidizing teams that go largely unwatched.

Recent court cases have produced major policy changes: Star athletes can now be paid by advertisers, fans, and as of this summer, their schools. This has spooked those on the other side of the equation, whose sports are getting cut to free up money to pay the football players. “That's not fair, you know?” Cochise Wanzer, the father of twin collegiate divers, told The Washington Post, after both of his sons lost their roster spots because of budget reductions.

Yet allowing colleges to pay revenue-generating athletes is long overdue. If that means cutting the diving team because athletic budgets are finite, so be it.

Saahil Desai: College sports are affirmative action for rich white students

In the struggle of subsidized squash against the powerful forces of the free market, President Donald Trump has sided with the former. In an executive order signed late last month, he declared that “opportunities for scholarships and collegiate athletic competition in women's and non-revenue sports must be preserved and, where possible, expanded.” (Whether he has the legal authority to enforce these requirements is, to put it lightly, unclear.)

Protecting women's access to college sports is a matter of settled federal law—Title IX is interpreted to require equitable athletic opportunities for men and women. But blanket protection for nonrevenue sports, which Trump's order calls “the backbone of intercollegiate athletics,” would help preserve an arbitrary status quo. If you're an excellent high-school-squash player, you might be admitted to a school that you would otherwise not get into, and that might pay for your tuition, even if your parents could have afforded it. (Student athletes come from disproportionately wealthy backgrounds, and many nonrevenue sports are distinctly upscale pastimes.) When you arrive, you'll be treated to expensive travel, fancy merch, and a get-out-of-class-free card. If you're equally good at chess or violin or oil painting, however, none of this is an option.

Where does the money for nonrevenue sports come from? Revenue-generating sports put up some of the cost; the student body (or tuition-paying parents) tends to cover the rest. James Madison University, for example, is unusually transparent about this nonconsensual sponsorship agreement: Each student pays a mandatory $2,362 a year to support the university's athletics.

In the race to secure applicants and alumni donations, colleges see this as money worth spending—and charging students for. But the usual rationales for most intercollegiate sports don't add up. If the goal is to promote school spirit, why does almost nobody go to the games? If the goal is to promote fitness, why not do so directly, rather than count on the tennis and lacrosse teams to set a good example? If the goal is teaching teamwork and resilience, why recruit and admit a special group of students to hoard these learning opportunities? From an academic standpoint, the traditional athletics program is a negative: According to NCAA figures, athletes typically spend 30 hours a week on their sports.

Originally, college athletics were cheap and nonintensive. Some stronger-than-average Yale and Harvard students rode a train to New Hampshire in 1852 to face off in a rowing race, the first-ever intercollegiate sporting event. For a while, that system of athletic amateurism continued. Even today, a version of this system exists, known as club sports. As an undergrad, I played club soccer and club table tennis against teams from other colleges. We paid dues to help fund our modest operating costs—we had no coaches—and offered financial aid to students who couldn't afford those dues.

Over the past 75 years, NCAA sports has become ever more professionalized. Football and men's basketball began to generate eye-watering sums of money, incentivizing colleges to invest more resources in them. Revenue generated by those teams subsidized the school's less popular teams. The roster of sports continued to expand as more and more women enrolled in higher education and schools added teams to comply with Title IX.

To protect the “amateur” status of the athletes, a rigid policing structure was created to make sure they never earned any money off their sports, no matter how much they generated for their universities. Not only could colleges not pay them, but the players couldn't accept any money or gifts as a reward for their athletic achievement. They couldn't charge to sign autographs or even accept complimentary meals from local restaurants when their 250-pound bodies got hungry.

In the mid-2000s, the running back Reggie Bush was the best player on a football team that generated tens of millions of dollars for the University of Southern California. His Heisman Trophy and the team's national championship were stripped after the NCAA found out that marketing agents had bought him a $13,000 car, let his parents stay in an empty investment property, and paid for their airfare so they could watch him play. (His Heisman was reinstated last year.) Ohio State players were suspended for multiple games for, among other things, accepting discounts on tattoos. Reggie Bush went on to the NFL, but not every college sports star can go pro. The most egregiously unfair cases regarded the football players who were crucial to their juggernaut teams, never got paid for their work, and just barely missed out on a professional career.

By contract, about 50 percent of NFL and NBA revenue goes to the players. At that rate, according to a 2020 National Bureau of Economic Research paper, college football players at the top 65 schools would have been paid about $360,000 a year, and basketball players about $500,000. Instead, for decades, they got nothing.

This began to change in 2021. In National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston, the Supreme Court unanimously held that certain rules against athlete compensation violated federal antitrust law. Shortly thereafter, the NCAA allowed players to receive pay for the use of their name, image, and likeness. This dramatically shifted the economics of big-time college sports. Top players at major programs can now make millions of dollars in endorsement deals. “Donors” eager to attract talent to their favorite team provide compensation to many other players, nominally in exchange for showing up at some events.

A legal settlement approved in June gave athletes another way to cash in: Universities are now allowed to directly pay athletes, up to a total of $20.5 million a year per school. Because some schools will compensate revenue-generating athletes in order to attract top talent, other athletes fear they'll make room in the budget by cutting the teams that don't generate any revenue at all. This fear has been especially pronounced about women's sports, which typically generate less money, but Title IX ensures that any cut would affect men and women equally. In practice, universities that continue to field teams in their most lucrative men's sports would also maintain their most popular women's teams. Not every school will necessarily keep football and men's basketball in perpetuity—at many schools, even those sports have little following.

Jemele Hill: Trump has a funny way of protecting women's sports

Supporters of the existing system fear that the country will lose out if universities drop niche sports. In comments earlier this month, Trump noted that college sports are the primary training ground for American Olympians. But a negligible fraction of college athletes will ever compete in the Olympics, and many Olympic sports aren't played at the intercollegiate level anyway.

Cuts to nonrevenue sports might be a good thing. Instead of giving admissions, scholarships, and resources to the best cross-country runners, for example, colleges could accept the most qualified applicants, spend money to provide them the best education, and offer financial aid to as many needy students as they can.

Students would remain free to pursue hobbies, including sports. They just wouldn't be rewarded with scholarships and other benefits for doing so. Trump's order purportedly seeks to “maximize the educational benefits and opportunities provided by higher education institutions through athletics.” Awarding scarce benefits and opportunities on the basis of talent in niche sports is one way to run an educational system, but it's not one worth preserving.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The meeting at the White House today yielded little progress toward peace—but it could have been far worse.

Sign up for National Security, a newsletter featuring coverage of rising authoritarianism, military intelligence, and geopolitical conflicts.

The fallout from Donald Trump's summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week continues to grow. On Friday, Trump flew to an apparently impromptu meeting with Putin, shaming America by greeting like an honored guest the man who'd ignited the largest war in Europe since Hitler. The whole misbegotten summit was likely driven more by Trump's desire to change the news cycle (especially after weeks of anger from his own base about the Jeffrey Epstein files) than by any real chance of securing an agreement.

What happened after the handshakes, as the two men went behind closed doors in Anchorage, remains a secret, but it couldn't have been pleasant for the American president. When the two leaders emerged, Putin spoke first and said very little of substance except to reiterate his insistence on solving the “root” causes of the conflict. Trump mumbled his way through a few minutes and took no questions. Then both presidents got on their planes and went home. Later, a haggard Trump tried to put a happy face on the failure in Alaska; on Friday night, he quietly told Sean Hannity that Volodymyr Zelensky has “got to take” Putin's deal, implying that the United States was endorsing Putin's demand to freeze the front lines and partition Ukraine. Such an arrangement would give Russia some breathing space while leaving it free to attack again in the future.

Trump's attempt to spin the Anchorage meeting, however, did not sway Zelensky or several European leaders, who in an extraordinary show of diplomatic concern all rushed to Washington two days after Trump's return. In contrast to Zelensky's previous visit to the White House, when he arrived alone to be ambushed and insulted to his face by Trump and Vice President J. D. Vance, this time the Ukrainian president came to town accompanied by the leaders of five NATO nations, along with the NATO secretary general and the president of the European Commission. The Alaska summit was never a good idea, especially without some signal from Putin that he was actually ready to stop the killing, but the response from European leaders is the clearest evidence yet that Trump was on a path to selling out Ukraine to the Kremlin.

Fortunately, someone at today's meeting appears to have talked Trump out of the idea of trading land for a temporary peace, an especially encouraging change because the White House already had a map of Ukraine in the room that seemed to be color coded almost perfectly in line with Putin's wishes. When the group discussion concluded, Trump called Putin and then issued a somewhat scrambled statement on Truth Social, in which he said that he had gained the Russian dictator's assent for a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelensky.

The plan—such as it is at the moment—to put Zelensky and his team in a room with Putin makes little sense. Trump believes that he can arrange a one-on-one meeting, with no mediators, between Putin and the man Putin is trying to kill every day, to be followed by a trilateral meeting among Putin, Zelensky, and Trump. The American president has backed away from his calls for a cease-fire, saying instead that he's solved several wars without a cease-fire.

Meetings require some level of basic agreement among the principals in order to produce results. Both sides have to have at least some shared goals; otherwise, such meetings are not negotiations but two sides reading each other their demands across a table. Without the pressure of further U.S. sanctions or more arms to Ukraine, Putin is likely to meet Zelensky only to renew his demands that Kyiv surrender and certify Putin's gains, an ultimatum to which Zelensky cannot agree.

The Russians, for their part, are being a bit more cautious about Trump's offer of further negotiations. Their readout of the call tonight said that the Kremlin supports “continuing direct talks” and that Trump and Putin have “discussed raising the level of the contacts.” None of this verbiage means anything: Putin can easily afford to say that he's thinking it over, and he loses nothing by humoring Trump while Russian forces continue to pulverize Ukrainian cities.

Still, it could have been worse. The Europeans, for now, seem to have moved Trump away from a land-for-peace deal, in which a grim handover of Ukrainian territories and the people who live in them would have been followed by haggling with Putin over what a “security guarantee” means. At the least, the mini NATO delegation achieved the minimum goal of stopping Trump from announcing some screwball plan to give Putin chunks of someone else's country, and if kicking the can down the road while promising more talks averts an American-imposed partition of Ukraine, that's good news for Kyiv.

Trump did, however, buy time for Putin, who has never been in as much of a hurry for a peace deal as Trump. Setting up a bilateral meeting with Zelensky and Putin while the fighting goes on will take a lot of planning—especially because the only thing Putin appears to want is to destroy the Ukrainian government and take over the country. Such a meeting could happen, but without a cease-fire or a basic agreement on Ukraine's existence, it would yield little more than Putin reiterating his demands, declaring Zelensky the obstacle to peace, and then continuing the war.

Perhaps the Europeans did the best they could, stiffening Trump's spine a bit after whatever browbeating he took in Alaska. But in the end, all of Trump's showmanship has resulted in no substantive progress. Putin's war continues. That said, Alaska is still part of the United States, America is still in NATO, and Kyiv remains free—and in this second Trump presidency, perhaps that counts as a good-enough day.

All research is allowed so long as it's “scientifically justifiable.”

Since January, President Donald Trump's administration has been clear about its stance on systemic racism and gender identity: Those concepts—championed by a “woke” mob, backed by Biden cronies—are made-up, irrelevant to the health of Americans, and unworthy of inclusion in research. At the National Institutes of Health, hundreds of research studies on health disparities and transgender health have been abruptly defunded; clinical trials focused on improving women's health have been forced to halt. Online data repositories that contain gender data have been placed under review. And top agency officials who vocally supported minority representation in research have been ousted from their jobs.

These attacks have often seemed at odds with the administration's stated goals of fighting censorship in science at the NIH and liberating public health from ideology. But its members behave as though they have no dogma of their own—just a wholehearted devotion to scientific rigor, in the form of what the nation's leaders have repeatedly called “gold-standard science.” This pretense—that the government can obliterate entire fields of study while standing up for free inquiry—is encapsulated by what's become a favored bit of MAHA rhetoric: All research is allowed, the administration likes to say, so long as it's “scientifically justifiable.”

On Friday, the phrase scientifically justified appeared several times in a statement by NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya that set the agenda for his agency and ordered a review of all research to make sure that it fits with the agency's priorities. “I have advocated for academic freedom throughout my career,” he wrote in a letter to his staff that accompanied the statement. “Scientists must be allowed to pursue their ideas free of censorship or control by others.” But his announcement went on to warn that certain kinds of data, including records of people's race or ethnicity, may not always be worthy of inclusion in research. Only when its consideration of those factors has been “scientifically justified,” he wrote, would a project qualify for NIH support.

That message may seem unimpeachable—in keeping, even, with the priorities of the world's largest public funder of biomedical research: NIH-backed studies should be justified in scientific terms. But the demand that Bhattacharya lays out has no formal criteria attached to it. Scientific justifiability is, to borrow Bhattacharya's description of systemic racism, a “poorly-measured factor.” It's imprecise at best and, at worst, a subjective appraisal of research that invites political meddling. (Neither the NIH nor the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees it, responded to my questions about the meaning and usage of this phrase.)

Judging scientific merit has always been one of the NIH's most essential tasks. Tens of thousands of scientists serve on panels for the agency each year, scouring applications for funding; only the most rigorous projects are selected to receive portions of the agency's $47 billion budget—most of which goes to research outside the agency itself. All of the thousands of grants the agency has terminated this year under the Trump administration were originally vetted in this way, by subject-matter experts with deep knowledge of the underlying science. Many of the studies have been recast, in letters from the agency, as being “antithetical to the scientific inquiry,” indifferent to “biological realities,” or otherwise scientifically unjustified.

The same language from Bhattacharya's email appears in other recent NIH documents. Last week, an official at the agency sent me a copy of a draft policy that, if published, would prohibit the collection of all data on people's gender (as opposed to their sex) by any of the agency's researchers and grantees, regardless of their field of study. It allows for an exception only when the consideration of gender is “scientifically justified.” The gender-data policy was uploaded to an internal portal typically reserved for agency guidance that is about to be published, but has since been removed. (Its existence was first reported by The Chronicle of Higher Education.) When reached for comment, an HHS official told The Atlantic that the policy had been shot down by NIH leadership, but declined to provide any further details on the timing of that shift, or who, exactly, had been involved in the policy's drafting or dismissal.

Still, if any version of this policy remains under consideration at the agency, its aims would be in keeping with others that are already in place. One NIH official told me that one of the agency's 27 institutes and centers, the National Institute for General Medical Sciences, has, since April, sent out hundreds of letters to grantees noting, “If this award involves human subjects research, information regarding study participant ‘gender' should not be collected. Rather, ‘sex' should be used for data collection and reporting purposes.” Payments to those researchers, the official said, have been made contingent on the scientists agreeing to those terms within two business days. “Most have accepted,” the official told me, “because they're desperate.” (The current and former NIH officials who spoke with me for this article did so under the condition of anonymity, to be able to speak freely about how both Trump administrations have affected their work.)

Collecting data on study participants' gender has been and remains, in many contexts, scientifically justified—at least, if one takes that to mean supported by the existing literature on the topic, Arrianna Planey, a medical geographer at the University of North Carolina, told me. Evidence shows that sex is not binary, that gender is distinct from it, and that acknowledging the distinction improves health research. In its own right, gender can influence—via a mix of physiological, behavioral, and social factors—a person's vulnerability to conditions and situations as diverse as mental-health issues, sexual violence, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, and cancer.

The Trump administration has expressed some interest in gender-focused research—but in a way that isn't justified by the existing science in the field. In March, NIH officials received a memo noting that HHS had been directed to fund research into “regret and detransition following social transition as well as chemical and surgical mutilation of children and adults.” That framing presupposes the conclusions of such studies and ignores the most pressing knowledge gaps in the field: understanding the long-term outcomes of transition on mental and physical health, and how best to tailor interventions to patients. (Bhattacharya's Friday statement echoed this stance, specifically encouraging “research that aims to identify and treat the harms these therapies and procedures have potentially caused to minors.”)

According to the draft prohibition on collecting gender data, NIH-employed scientists would be eligible for an exception only when the scientific justification for their work is approved by Matthew Memoli, the agency's principal deputy director. Memoli has played this role before. After Trump put out his executive order seeking to abolish government spending on DEI, Memoli—then the NIH's acting director—told his colleagues that the agency's research into health disparities could continue as long as it was “scientifically justifiable,” two NIH officials told me. Those officials I spoke with could not recall any instances in which NIH staff successfully lobbied for such studies to continue, and within weeks, the agency was cutting off funding from hundreds of research projects, many of them working to understand how and why different populations experience different health outcomes. (Some of those grants have since been reinstated after a federal judge ruled in June that they had been illegally canceled.)

The mixing of politics and scientific justifiability goes back even to Trump's first term. In 2019, apparently in deference to lobbying from anti-abortion groups, the White House pressured the NIH to restrict research using human fetal tissue—prompting the agency to notify researchers that securing new funds for any projects involving the material would be much more difficult. Human fetal tissue could be used in some cases, “when scientifically justifiable.” But to meet that bar, researchers needed to argue their case in their proposals, then hope their projects passed muster with an ethics advisory board. In the end, that board rejected 13 of the 14 projects it reviewed. “They assembled a committee of people for whom nothing could be scientifically justified,” a former NIH official, who worked in grants at the time of the policy change, told me. “I remember saying at the time, ‘Why can't they just tell us they want to ban fetal-tissue research? It would be a lot less work.'”

The NIH's 2019 restriction on human-fetal-tissue research felt calamitous at the time, one NIH official told me. Six years later, it seems rather benign. Even prior to the change in policy, human fetal tissue was used in only a very small proportion of NIH-funded research. But broad restrictions on gathering gender data, or conducting studies that take race or ethnicity into account, could upend most research that collects information on people—amounting to a kind of health censorship of the sort that Bhattacharya has promised to purge.

The insistence that “scientifically justifiable” research will be allowed to continue feels especially unconvincing in 2025, coming from an administration that has so often and aggressively been at odds with conventional appraisals of scientific merit. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the head of HHS, has been particularly prone to leaning on controversial, biased, and poorly conducted studies, highlighting only the results that support his notions of the truth, while ignoring or distorting others. During his confirmation hearing, he cited a deeply flawed study from a journal at the margins of the scientific literature as proof that vaccines cause autism (they don't); in June, he called Alzheimer's a kind of diabetes (it's not); this month, he and his team justified cutting half a billion dollars from mRNA-vaccine research by insisting that the shots are more harmful than helpful (they're not), even though many of the studies they cited to back their claims directly contradicted them. Kennedy, it seems, “can't scientifically justify any of his positions,” Jake Scott, an infectious-disease physician at Stanford, who has analyzed Kennedy's references to studies, told me.

Bhattacharya's call for a full review of NIH research and training is predicated on an impossible, and ironic, standard. Scientists are being asked to prove the need for demographic variables that long ago justified their place in research—by an administration that has yet to show it could ever do the same.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

For some men, fatherhood is an answer to questions about modern masculinity.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Charlie Calkins grew up in a big extended family. We're talking about nearly 30 cousins—some of whom had their own kids. When he was in high school, he spent a lot of time with those young children: a position that some surly teens might resent but that Calkins adored. The idea that someday he would be a father himself seemed, to him, only natural.

He just needed to wait for the right partner to show up. So he did: He waited and waited. He went to business school. He built a career in tech. He traveled. And he went on dates. When a relationship didn't work out, he'd return to “professional mode”—bouncing between “intermittent surges” of dating and work. “I spent a lot of my early adulthood going, When everything's right, it will happen,” he told me. “I'm definitely a The stars will align kind of person. And then one day it hit me: They were not aligning.”

That's how Calkins ended up, in his 40s, making an appointment with a fertility clinic—and eventually, over the course of years, getting matched with an egg donor and a “gestational carrier,” or surrogate. At 49, he became a parent. Now he's living in Durham, North Carolina, with a 7-year-old son and a daughter who's almost 2.

Single mother by choice has become a common term for unpartnered women who have intentionally become parents. You rarely hear of single fathers by choice, which makes sense given that they're much more rare. But this population, it appears, has been expanding—slowly, over the course of a couple of decades, and then more notably in the past few years. The exact count is unclear; most surveys don't differentiate them from widowers or men separated from an uninvolved co-parent. Still: Susan Golombok, a University of Cambridge psychologist and the author of We Are Family: The Modern Transformation of Parents and Children, told me that before this millennium, single dads by choice were virtually unheard of. Based on my conversations with kin researchers, fertility-industry professionals, and adoption centers, that's certainly not the case anymore.

Read: Another side of modern fatherhood

Over the past few years, Yan Dekel, a community manager for an organization called Men Having Babies (MHB), has noticed what he described as “a radical change” in single-fatherhood interest. The nonprofit hosts conferences in a number of large U.S. cities (and abroad) to offer parenting or surrogacy information, legal advice, financial aid—but the main audience was always intended to be coupled gay men. As recently as 2021, Dekel told me, only a few single men would show up to a typical conference. Now the “singles' session” tends to bring in about 50 men. In some cities, that represents a whole quarter of all the conference-goers.

Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising given that singlehood rates have been rising for years, more steeply among men than women—leaving lots of would-be dads without a co-parent. But the fact that single men are deciding to start families on their own, some of them paying extravagantly for egg donation and surrogacy, might also say something about just how important fatherhood is for many men today. Multiple family-planning professionals told me that the coronavirus pandemic was a turning point for a lot of single fathers by choice: It led to a “reorganization, reprioritization of what's really important in life,” Jennifer McGill, the chief operating officer of the Maryland fertility clinic Creative Family Connections, told me. Some men are deciding that being a father is what matters to them—even if romance isn't in the cards.

American households are dramatically more diverse than they were a century ago. Gay couples are adopting or using fertility services; divorced parents are finding new partners and creating big blended families; friends are platonically co-parenting. Our norms for kinship are simply loosening up, and that can create a “reinforcing phenomenon,” as Ron Poole-Dayan, MHB's founder, put it: The more single dads you see around you, the more likely you might be to become a single dad yourself—and the more likely you might then be to inspire someone else's choice. Of the seven men I spoke with who were either a single dad or in the process of becoming one, most mentioned having a single-parent friend or having gone to an MHB conference: something that made the possibility feel a little less abstract.

The experts I spoke with had the sense that single fatherhood by choice is more common among gay men than straight ones. Gay men, for one thing, would likely need to adopt or use a surrogate to have a kid whether they were partnered or not. Perhaps more important, they may be more accustomed to imagining what a family could look like beyond the bounds of societal expectations. And in recent years, Poole-Dayan told me, the gay community has seen a real “demographic recovery” after the AIDS epidemic took so many lives beginning in the 1980s. A new generation of gay men has made it through young adulthood with more health, stability, financial security, and societal acceptance than many before them ever had. All of those factors can make starting a family feel more possible.

For straight single dads by choice, the leap away from convention might feel more “daunting,” Batya Novick, a therapist who works with clients seeking to grow a family, told me. Novick started her practice, Calla Collective, in 2016—but only in the past year and a half have single men started coming to her to talk through whether they should have a kid. Whereas the gay men she's worked with generally haven't planned to give up on dating at all, the straight ones, she told me, seemed to be pursuing single fatherhood “in the face of defeat versus the face of choice.” She's seen them struggle with a feeling of failure for not finding a wife, with “latent grief” as they adjust expectations, with isolation as they search for anyone around them having families in nontraditional ways. Some clients wrestle not only with how they'd make single parenthood work logistically and financially, but also with what becoming a sole caregiver means for their sense of self, she told me: “There is this almost unspoken de-masculation.”

They're considering this in a moment when many of the traditional trappings of manhood—a spouse, a breadwinner's paycheck, an ambient sense of power—are no longer a given. Women are now graduating college at higher rates than men. A growing share of jobs require a degree, while many industries that traditionally favored men—physical labor, factory work—are in decline. As fewer women (thankfully) rely on men for financial security, fewer straight men can rely on marriage. Conversations about “toxic masculinity” have put some men on the defensive; others see the traditional model of manhood as something to move away from. But toward what?

Fatherhood, whatever questions about identity it might raise for some men, can also be an answer. Richard Reeves, as the president of the American Institute for Boys and Men, talks to—well, a lot of boys and men. And he told me that he sees many of them placing great importance on becoming a dad, in a way he didn't always notice. For so long, he said, “fatherhood was mediated through motherhood”: Many straight men became dads almost by default, and their relationship with their children often remained fairly indirect. Picture a family tree, he told me, in which the lines between a mom and her children, and between herself and her husband, are solid—but a dotted line runs between that dad and his kids. Because fathers weren't expected to give as much, in terms of the time and labor of child care, many of them also gained less in close, emotional relationships with their children.

Today, though, fathers on the whole are far more engaged than they used to be. Even just from 2015 to 2023, the time that 25-to-44-year-old fathers spent on child care in an average week increased by about two and a half hours. That time climbed significantly from 2019 to 2023, perhaps a sign of what McGill, the fertility-clinic COO, had described as men coming out of the pandemic wanting to “spend those moments with their loved ones before it was too late.” And when Pew Research Center polled young adults without children in late 2023, it found that 57 percent of the men surveyed said they hoped to have kids someday, while only 45 percent of the women said the same. Perhaps as pressure on women to become mothers has loosened, allowing more women to choose to remain child-free, some men are undergoing the opposite revelation: realizing that some of the qualities associated with parenting, such as care and tenderness, need not be so relentlessly feminized; that parenthood could be a much-needed source of purpose. Single fathers by choice, who have the ultimate solid line between themselves and their kids, give Reeves hope. “People are realizing,” he said, “that fatherhood has to survive gender equality.”

For many of the single men I talked with, fatherhood dangled a promise of deeper meaning in life. They told me they wanted to multiply love, to teach a child all that they'd learned, to re-create the warm family dynamic they'd experienced as a child. One New York dad, Raghav Nayar, said that he craved both a sense of purpose and of “human connection.” Like many men, he'd never quite learned to open up to people emotionally. He was academically and professionally successful, yet unfulfilled. But he was inspired by a Buddhist tale he'd heard, about a child whose mother gives him the top of a glass of milk: the tastiest part, with the highest concentration of butter. A parent, the story goes, doesn't expect anything in return for their love. He wanted to feel that kind of transcendent selflessness. “If I raise a child who is a good human being,” he told me, “I can't ask for anything else.”

Becoming a single dad by choice tends to be difficult—in some ways that are unavoidable, and some ways that reflect persistent skepticism about men's fitness as parents. Single men can't legally adopt or access assisted reproductive technology in every country, so many of them travel to the United States just to get that chance. But even in America, some adoption agencies view single men with suspicion, and many don't actively recruit men. In some states, surrogacy is illegal or requires overcoming legal obstacles; in every state, it's complicated and extraordinarily expensive. A hopeful father must choose an egg donor, who will undergo a slate of medical screenings, and find a surrogate, who may well live in another state. Legal contracts have to be drawn up to ensure that the father will be considered the sole parent (and not the surrogate, who would otherwise hold parental rights). Because so many people need to be paid, the price of this undertaking hasn't gone down much over the years, even as it's become more widely used, Sheeva Talebian, a doctor at CCRM Fertility in New York, told me. All in all, it can cost a couple of hundred thousand dollars. And, of course, that's just the start of raising a child, which itself is prohibitively expensive for many Americans.

Men Having Babies provides financial assistance to some aspiring dads, but the organization has also been pushing for insurance plans to cover these costs. So far success has been limited. In 2019, for instance, New York passed legislation making IVF a mandated health-plan benefit for large-group insurance policies—and in 2021 issued an anti-discrimination directive for same-sex couples. But surrogacy coverage still isn't required, so single men and gay male partners are out of luck. And many insurance providers still define infertility as the inability to conceive after a year of trying, rather than the inability to conceive without medical intervention. MHB has tried to galvanize people around these issues—but has struggled, even within the LGBTQ community. Poole-Dayan thinks many people see parenthood as integral to a woman's purpose but as an extra treat for men, especially gay men. This is the flip side of the misguided assumption that all women want children and will be deprived without them: that men can't truly be deprived of parenthood. “The average person doesn't think of us as childless,” he told me. “A lot of discrimination is tolerated and a lot of support is withheld because of that. And this is without even talking about those people who are actually looking at what we're doing suspiciously.”

Read: What older dads know

The donor-and-surrogacy process can also take years, which is difficult given that many single men start it, McGill told me, in their 40s—when they realize they're running out of time. Male fertility does decline with age, though not at a rate as steep as for women. But men still face emotional, logistical, and existential limits on their child-rearing window: They might not want to carry around a toddler when they're 60, or leave a still-young child parentless when they die—and men face a shorter average lifespan than women. Greg Larson, an aspiring dad in New Jersey, started looking for egg donors in 2022, had embryos created by the end of 2023, and now he's matched with a surrogate—but she hasn't gotten pregnant yet. If everything goes perfectly, he might have a baby around his 46th birthday, next May. If things don't work out with this surrogate, he might not start all of this over again.

And yet, despite the obstacles, becoming a single dad by choice can be empowering. It means not waiting for a partner to complete your life, knowing what you want to prioritize, actively creating the life you want, even if it's not what anyone expected of you. For the men I spoke with, making this decision also pushed them to be vulnerable enough to ask for help, or to build community. Calkins has four sisters, two of whom are local and all of whom adore his kids. He finds himself texting “the aunties” little updates—the kind of thing he might, in a different world, be sending to a spouse. Larson has met other aspiring single dads through Men Having Babies; they talk about navigating the surrogacy process, how to date while they're in the midst of it, what to tell romantic prospects about the possibility but not certainty of near-future fatherhood. “It's really cool,” he said, “the people that you pick up along the way that you get unexpected support from.”

The men I spoke with never set out to buck tradition; they just wanted to be dads. But that decision spurred some of them to consider what it means to be a good father—and a good man. Nayar told me he notices now how rarely he sees another father in the park with his kid. Sometimes when he does, he thinks the father seems a little begrudging, walking slightly behind the child, and he wonders how many of these dads were told by their wife to take the kid out to play. He understands: He, too, is stretching to be not just a provider, that classic masculine trope, but also a nurturer—someone softer, more open. The other day, when he was visiting his cousin's two daughters, the 5-year-old got in trouble and ran into the living room and hid behind the couch. He picked her up and took her to the mirror, and they looked at their reflections together. “You are wonderful,” he told her. “And you don't have to worry about anything.”

In an ideal world, these single dads by choice might prefer not to be single. But many of the experts I spoke with told me the ones they knew were notably steady and optimistic. And that made sense to me: The ones who have made it this far are the ones who really want fatherhood. “I don't know quite how to explain it,” Calkins told me, “but I was just so confident and comfortable with the fact that I wanted to be a parent. And I was going to love being a parent, which I do.” Getting to this point, despite the effort and technology involved, felt like the most organic thing in the world to him. And in a way he never quite expected, the stars ended up aligning after all.

Republicans are right to criticize Europe for attacking free expression, even if that makes them hypocritical.

American officials are waging a multifront attack on Europe's approach to free speech. This month, a congressional delegation traveled to Dublin, Brussels, and London to probe and decry European regulations on digital speech. A State Department human-rights assessment issued last week pointed to objectionable “restrictions on freedom of expression” in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. All of this follows Vice President J. D. Vance's speech in February at the Munich Security Conference, where he accused European leaders of retreating from the continent's “most fundamental values,” including free expression.

These assessments might seem untrustworthy, given the flagrant transgressions against free-speech principles from the Trump administration and its allies. But the fact is that European leaders are corroding the right to free expression, and show every sign of sliding further down a slippery slope into illiberalism.

Europe and the United States have always had different free-speech cultures. In the postwar era, both confronted the question of how tolerant societies should treat intolerant factions. Much of Europe concluded that, although free speech is important, views that threaten democracy itself are different and can be criminalized; see laws in various European states against Nazi propaganda. In contrast, the American system protected expression as vile as neo-Nazis marching through a town of Holocaust survivors because, by First Amendment logic, fascist speech poses less of a danger than enabling the state itself to engage in viewpoint discrimination. Despite these differences, both Europe and America mostly expanded speech protections in the 20th century and pulled back from censorship, seeming to converge on liberal values by the time the Iron Curtain fell and the internet spread.

Now Europe and the United States are diverging. Never mind enduring disagreements about how to treat Nazis and other would-be totalitarians. Europe today, in both its individual countries and its shared continental governance, is criminalizing more and more speech that doesn't come close to American thresholds for incitement or harassment.

James Kirchick: What happens where free speech is unprotected

The shift has been gradual, emerging in landmark cases at the European Court of Human Rights, as well as in legislation at the national level. But the new reality is stark. Last year, Amnesty International (hardly a Trump-administration ally) published a report about what the organization's secretary-general, Agnès Callamard, called a “Europe-wide onslaught against the right to protest”; the report documented examples of restrictive laws, use of excessive police force, and arbitrary arrest. It's not just protests. European judges have signed off on the criminalization of the kinds of hate speech that, while easy to revile, pose nothing like Hitlerite peril. When a middle-aged mother lashes out at asylum seekers in a social-media post (later deleted), or a pro-Palestinian marcher chants a slogan that some but not all see as genocidal, or a flyer calls gays “deviants,” a tolerant society can exercise forbearance and respond with counterspeech. European states are often deploying handcuffs instead. And European leaders are pushing to expand the speech that can get a person thrown in prison.

Unfortunately, the Trump administration is so hypocritical on free expression, so unpopular in Europe, and so undiplomatic that it and its supporters are poorly positioned to persuade Europeans to reverse course. But at a time when freedom of expression is under attack across the globe, fighting for the expressive rights of Europeans is still worthwhile.

The American system, of course, isn't absolutist about freedom of expression or permissive of all hate speech. Speech can be punished if it is a “true threat” that intentionally or recklessly makes its target fear violence, or if it constitutes harassment, libel, or incitement. But the U.S. has a very clear, very high threshold for incitement: Per the 1969 Supreme Court case Brandenburg v. Ohio, the speech must be directed toward “producing imminent lawless action” and “likely to incite or produce such action.”

In Europe, the picture is more complicated. The member states of the Council of Europe all have their own laws and are bound by the 1953 European Convention on Human Rights, which states that “everyone has the right to freedom of expression,” including freedom “to receive and impart information and ideas without interference.” But the same treaty notes that member states can restrict that right to advance national security, territorial integrity, or public safety; to prevent disorder or crime; to protect health or morals; and more.

Since shortly after its inception in 1959, the European Court of Human Rights, also known as the Strasbourg Court, has heard cases of alleged violations of the 1953 convention. The court's strongest precedent affirming liberal free-speech values was articulated in a 1976 case called Handyside v. United Kingdom. In it, the court actually ruled in favor of the British government's censorship of a book, for schoolchildren, whose content was deemed obscene. Yet its judgment stated that, in general, freedom of expression is “applicable not only to ‘information' or ‘ideas' that are favourably” or indifferently received, “but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population.” That ethos would be a powerful bulwark for expressive rights, if enforced. Yet in a series of rulings that began in the aughts, the court betrayed that ethos until it was all but abandoned.

One influential case, in 2009, concerned Daniel Féret, a Belgian politician who founded a far-right political party. He published campaign leaflets that included statements such as “stop the Islamization of Belgium” and “save our people from the risk posed by Islam, the conqueror.” A Belgian court convicted Féret of inciting discrimination, hatred, or violence, and punished him with a suspended prison sentence, 250 hours of community service, and 10 years of ineligibility for office. His punishment “had the legitimate aims of preventing disorder,” the court ruled, stating that “incitation to hatred” need not involve calls “for specific acts of violence.” Rather, “insults, ridicule or defamation aimed at specific population groups or incitation to discrimination, as in this case, sufficed.” Punishing insults that could lead to discrimination is a much lower standard than punishing calls for imminent violence that are also likely to lead to it.

In a 2012 case, Vejdeland and Others v. Sweden, four Swedes challenged their conviction for distributing to high schoolers leaflets that called homosexuality a “deviant sexual proclivity” and argued that promiscuous gays were responsible for spreading HIV. The court ruled that discrimination based on sexual orientation is as serious as racial discrimination, and that although the four Swedes might have been trying to initiate debate on “a question of public interest,” they had a duty to avoid “as far as possible” statements that are “unwarrantably offensive,” such as disparaging homosexuals as a group. How far such a duty to avoid offense might extend was unclear. In 2015, the court concluded that European states could be justified in punishing speech that is contrary to the “underlying values” or “spirit” of the European Convention on Human Rights, “namely justice and peace,” but didn't clearly define those values or set forth a test for what violates them.

With online speech offering national authorities more occasions to launch prosecutions, the court set another speech-chilling precedent in 2015: An online news portal in Estonia could be punished for failing to remove hateful comments posted beneath a news article that itself was unobjectionable, the court found. In a similar case, in 2023, the court ruled against a far-right politician from France, Julien Sanchez, who had been punished for failing to delete hateful comments left beneath a Facebook post he wrote, even though he apparently hadn't seen the comments. That ruling included the sweeping statement that because “tolerance and respect for the equal dignity of all” are foundational in a pluralistic democracy, “it may be considered necessary in certain democratic societies to penalise or even prevent all forms of expression that propagate, encourage, promote or justify hatred based on intolerance.” Not only must wrongthink be banned, the court suggested; justifying the wrongthink of others, or failing to adequately monitor and censor it, can be penalized, too.

All of those precedents come from the judicial body charged with protecting free-speech rights. Natalie Alkiviadou, the author of Hate Speech and the European Court of Human Rights, observed recently that although the court has long invoked the necessity of protecting democracy in restricting speech, its reasoning “has drifted far from those original aims.” Now that the court has justified criminalizing so many other forms of speech, no European citizen can trust that the court retains its bygone commitment to protecting ideas that “offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population.”

By repeatedly prioritizing other goods above expressive rights, the European court helped create the conditions for the free-speech crackdowns now seen in numerous countries.

Germany has a unique history that informs its speech restrictions, which are motivated in part by a desire to prevent anything like the Holocaust from happening again. But Iris Hefets, an Israeli-born activist, believed that she was trying to stop a human-rights atrocity when she was arrested at a protest in Berlin for holding a sign that said As a Jew and Israeli, stop the genocide in Gaza. Although she was not criminally charged in that incident, she has been arrested on two other occasions for nonviolent pro-Palestinian protests. A German court convicted another activist for leading a “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” chant in Berlin. Jacob Mchangama, an academic who researches freedom of expression in Europe, reported earlier this year that German police investigations of online speech “happen to literally thousands of people,” including climate activists, pro-Palestinian activists, and ordinary people. “Even posting a book cover on X that features a barely visible swastika on a facemask—intended to draw sarcastic parallels between COVID policies and Nazi-era policies—can lead to a criminal conviction for displaying prohibited symbols,” he wrote.

Simon Cottee: A flawed European ruling on free speech

Denmark has criminalized the inappropriate treatment of holy texts. In Switzerland, a man was fined and sent to prison for 40 days, a sentence upheld last year on appeal, for calling a journalist a “fat activist lesbian” and saying that queer means “degenerate.” After police in Austria raided the home of a Muslim academic at gunpoint, a regional court cited his work on Islamophobia as justification. A court sentenced a Czech teacher to a prison term (which was suspended), probation, and the loss of her ability to teach for three years for telling her class that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was justified.

In Britain, Lucy Connolly, a middle-aged British mother, is serving a 31-month prison sentence for “distributing material with the intention of stirring up racial hatred.” After hearing inaccurate rumors that an asylum seeker had committed a crime, she posted on social media the vile message, “Mass deportation now, set fire to all the fucking hotels full of the bastards for all I care, while you're at it take the treacherous government and politicians with them.” She soon deleted the message. The length of Connolly's sentence has sparked widespread backlash in the country; critics point to criminals who have received lesser punishments for perpetrating actual violence. Just this month, in London, NPR reported, 532 people were arrested when supporters of a pro-Palestinian group recently banned as a terrorist organization gathered to protest.

As important are Britons who have broken no laws but have been harassed by police. In 2023, for example, Julian Foulkes, a retired police officer, implied that a pro-Palestinian social-media post was anti-Semitic, writing that the person who posted it was “one step away from storming Heathrow looking for Jewish arrivals.” The police, who perhaps misunderstood the post, handcuffed him and seized his electronic devices. Later, they “apologised to Mr Foulkes, removed a caution from his record and would hold a review,” the BBC reported. When citizens know that speech cops might show up at their door with handcuffs for an unremarkable post, even speech that censorious laws permit gets chilled.

European leaders are pushing for even more sweeping restrictions. In part, they seek to expand the categories of persons that, according to the Council of Europe, are protected from incitement to hatred or discrimination to include gender, disability, sexual orientation, language, and age, in addition to already protected categories (race, color, religion, and descent or national or ethnic origin). Many are pushing to expand what counts as hate speech, too. In a 2022 strategy paper on how to better combat hate speech, the Council of Europe defined it as “all types of expression that incite, promote, spread or justify violence, hatred or discrimination against a person or group of persons”––note that justifying hatred is a lower standard than advocating it. The European Commission has been pushing a proposal to require that all European Union states make hate speech a crime. And in 2024, the European Parliament urged the European Commission to adopt an open-ended approach to the sorts of discrimination that are banned, rather than a closed list, so that authorities “can adapt to changing social dynamics.”

Criminalizing more and more expansive conceptions of hate speech and applying them to more and more classes of Europeans doesn't just infringe on individual rights. It risks a number of social ills, including beyond Europe.

Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment scholar at Stanford's Hoover Institution, has argued that humans tend to have “censorship envy”: Once my neighbor gets to ban speech that offends him, I feel entitled to ban speech that I revile. This begets efforts to criminalize more speech over time, and can radicalize those who feel they must stand by as others censor. Former ACLU President Nadine Strossen has pointed out that when censorship succeeds in causing hateful people to express their ideas in private but never in public, others lose “the opportunity to dissuade them and to monitor their conduct.” And Greg Lukianoff, the head of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, has argued that censorship is ineffective. “Since the widespread passage of hate speech codes in Europe, religious and ethnic intolerance there has gone up,” he wrote in 2021.

Europeans might retort that the American system, too, has failed to stop threats to freedom of expression. The Trump administration has sued news outlets, used anti-discrimination law to crack down on student protesters, and more, in some instances targeting European citizens. After Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish national studying at Tufts University, wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper that criticized campus administrators for their response to the war in Gaza, the administration suspended her visa and put her in immigration detention.

David A. Graham: The free-speech phonies

But a First Amendment lawsuit helped free Öztürk. And First Amendment protections constrain Donald Trump from detaining American citizens in the same fashion, while some citizens of Europe find themselves jailed in their own countries for political speech. Under the approach that many European leaders favor, Trump could indict half of Bluesky. And if internet companies all begin censoring speech globally by suppressing everything that could conceivably be illegal in Europe, Americans, including Trump critics, will be stifled.

For many with liberal values, or who are averse to criminalizing viewpoints, the kinds of prohibitions that the United States puts on speech go far enough—and Europe's promiscuous prohibitions go too far. Should the right gain more power on the continent (as it has done in Hungary, with dire consequences for free speech), more centrist European leaders could soon realize the risks of the infrastructure they are building to surveil and punish hate speech. Any authoritarian could exploit that infrastructure to disastrous effects. Already, European leaders do more illiberal chilling of speech than Trump, who is doing enough of it himself to prevent America from leading by example.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The second-wave matcha boom isn't really about the tea.

Seemingly out of nowhere, a pale green drink has become a staple in my life. In recent months, the matcha latte has become my primary source of energy throughout the day and my favorite indulgence at night. I order it at coffee shops without missing a beat. I take “aesthetic” photos of the milk swirling with the vibrant green liquid. I can now explain the dubious difference between “ceremonial” and “culinary” grades of the finely ground, lightly caffeinated green tea powder.

Yet something about my newfound appreciation for the Japanese delicacy feels a bit uncanny. Matcha isn't new (to say the least), and I admittedly didn't love it at first try. What changed, and why now? It feels like it was muscled into my kitchen by some invisible force, and my taste buds have magically adjusted to its flavor.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Clearly, I've been influenced. It's not just that my TikTok feed is filled with women showing their matcha orders or tutorials on how to achieve the perfect matcha foam. The powder and its flavor are nearly impossible to avoid in public life. Signs outside coffee shops and bars tout matcha concoctions and cocktails. At bakeries and sweet shops, it seems like every dessert can be made as a matcha hybrid. It's the hottest ingredient across a wide spectrum of products, from skincare to candles to butter to ramen; the Crumbl cookies of beverages that have been popular for more than a thousand years.

That I could succumb to such an enormous trend isn't really the strange part. What's strange is that it feels like we've already done this trend before — and quite recently, too. In the mid-2010s, matcha seemed to achieve its cultural peak in the US — although, it turned out to be more culty than mainstream. Almost a decade later, matcha is suddenly everyone's favorite drink, for real. According to Grand View Research, the tea market generated $391.1 million in revenue last year and is expected to reach $599.5 million by 2030. Now, there are reports of a matcha shortage due to increased demand and limited production.

Unlike many trends that have reentered the zeitgeist, it doesn't seem like we're consuming matcha out of nostalgia. Rather, it's almost like we forgot we were ever introduced to it in the first place. It raises some questions: What ever happened to the “matcha people,” and what does it mean to be a “matcha person” this time around?

2014 was a major year for matcha in the US, signaling the advent of a new, nutrient-rich beverage trend. Sales for the green tea powder grew more than 50 percent, while sales for ready-to-drink matcha products more than doubled. Brands responded quickly. In the mid-2010s, you could shop an assortment of matcha products, from bottled drinks to Trader Joe's baking mix to matcha waffles. Starbucks added it to its instant drink line. The tea craze hit New York City particularly hard, including with the opening of the first matcha-themed cafe in the US in 2014. This trend was partly met with an eyeroll. Critics lamented that Americans were bastardizing the ancient Japanese specialty by giving it the “pumpkin spice latte” treatment.

By the end of the 2010s, though, matcha's relatively low-key boost wasn't the “in” thing: Americans wanted to be jacked up on cold brew and energy drinks. One of the harbingers of our current health and fitness obsession has been the rise of sugar-free, wellness-branded caffeinated beverages, like Celsius and Red Bull Editions.

But in the wake of health concerns and complaints about highly caffeinated energy drinks, matcha has come back around as a more sustainable, less jittery option. In addition to its relatively lighter caffeine content, matcha has a high concentration of the amino acid L-theanine, which induces a calm, focused mindset. But that only partially explains why it's become so unavoidable, even if it's not your literal cup of tea.

Erika Weiss, a marketing expert and professor at Loyal Marymount University, says the growth of social media over the past decade as a driving force in consumer trends has catapulted matcha into a new stratosphere of popularity. It helps that matcha contains the one attribute that matters the most on apps, like TikTok and Instagram: It's “aesthetic.”

“It's a product that's so well-suited for promotion through these social-media platforms,” Weiss says. “It's a beautiful, bright color. You go to an interesting place to find your matcha.”

Outside of discovering matcha at different grocery stores and cafes, the act of preparing the tea is heavily documented on social media. There's the visual part of the ritual — the whisking, the frothing, the pouring, the setting of the table. On TikTok, there's a large emphasis on making the drink itself look pretty, adding different foams and fruits for color. For the most part, though, the attention to detail and aesthetics resembles traditional tea ceremonies in Japan.

“There's a great deal of energy put into expressing one's aesthetic taste and meticulousness, including toward the implements, the tea itself, and the surroundings,” says Stephen Roddy, who teaches Japanese literature at the University of San Francisco.

Online, though, a lot of matcha-making is done alone, often included in users' morning routines. That's an aspect of the current matcha wave that feels very Westernized, the fact that it's become an individualized, self-improvement ritual. “Individual tea performance [in Japan] is not as good as doing it for others,” Roddy says. He describes tea ceremonies in Japan as “very much a social activity that enables people to express solicitude, thoughtfulness, and appreciation for one another.”

“There's a strong sense of historical connection and continuity of the ceremony (‘chanoyu') going back to the 16th century and even earlier,” he says.

Regardless of whom you're enjoying matcha with, Weiss says this “highly experiential” element is exactly why the drink is taking off. She differentiates the tea trend from the much-mocked “pumpkin spice latte” phenomenon, saying that it feels like a more authentic discovery and practice for its consumers.

“This isn't owned and pushed by a big corporate brand like Starbucks,” Weiss says. “There are lots of independent tea shops or coffee shops that are putting this forward. There's the history, the authenticity, the ritualistic nature of what it is, and the fact that it's something that could be enjoyed all through the year. It's not this sort of made-up thing.”

The appeal of matcha seems clear enough: It's pretty. It's healthy. It's fun to try out. And yet, it stands to reason that a grassy, chalky, somewhat bitter drink would be more of an acquired taste than an immediate obsession — because it did take ten years.

Weiss had another expert in mind to help explain the matcha resurgence. Her 16-year-old daughter, Kaia, who's witnessed the trend among her friends and classmates, had a rather simple theory: You can be a matcha drinker without really enjoying — or even experiencing — matcha flavor.

“You can just add so much sugar,” Kaia says. “It basically just tastes like a sugary drink. People who don't actually like the taste of matcha will just go to Starbucks and order the lavender matcha because they want to experience a different flavor profile.”

This is probably why matcha has recently exploded in the form of a latte. Consumers can dilute the taste as much as they want with milk, sweetener, and whatever added syrup. TikTok shows an endless array of matcha fusions and customizations you can make for yourself or order at cafes, some of which border on the absurd. From lemonade to soda to eggnog to espresso, it seems that, for a lot of people, making a “good” matcha involves overcoming the natural taste of it with other ingredients. You could argue this is probably the case with many coffee drinkers. But the even more juvenile options at Starbucks look quite simple compared to the current spectrum of matcha variations.

The current matcha craze is maybe the most literal representation of the tension between our actual tastes and what we feel the pressure to crave in a hyper-consumerist culture. It also seems born out of a reality that seems to partly define the current generation of chronically online youth: isolation.

As Bloomberg reporter Amanda Mull writes about the current flurry of random social media trends, including Labubus, Dubai chocolate, and yes, matcha, a need for community and tangibility is maybe what's simply behind the need to buy into everything on display. “If nothing else, the new ubiquity of a toy or snack is like a signal of some kind of consensus reality bubbling up in spite of algorithmic isolation,” Mull writes.

Overall, it seems like being a matcha person in 2025 is just about wanting to be a person.

﻿Does Trump know he's blowing up the GOP's future?

For all the talk of a new, lasting multiracial coalition that helped elect President Donald Trump, there are clues that this support may be wavering, particularly among Latino voters. Polls show the president's approval rating with this group has plummeted since the last election, and a third of Latinos who voted for him say they are unlikely to back a Republican candidate in the next one.

This collapse happened for a few reasons. Latino voters are souring not only on the president generally, but also on his handling of key issues like immigration and the economy — the very topics that boosted his support with them initially. And curiously, this decline in support for the president isn't translating into a surge for Democrats. Instead, many Latino voters express dissatisfaction with both parties.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

This shifting dynamic suggests that both parties have been operating on flawed assumptions over the last few years. Democrats made the mistake of treating Latinos as a monolithic group, focusing on social justice issues while failing to address economic concerns that were pushing these voters toward the GOP.

Now, Republicans may be poised to make a similar mistake. They have largely viewed these voters as Republicans-in-waiting, banking on a rightward drift that they assume extends to the most extreme parts of the conservative social agenda. This approach risks alienating a large segment of the Latino electorate. Ultimately, both parties are learning a crucial lesson: Demographics aren't destiny, and they need a more nuanced understanding of this diverse and rapidly changing group of voters.

Over the last decade, Trump has remade the American electorate with the help of Latino voters. Back in 2016, his highly racialized and polarizing election victory resulted in one of the worst performances with Latino voters in modern history, winning fewer than three in 10 Hispanic and Latino voters, well below average for Republican candidates.

But splits began to develop among Latino communities in the US over the next few years. Working-class, non-college educated, and male Latinos, as well as those from Florida and the Southwest, began to drift away from Democrats, particularly at the national level. They were more intrigued by Republican pitches centered around the economy, small business growth, and affordability.

At the same time, Democrats were hesitant to admit they had an issue with the Latino population, quibbling over messaging and campaign investments while missing the plot. By the time of the 2020 election, Trump had managed to not just recover his party's losses in 2016, but expand on them, shrinking the Democratic advantage with Latinos by nearly 20 points.

Democrats, it turns out, misread Latino voters' priorities and beliefs, gradually losing support from the peak they had from 2012 to 2016 (when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton enjoyed 40-point margins). The party largely approached Latinos as “voters of color,” marginalized minorities who could be mobilized through appeals to identity, immigrant solidarity, and social justice.

For some time, this worked, but Latinos weren't behaving like a monolithic group. Instead, Latinos would fracture and become more dissimilar during this time, with various kinds of evangelicals, border residents, naturalized immigrants, and working-class Latinos remaining or becoming more conservative as the Democratic Party and its white, college-educated base became more progressive.

Particularly on issues like crime, immigration and the border, and gender roles and identity, the liberal positions that Democrats took — or were portrayed to take — were out of step with the views of many conservative and moderate Latinos from 2020 to 2024.

In 2021, the Pew Research Center found that the most liberal, educated, and politically engaged Democrats exerted outsized influence on their party. By the 2024 election, this created an opening for Republicans, as Latino voters expressed greater openness to Trump and the GOP's stances on the economy, immigration, and abortion. By then, their votes had begun to follow some of their beliefs.

As Democrats stumbled, Republicans stuck to a different approach: treating Latinos as a new kind of white voter. They doubled down on a hawkish and xenophobic immigration message that seemed to resonate with a large minority of Latinos, spoke of the border as an issue of crime and public safety, and talked nonstop about prices and affordability to exploit the lack of trust in Democrats' stewardship of the economy.

Republicans sought to make the old Reagan line, that “Hispanics are conservatives, [but] they just don't know it yet,” come true by hammering home the idea that Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party were too radical and out of touch.

This approach worked. Latinos concerned with immigration and the economy shifted to Republicans, and Trump posted a double-digit boost in support among Latinos, shrinking the Democratic advantage another 20 points.

An array of data suggests that this advantage is looking more short-lived, largely because Republicans aren't taking into account the nuances of Latino voters. The GOP still did not win a majority of Latinos last year — and much of the boost was from disaffected Democrats or more moderate, disengaged Latinos who don't have the same strong ideological leanings as the primarily white MAGA base.

Latino voters are rapidly changing, existing as both a racial minority and an assimilating, formerly immigrant generation. 

The most recent evidence for this divergence comes from two research projects undertaken by the Democratic-aligned Equis Research group. In the spring, they tracked growing dissatisfaction among Latino voters with Trump's handling of the economy, cost of living, and immigration. Even among what Equis calls “Biden defectors,” those former Democrats who switched to supporting Trump in 2024, a slight majority were beginning to turn on Trump's economic policies.

This dynamic extended to immigration, where an overwhelming majority of all Latino voters thought the administration's actions were “going too far and targeting the types of immigrants who strengthen our nation.” Some 36 percent of Trump-voting Latinos said the same thing, and a majority of Biden defectors, some 64 percent, felt the same way.

This suggests some degree of remaining immigrant solidarity among these swingier, evolving segments of the Latino electorate and disapproval over how mass deportations and aggressive anti-immigrant policies will affect law-abiding immigrants and their families.

Nearly two-thirds of Latinos in Equis' polling believe that the Trump administration's actions “will make it difficult for hardworking Latinos to feel safe, by increasing racial profiling and harassing all Latinos regardless of immigration status.” In other words, there is a limit to what various kinds of Latino voters are willing to stomach.

The same dynamic is becoming clearer with regards to the economy, where Latino voters, and new Trump voters specifically, are unhappy with the state of the economy. Biden defectors, Equis finds, are net negative on Trump's economic policies: -6 percent of support in May and -8 percent in July.

Whether this dynamic not only hurts the GOP but also helps Democrats is unclear. Although many Latino voters still believe Republicans favor the wealthy over the working class, this long-standing sentiment is no longer pushing them toward the Democratic Party. Instead, they increasingly distrust both parties on this question.

But together, these signs suggest that the GOP is going too far with their policy and ideological mission in Trump's second term, turning off the new converts they won to their coalition over the last 10 years.

The two major parties are making errors with Latino voters. Both have to moderate their policy and ideological approaches while bringing more nuance to how they campaign.

Latinos do have some things that bind them together, and they are not just like white voters who can ignore discrimination and scapegoating and uprooting of their extended community's lives (as immigration enforcement is showing). At the same time, they need to be talked to with more nuance.

Democrats tried to do this in 2024, moderating on immigration, dropping the usage of the term “Latinx,” and investing in hyper-specific, hyper-local campaigning with various kinds of Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans, and others. But there was only so much campaigning they could do when facing a wave of anti-Biden, anti-incumbent electoral sentiment.

Republicans, meanwhile, toned down immigration talk and zeroed in on subgroups of the Latino electorate in battleground states in 2020. They appealed to religious and ideological conservatives — Cuban, South American, and Puerto Rican communities in Florida, as well as border communities in Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. Some of this nuanced campaigning did carry over to 2024, but it focused more on young and male Latinos in general. And 2024 saw a return to a kind of dog-whistle, racialized, and anti-immigrant scapegoating, which helped the anti-incumbent tide.

Latino voters are rapidly changing, existing as both a racial minority and an assimilating, formerly immigrant generation. Both parties will have to find a middle ground to recover or build up their coalitions. There is no such thing as a Latino voter, but rather, various kinds of Latino voters. Each must be approached differently.

In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy.

There are 90,000 supplements on the market. Do they actually work?

A few weeks ago, Explain It to Me — Vox's weekly call-in podcast — went on a field trip to our local Whole Foods supplement aisle, where there were powders and pills and tinctures galore. These supplements promised to do everything from reducing wrinkles, to maintaining focus, to keeping your gut biome intact. But how much of that is true?

According to Anahad O'Conner, health columnist at the Washington Post, supplements can be a mixed bag. But despite the dubious evidence behind some of them, a lot of us are taking these pills and potions. “The best statistics we have show that at least 60 percent of people in the United States alone use dietary supplements,” he said. “And that's just one supplement or more. I know one doctor who had told a story of a patient who was taking 121 supplements in a day.”

The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

How do we navigate the dizzying world of supplements? And what actually works as advertised? Below is an excerpt of our conversation with O'Connor, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

We're taking these products to feel better, but are they actually making us feel better? 

There could be the placebo effect where people take supplements and think they're getting benefits.

There have been studies showing that selenium is really good for your health and essential, and vitamin E is really good for your health, and it's essential. And scientists will say, “Okaym we need to figure out what doses we should be telling people to take and how often to take these supplements.” They've then found people who take these supplements actually develop side effects and are more likely to develop cancer or heart disease, prostate cancer, things like that, and have been shocked. In fact, what we know is that it's the dose that makes the poison. We need some level of vitamins and nutrients, of course, but taking more and more and more is often not good for your health and can cause a lot of side effects.

So, why are we allowed to take them? How come the FDA isn't stepping in? 

To put it mildly, dietary supplements are very loosely regulated in this country. They're treated almost like they're just food, because they are nutrients that come from food, but then they're purified and concentrated.

Decades ago, the supplement industry pushed for this law called the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which basically created what many critics call the Wild West of the supplement industry. Supplement makers can make all sorts of health claims. They can say that their supplement or their vitamin supports immune health, cardiovascular health, skin health — all these sorts of vague claims. They don't have to undergo clinical trials where they're tested to find out what doses are safe, what the side effects are, if they actually work or not for what's claimed. And the FDA really can't do anything once they're on the market, unless there are reports of severe side effects. Right now, there are an estimated 90,000 different dietary supplements.

The FDA has no idea what most of the products are unless there are many reports of people getting sick from a particular supplement. 

These companies don't have to register their products at all with the FDA. The FDA has no idea what most of the products are unless there are many reports of people getting sick from a particular supplement.

And, in fact, you and I can easily create our own supplement company in five minutes. You can just create a website, get some powder, put it in a capsule, and start marketing your supplement. You don't have to do any studies or notify any agency. You can just start marketing it.

I think we should talk about a few of these supplements. Should we be taking those daily multivitamins? 

If you are eating a healthy diet, then it's very unlikely that you actually need a multivitamin. Although there have been some studies showing benefits. For example, in older adults, it's been shown that taking a daily multivitamin could potentially help with memory loss, for example.

Another thing everyone talks about is gut health. People say it can impact more than just your stomach. Should we be taking probiotics? 

Probiotics are basically any bacteria or microbe that confers health benefits. You want a diverse community of gut microbes. You want a healthy ecosystem. But if you take a probiotic in capsule or pill form, what happens is that oftentimes they contain a limited number of species of bacteria in very concentrated mega-doses that can throw off the balance of your gut microbial ecosystem.

Probiotics are good for you, and you can get them from fermented foods. So, you think about things like sauerkraut, kimchi, Greek yogurt, for example. Humans have been consuming fermented foods for thousands of years, and they contain these healthy live microbes. If you're just taking the probiotics in capsule or pill form, there can be side effects, and you can actually reduce the diversity of your gut microbiome rather than enhance it.

I have a couple of more supplements to ask you about. One is collagen. I admit that I bought some back when my favorite influencer at the time was putting it in her macha lattes, and now it's sitting there gathering dust on my coffee bar. Should we be taking it? 

No, I don't think so. I haven't seen any convincing studies that show any benefits of taking collagen supplements. That is something that I would not particularly waste money on.

Unless you have a documented, demonstrated deficiency, you should be focusing on getting your nutrients and vitamins from your diet.

What about creatine? Who should be taking this beyond your gym bros who are trying to get buff? 

Creatine has been around for a while, and there have been a lot of studies on its benefits. It's something that you can obtain naturally from food, particularly meat. And there have been studies showing that when you take a creatine supplement in combination with resistance training, then you can get some benefits from that. Particularly, it'll help you grow bigger and stronger, but the benefits are not extraordinary. It might help you gain a few extra reps out of your bench press or your squat, for example. What they have also shown is that if you're just taking creatine and not lifting weights, then you're not going to see any benefits from it.

There's been a lot of health claims that it can improve your cognitive health, help with dementia. There haven't been any real good studies demonstrating that. That's not to say that it's not true, just that it hasn't really been shown conclusively.

Any final thoughts on supplements? Should we be as invested in them as we are? 

I am not anti-supplement. I still take some supplements here and there. Protein powder, for example, is something I'll add to my smoothies.

Just be cognizant that there is a multibillion-dollar industry that wants the profit off of you by selling you their products, and they're allowed to make all sorts of health claims and there are a lot of potential side effects. I always tell people, unless you have a documented demonstrated deficiency, you should be focusing on getting your nutrients and vitamins from your diet just by eating a lot of healthy whole foods, which is what human beings have been doing for millennia and has always worked. If you're going to take supplements, be really careful about which ones you're taking, make sure that you actually need it, that you're actually getting benefits, and don't just believe what the industry wants you to believe.

Why it feels like people are more impolite than ever.﻿

It's a question, a lingering suspicion that has bedeviled nearly every generation: Are the kids these days getting more rude, more brash, more grossly unapologetic?

“We have stories of Emily dealing with this question, we have stories of our grandmother dealing with this question,” says Lizzie Post, the great-great-granddaughter of etiquette maven Emily Post and co-president of the Emily Post Institute. “Five generations gives us the length of time to prove this one out that we really do constantly look back at times nostalgically and say that they were more polite.”

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Society certainly seems to think we've collectively gotten more rude. According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, nearly half of the country believes people's behavior is more impolite than before the pandemic. Enter any public space and you're bound to encounter someone having a phone call on speaker, fellow passengers mixing up egg salad on a plane, or students leaving class unannounced. These incidents inevitably become flashpoints of heated debate online.

Unchecked incivility has wide-reaching consequences. Bearing witness to behavior that you find rude, whether face-to-face or electronically, leads to worse mood and decreased cognitive performance. When someone is rude to you, you may become defensive and less likely to cooperate — no one wants to spend time and energy interacting with a jerk. Impoliteness is actually contagious, spreading from one person to another: When you experience something impolite, you're more likely to spot other supposedly rude behavior and act impolitely yourself.

“Are we ruder? I don't know, but I know we're less aware of each other, we do not pay as much attention to our impact on one another.”

Post can't say for sure whether our current culture is more impolite than generations' past, but she does believe we're living through a crisis of attention that can lead to disrespectful behaviors. Perpetually distracted and always looking at screens, we've become accustomed to switching topics mid-conversation or checking email over dinner. And that's just how we treat the people we know. We hardly consider the comfort of strangers when playing a YouTube video sans headphones on a crowded bus.

“Are we ruder?” Post says. “I don't know, but I know we're less aware of each other, we do not pay as much attention to our impact on one another, and we have more ways to be annoying to each other or rude or dismissive than we've ever had before.”

There may also be bigger factors underlying our supposed epidemic of rudeness. Christine Porath, a professor at the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School and the author of Mastering Civility: A Manifesto for the Workplace, conducted a global survey in 2022 of 2,000 people who either had customer-facing jobs or observed those who did. Porath found that 73 percent of respondents said it wasn't unusual for customers to behave badly, compared to 61 percent who said the same in her 2012 survey. “The number one reason that I found for people being rude is feeling stressed or overwhelmed,” Porath says. “If you think about the last few years, Covid in particular, contributed to this, but plenty of other stressors, the uncertainty…a lot of negativity that we're taking in in society, a lot of people angrier or on edge or frustrated.”

“Rude,” of course, can mean many things to as many people. Some may not bat an eye when students leave class unannounced, others see it as a breach of the social code. But, as Post notes, your definition of what's “rude” is shaped by personal experience and preference.

According to Post, you might label an action as rude if it has offended, disrespected, or made you uncomfortable. Jennifer Loh, a management and human resources professor at the University of Canberra in Australia, classifies “rude” as an action, behavior, or comment meant to convey disrespect that also violates a social norm. When you expect to be treated one way and others fail to meet that standard, you might consider it impolite.

These breaches can be direct or indirect, says Amy Irwin, a senior lecturer in the School of Psychology at the University of Aberdeen. Overly critiquing a friend's performance at an open mic may be construed as directly rude. Staring at your phone while someone attempts to converse with you is a passive form of incivility. There's also an element of ambiguity at play, Irwin says, since you never really know if a colleague purposely ignored you when you greeted them (rude) or if they simply didn't see you (can be forgiven).

Lizzie Post, the co-president of the Emily Post Institute, offers some clarity on oft-devisive behaviors.

But everyone's idea of what is normal, acceptable behavior differs. People learn what is kosher from those around them: parents, extended family, friends, culture writ large, Post says. You may have grown up in a family where eating in front of the TV was customary, but your romantic partner might find the idea horrifying.

While age often gets blamed for rudeness — the classic “kids these days” knock — generational differences in incivility can be attributed to the culture in which you grew up. Younger people who grew up alongside technology may find it appropriate to scroll TikTok in social settings. Those who were exposed to tech later in life could be offended by even the presence of a phone in a one-on-one hangout.

In a study of Australian millennials, Gen Xers and boomers, Loh found younger participants consider it good manners to respond to a text immediately. “Whereas for the older generation,” she says, “not responding straight away doesn't seem to worry them too much because they don't think it's actually rude.”

Your present social context also plays a role in whether you consider an act rude, Irwin notes. Burping loudly in a bar is more widely accepted than burping in the middle of a meeting. “You can take exactly the same behavior,” she says, “put it in a different context, and it's viewed completely differently by the same person.” And the closer you are to the offender, the more likely you are to excuse their behavior, anyway.

More broadly, each culture has its own social niceties, so while it might be acceptable for you to scarf down a snack while walking on the street in the US, you might get a few confused glances in Japan.

When instances of impropriety abound, Post says it's crucial to be aware of the behavior you're modeling, both to peers and the kids in your life, and explain why courtesy is so important — that it isn't just to police others' behavior, but to provide a framework of respect. “Taking the time when you're at the dinner table to talk about why we don't chew with our mouth wide open,” she says.

Leaders at work, coaches, and teachers can set expectations for what behavior is appropriate for the office, the field, the classroom, and hold people accountable, Porath says.

Reflect on how you interact with others: Are you constantly on your phone at the dinner table? Do you cut off colleagues in meetings? Do you leave your shopping cart in the middle of the grocery store parking lot? How do you speak to waiters and other service workers? If there were recent moments where you fell short — maybe you were a little terse with a barista — consider where you went wrong, Post says. Moving forward, try to be more mindful of the impact you have on others.

It can help to start noticing polite behaviors all around you: The guy at the doctor's office who held the door open for another patient; someone appropriately covering their mouth when they sneeze in public. They're not as few and far between as you might think. “It's important to recognize that the positive can have such a big impact,” Post says. “Looking for the good moments of behavior that you see out in the world, starts to remind you that they're there, that you can participate in too.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I burned out working at consulting firms like KPMG and became a stay-at-home dad. I feel some guilt, but I'm glad I left.","https://www.businessinsider.com/consultant-left-corporate-stay-at-home-dad-raise-sons-2025-8","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 09:07:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nicholas Gilpin, a 38-year-old stay-at-home dad and entrepreneur from Fair Oaks, California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I never planned to be a stay-at-home dad.

When I was an information technology consultant at KPMG, there were some weeks when I worked almost 100 hours across all seven days.

Now, I spend those hours with my sons — a very different environment. Almost three years since becoming a full-time stay-at-home dad, I'm glad to invest this time I can't get back with my sons.

At KPMG, the burnout was relentless. I managed million-dollar technology implementations and worked nonstop. In late 2021, I joined Crossfuze, a consulting company, as a project manager and worked there for a little over a year.

In 2022, my wife and I were expecting our first child, and her pregnancy needed more attention from us both. She was also working full-time as a case manager at a health insurance company, but needed to take time off before the birth to keep up with doctor's visits.

Supporting my wife and keeping up with client demands became too much. We felt it made sense for me to take a break from working, so two weeks before my first son was born, I clocked out of the corporate world and clocked in as a full-time dad.

We'd spent years trying to have children, and the months of visits to the doctor's offices took an immense emotional and mental toll on both my wife and me. So, when our first son was born through IVF, and our second two years later naturally, it was a gift we didn't want to take for granted.

At Crossfuze, I was making $135,000 a year before my son was born. That loss of salary didn't play a large part in my transition to being a full-time dad, though. We'd always planned for one of us to stay home with the kids. Ultimately, we saw having a parent home as more valuable than maintaining two full-time incomes.

We didn't want to outsource parenting. We don't know what a day care or babysitter might be teaching our kids, and the time spent driving them to and from those programs may negate the benefit of sending them there in the first place.

Are you a working parent not paying for childcare? Fill out this quick form or email bdelk@businessinsider.com to share your story.

I'm with my boys every hour of the day, and sometimes, we sleep in the same room throughout the night. My first son is almost 3 years old now, so he requires much more attention and play time, while my other son, almost 6 months old now, spends more time with his mom.

I take care of 70 to 80% of the daytime responsibilities, and my wife takes care of our family when she's not working. She's the most active with our boys in the evenings and weekends.

Thankfully, my wife and I worked hard early in our careers, and she can support us through her private mental health counseling practice. We also bought a duplex and rented out half of it to help cover our mortgage.

We've really had to get intentional about what matters most. Personally, I don't buy anything unless it's essential — supplements, a gym membership, and basic toiletries. We rarely go out to eat, and I cook nearly all of our meals at home. My mom has also helped provide essentials for our boys, and my wife's parents have contributed financially since our youngest was born.

We're making it work — but every dollar has a job.

A part of me wants to rebuild my career to support my family more financially. Society's expectation for fathers has always hinged on them being providers. While this era of parents is evolving away from stereotypical parenting roles, I still feel a sense of guilt for not providing as much while our sons grow up.

I have to remind myself that I'm doing enough for my family through the hours of spending time with them, potty training, going on walks around the neighborhood, playing in the backyard, and making them breakfast.

This has been my biggest challenge when trying to have it all as a dad.

I spent most of my adult life connecting with clients, working on projects, and advancing my career. I've invested heavily in my skills throughout my career and obtained my MBA.

When it's just my sons and me during the week, I lack the adult conversations I was used to. It can feel isolating, and like I'm regressing in my career or missing out on the latest tech advancements.

A month after my first son was born, ChatGPT was released to the public. Seeing the way AI has been implemented to outsource work, code, and handle menial tasks around the office makes me feel like I'm missing out on a major tech advancement in my field.

But staying home has also given me the space to build my own business and work on the book I'm writing, ""Thriving Dad,"" during my sons' naps or after their bedtimes.

AI models have leveled the playing field for entrepreneurs like me as I try to rebuild my career a couple of hours at a time, since 100% of my day is invested in my boys.

I use ChatGPT as a personal assistant to help manage all the tasks and coding I want to get done during the day, and chip away at the business I want to sculpt.

Balancing my time between childcare, spending time with my wife, and rebuilding my career is a challenge.

I find spending time with my sons incredibly rewarding. I grew up without a father in my life, and I consider the time I spend with my sons to be unfulfilled time I didn't have with my father. In a way, I'm kind of winging it.

Time is invaluable when children are young, and I want to pour this experience into my sons while I stay home.

While it's difficult to pinpoint the most rewarding experience of being a dad, recently, my oldest said, ""I love you, daddy,"" for the first time. That hit me hard.

Seeing these milestones for both of them and seeing parts of myself in them, I am immensely grateful to give them what I couldn't have and what I needed as a child. When I look at my boys, I see a lot of love every single day.

In this article

Robinhood announced Tuesday that the online broker is launching new prediction markets for professional and college-level football.

Customers will now be able to trade on the outcomes of ""the most popular"" NFL and college football games on the Robinhood app. Robinhood said those games would include regular season pro matchups and all college Power Four schools games.

The prediction markets are currently rolling out, according to Robinhood, and will be available to customers ""in the coming days,"" with plans to launch the first two weeks of the regular football seasons and eventually add weekly matchups.

""Adding pro and college football to our prediction markets hub is a no-brainer for us as we aim to make Robinhood a one-stop shop for all your investing and trading needs,"" Robinhood Vice President of Futures and International JB Mackenzie said in a statement.

The new move comes as Robinhood is aggressively expanding its prediction markets and wades deeper into the sports wagering arena. On its second-quarter earnings call last month, CFO Jason Warnick said the company is seeing its strongest engagement in sports wagers, with CEO Vlad Tenev adding that the company sees ""a big opportunity"" in sports betting.

The broker added that the football prediction markets will differ from sports betting, allowing buyers and sellers to engage with each other to set the price. Robinhood said it expects the football prediction markets to be tradeable everyday between 8 a.m. ET and 3 a.m. ET.

Since first unveiling its prediction markets at the end of of last year, Robinhood said it's seen more than 2 billion contracts traded.

The stock is up more than 400% over the one-year period.

In this article

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Intel must give the U.S. government an equity stake in the company in return for CHIPS Act funds.

""We should get an equity stake for our money,"" Lutnick said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it.""

Shares of the struggling chipmaker climbed 7% Tuesday, continuing to rally on recent reports that the Trump administration is weighing different ways to get involved with the company.

Bloomberg reported Monday that the White House was discussing a 10% stake in Intel, in a deal that could see the U.S. government become the chipmaker's largest shareholder.

Intel and SoftBank announced on Monday that the Japanese conglomerate will make a $2 billion investment in the chipmaker. The investment, equal to about 2% of Intel, makes SoftBank the fifth-biggest shareholder, according to FactSet.

Lutnick said any potential arrangement wouldn't provide the government with voting or governance rights in Intel.

""It's not governance, we're just converting what was a grant under Biden into equity for the Trump administration, for the American people,"" Lutnick said. ""Non-voting.""

Intel declined to comment.

Lutnick also suggested that President Donald Trump could seek out similar deals with other CHIPS recipients.

Intel said last fall that it had finalized a nearly $8 billion grant from the law to build its factories. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was awarded $6.6 billion under the legislation to boost chip fabrication at its Arizona facilities.

Trump has called for more reshoring of U.S. manufacturing to reduce the country's reliance on companies like Samsung and TSMC to manufacture chips.

Intel has been spending billions near Columbus, Ohio, to build a series of chip factories that the company previously called the ""Silicon Heartland."" Intel has said that the factory complex would be able to produce the most advanced chips, including AI chips.

But in July, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a memo to employees that there would be ""no more blank checks,"" and that it was slowing down the construction of its Ohio factory complex, depending on market conditions. 

The first factory is now scheduled to start operations in 2030.

The Ohio factory was one of the most public projects funded by the CHIPS and Science Act, which became law in 2022. The law committed the U.S. government to fund chip development and research and was estimated to cost about $53 billion.

""The Biden administration literally was giving Intel for free, and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies just giving them money for free,"" Lutnick said. ""Donald Trump turns that into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money. If we're going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.' ""

Intel has struggled to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom in advanced semiconductors and has spent heavily to stand up a manufacturing business that's yet to secure a significant customer. Intel tapped Lip-Bu Tan to be its CEO in March after his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was ousted in December.

Tan met with Trump at the White House last week after the president called for his resignation, alleging he had ties to China.

In this article

Nvidia said Tuesday that it is evaluating several products following a report that the company is working on a new artificial intelligence chip for China that is more powerful than the currently available H20.

The new product, tentatively called the B30A, is expected to be based on Nvidia's Blackwell chip architecture, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the company's plans. Nvidia hopes to deliver sample units to Chinese clients for testing as soon as next month, according to Reuters.

""We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow,"" the company told CNBC in a statement. ""Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use.""

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and said he wouldn't be surprised if Huang wants to sell a new chip to China.

""I'm sure he's pitching the president all the time,"" Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I've listened to him pitch the president, and the president listens to our great technology companies, and he'll decide how he wants to play it.""

Earlier this month, Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their sales in China, in exchange for permission to resume selling chips in the region.

The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns. Nvidia built its China-specific H20 chip after the Biden administration implemented export controls on AI chips in 2023, while AMD developed the MI308 chip for the Chinese market.

President Donald Trump said last week that he originally requested a 20% cut of Nvidia's sales, but that Huang negotiated the number down to 15%.

Trump suggested at the time that he would be open to Nvidia selling a significantly scaled-down version of its advanced Blackwell chip in China.

""It's possible I'd make a deal"" on a ""somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell"" processor, Trump said. ""In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.""

Apple has reportedly boosted iPhone production in India as the country faces pressure from the White House over its Russian oil purchases.

""We have planned to up the tariffs on India,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday. ""These are secondary tariffs for buying the sanctioned Russian oil.""

Bessent accused India of ""profiteering"" by purchasing cheap Russian oil and reselling it during the Ukraine war, ""which is unacceptable.""

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump hiked tariffs on India to 50%. The president said in July that he would impose secondary tariffs ""at about 100%"" on Russia's trading partners if a peace deal isn't reached with Ukraine by September.

His comments came as Bloomberg reported that technology giant Apple has reportedly upped production at five of its factories in India as it readies for the launch of its new iPhone 17 models.

The expansion includes some new plants and factories belonging to the Tata Group and contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn Technology, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter. Apple is also looking to create a new iPhone 17e in India next year, according to the report.

In recent years, Apple has shifted more production to India as it looks to reduce its reliance on China, especially in the wake of recent trade tensions.

Data from Canalys in May estimated that iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. grew 76% in May as trade restrictions loomed.

At the same time, Apple has committed to investing over $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years to improve American manufacturing production.

That includes a $100 billion spending expansion this month, which included a $2.5 billion investment to expand iPhone glass maker Corning's production.

This commitment to building in the U.S. should put Apple in the clear on India-related tariffs.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday he will begin interviewing candidates for Federal Reserve chair as soon as the White House whittles down what has suddenly become a crowded field.

In a CNBC ""Squawk Box"" interview, Bessent confirmed the race to replace current Chair Jerome Powell is between 11 candidates, an array that includes past and present central bank officials as well as economists, a White House advisor and a few Wall Street market experts.

""In terms of the interview process, we've announced 11 very strong candidates. I'm going to be meeting with them probably right after Labor Day, and to start bringing down the list to present to President Trump,"" he said. ""It's an incredible group.""

That list is believed to include current Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, White House economist Kevin Hassett and former Governor Kevin Warsh. Strategists Rick Rieder of BlackRock and David Zervos of Jefferies also are part of the group, as well as economist Marc Sumerlin, former Governor Larry Lindsey and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.

Though Powell's term does not end until May 2026, the White House is keen to get the process moving as it pushes an urgent need for interest rate cuts.

Bessent repeated the administration's desire for easing, saying it would help the moribund U.S. housing market. Sales and new building have been weak, with low inventory pushing prices higher.

""If we keep constraining home building, then what kind of inflation does that create one or two years out?"" he said. ""So a big cut here could facilitate a boom or a pickup in home building, which will keep prices down one two years down the road.""

The Fed does not have a policy meeting again until Sept. 16-17, where it is widely expected to approve its first quarter percentage point reduction since December 2024. Bessent said he was not concerned about a producer price index reading for July that showed the largest monthly increase in three years, as he attributed much it to a rise in portfolio fees tied to higher stock market values.

Before then, Powell on Friday will give what is likely his final keynote address at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. That speech could focus on a review the central bank does every five years of its policy, but Powell also may choose to tip the Fed's hand on the September vote.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday accused India of profiteering from cheap Russian oil imports during the war in Ukraine, describing the practice as ""arbitrage"" and condemning it as unacceptable.

""They are just profiteering. They are reselling,"" Bessent told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in an interview. ""This is what I would call the Indian arbitrage — buying cheap Russian oil, reselling it as product.""

""They've made $16 billion in excess profits — some of the richest families in India,"" Bessent said.

India buys Russian oil at a discount due to sanctions, refines it into gasoline and diesel, and then sells the product back to regions that have sanctioned Moscow such as Europe, said Matt Smith, an oil market analyst at Kpler.

India's imports of Russian oil have surged since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Before the attack, India imported a minuscule amount of Russian crude.

India is now Russia's biggest customer importing 1.5 million barrels per day in July, according to data from Kpler. China is the second-largest buyer of Russian oil, importing about 1 million bpd last month.

President Donald Trump earlier this month ordered an additional 25% tariff on India's exports to the U.S. to punish New Delhi for buying Russian oil. The tariffs take effect next week.

Trump is threatening what he calls ""secondary tariffs"" on Russian oil buyers like India to pressure the Kremlin to reach a negotiated settlement with Ukraine. So far, however, the U.S. has spared China from secondary tariffs over its imports of Russian crude.

When asked about China's imports, Bessent suggested that Beijing's imports were less egregious in the eyes of the Trump administration because it was also a major buyer before Russia invaded Ukraine.

But India actually started purchasing Russian oil in a major way at the behest of the U.S., said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy and a former advisor to President George W. Bush.

The Biden administration had asked India to accept Russian crude as other countries imposed bans in order to prevent a major oil price spike after the invasion of Ukraine that would result in high gasoline prices in the U.S., McNally told CNBC.

""India played a key role in the price cap sanction mechanism designed by the U.S. and its European allies to ensure Russian oil still flowed while trying to crimp the revenue Moscow earned,"" McNally said.CNBC has reached out to the Indian Embassy in the U.S. for comment.

GPT-5 just launched. GPT-6 is already on the way.

That's the message OpenAI CEO Sam Altman delivered to reporters in San Francisco last week, offering a rare glimpse into the company's evolving product road map, as well as its missteps.

Altman didn't give a release date for his company's next artificial intelligence model, but he made clear that GPT-6 will be different and that it will arrive faster than the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5. It won't just respond to users but will adapt to them, and allow people to create chatbots that mirror personal tastes.

He said he sees memory as the key for making ChatGPT truly personal. It needs to remember who you are — your preferences, routines and quirks — and adapt accordingly.

""People want memory,"" Altman said. ""People want product features that require us to be able to understand them.""

He said OpenAI has been working closely with psychologists to help shape the product, measuring how people feel while tracking well-being over time. The company hasn't made that data public, but Altman indicated it might.

He also said that future versions of ChatGPT would comply with a recent executive order from the Trump administration that requires AI systems used by the federal government to be ideologically neutral and customizable

""I think our product should have a fairly center-of-the-road, middle stance, and then you should be able to push it pretty far,"" Atlman said. ""If you're like, 'I want you to be super woke' — it should be super woke.""

He added that if a user wanted the model to be conservative, it should also reflect that as well.

Altman's comments about GPT-6 follow a rocky rollout of GPT-5. Users took to social media to complain about the model being colder, less connected and less helpful than the prior version.

""I like the new one much better,"" he said, acknowledging that the rollout was mishandled. He noted that OpenAI quietly pushed a tone update to GPT-5 that's ""much warmer.""

While Altman called enhanced memory his favorite feature launched this year, he said there are privacy concerns, particularly because temporary memory isn't encrypted. That means sensitive information could potentially be exposed without stronger safeguards. Altman confirmed that encryption ""very well could be"" added, though there's no timeline yet.

Queries involving legal or medical information, he said, need to be treated with adequate privacy protections that aren't in place today.

""It's in society's interest for people to get good medical advice … good legal advice,"" he said. ""And if you can get better versions of those from AI, you ought to be able to have the same protection for the same reason we decided you could get them from a doctor or a lawyer.""

He's looking to the future and brain-computer interfaces. Altman said he finds ""neural interfaces a cool idea"" and imagines being able to ""think something and have ChatGPT respond.""

""There are a few areas adjacent to AI that I think are worth us doing something, and this is one of them,"" he said, adding that he's also interested in energy, novel substrates, robots and faster ways to build data centers.

For now, OpenAI's core consumer product remains ChatGPT, and Altman said he's focused on making it more flexible and more useful in daily life. He said he already relies on it for everything from work to parenting questions.

He said, however, that there are limits.

""The models have already saturated the chat use case,"" Altman said. ""They're not going to get much better. ... And maybe they're going to get worse.""

In this article

Nexstar Media has agreed to buy smaller rival Tegna for $3.54 billion, creating a local-TV powerhouse that seeks to compete better with Big Tech and national media for advertising dollars.

Tuesday's deal will expand Nexstar's presence in nine of the top 10 U.S. markets, covering 80% of TV households in the country. That could provide the company, already the largest operator of regional U.S. TV stations, with greater leverage in talks with advertisers and pay-TV distributors.

Nexstar owns or has partnered with others for over 200 stations, while Tegna owns 64. Their deal is the latest in a fast-consolidating U.S. media industry, which is hoping for looser antitrust regulation under President Donald Trump.

Deal-making in the sector has also gathered steam as cable TV operators scramble to adapt to shifting consumer habits driven by cord-cutting and the rapid expansion of streaming.

""The initiatives being pursued by the Trump administration offer local broadcasters the opportunity to expand reach, level the playing field, and compete more effectively with the Big Tech and legacy Big Media companies,"" Nexstar CEO Perry Sook said.

Nexstar's offer price of $22 per share represents a premium of nearly 44% to Tegna's closing price on Aug. 8, before reports of a deal emerged. The deal is valued at $6.2 billion, including debt and other transaction expenses.

Shares of Tegna climbed more than 3% to $20.85 premarket, adding on to the near 21% gain the stock has seen this month on the expectations of a takeover.

The deal, which is expected to close by the second half of 2026, will boost Nexstar's reach by expanding its presence in key markets such as Atlanta, Phoenix and Seattle and would generate annual net savings of about $300 million.

If Tegna terminates the merger to accept a better offer, it must pay Nexstar $120 million, and if the deal falls through as a result of not securing regulatory approval, Nexstar will pay Tegna $125 million, a regulatory filing with the SEC showed.

In this article

Best Buy is launching a third-party marketplace, as it tries to bulk up the variety of merchandise it offers and reverse slower sales.

Starting on Tuesday, shoppers who go to Best Buy's website and app will see products and brands that weren't available there before, including more tech-related accessories like custom video game controllers and some nontech items including seasonal decor and sports collectibles.

The company's online marketplace riffs off those of other retailers, such as Amazon and Walmart, by relying on third-party sellers to stock, sell and ship inventory and taking a cut of their sales in the form of a commission.

""Everything we do is really centered around the customer and their technology needs, and we do see customers actually doing a lot of consumer electronics transactions through marketplaces,"" Chief Customer, Product and Fulfillment Officer Jason Bonfig said. ""And as a result of that, we need to make adjustments to be where the customer's at.""

He said Best Buy noticed gaps in its assortment that the new platform will help it fill. For instance, Bonfig said the company didn't carry batteries for some older cameras or cases for older smartphones. And it didn't offer some items that complement Best Buy purchases, such as furniture that goes around a big-screen TV or cookware to use with a new kitchen appliance.

Along with adding those items, the marketplace makes it possible for smaller vendors with innovative products to sell on Best Buy's website when they're not yet big enough to make or distribute the volume needed for its stores, he added.

Best Buy's marketplace launches at a time when its business could use a boost. Its annual sales have declined over the past three years as the company contends with a sluggish housing market, selective consumer spending and a decline in device replacements after a spike in tech purchases during the Covid pandemic.

The company cut its sales outlook in May and said it expects full-year revenue to range from $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion. That would be similar to Best Buy's annual revenue of $41.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year, but below the numbers it posted in the years leading up to and during the pandemic.

Best Buy will share its most recent earnings results and sales forecast on Aug. 28.

Tariffs have complicated the backdrop for Best Buy, too, since the higher duties have added costs for consumer electronics vendors and distracted them from other priorities like research and development that leads to new and innovative products, said Jonathan Matuszewski, a retail analyst at Jefferies. He said Best Buy tends to win sales instead of big-box or online competitors when there's a leap forward in technology.

With the platform's launch, Best Buy joins other retailers that have jumped on the trend of introducing or expanding third-party marketplaces. Lowe's and Nordstrom started marketplaces last year. Ulta Beauty plans to launch its own later this year. And Target said it will expand its existing marketplace, Target Plus.

On Best Buy's earnings call in May, CEO Corie Barry described the third-party marketplace as one of the company's strategic priorities for the year. She said that new profit stream ""is even more important in this environment"" and will provide greater flexibility with the range of items and price points.

Plus, she said the marketplace supports the company's growing advertising business. Sellers can buy ads for their products, including by paying for better placement in search results.

Marketplaces and the advertising opportunities that come with them tend drive higher profits for retailers, said Justin MacFarlane, a managing director for the global retail group of AlixPartners. Sellers buy, stock and ship products instead of the retailer, and take on both the expense of buying inventory and the risk that they may have to mark down unwanted items, he said.

Yet the business model comes with risks, too, he said. For instance, sellers may not have the same standards as a retailer and it could anger a retailer's customers if they send products in torn boxes, with missing pieces or days later than expected. And he said retailers can flood their websites with so many different categories, brands and products that they overwhelm customers with choices that seem irrelevant to their company's identity.

""You get addicted to the growth and more is more until it's not,"" he said.

At launch, Best Buy's marketplace will have about 500 sellers, Bonfig said. He said the company vetted applicants and whittled them down to the ones who can provide a high-quality customer experience. The sellers must match Best Buy's return policy, he added.

Customers can return purchases either directly to the seller or to Best Buy stores, he said.

On the face of it, talks on Monday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders went well.

The U.S. and Ukrainian leaders were pictured looking jovial and smiling together — a far cry from the extraordinary shouting match and public humiliation inflicted on Zelenskyy during his last trip to the White House in February.

Monday's talks, which involved a raft of European leaders, appeared to make progress toward ending the protracted war between Russia and Ukraine, with Trump saying a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy would be arranged, followed by a trilateral meeting that he would join.

The most significant development result for Kyiv and Europe, however, was Trump's statement that security guarantees for Ukraine would be ""provided"" by European countries in ""coordination with the U.S.""

Describing that as a ""major step forward,"" Zelenskyy said later that the package of security guarantees for Ukraine — highly coveted by Kyiv's leadership and seen as a deterrent to future Russian aggression — will include a massive purchase of American weapons, with financing reportedly supported by Europe. The agreement would be ""formalized on paper within the next week to 10 days,"" he said.

As for what the security guarantees could include, the detail is still scant. Trump commented at a post-talks press conference that Europe would ""take a lot of the burden"" for these, but said the U.S. would help and would make it ""very secure.""

In any case, security guarantees likely mean that Europe, and the so-called ""Coalition of the Willing"" of countries offering to oversee a peace deal, is on the hook to fulfill what they've previously promised.        

French President Emmanuel Macron hinted Tuesday that the ""first security guarantee we are working on — and it is the most important — is a strong Ukrainian army, composed of several hundred thousand men, well equipped, with defense systems and higher standards.""

""The second is to have reassurance forces, the British, the French, the Germans, the Turks, and others ready to carry out these operations — not on the front line, not in a provocative way, but reassurance operations in the air, at sea, and on land. The goal is to send a strategic signal: peace in Ukraine is also our concern,"" he told French broadcaster TF1-LCI, in comments translated by NBC News.

Jaroslava Barbieri, research fellow at Chatham House, told CNBC Tuesday that the overall mood from the talks on Monday was one of ""cautious optimism,"" but there are many unknowns.

""However, we have to say that the Kremlin's maximalist demands on Ukraine have not changed and so there's still a number of uncertainties about the security guarantees, the details, who is going to be doing what, if there are any troop deployments then where will they be stationed and for how long, which countries will be contributing?"" she asked.

European leaders have voiced misgivings over the lack of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine before a peace deal is negotiated, but they seem willing to acquiesce, for now, with the end goal of peace and Ukraine and Europe's security in mind.

Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania's former foreign minister, told CNBC Tuesday that Europe still appeared to be struggling to be heard, saying the bloc had not yet found its strength and ""ability to create leverage.""

""What came out of the meeting yesterday was that Europe was asking the U.S. yesterday to continue its assistance, to ask for a ceasefire, to assist any stationing of troops, and then some of the leaders were even saying, 'Well, some of the Ukrainian territories might be lost, but that's a reality.' Well, that doesn't sound like Europe finding it's strength,"" he said.

""It's more like Europe agreeing that, 'we are in a very weak position and we have to please President Trump as much as we can and we have nothing to put on the table',"" he noted. 

What's more, it's unclear whether the Kremlin will even agree to direct talks with Zelenskyy. Putin's presidential aide Yuri Ushakov stated Monday that Trump and Putin had discussed ""that it would be necessary to study the possibility of raising the level of representatives of the Ukrainian and Russian sides,"" but that no firm decision was made.

The proposed future summits between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy would keep a process towards a possible resolution of the conflict alive, but it would still follow the Russian script of a no-ceasefire scenario, Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, cautioned.

""Putin may already set difficult conditions for a meeting with Zelenskyy. And in a meeting with Zelenskyy, Putin's major goal may be to pin the blame for any failure on Zelenskyy instead of agreeing to a truce or a final deal. The outcome remains very uncertain,"" he noted.

European soccer is a bigger business than ever, with clubs in the continent's five top leagues raking in 20.4 billion euros ($23.7 billion) in revenue in the 2023-2024 season — and American investors have been eyeing a piece of that pie.

U.S. investors now own, fully or in part, the majority of soccer teams in England's Premier League. That now includes four of the traditional Big Six clubs, with Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal all attracting U.S. investment.

Rapid growth in revenues has been the key attraction.

In the 1996-97 season, when the Premier League was established in England, revenues across the five biggest European leagues totaled 2.5 billion euros, according to Deloitte analysis.

In 2023-24, that figure ballooned by 750%.

That growth has led to sharp increases in valuations for Europe's biggest soccer teams. The Glazer family, which also owns the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bought Manchester United for £790 million ($1.07 billion) in 2005. In 2024, a minority stake sale to billionaire Jim Ratcliffe pegged the club at around £5 billion, or the biggest valuation in world soccer.

Kieran Maguire, associate professor in football finance at the University of Liverpool, told CNBC on Wednesday that the rising levels of U.S. ownership in European soccer have been driven by higher wealth aggregation Stateside.

""It's actually a bit of a no brainer … what else you can do with your cash? You can only have so many helicopters, you can only have so many super yachts.""

According to Maguire, the small number of top professional sports teams available to purchase has also contributed to rising demand, with investors unable to meet the multi-billion dollar price tags attached to NFL or NBA teams in the U.S. looking to European soccer as an alternative.

More than 36 of clubs in Europe's five biggest leagues now have private equity, venture capital or private debt participation through majority or minority stakes, including a majority of clubs in the Premier League, according to PitchBook research.

The data shows a sharp increase in M&A deal activity in European soccer clubs, from just 66.7 million euros in 2018 to almost 2.2 billion euros in 2024.

Many private equity investors in soccer have looked to the multi-club ownership model to boost their investments. Speaking to CNBC, PitchBook Senior EMEA Private Capital Analyst Nicolas Moura said many U.S. investors want to ""build a variety of different football clubs,"" and that the model can have marketing and financial benefits.

But the increasing prevalence of multi-club ownership has risked the ire of regulators, with Moura saying that European soccer body UEFA is ""starting to crack down on clubs.""

This summer, England's Crystal Palace was barred from participating in UEFA's Europa League competition due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules. American businessman John Textor owns a stake in the English club as well as in France's Lyon, which also qualified for the competition.

Moura says the decision — which Crystal Palace labelled as an ""injustice"" — could become more of an issue as more clubs involved in multi-club structures move into Europe's top divisions.

The growth of soccer revenues has slowed in recent years, with Deloitte saying it sees income ""plateauing"" in the 2025-26 season on the back of slowing growth in the value of sports media rights.

That has left commercial revenue — up 6% in the 2023-24 season, per Deloitte — as a main driver, as clubs clinched new sponsorship deals and looked to utilize stadiums for non-soccer events.

Moura says lots of U.S. private equity investors are ""looking to do their stands, their entire stadiums"" in a bid to diversify away from broadcast income.

The search for growth in commercial and match day revenues could see more clubs holding regular matches overseas. Spain's La Liga will take its first regular season game abroad this season, as current champions Barcelona prepare to play Villareal in Miami. Italy's Serie A is also considering an international game, with the country's governing body approving plans for a match in Australia. Until now, games in domestic leagues have not been allowed to be played outside of their home country, with global governing body FIFA considering a formal change to its rules on overseas matches.   

Maguire says Premier League clubs will eventually look to hold games overseas to compete with rival European leagues, and that the money generated will mean games ""will be sold to the fan base … effectively as a fait accompli.""

The Premier League has not publicly entertained the idea of taking regular season games out of England, with CEO Richard Masters telling CNBC the league is ""very different"" from American peers when it comes to international games.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Trump administration reportedly weighs 10% stake in Intel via CHIPS Act grants, making government top shareholder","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/trump-administration-weighs-10percent-stake-in-intel-via-chip-act-grants.html","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:32:31 GMT","



The Trump administration is discussing taking a 10% stake in Intel, according to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday, in a deal that could see the U.S. government become the chipmaker's largest stakeholder.

As part of a potential deal, the government is also considering converting some or all of Intel's grants from the 2022 U.S. CHIPS and Science Act into equity in the company, the report said, citing a White House official and other people familiar with the matter.

At the embattled chipmaker's current market value, a 10% stake would be worth roughly $10.4 billion. Meanwhile, Intel has been awarded about $10.9 billion in CHIPS Act grants, including $7.9 billion to support its domestic investment plans and $3 billion to further its semiconductor manufacturing for national security.

The report noted, however, that it remains unclear if the idea has gained traction broadly within the administration or whether officials have broached the possibility with affected companies.

It added that the exact size of the stake remains in flux, and it remains unclear whether the White House will actually proceed with the plan. Intel and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's queries regarding the report. 

Intel, once a dominant force in the U.S. chip industry, has fallen behind global competitors in advanced chip manufacturing. Reviving the former U.S. chip champion has become a national priority in Washington, with reports about a potential government stake in the company first circulating last week.

The company has been the largest recipient of the 2022 CHIPS Act, passed with bipartisan support under the Biden administration, as part of efforts by Washington to revitalize U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.

The bill allocated $39 billion in grants for American semiconductor projects, with funding committed to many of the world's chipmakers such as TSMC and Samsung, as well as American chip companies such as Nvidia, Micron and GlobalFoundries. 

U.S. President Donald Trump, though supporting the general goals of the CHIPS Act, has been a vocal critic of the bill and even called for its repeal earlier this year. While republican lawmakers in Washington have been reluctant to act on that call, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in June that the administration was renegotiating some of the bill's grants. 

If Intel's CHIPS Act funds were to be converted into a potential government stake in the company, it could decrease the total amount of capital infused into the company as part of any deal by Washington. 

However, it would serve as the latest example of the Trump administration's interest in building government-backed national champions in strategic industries.

Intel has struggled to gain an advantage in the artificial intelligence boom and has yet to capture a significant customer for its manufacturing business despite spending heavily on it. 

Some analysts have argued that government intervention is essential for the struggling chipmaker and for the sake of U.S. national security. Others contend that Intel's problems are deeper than funding, and that it's unclear if the government can steer it in the right direction. 

Analysts have also noted that Trump may be able to use the threat of tariffs and regulation to sway companies to buy Intel chips or provide indirect assistance.

On Tuesday, SoftBank announced a $2 billion investment in Intel, which, according to LSEG, would make it the fifth-largest shareholder. Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group, said: ""This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role.""

Intel investors had initially welcomed news of a potential government investment, which resulted in a share rally of nearly 9% on Aug. 14. Shares of Intel fell over 3% on Monday on the Bloomberg report, but rebounded by more than 5% in overnight trading on the trading platform Robinhood following news of the Softbank investment.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who was appointed in March 2025, met with Trump at the White House last week, after the U.S. president had called for his ousting due to his past ties to China. 

After the meeting, Trump had changed his tune on the Intel chief, saying he had ""an amazing story."" It's unclear if a potential government stake in the company had been discussed at the time.

 Bitcoin gets new ""plunge protection"" amid an ongoing sell-off and more liquidations for those hoping they had bought the dip. 

Key points:

Bitcoin selling pressure increases as US stocks dip at the Wall Street open.

BTC price almost hits $113,500 as over $100 million in longs gets liquidated in an hour.

ETF flows are now key as onchain fundamentals start “weakening.”

Bitcoin (BTC) fell to near two-week lows at Tuesday's Wall Street open as US selling pressure surged.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping beneath $114,000.

Bitcoin and altcoins fell with US stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite Index down 1.2% at the time of writing.

Long BTC positions, subject to an ongoing squeeze, added another $116 million to their liquidation tally in an hour.

Data from CoinGlass also showed bids lining up around the $112,000 mark — already a point of interest for market participants.

“TLDR: The $107k - $110k range is coming into focus,” Keith Alan, cofounder of trading resource Material Indicators, summarized in part of his latest post on X.

Alan flagged the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) at $110,950 as a potential support barrier, with the 50-day counterpart at $115,875 now important to reclaim.

On exchange order books, Material Indicators identified a $25 million band of liquidity at $105,000 — “plunge protection” against a deeper market rout.

“This bid liquidity does not look like it aims to get filled. It was placed to heard liquidity upward. If it fails to accomplish that and price reverts, I expect it to get rugged or moved before it gets filled,” it commented alongside a chart of liquidity and whale order volume.

In the latest edition of its Market Pulse updates, onchain analytics firm Glassnode meanwhile highlighted a growing divergence between institutional demand and price action.

Investment vehicles, notably the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), were seeing inflows despite “weakening” onchain signals such as volume.

“With profit-taking on the rise, the sustainability of institutional flows and renewed buyer conviction in both spot and futures will determine whether this contraction stabilizes into fresh upward momentum or extends into deeper consolidation,” it reported.

The ETFs recorded a net outflow of $121 million on Monday, per data from UK investment firm Farside Investors. The largest ETF offering, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), saw its first outflows since Aug. 5.

Cryptocurrencies continued their slide on Tuesday with bitcoin BTC$113,587.17 sinking below $114,000 as investors are turning cautious that Federal Reserve Chair Powell's Friday Jackson Hold speech may come with a hawkish surprise.

BTC dropped to $113,700 during the early hours of the U.S. session, its weakest price in almost two weeks and pulling back 9% from its Thursday record high above $124,000.

Ether (ETH) slid 3.5% over the past 24 hours below $4,200. Major altcoins weren't spared either: Chainlink LINK$24.04, Avalanche AVAX$22.82, Toncoin TON$3.2179, Ethena ENA$0.6371 and Aptos APT$4.3629 declined 4%-6% in a day.

The crypto pullback occurred alongside with traditional markets turning risk-off, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes down 0.9% and 0.4%, respectively, in the morning.

A check of crypto treasury companies shows that bubble continuing to deflate, with  BTC accumulator KindlyMD (NAKA) lower by another 14% on Tuesday. ETH-focused names Bitmine Immersion (BNMR) and Sharplink Gaming (SBET) are down 10% and 8%, respectively.

Since soaring as high as $124 in late May in wake of its transition to an ether treasury strategy company, SBET — to pick one — has now crumbled by about 85% to its current $18.60.

The grandaddy of the group — Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) was down 5.7% on Tuesday, now lower by 20% over the past month and off 37% from a record high hit late last year. Shares, of course, remain up more than 20-fold since Saylor began purchasing BTC about five years ago. Being the first mover has its advantages.

Investors, who previously saw a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve as a given, are now weighing the odds that Fed Chair Jerome Powell might argue for holding rates steady during his Friday keynote address at the Kansas City Fed's Economic Symposium.

Despite recent signs of a weakening job market and slowing economy, last week's far hotter-than-expected PPI report reignited concerns of inflation reaccelerating.

Economists at Bank of America said in a report that they see the Fed holding rates in September.

""With inflation essentially stuck over the past year, the tariff pass-through that we still expect, and the labor supply story keeping the unemployment rate historically low, we still think there is a strong case for the Fed to remain on hold,"" the analysts said.

Market participants put a 85% likelihood of 25 basis point cut next month, down from as high as 98% at one point last week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

Oops, something went wrong

Outflows from U.S. ETFs tracking Ethereum's spot price hit $197 million on Monday—the second-highest figure ever for daily withdrawals.

The sell-offs come as the queue for unstaking ETH also surged to new records, with $3.9 billion worth of withdrawals now pending.

BRN Head of Research Timothy Misir warned both factors are ""pressuring near-term sentiment.""

In a note to investors, he argued $4,400 is now a crucial support level for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, Ethereum is flat compared to yesterday, trading at $4,203.84, according to price aggregator CoinGecko.

The outflows come days after ETH failed to secure a fresh all-time high above $4,891.70, which was set back in November 2021. It peaked around $4,776.32 on Thursday, August 14.

All signs point to investors taking profits off the table after Ethereum surged by 66% in the space of a year, attracting a slew of institutional interest.

Ethereum ETFs hold 5.08% of this digital asset's supply, but Misir believes the portion of Ethereum sitting in ETFs could overtake the 6.38% worth of Bitcoin held in ETFs ""if the current inflow pace is sustained.""

Bitcoin funds weren't immune from these outflows on Monday, but suffered a less modest draw of $122 million by comparison.

Despite BTC also retracing from an all-time high of $124,457.12 last Thursday, Misir argued that whales are continuing to accumulate—with 20,061 BTC added to wallets holding at least 10,000 coins over the past six days.

The pullback happened as Donald Trump invited European leaders to the White House to discuss the war in Ukraine, days after a much-anticipated summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin resulted in no deal being reached.

""Crypto remains sensitive to these signals,"" Misir wrote, adding that the prospect of further negotiations could bolster risk appetite among investors.

Bitcoin Jumps to New All-Time High Price as Ethereum Nears Record

For now, he argues that Bitcoin enjoys ""structural support"" in the $115,000 range—and a break above $121,000 would pave the way for a retest of the zone between $123,000 and $127,000.

""Geopolitical developments around U.S.–Ukraine–Russia trilateral talks now inject additional two-way risk: a ceasefire could catalyze BTC's push above $120K, while escalation risks argue for caution.

08/19 update below. This post was originally published on August 18

Bitcoin—alongside other major cryptocurrencies ethereum and XRP—have fallen sharply, raising fears of a crypto market crash after it bubbled up to an all-time high of $4.2 trillion this month (just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk breaks his silence on crypto).

The bitcoin price has plunged from an all-time high of $124,000 per bitcoin just last week, dropping around 10% to $114,000, while ethereum and Ripple's XRP have seen similar declines despite U.S. president Donald Trump dropping a surprise $12.2 trillion crypto bombshell.

Bitcoin and crypto's decline, coming just as JPMorgan makes a game-changing Federal Reserve flip, follows Wall Street giants issuing a warning that the recently passed Genius Act stablecoin bill could trigger a $6.6 trillion flood of account withdrawals.

U.S. banking groups that count Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan and Bank of America as members have urged Congress to close a loophole in the recently passed Genius Act stablecoin bill that allows issuers of the dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies to offer yields via affiliates, warning it could trigger huge account deposit flight that would undermine the banking system.

08/19 update: The bitcoin price and crypto market has swung wildly as fears swirl a widespread crypto market crash could be gathering pace.

The bitcoin price dropped towards $113,000 before bouncing back to around $115,000, dragging down the wider crypto market that's seen $250 billion in value wiped out since last week.

“Cryptocurrencies traded sharply lower,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. 

“Bitcoin continued to pull back away from Thursday's all-time high just below $124,500. Ethereum came under heavier selling pressure, dropping over 5%. These losses highlight the continued volatility within the crypto sector. The bigger question is whether this is simply a round of profit-taking following the sharp rally over the first two weeks of August, or if it is the beginning of a deeper and more protracted sell-off.”

The closely-watched crypto fear and greed index has swung from a reading of 68 last week to just 56, its lowest reading since the bitcoin price dropped to under $112,000 at the beginning of August and putting it on the verge of “fear” territory.

This week, the three-day Jackson Hole economic policy symposium begins in Wyoming, with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's Friday speech topping the agenda as traders brace for what's widely expected to be a Fed interest rate cut in September.

“Markets are shoring up their focus on upcoming commentary from the Fed chair at the Jackson Hole Symposium,"" Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in emailed comments. “Fed reserve timelines and geopolitical developments are shaping flows across equities, FX, and crypto.”

Last week, Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, mirroring a surprise 2024 interest rate cut that powered a bitcoin price boom into the November election.

“If Powell signals a slower path to easing at Jackson Hole, markets could reprice aggressively, tightening financial conditions and putting pressure on crypto prices in the near term,” Carolane de Palmas, market analyst at Activtrades, said in emailed comments.

“While bitcoin is often framed as ‘digital gold,' its short-term performance is still highly sensitive to liquidity cycles. Traders need to recognize that Fed policy directly shapes dollar liquidity, and by extension, influences the flows into and out of bitcoin. If the Fed looks more cautious on rate cuts, we could see reduced momentum in the crypto space through the fall. But there's a second layer here—beyond just liquidity. The symbolism of Jackson Hole matters. This is where Powell sets the tone for policy direction, and any hint that rate cuts are still firmly on the table could restore confidence in the crypto rally. On the flip side, if the Fed appears hesitant because of tariff-driven inflation concerns, bitcoin could remain trapped in consolidation until a clearer macro catalyst emerges. In the next quarter, bitcoin's path will be closely tied to Fed expectations.”

In April, a Treasury Department report estimated that stablecoins could trigger up to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, depending on whether they can offer interest or yield, with the stablecoin market expected to grow to $2 trillion by 2028, up from $280 billion today.

""Congress must protect the flow of credit to American businesses and families and the stability of the most important financial market by closing the stablecoin payment of interest loophole,"" the report, posted to the Bank Policy Institute website, and addressed to lawmakers, read.

“Banks power the economy by turning deposits into loans. Incentivizing a shift from bank deposits and money market funds to stablecoins would end up increasing lending costs and reducing loans to businesses and consumer households.”

The plea to lawmakers was also signed by the American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America and the Financial Services Forum.

Stablecoin adoption wars are heating up following the passage of the Genius Act that laid down rules of the road for the crypto-based dollars.

Tether's USDT remains the dominant stablecoin but is facing a tidal wave of competition from all angles, including Wall Street giants themselves, technology companies such as Facebook's Meta, as well as financial technology companies like PayPal and Stripe.

Earlier this year, David Sacks, a technology investor and U.S. president Donald Trump's crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he hosts with three other investors that he hopes that eventually the rules will swing in favor of stablecoin issuers, allowing them to directly offer interest to stablecoin holders.

Trump's sons Eric and Don Jr have publicly said their World Liberty Financial crypto project is a direct challenge to Wall Street following their claims of being “de-banked” in the aftermath of Trump's 2020 election loss. “Honestly, I would love to see some of the big banks go extinct, because, honestly, they deserve it,"" Eric Trump said in May.

The bitcoin price and crypto market's latest downturn, coming as just as traders celebrated a fresh all-time high, have raised fears the market could see further declines in coming weeks.

“The crypto market continued its decline on Monday after a pause over the weekend,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro's chief market analyst, said in emailed comments.

“The total capitalisation fell back to $3.88 trillion, reaching its lowest level in more than two weeks. As expected, altcoins are falling the hardest, with ethereum and XRP losing about 5% in the last 24 hours, twice as much as bitcoin. Bitcoin fell to $115,000, the lowest level in the last 11 days. It is now testing the 50-day moving average, which has been the bullish trend line since April. A consolidation below it will sharply increase the chances of a deeper correction, and a failure below $112,000—the area of recent lows—will confirm the correction, opening the potential for a decline to $105,000-107,000.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

SharpLink bought $667M of Ethereum near record highs, lifting its holdings to $3.2B, while its stock dropped 12% as investors weighed the risks.

SharpLink (SBET) snapped up a whopping $667 million of Ethereum (ETH-USD) at sky-high prices, pushing its holdings to $3.2 billion, even as its shares slid 12% on the news. The sports betting platform made the purchase just as ETH traded near record highs of $4,700, showing it's willing to pay top dollar to keep building its crypto war chest.





SharpLink disclosed in a U.S. SEC filing that it bought 143,593 Ethereum at an average of $4,648 each, totaling $667.4 million. The purchase boosted its total stash to 740,760 ETH, worth around $3.2 billion at current market prices.

What's interesting is that rather than waiting for a dip, SharpLink added at the top end of ETH's trading range. This signals confidence in Ethereum's long-term value.

The company isn't leaving its crypto pile idle. SharpLink reported that “substantially all of the ETH Holdings were deployed in staking, including through liquid staking,” as of August 17. Staking allows the company to earn rewards while helping run Ethereum's proof-of-stake network.

So far, those rewards amount to 1,388 ETH, worth more than $5.8 million. Still, SharpLink warned in its filing that staking rules may be subject to regulatory changes, which could impact this strategy.

Despite the bullish crypto move, SharpLink's stock didn't benefit. Shares tumbled 12% on Friday and closed Monday at $20.10, down 13.5% over the past five days, according to TradingView.

Part of the decline ties back to SharpLink's recent $103 million net loss in Q2 2025, much of it related to accounting for liquid staked Ethereum (LsETH). Investors seem uneasy about the balance between big crypto bets and actual profitability.

SharpLink's ETH purchase comes as institutions are scooping up the token at record pace. Ethereum ETFs alone saw $3.7 billion in inflows between Aug. 5 and last Thursday, reflecting heavy demand.

Its main rival, BitMine (BMNR) , announced an even bigger buy of 373,000 ETH. This lifted its holdings to 1.52 million ETH worth about $6.6 billion. “The new ETH purchase made BitMine the second-largest crypto treasury in the world behind only Michael Saylor's Strategy,” BitMine board chair Thomas Lee said.

Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) remains king of corporate crypto reserves, though its focus is Bitcoin rather than Ether. The firm recently added $51.4 million in BTC, bringing its total holdings to 629,376 BTC, valued near $72.7 billion.

That leaves Strategy on top overall, but SharpLink and BitMine are racing for dominance in Ethereum.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is sitting at $4,189.50.

                            These Three Altcoins Could Crash Soon | Credit: Veronica Cestari                        


Key Takeaways

The crypto market has been on a downward spiral, racking up losses and liquidations since early last week.

Bitcoin (BTC) is sliding too, but its dominance is climbing—a clear sign that altcoins are taking an even bigger hit.

Here's a look at the altcoins that are most at risk, the ones that could face the sharpest declines if the sell-off deepens.

The first altcoin showing serious weakness in the ongoing market downturn is PUMP, which has already broken down from its ascending parallel channel.

Its rebound since July 24 was shaky to begin with, as the move unfolded inside a bearish corrective pattern.

The breakdown from support yesterday, followed by today's drop, confirms that PUMP has entered a renewed bearish trend.

In fact, PUMP has been trending downward since July, and this latest breakdown signals that the downtrend is likely to accelerate.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) supports this outlook, falling below 50 and pointing lower—a clear sign of bearish momentum.

The nearest horizontal support sits at $0.0023, and if that level fails, PUMP could plunge toward a new all-time low near $0.0017.

The next altcoin at risk of a crash is Injective (INJ), which has fallen since a rejection at the $16.50 horizontal resistance area (red icon) on Aug. 17.

Today, the INJ broke down from an ascending support trend line, confirming that the downward movement has started.

Similarly to PUMP, the INJ price increase was corrective, and the breakdown is accompanied by an RSI decline below 50.

If the downward trend continues, INJ risks falling to the $12.10 horizontal support area.

The final altcoin that could crash alongside the crypto market is the memecoin SPX6900 (SPX).

Like PUMP and INJ, SPX has also broken down from an ascending support trend line to a horizontal support area.

However, SPX has the most bearish chart because of its wave count.

SPX has already completed a five-wave upward movement (green), meaning its bullish cycle may already be over.

If that is the case, the SPX price is mired in a lengthy correction that will take it down to $1.

For SPX, the RSI and MACD are bearish, since the former is below 50 and the latter is negative.

Therefore, the SPX chart is the most bearish of the three altcoins and predicts the steepest crash.

The broader crypto market is under heavy pressure, and altcoins are showing deeper cracks than Bitcoin.

PUMP has lost its footing, INJ is sliding below support, and SPX is poised for the steepest correction.

If the market downturn continues, these altcoins could see significant downside in August and possibly the rest of 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

The search for the Best Altcoins To Buy Now, XRP Price has dominated the conversation in 2025. XRP continues to be sought after worldwide, and new players like Remittix are popularizing due to their useful applications.

With the long-term prospects of growth in XRP and Remittix's increasing presale popularity, investors are weighing the possibilities in both tried-and-true and new digital currencies.

XRP is priced at $3.07, experiencing a small dip by 1.29% in the past 24 hours. The decline notwithstanding, the token boasts a huge market cap of $182.73 billion. Its activity has risen significantly, with trading volume in a day touching $7.81 billion — a 133% increase that reflects growing interest in traders.

XRP is still among the top cryptos under $5 in consideration of its use in cross-border payments. Its use in the financial settlement keeps it relevant, although new entrants are providing stiff competition. Investors who consider Best Altcoins To Buy Now, XRP Price patterns are increasingly considering presales such as Remittix for early access.



Remittix (RTX) is soon to become a standout on the top crypto presale of 2025. Over $20 million have been locked up already with more than 608 million sold out tokens priced each at $0.0969. Reaching the milestone prompted its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing, with BitMart making announcements of listing the token.

This action boosts liquidity and makes RTX more liquid, besides opening doors for mass acceptance. Besides the exchange listing, Remittix is preparing for its Q3 beta wallet launch, enabling users to send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in more than 30 nations.

As a Remittix DeFi project, RTX is working to simplify payments by bridging crypto and everyday banking. It stands apart from speculative meme coins because it is built for utility — with real-time crypto-to-fiat transfers, support for 40+ digital assets, and low-gas-fee crypto transactions. All of these capabilities put RTX on the next big altcoin 2025 run.

Some of the most striking aspects of the project are:

By tackling the $19 trillion payments economy, Remittix is gaining traction as one of the best new altcoins with practical application. As a means of investment for those considering early stage investing in crypto, RTX offers sound use cases coupled with strong presale adoption.



The discussion on Best Altcoins To Buy Now, XRP Price contains a shift in investor strategies. XRP is still one of the best crypto to buy now because it already has a footing in payments, while Remittix is a fresh crypto token launch intended for adoption.

				Last Updated:				August 19, 2025			

Fact checked

By Sam Cooling

The combined crypto market cap is down 0.5% on the day, slipping to $3.95 trillion as major caps like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are down 0.5%, 0.9%, and 0.7%, respectively. With the discounts on offer across the market, many are wondering which is the best Solana meme coin to buy on the dip.

Altcoins such as PUMP and VIRTUALS have also taken sizeable hits, with Pump.fun's native token down over 10% and AI powerhouse Virtuals Protocol down 3%.



(COINGECKO)

As we enter yet another day of red across the crypto market, traders and analysts are scrambling to put together a fresh piece of technical analysis to suit their agendas.

However, the simple fact of the matter is that aside from outliers such as LIGHT or API3, which are up overnight, 70% and 78% respectively, the entire crypto market is undergoing a correction.

Multiple analysts believe that BTC will drop between $95,000 and $105,000, while technical analysis is indicating that ETH may drop as low as $2,900. Whether the two leading cryptocurrencies drop that low, this ongoing dip is presenting some incredible buying opportunities.

Many have been trying to time the perfect bottom for Pump.fun's PUMP token, and while it did pump over 60% to $0.0041 from the end of July into August, it has since begun to drop once more.

PUMP is down over 21% in the past seven days, essentially frontrunning the market-wide dip that began just a few days after the Pump.fun token crashed.

(SOURCE)

As for Solana meme coins, PUMP is directly responsible for many of them due to many launches taking place on the Pump.fun platform, and they are suffering greatly.

Tokens such as CHILLHOUSE, MOODENG, and AURA have been down between 15% and 25% in the last seven days. Whenever a market-wide correction occurs, meme coins are often the biggest victims, and this time is no different.

DefiLlama data also supports the narrative that Solana's on-chain ecosystem has taken a hit over the past week, with TVL (total-value locked) down 3.25% on Solana in the last 24 hours alone.

To put it into context, just yesterday, TVL on SOL was at $11.4 billion, and today it is sitting at $10.35 billion, a daily loss of $1 billion.



(SOURCE)

However, there is optimism that Q4 will prove a bountiful period across crypto. While meme coins tend to go down faster than your average altcoin, they also reverse the hardest. For this reason, traders should ask themselves, “What is the best Solana meme coin to buy before Q4?”

Snorter Bot (SNORT) might just represent the best play when seeking the next blue-chip meme coin, as it has the added benefit of still being in presale and thus not a victim of the ongoing market volatility.



While there is no telling how low Solana meme coins may go during this correction, Snorter Bot (SNORT) can still be in the presale phase and not at the mercy of volatile price swings.

It is also the perfect investment. On the surface, SNORT seems like just another meme coin. However, it is packed with utility, and it could quickly become a cash-generating monster.

The increasing demand for SNORT is attributed to traders recognizing it as an essential tool as the bull market progresses. Snorter Bot is a multi-chain-ready Telegram trading bot that offers SNORT holders industry-leading trading fees of just 0.85%. From day one, this rate has been more competitive than that of other trading bots, such as Trojan, BONKBot, and Banana Gun.

Since its initial coin offering (ICO) went live, Snorter Bot has raised over $3.2M in just over three months, demonstrating strong investor interest in a project combining meme coin appeal and utility.

Snorter Bot features built-in MEV (miner-extractable value) protection, an innovative sniper tool, and a copy-trade function. These features enable users to follow their favorite wallets and influencers while also allowing them to acquire low-cost tokens during the hottest new launches.

SNORT is quickly becoming traders' answer to the best crypto to buy right now for both the short and long term due to its market-leading trading bot and meme coin virality of its token.

Initially, SNORT will only be available on Solana; however, the bot has been designed with multi-chain capabilities. It is anticipated that it will soon expand to other notable chains such as Base and Ethereum.

Investors seeking passive income on their SNORT presale bag can stake their tokens for an impressive 137% APY. This offers traders a perfect passive income opportunity while they wait for the Snorter Bot ICO to conclude.

Just under 24 hours are remaining until the SNORT presale moves onto its next price stage, meaning that once the timer hits zero, its current price of $0.1017 will be gone for good.

Oops, something went wrong

Figure, the blockchain-powered lender founded by SoFi co-founder Mike Cagney, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering as the latest entrant in a growing crypto IPO wave.

The company plans to list its Class A shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker FIGR, with Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and BofA Securities serving as lead underwriters.

Figure's path to public markets has been years in the making. In 2021, it launched a special purpose acquisition company, Figure Acquisition Corp. I, with a $250 million raise aimed at acquiring growth-stage businesses using Provenance as an efficiency layer, however in the end this SPAC did not bring Figure to market.

A friendlier regulatory stance under the Trump administration and buoyant crypto and stock markets have set the stage for a surge of digital asset firms tapping the equity markets, including crypto exchange Bullish which is the owner of CoinDesk.

The company last month merged with Figure Markets, a blockchain marketplace also launched by Cagney that issues YDLS, a yield-bearing stablecoin structured as a tokenized money market fund.

Financials disclosed in the S-1 show revenue up 22.4% in the first half of 2025 to $190.6 million, with net income of $29 million compared with a $13 million loss a year earlier.

According to the filing with the SEC, proceeds from the IPO will fund working capital and potential acquisitions, with no dividends planned.

 Lib Work is dipping its toes into Bitcoin, a month after using NFTs for the first time to tokenize the designs of one of its 3D printed houses. 

Japan-based 3D printed housing firm Lib Work Co. has become the latest non-crypto native company to buy Bitcoin for its corporate treasury, coming just a month after launching an initiative that uses non-fungible tokens to store house designs. 

In a Monday statement following its board meeting, Lib Work announced plans to purchase 500 million Japanese yen ($3.3 million) worth of Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against “inflationary trends” in Japan and the risks of “holding assets only in cash.”

“Therefore, our company has decided to adopt a phased approach to acquisition and holding, in response to these risks and to prepare for future growth areas with overseas operators,” the firm said. 

Lib Work will buy Bitcoin in a series of purchases from crypto exchanges starting in September and continuing until December, while also establishing a risk management system, according to its statement. 

At current prices, one Bitcoin is worth around $115,377, meaning the company could buy roughly 28 for $3.3 million, making it 105 on the list of top Bitcoin treasury companies, overtaking French payment provider BD multimedia. 

It comes only a month after Lib Work launched an NFT-backed 3D printed housing initiative to store blueprints on the blockchain and use Bitcoin as a payment method. 

Lib Work said in a July 25 statement that one of its house designs, a Lib Earth House Model B, was issued as an NFT and aims to protect the intellectual property and to act as an ownership certificate linked to the physical home. 

The NFT can store the house's ID, history, and ownership information on the blockchain to ensure buyers hold exclusive design rights and prevent unauthorized blueprint plagiarism. 

“Because 3D printed houses are based on digital designs, protecting the rights to these design files and managing their licenses is essential,” Lib Work said. 

 “Currently, blockchain technology and NFTs are expanding beyond the art and music industries into real estate and intellectual property sectors.” 

In recent years, the construction industry has faced labor shortages and soaring material costs, which, according to Lib Work, show the “limitations of traditional construction methods.”

The company said 3D printing construction methods and asset digitalization could help solve some of these challenges by reducing labor, time, costs and “creating new international housing markets for the metaverse and Web3 era.”

Lib Work was founded on Aug. 1, 1997. The firm changed its name in April 2018 and started focusing on building 3D printed homes. 

It mainly sells detached houses and real estate using the internet and virtual reality, according to its company profile.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","The Moser Pioneer Returns with a Dive Bezel (and NFT Connection)","https://watchesbysjx.com/2025/08/h-moser-cie-elements-of-time-azuki-nft.html","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 02:58:49 GMT","

H. Moser & Cie.'s only dive watch returns as the Pioneer “Elements of Time”, the result of an unexpected, but not unprecedented, collaboration with Azuki, an anime-inspired NFT, and American retailer The 1916 Company. Unsurprisingly given the digital nature of the collaboration, the watches will only be available online via raffle from Azuki.

Representing the four elements of earth, lightning, fire and water, Elements of Time features engraved fumé dials in four colourways. Each is limited to 24 watches in Pioneer Centre Seconds format, along with one unique Pioneer tourbillon per colour. All variants are titanium, matched with bracelet with the amenities you'd expect from a diver, including a micro-adjust clasp.



While a new Pioneer with a rotating bezel would normally be a major release, you won't find Elements of Time on Moser's website. That's because it's a collaboration with Azuki, a non-fungible token (NFT). Azuki is Japanese for “red bean”, but Azuki is basically anime-style digital art on the blockchain.

But these are real watches – they can be collected at The 1916 Company's physical stores – and more notably, sport of the most interesting fumé dials from Moser in a while.



This isn't Moser's first foray into the Web 3.0 world. Back in 2022, the brand launched the Endeavour Centre Seconds Genesis, a watch that was essentially a physical QR code. The timing wasn't the best as it debuted just as the NFT bubble popped.

With the air having gone out of the NFT market, the NFT aspect is incidental to the watches this time around. There is an NFC chip in the warranty card and minimal Azuki branding (in the form of a red bean at 12 o'clock and a case back engraving), which should give the watches broader appeal. In other words, these are appealing watches even absent the NFT connection.

As for the watches themselves, they are Moser's typical fare – well engineered watches with eye-catching minimalist dials, but possibly less refined than traditional haute horlogerie brands. The dearth of traditional dive watches from practitioners of “fine watchmaking”, especially indies, also helps these stand out.



I find the tourbillons most compelling, even if I'm ambivalent towards the genre, as it uses Moser's trademark double hairsprings. Many Swiss tourbillons in the price range offer the bare minimum, focusing on the theatre of a tourbillon, so it's good to see something more cerebral.

On a more emotional side, a unique piece from a respected brand has its own appeal, and these are priced significantly below non-unique sports watches with tourbillons from establishment brands like Audemars Piguet and Vacheron Constantin. Another highlight is the slick animated short produced to promote the launch.



The Pioneer with a rotating bezel has already been launched in the past, but it's a rare breed: only about 200 watches exist across three limited editions, half in 43 mm stainless steel cases and the other in 40 mm titanium cases.

Elements of Time follows the latter template of a compact case, in line with the current trend towards moderate sizes, but with a quartet of novel, textured fumé dials.



Moser won't admit it, but the Pioneer Center Seconds Rotating bezel is a dive watch, and follows the codes of modern diver with a lumed dial, lumed unidirectional bezel, screw down crown, and metal bracelet.

It does break from convention with a deceptively un-lumed seconds hand and only 120 m of water resistance, which is modest by today's standards but more than sufficient.



The standard Pioneer is typically strap-borne, but the dive iteration is paired with a simple, “H-link” titanium bracelet that's nonetheless thoughtful designed. The clasp continues the fluting from the watch's excavated flanks which helps with visual cohesiveness.

More usefully, the clasp contains a ratcheting quick-adjustment mechanism that's a much appreciated quality of life feature.



To represent the four classical elements (though with lightning in place of air), Moser gave each colourway its own gradient finish and texture. Water is the standout for me, and prompts memories of swimming to the surface after jumping into a deep pool. The ethereal purple gradient of the lightning dials are another, bristling with a rhombus motif.

On the reverse of the time-only Pioneer is the HMC 200, a technically competent, if industrially decorated, automatic. It winds bidirectionally using the Magic Lever system invented by Seiko but now widely used in Swiss watchmaking. The rotor is base metal, probably tungsten, and not gold, despite the price point.



The HMC 804 powers the tourbillon models and hails from the same movement family, but a 18k red gold rotor along with the flying tourbillon.



Moser is one the few brands across the entire industry, let along independents, making its own “assortment”, namely the escapement, hairspring and balance wheel.

The fruits of its investment in manufacturing are immediately noticeable on the tourbillon, which is equipped with two opposing hairsprings, which theoretically maintain a constant centre of gravity across all vertical positions. The tourbillon assembly is also modular, allowing it to be assembled and serviced separately from the movement, then dropped in, shortening turnaround times.

Jimmy ""MrBeast"" Donaldson‘s philanthropic initiative to bring clean water to millions of people worldwide is getting a boost from the cryptocurrency community.

Donaldson on Aug. 1 announced #TeamWater, a fundraising campaign to raise $40 million during the month to ""provide 2 million people with life-changing access to clean water for decades"" in partnership with fellow YouTuber Mark Rober and non-profit WaterAid.

Moments after Donaldson's announcement, a memecoin called TeamWater went live on the Layer 1 blockchain Solana, promising to donate 90% of all fees generated to the initiative. #TeamWater's dashboard shows the project has raised $257,000 for the campaign.

The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.

Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

But the cryptocurrency community's support for #TeamWater did not end  with the eponymous memecoin. On Aug. 6, leading non-fungible token platform OpenSea launched a charitable NFT mint to support the cause together with Ethereum Layer 2 Abstract, Web3 gaming platform Yield Guild Games and others. Over 22,000 NFT collectors banded together during the event, which concluded on Aug. 11, ultimately raising $230,000 for the project.

Ranked by communities, the TeamWater memecoin and OpenSea mint are the second and fourth-largest donors to the #TeamWater initiative, according to the project's dashboard. In first place are users of the streaming platform Kick with nearly $11 million raised at last look.

Recent actions by the cryptocurrency community in support of #TeamWater highlight the utility of blockchain technology and digital collectibles beyond speculation, as well as their growing role in aid and philanthropic efforts.

As the #TeamWater campaign team points out, the World Health Organization and UNICEF estimate that one in 10 people do not have access to clean water close to their homes. The team also highlights the United Nations' projection that 4.5 billion people will face water scarcity by 2040.

#TeamWater says tackling this problem will have significant implications for the welfare of women and children, healthcare and climate resistance.

The #TeamWater initiative follows the success of #TeamTrees and #TeamSeas, initiatives also led by Donaldson and Rober, which raised $50 million combined to plant 20 million trees and remove 30 million pounds of waste from waterbodies worldwide.

""We've seen the power of the internet when it rallies behind a cause, from planting millions of trees to removing millions of pounds of trash from the ocean,"" Donaldson and Rober said in a joint statement. ""Now, we're taking on clean water, because no one should have to live without it.""

The #TeamWater campaign is slated to end Aug. 31 and has so far raised $30.4 million with two weeks to spare. Beyond the cryptocurrency community, the project has received donations from YouTube, TikTok, Citadel CEO Ken Griffin and OnlyFans star Sophie Rain.

Investor sentiment has shifted again, as Ethereum ETF flows dwindled after weeks of frenzy. However, Remittix (RTX) is at the center stage after its rocket past the $20 million mark in its ongoing ICO. 

With its token priced at $0.0969 and a wallet beta launch planned in Q3, Remittix is solidly on its path to becoming one of the best crypto presales of 2025, connecting payments in the real world with blockchain technology.

The second-largest blockchain on the planet by market cap, Ethereum, is valued at $4,328.22, declining 4.5% in the last 24 hours. The price has cooled off, although volume surged to $54.53 billion, rising a whopping 116.04%, which means both retail and institutional investors are still interested.

Its market cap stands at $522.17 billion today, and its relevance to decentralized finance and the broader Layer 1 ecosystem has strengthened. In spite of that, though, recent deceleration of ETF inflows has investors questioning near-term momentum, with attention turned to new altcoins that aim to solve real-world financial problems.

Remittix (RTX) aims to be among the most innovative future crypto projects of the year. The project has made its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing on BitMart after reaching the milestone of more than $20 million raised and selling more than 608 million tokens. 

The listing is expected to introduce stronger liquidity, wider global accessibility, and easier access for new investors who would like to buy the RTX token.

Practical success supports the success of the presale. Remittix will launch its beta wallet during Q3, aimed at real-time crypto-to-fiat exchange between 30+ currencies. With over 40 cryptos being supported on launch and real-time FX conversion, the wallet will make Remittix one of the top-ranking cryptos under $1 that offers real adoption rather than speculation.

Why Remittix Is Gaining Global Attention:

In contrast to hype-based launches or meme tokens, Remittix is positioned towards solving real use cases. It seeks to enable low gas fee cryptotransfers straight into bank accounts for freelancers, remitters, and global businesses to use. This commitment to genuine adoption already made RTX among the leading DeFi projects in 2025.

By combining decentralized exchange benefits with centralized exchange ease of access, Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi platform poised to thrive in the long term. Its utility-oriented model, deflationary tokenomics, and global remittance application make it translate into comparisons to XRP and Stellar, but with added emphasis on speed and convenience.

With the momentum growing and milestones coming along, Remittix is making waves among currently live crypto presales. Investors seeking the next popular altcoin 2025 with real utility find in RTX's presale and upcoming wallet launch a unique entry point prior to big listings spreading its adoption.

Cardano, Shiba Inu have both seen renewed momentum in recent sessions. While Cardano's ADA and the Shiba Inu Coin are in the green, the real buzz in the crypto space is around the fast-moving Remittix presale.



The cross-border payments project has now raised over $19.3 million, bringing it close to a major $20 million  milestone that will trigger its first centralized exchange listing reveal.





Cardano is trading at $0.8804, up 11.58% in 24 hours, with a market cap of $31.35 billion. Its trading volume surged 103.06% to $2.52 billion, showing strong market interest.

Meanwhile, Shiba Inu Price has climbed 5.79% to $0.00001384. The SHIB market cap now sits at $8.15 billion, while trading volume has risen 36.23% to $335.42 million. The uptick adds to recent Shiba Inu News pointing toward steady retail participation.



Both Cardano and SHIB are benefiting from the broader interest in top crypto under $1 assets and low cap crypto gems with high growth potential.



Remittix (RTX) is quickly positioning itself as one of the best crypto project 2025 contenders. Priced at $0.0944 per token, the project has sold over 599 million RTX, raising $19.3 million + so far.

When the presale hits $20 million , Remittix will announce its first CEX listing, a key move to improve liquidity and accessibility. This is alongside a 50% token bonus still live for early participants and a $250,000 RTX Giveaway for the community.

Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi project aimed at solving a $19 trillion real-world payments problem. Its platform will allow users to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, with low gas fees and real-time FX conversion.

A major update came with the announcement of its beta wallet launch planned for Q3 2025. This mobile-first wallet will integrate crypto staking, fiat withdrawals and support for 40+ cryptocurrencies, giving RTX a clear real-world utility edge over many upcoming crypto projects.



Why Remittix Is Gaining Attention

With momentum building and whales reportedly buying RTX, the $20 million target is within reach. Hitting it will mean the first centralized exchange reveal and the end of the 40% bonus period.

For investors tracking the next big altcoin 2025 or crypto solving real world problems, Remittix is shaping up as a serious contender. As Cardano, Shiba Inu and other established coins show signs of life, this new altcoin to watch is making its own headlines.

The UK's Information Commissioner's Office has reprimanded the South Yorkshire Police (SYP) after the force deleted over 96,000 pieces of body-worn video (BWV) evidence.

At the end of each shift, officers' BWV footage was uploaded and stored to a central hub which could be accessed and managed, along with all of SYP's digital evidence, via a secure system.

Following an upgrade in May 2023, the secure system began to struggle processing BWV data and a local drive workaround was put in place.

In August 2023, SYP identified that its BWV file storage was very low, and further investigation found that 96,174 pieces of original footage had been deleted from its system.

The following month, it was found the deletion had taken place on 26 July 2023 and included the loss of data relating to 126 criminal cases. It's been said only three of the cases were impacted by the loss.

Of those three cases, SYP states one may have progressed to the first court hearing if BWV had been available. However, as there was no additional independent evidence to prove the offence, progression to prosecution stage was already uncertain.

Prior to the deletion, 95,033 pieces of BWV footage had been copied to a new system that SYP was implementing but, due to poor record keeping, SYP remain unable to confirm the exact number of files deleted without copies made.

The ICO‘s investigation found that SYP ultimately did not have the appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to keep evidence secure.

This includes poor record keeping, not identifying the security risk in relation to transferring personal data between IT systems, and delaying the formulation of IT backup policies and not escalating to senior management when flaws were discovered.

“This incident highlights the importance of having detailed policies and procedures in place to mitigate against the loss of evidence,” said Sally Anne Poole, head of investigations at the ICO.

“People rightly have high expectations that our police forces and services, which protect us, also protect the personal information they hold.

“There is a lot to be learned from this incident and I encourage police forces and services and other organisation using this type of technology to check and make improvements where they find potential flaws”.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

A new nonprofit organization, supported by industry leaders including Coinbase, Uniswap Labs, and others, launched Tuesday with a shared mission — to educate U.S. policymakers on the rapidly evolving landscape of emerging technologies like crypto and artificial intelligence.

The American Innovation Project (AIP) debuted on Tuesday, committed to helping foster  ""dialogue on the policy and technology issues shaping the future of the U.S. economy,"" according to a statement.

""Our mission is simple, but urgent: we must equip America's leaders with the knowledge, context, and tools they need as they consider timely rules and regulations that meet the moment and account for a rapidly evolving technological landscape,” said Kristin Smith, AIP president and president of Solana Policy Institute, in the statement. “The American Innovation Project was established to foster dialogues regardless of partisan affiliation, so we can bridge divides and work together to move our country forward.""

The launch comes amid significant regulatory momentum in Washington. Over the past year, lawmakers and regulators have been steadfast in drafting regulatory frameworks for crypto. Last month, President Donald signed into law a bill to create a federal framework for stablecoins, and the House of Representatives passed a bill to regulate the crypto industry at large. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also embarked on ""Project Crypto"" to update the agency's rules when it comes to crypto distributions, custody, and trading, among other areas.

AIP said it will host several events, from roundtables to workshops.

""These events will connect policymakers, industry innovators, and subject-matter experts, and be focused on translating complex, emerging technological trends — from artificial intelligence to blockchain infrastructure — into actionable understanding,"" the organization said.

Several crypto-focused entities are backing AIP, including Kraken, Coinbase, the National Cryptocurrency Association, Paradigm, the Solana Policy Institute, and the Digital Currency Group (DCG). The organization received seed funding from the Cedar Innovation Foundation as well as $1 million from Digital Currency Group, according to the statement.

“The future of the U.S. economy will be shaped by the choices we make today in developing emerging technologies,” said Mark Murphy, president of DCG, in a statement.

With more than a dozen U.S. crypto policy groups crowding the offices of Washington's lawmakers and regulators, the launch of another new organization on Tuesday — the American Innovation Project — may leave it with a brisk fight to draw attention. But AIP is pursuing the niche of educational events for those making crypto policies.



Because the group is being set up as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) and not a lobbying organization, the nonpartisan effort may make it easier for U.S. lawmakers to interact with and travel to its events, and donors (who can give crypto assets) could get some tax benefits.



The new group arrives in an advocacy field full of such names as the Digital Chamber, Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, DeFi Education Fund, Solana Policy Institute and the well-funded new entry backed by Ripple: the National Cryptocurrency Association. But AIP will focus on ""policy roundtables, innovation summits, workshops and trainings,"" according to its website.



API's opening event is a summit this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on August 21, overlapping with the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium.

The new nonprofit was backed with cash from crypto venture capital firm Digital Currency Group and by Cedar Innovation Foundation, a crypto industry dark-money group whose funders are anonymous. Other supporters include Coinbase, Kraken, Andreessen Horowitz, National Cryptocurrency Association, Paradigm, Solana Policy Institute, Stand With Crypto and Uniswap Labs, according to the organization.



“The American Innovation Project offers a nonpartisan forum where lawmakers, innovators, and entrepreneurs can collaborate on thoughtful, forward-looking discussions and solutions,"" said Mark Murphy, president of DCG, in a statement.



Its board is led by Kristin Smith, the recently departed leader of the Blockchain Association who is now president at the Solana Policy Institute. Other board members come from those organizations and DCG, Paradigm and Coinbase. 

""Our mission is simple, but urgent: We must equip America's leaders with the knowledge, context, and tools they need as they consider timely rules and regulations that meet the moment and account for a rapidly evolving technological landscape,” Smith said in a statement.

The industry's many lobbying arms have been closely engaged on influencing the emerging crypto policies from Congress and the federal regulators, supported by President Donald Trump as he seeks to secure the U.S. as the leading hub for global digital assets activity.

Wyoming on Tuesday introduced the Frontier Stable Token, or FRNT, becoming the first U.S. state to issue its own dollar-linked digital currency. The token is fully backed by cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries and carries an additional 2% reserve cushion, according to the state's Stable Token Commission.



FRNT launched simultaneously on seven networks—Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism and Base—using LayerZero's Omnichain Fungible Token standard, allowing it to move seamlessly across the supported blockchains. Public trading has not begun while the state completes pending federal regulatory reviews.



Wyoming officials said interest earned on the reserves will flow each quarter to the state's School Foundation Fund, distinguishing the program from privately issued stablecoins that channel yields to corporate treasuries. The commission described FRNT as a constitutionally protected public asset rather than a central-bank digital currency, asserting it will not be subject to discretionary transaction restrictions.

US banking agency leaders will soon have a chance to reshape state regulation of stablecoins under landmark legislation President Donald Trump signed into law.

The Stablecoin Certification Review Committee—led by the Treasury secretary and including the chairmen of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.—will have to determine whether disparate state frameworks are “substantially similar” to the federal regime for stablecoin issuers.

The requirement, one of the less-noticed provisions in the “GENIUS Act” (Public Law 119-27) enacted last month, comes as companies including Walmart Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Western Union Co. eye payment stablecoin products of their own alongside major banks.

“It creates a potential for less of a mosaic of state-by-state regulation, which kind of plagues other aspects of the financial industry,” said Gavin Meyers, a financial services regulatory partner at Pierson Ferdinand LLP. “Eliminating that barrier is a highly beneficial aspect of the committee.”

The Fed and FDIC chiefs will need to reach unanimous agreement with the Treasury secretary to give state jurisdictions the federal government's blessing on stablecoin oversight.

“There will be some wiggle room in states that have been more favorable to crypto generally, like Wyoming,” Meyers added.

The “GENIUS Act” seeks to streamline an assortment of state-level regulations, tasking the federal committee with screening and recertifying each state regime to align with the statute itself. 

Stablecoin issuers currently must contend with varying policies enacted by red and blue states alike.

Wyoming passed its own legislation in 2023 authorizing a state commission to issue stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. The state on Tuesday became the first to launch its own stablecoin, the Frontier Stable Token. Wyoming-domiciled crypto exchange Kraken will be among the first marketplaces to make FRNT available for purchase on the Solana blockchain.

Texas, which released its first stablecoin guidance in 2019, adopted the Money Services Modernization Act in 2023 that aligns closely with a model set forth by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. Lawmakers in Texas added a provision defining monetary value to include stablecoins pegged to fiat currency, backed by assets held in reserve, and redeemable for fiat from the issuer.

Meanwhile, New York's existing BitLicense virtual currency standards apply to stablecoins, and the state's Department of Financial Services issued guidance in 2022 for stablecoin issuers that requires them to meet standards for redeemability, asset reserves, and attestations of how the coins were backed.

And in California, the state's Digital Financial Assets Law will require companies to seek licensing from the state's financial regulator starting in July 2026, stipulating that only licensees, banks, trust companies, and authorized national associations can exchange stablecoins. Standards set forth in 2023 also require reserves to be among a defined set of eligible securities listed in California's Money Transmission Act, preventing issuers from representing stablecoins as safe bank credit or stored-value products.

The federal interagency panel is now poised to even out the state-by-state approach, curtailing stricter regulatory regimes or building upon permissive state frameworks.

“If 40 states all sign on to what the federal government does, those are going to be pretty simple rubber stamps—they're going to adopt a model act and incorporate it into their laws,” said Rosemary Spaziani, a partner in the fintech and digital assets practice groups at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP. “The ones that deviate are probably going to be a bit of a bottleneck.”

Dollar-backed stablecoins are a serious consideration for Wall Street giants including Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., many of which used to steer clear of digital assets. Issuers such as Circle Internet Group Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. had already entered the fray even before a federal statute was on the books.

Companies hoping to enter the stablecoin business will likely welcome federal oversight to avoid potential compliance issues across disparate state regulatory regimes, Meyers said.

“If you are licensed by whichever state that qualifies under the ‘GENIUS Act,' that certification is good across the country,'” he said. “Unlike on the securities side, here it's more about the dollar threshold of the outstanding issuance.”

Under the stablecoin law, any state-chartered depository institution acting as a stablecoin issuer will transition to federal oversight within one year of crossing a $10 billion outstanding issuance threshold. Nonbank stablecoin issuers reaching that milestone will also be subject to a federal regulatory framework, administered by a state regulator in conjunction with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

“Just because an issuer has less than $10 billion of outstanding stablecoin doesn't mean it shouldn't have to have substantially the same compliance regime as the larger issuers,” said Alan Bickerstaff, a partner at DLA Piper who focuses on blockchain and digital assets. “Some of the larger nonfinancial issuers are so big that they're going to quickly surpass the $10 billion mark, depending on how they conduct their stablecoin, and they'd end up in the federal regulatory regime.”

Public companies that aren't predominantly engaged in financial activities must also get unanimous certification from the federal committee before issuing stablecoins. Meanwhile, foreign issuers subject to approval by the panel are likely to influence the way their local jurisdictions oversee stablecoins in order to get a green light from all committee members.

“Ultimately these folks are going to be able to figure out how to work together, but it remains to be seen how that's going to play out.” Bickerstaff said. “They're going to be coming at it from different points of view.”

Figure Technology's IPO is set to take place on Nasdaq, and it's stirring the crypto space into a frenzy. This isn't just a big step for the company, but a potential turning point for the entire crypto payroll landscape. With a financial comeback under its belt, there are questions about blockchain innovation's future amid the ongoing regulatory dance. Let's unpack how this IPO might reshape crypto payroll, usher in financial inclusion, and spark a new breed of startups in the crypto realm.

Figure Technology is carving out its niche as a frontrunner in blockchain lending, recently filing for an IPO on Nasdaq with the ticker “FIGR.” The financial figures are striking, with revenues nearing $191 million—a 22% climb from last year—and a leap from $13 million in losses to $29 million in profit.

Co-founded by Mike Cagney, a significant player in fintech, Figure operates on the Provenance blockchain. They provide cutting-edge lending services and asset tokenization for institutional clients. With more than $16 billion in blockchain-based loans and $50 billion in on-chain transactions, Figure's journey highlights the growing interest from institutions in blockchain tech.

Cagney believes blockchain can remove financial middlemen, cut costs, and boost transparency in markets that are usually hard to navigate. As the crypto industry bounces back, driven by favorable regulations, Figure's IPO might clear a path for other fintech companies to explore public markets.

While the IPO is exciting, the regulatory landscape is both a hurdle and an opportunity for the crypto world. Ambiguous regulations, enforcement-heavy methods, and patchy oversight can cloud the innovation scene and create uncertainty for newcomers. This is particularly true for firms like Figure, which face the SEC's tough stance treating crypto assets as securities.

But there is a silver lining—recent moves toward clearer regulations could allow innovation to flourish while keeping investors safe. As regulators start to clarify their guidelines and bring in crypto-savvy officials, the chance for a more balanced approach may emerge, potentially spurring R&D in the sector.

Figure's unique take on crypto payroll shows how blockchain can drive financial inclusion. With crypto-backed loans free from the usual credit checks, and trading without fees, Figure is lowering the hurdles for people who are underserved to access financial services. This is part of a wider trend in fintech, where digital advancements are making financial services more available.

The notion of crypto payroll is gaining traction, and it could provide easier access to financial services for the unbanked. Integrating blockchain payments into payroll not only streamlines processes but can also instill trust and transparency among users.

The rise of blockchain is shaking up traditional financial services, and Figure Technology is leading the way. With blockchain enabling real-time interbank transactions and collaborations with major payment networks, Figure is setting new standards in payment systems. This mirrors a growing trend in fintech where startups are increasingly incorporating crypto and blockchain to enhance their services.

As the crypto world grows, the intersection of crypto and HR is capturing attention. Tools and platforms that support crypto payroll are becoming more popular, with startups looking at the potential of digital banking tailored to the crypto industry.

Figure Technology's IPO isn't just a win for the company; it's a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. With clearer regulations and new solutions like crypto payroll on the rise, financial inclusion and the growth of digital banking startups are on the horizon.

For smaller fintech startups, Figure's success is a playbook for leveraging blockchain tech to improve operations and attract investment. By proactively addressing regulatory issues and forming smart partnerships, these startups can position themselves competitively in a bustling market.

In short, Figure Technology's story showcases blockchain's ability to reshape financial services, drive innovation, and broaden access to financial resources. As the crypto landscape evolves, opportunities await those willing to embrace the changing tides of this vibrant industry.

Katten and CRC-Oyster teamed up to launch a three-part webinar
series on ""Crypto in Focus: Regulation, Risk and the Road
Ahead."" Part 1, ""Digital Assets Regulatory Updates,""
brought together Katten Partners Dan Davis, Co-Chair of Financial Markets and
Regulation, Susan Light, Co-Chair of Broker-Dealer
Regulation, with CRC-Oyster Managing Directors Jeff Gearhart and Dan Garrett, to discuss the changing
legislative, regulatory and market environment for digital assets
and cryptocurrencies in the United States. The session focused on
significant new laws, regulatory initiatives and the practical
implications for market participants, retail investors and service
providers.

The GENIUS Act marks a notable milestone as the first federal
legislation specifically addressing digital assets, with a focus on
payment stablecoins.1 Signed into law by President
Donald Trump, the GENIUS Act establishes a regulatory perimeter for
payment stablecoins, including federal and state registration
pathways, reserve requirements and business limitations for
issuers. It also recognizes the utility of payment stablecoins as
collateral and for fund transfers, aiming to provide greater
regulatory clarity and stability in this segment of the market.

The Clarity Act, which passed the House and is pending in the
Senate, seeks to address the broader market structure for digital
assets. The bill proposes clearer delineation of regulatory
authority between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and introduces new
registration categories for entities involved in spot digital asset
activities. If enacted, the Clarity Act would grant the CFTC
primary oversight of spot digital asset markets, filling a current
regulatory gap.

Federal regulatory bodies have significantly increased their
engagement with crypto. The White House has issued multiple
executive orders and established task forces to coordinate policy
across agencies.2 The SEC, CFTC, as well as banking
regulators are all actively developing guidance and seeking
industry input.3

The SEC has established a Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner
Hester Peirce, and has issued new guidance on digital asset
activities.4 Recent public statements from SEC
leadership emphasize a commitment to ensuring US leadership in
digital asset innovation and to providing timely guidance on best
practices for distribution, custody and trading.5 The
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), while reliant on
SEC rulemaking, is also engaging with market participants and
focusing on core regulatory concerns such as accurate public
communications, supervision, anti-money laundering and
recordkeeping.6

The CFTC continues to issue guidance and grant exemptive
relief,7 including recent requests for comment on
leveraged spot digital asset products.8 The agency is
exploring ways to provide additional clarity and facilitate the
development of new products within its existing authorities.

Traditional financial institutions and service providers are
increasingly seeking to integrate digital assets into their
business models, while decentralized finance (DeFi) and
international entities are exploring entry into the US market.
There is a strong emphasis on education and collaboration, as firms
work to understand the regulatory environment and prepare for
forthcoming changes.

Key infrastructure providers, such as the Depository Trust &
Clearing Corporation (DTCC), are developing standards and protocols
to support blockchain interoperability and certification, which is
expected to enhance comfort and participation among larger market
participants.9 Industry partnerships and workshops are
underway to test and refine new products and services.

A notable shift has occurred in regulatory engagement, with
agencies now more open to dialogue and collaboration with industry
participants. Law firms and consultants are facilitating these
interactions, helping clients navigate complex and evolving
requirements.10 While regulatory frameworks are still
under development, there is a clear trend toward increased
transparency, engagement and the establishment of best
practices.

Despite the progress, several challenges remain. Key regulatory
definitions and requirements, such as those related to possession
and control of digital assets, are still being clarified.
FINRA's ability to approve new business models is limited by
the current absence of a comprehensive regulatory framework from
the SEC. Firms must continue to exercise diligence in areas such as
customer communications, supervision, anti-money laundering and
recordkeeping.

The US digital asset regulation is undergoing rapid
transformation, with significant legislative and regulatory
initiatives underway. Market participants should anticipate
continued developments and increased regulatory clarity in the near
term. Engagement with regulators, industry collaboration and
adherence to evolving best practices will be critical for firms
seeking to participate in this dynamic sector. Future webinars and
industry updates are planned to provide ongoing guidance as the
regulatory environment continues to evolve.

Home » How Innovation Is Influencing Crypto Compliance Worldwide

As blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi), and NFTs reshape global financial systems, regulators are racing to adapt compliance frameworks. Balancing innovation with risk management has become a critical challenge, making it key for businesses and investors to understand how new technologies are influencing crypto compliance.

Cryptocurrencies emerged in response to the limitations of traditional financial systems. Many consumers and businesses felt disillusioned by banks and governmental institutions, leading to the growth of an alternative form of currency not controlled by any central authority. With this rise came significant regulatory challenges. Governments fear that cryptocurrencies could facilitate money laundering and other illicit activities. 

They have been scrambling to implement regulations that mitigate these risks while promoting innovation. The regulatory landscape is inconsistent, with different countries adopting various approaches based on their unique economic and sociopolitical contexts. Regulations are slow to catch up with this fast-paced technology. 

Innovations in technology are disrupting financial markets and necessitating changes in compliance practices. One significant innovation is the use of smart contracts, which automate compliance processes in various sectors. By using blockchain technology, businesses can create contracts that automatically execute transactions once predefined conditions are met. This minimizes the need for manual oversight, enhances transparency, and reduces the likelihood of fraud. 

It raises questions about accountability and enforceability, prompting regulators to rethink traditional compliance frameworks. Simultaneously, the development of regulatory technology, or regtech, is transforming how compliance is achieved. Regtech employs artificial intelligence and machine learning to help businesses comply with regulations efficiently. By automating risk assessments and monitoring transactions, regtech solutions can significantly reduce the burden on businesses and ensure compliance effectively. 

The approach to cryptocurrency regulation varies widely across the globe. Some regions, like the European Union, are moving towards comprehensive regulatory frameworks designed to oversee crypto-asset activities. Recent proposals include the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which aims to establish a unified regulatory environment within EU member states. Regulations in this context would cover everything from exchanges to stablecoins, requiring firms to adapt their compliance strategies accordingly. On the other hand, regions like Asia exhibit both progressive and restrictive measures. Countries such as Singapore emphasize promoting innovation while ensuring consumer protection through a clear regulatory framework. 

In the United Kingdom, regulators are grappling with aligning their approach to emerging crypto technologies. Recent developments indicate a shift towards establishing clearer guidelines for crypto firms operating within its jurisdiction. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has emphasized the importance of effective anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) measures. To facilitate compliance, many organizations are looking closely at the UK Cryptoasset Regulation that seeks to balance innovation with regulatory oversight. Such frameworks are vital as they offer businesses clarity regarding their responsibilities, thus enabling them to innovate within defined limits. Companies that understand these regulations can tap into the potential of cryptocurrencies without overwhelming their operations with compliance burdens. 

To navigate the complexities of crypto compliance, many businesses are forging partnerships with legal and compliance experts to ensure they remain ahead of regulatory changes. Collaboration allows firms to pool resources, share knowledge, and leverage expertise, which can be particularly beneficial in a rapidly evolving sector like crypto. 

By partnering with technology companies specializing in blockchain and regtech, businesses can develop tailored compliance solutions that align with both innovation and regulatory requirements. Industry groups and associations play a role in advocating for a regulatory framework that fosters innovation. By cooperating with policymakers, these organizations can provide feedback on proposed regulations. 

As cryptocurrencies continue to gain traction and mainstream acceptance, the complexities surrounding compliance will only grow. Regulatory bodies worldwide may increasingly look towards standards set by organizations like the FATF and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) for guidance. 

As innovation in crypto technologies continues to advance, compliance frameworks must be flexible enough to adapt to new challenges and risks. Investors and businesses will need to remain vigilant, keeping abreast of the evolving regulatory landscape. Continuous engagement with regulators will be key in ensuring that proposed policies support innovation without compromising safety and stability. Innovation and compliance can create a stronger framework if all stakeholders collaborate on cryptocurrency's future.

Innovation is reshaping crypto compliance, pushing regulators and businesses to adapt rapidly. By fostering collaboration and aligning technology with evolving rules, the industry can achieve a balance between growth and regulatory responsibility, ensuring a secure and sustainable future for cryptocurrency.

XRP saw aggressive swings before an abrupt halt capped the session, leaving traders to debate whether institutional flows or technical glitches drove the erratic pattern. The token moved in a 5% range before trading froze at the $3.00 mark.

• XRP gained as much as 5% from $2.97 to $3.10 during the August 18–19 session before sliding back toward $3.00.• The final 60 minutes showed heavy activity — price moved between $3.01 and $2.99 — before freezing completely at 08:19 with zero volume recorded.• The abrupt halt raised speculation of technical disruption or liquidity vacuum in major trading venues.• Volumes peaked at 3.26 million in a single minute (08:00–08:01), consistent with institutional order flow or algorithmic triggers.

XRP XRP$2.9289 call options at the $4 strike have experienced heavy block trading activity this week, despite the price decline.

Data tracked by Amberdata shows that one million contracts of the $4 call option expiring on Dec. 26 changed hands via a block trade on Monday. Contracts on Deribit are sized 1,000 XRP. A block trade is a large transaction that is privately negotiated and executed over the counter and then listed on the exchange.

The $4 call represents a bet that the payments-focused cryptocurrency's price will rise beyond that level by the end of December.

However, the surge in activity for the $4 call does not necessarily signal bullish sentiment. Observers note that the block trade was likely part of a covered call strategy, where higher strike out-of-the-money calls—like the $4 strike—are written (sold) against existing spot market holdings.

In other words, the large block trade involved a user writing the $4 call rather than purchasing it in anticipation of a price rally. The option was likely acquired by market makers, whose role is to create order book liquidity and maintain a market-neutral exposure.

""I would guess some big holder was doing covered calls,"" Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen, told CoinDesk.

The covered call strategy involves writing higher strike out-of-the-money call options against a long position in the spot market. This helps the investor earn an extra yield on top of the coin stash, which comes from the premium received for selling the call option. The setup, however, limits the potential upside gains.

The covered call strategy is popular among BTC holders, and its increasing adoption has contributed to a steady decline in implied volatility over the past two years.

XRP's price briefly fell to $2.94 on Monday, tracking the broader market swoon and has since stabilized just above $3. Prices hit a record high of over $2.6 last month, CoinDesk data show.

Crypto markets spent the past 24 hours unwinding bullish bets as $270 million in liquidations hit traders, led by ether (ETH) and bitcoin BTC$113,603.03 longs. 

The flush came alongside fading hopes of a September Fed rate cut, with Polymarket odds of “no cut” jumping from 12% to 26%. That shift left some investors recalibrating risk ahead of Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech on Friday. 

Nick Forster, founder at Derive.xyz, called the move a reset of short-term positioning rather than a structural shift in a Monday note.

“It's been a turbulent 24 hours in the crypto market, with over $270 million in liquidations, led by $170 million in ETH and $104 million in BTC,” he said.

“A vast majority (95%) of these were longs, triggered by moderate pullbacks of 3% for ETH and 2% for BTC. This flush comes as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September dropped sharply,” Forster said.

That macro repricing spilled into derivatives. ETH's seven-day implied volatility rose to 73% from 68%, even as 30-day IV stayed steady, Derive's data showed. The divergence suggests traders see turbulence in the coming sessions but aren't yet bracing for a prolonged selloff.

Forster flagged a 21% probability of BTC hitting $100,000 before September's close, up from 15%, while the chance of ETH correcting to $4,000 by month-end climbed to 60%.

SignalPlus head of Insights Augustine Fan noted that markets have already ruled out any chance of an outsized 50-basis-point cut.

“Any hopes of a 50bp cut at the September meeting were quickly dashed, with ~90% of a single cut being priced as of Friday's close,” Fan said. “Focus will be on Jackson Hole later this week, but we are not looking for a lot of new dovish surprises given the inflation backdrop.”

That backdrop has weighed on majors. Bitcoin slipped to $115,036, its lowest in nearly two weeks, while Ethereum traded at $4,235. XRP held firmer at $3.02, trimming weekly gains to just 4% from a 9% high earlier.

 Polkadot has launched Polkadot Capital Group to connect traditional finance with its blockchain ecosystem, focusing on tokenization and DeFi. 

Polkadot has launched a capital markets division aimed at bridging traditional finance and its blockchain ecosystem, underscoring the network's push to attract institutional players as digital assets gain traction.

Unveiled on Tuesday, Polkadot Capital Group was created in response to rising institutional demand for digital assets and improving regulatory clarity in the United States. 

Its mission is to connect traditional finance with Polkadot's infrastructure, helping institutions explore opportunities in asset management, banking, venture capital, exchanges and over-the-counter trading.

The division will showcase practical use cases in decentralized finance, staking and the fast-growing area of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.

According to Polkadot Capital Group lead David Sedacca, the team is already pursuing partnerships with asset managers, brokers and allocators.

While headquartered in the Cayman Islands, the division was also shaped by recent US regulatory progress, including the passage of the GENIUS stablecoin act and the House of Representatives advancing separate bills on crypto market structure and anti-CBDC measures.

Launched in 2020, Polkadot is the 24th-largest blockchain by market capitalization, valued at roughly $6.1 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Its defining feature is a multichain architecture that allows independent blockchains, known as parachains, to connect and interoperate.

Polkadot's capital markets pivot comes as more blockchain firms realign their strategies to capture institutional demand in areas such as asset tokenization, bond issuance and stablecoin settlement.

In December, tokenized securities company Prometheum raised $20 million to expand efforts to bring traditional securities onchain.

In June, Digital Asset secured $135 million to scale its Canton Network, a blockchain built for regulated financial institutions that has already piloted the tokenization of bonds, gold and other assets.

Meanwhile, Polygon is advancing its capital markets strategy through Obligate, which partnered with Capital Système Investissements to execute a bond issuance on Polygon using USDC (USDC).

Traditional financial institutions have acknowledged blockchain's potential to cut costs, speed up transactions and reduce friction in banking. As Cointelegraph reported, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have developed a sandbox for tokenized money market funds with round-the-clock settlement.

 The appointment of Hines signals a renewed focus on entering US markets and more investments in “domestic infrastructure,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said. 

Stablecoin giant Tether hired former White House Crypto Council Executive Director Bo Hines as its new strategic adviser for digital assets and US strategy, signaling a push to expand in the world's biggest economy.

Tether, the issuer of the USDt (USDT) stablecoin, appointed Hines to directly engage and coordinate the company's US strategy and expansion as part of its core focus with immediate effect, according to a Tuesday announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

Hines previously served in President Donald Trump's administration, where he worked on initiatives to foster digital asset innovation, set guardrails for stablecoin issuers and develop collaboration between government and the blockchain industry.

In his new role, Hines will collaborate with Tether's leadership team to execute its US market entry and cultivate “constructive relationships” with policymakers and industry stakeholders.

Hines' “deep understanding of the legislative process, combined with his passion for practical blockchain adoption, makes him an invaluable asset as Tether enters the biggest market in the world,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, adding:

Tether Investments has already reinvested almost $5 billion in the US economy. Hines' addition aims to “reinforce” this commitment and alignment to the US market, the announcement said.

Tether is planning to enter the US with a new “domestic” dollar-backed stablecoin, which may launch in late 2025 or early 2026, depending on progress with US lawmakers.

In December, Tether announced a $775 million strategic investment with video-sharing platform Rumble, two months after the stablecoin giant invested $100 million in Latin American agricultural giant Adecoagro, marking its first investment in the agriculture and food sector, Cointelegraph reported in September 2024.

“I'm thrilled to join Tether at such a pivotal moment,” to help deliver ecosystem products that will “empower American consumers and help revolutionize our nation's financial system,” said Hines, adding:

Stablecoins are a significant monetary tool for regions with little traditional banking infrastructure, enabling digital transactions without the need for a bank account, potentially reducing remittance fees by up to 97% for cross-border payments.

Tether's appointment comes less than two weeks after Hines stepped down from his former White House role, Cointelegraph reported on Aug. 10.

Under Hines' leadership, the White House Crypto Council published a comprehensive report proposing a regulatory action plan for digital assets in the US in July, which received criticism for its lack of progress on the strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve.

In March, Hines suggested the US government could revalue its gold holdings and convert part of them to Bitcoin to build a national reserve without adding to the federal budget. The proposal aligned with “budget-neutral” strategies outlined in Trump's executive order.

A month later, Hines said the administration was exploring other “creative ways” to increase its Bitcoin holdings, including using revenue from import tariffs. The executive order also prohibits the government from selling any of its Bitcoin and directs the Treasury and Commerce departments to identify budget-neutral methods to accumulate more.

 While many eye a September rate cut, one economist said Bitcoin won't be fully priced in until the US president announces Fed Chair Jerome Powell's replacement. 

Bitcoin investors have yet to factor in a potentially more dovish Federal Reserve, which will depend on who US President Donald Trump nominates to replace Chair Jerome Powell, economist Alex Krüger said.

Bitcoin (BTC) traders see the Fed's first potential rate cut this year, expected in September, as creating a more bullish environment for Bitcoin. The right Fed chair nominee could push the price even further. 

“I have a high degree of confidence this cycle is not over because I am expecting changes in the Fed to bring on considerably more dovish monetary policy,” Krüger said in an X post on Monday.

“This would start to get priced in once Trump announces his nominee to replace Powell,” he said. Powell's term expires in May 2026, and Trump has already begun putting forward names as potential candidates to replace him.

The Fed affects Bitcoin through its monetary policy, which influences interest rates, overall market sentiment and whether investors are willing to take risks or play it safe.

According to a CNBC report on Wednesday, the Trump administration is considering 11 candidates to replace Powell. 

The latest names added to the list include Jefferies' chief market strategist David Zervos, BlackRock's global fixed income chief investment officer Rick Rieder and former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey.

Other reports suggest Trump has narrowed the list to three or four candidates and may announce a replacement sooner than expected. 

Trump's relationship with Powell has been strained since his inauguration in January, with the president repeatedly criticizing the Fed's reluctance to cut rates and publicly calling out Powell.

On April 17, Trump said, “Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!” Meanwhile, Florida Senator Rick Scott agreed with the president, saying, “It's time for new leadership at the Federal Reserve.”

Krüger said he believes the Fed will cut rates at its Sept. 17 meeting.

The view is widely shared by the market, with 83.9% of participants anticipating a rate cut,  according to the CME FedWatch Tool. 

On Friday, Coinbase Institutional's global head of research, David Duong, said there was “significant retail capital sitting on the sidelines” in money market funds, and the Fed's easing could “unlock greater retail participation in the medium term.”

Can Peanut Allergies Be Cured?

Remarkable new treatments can free millions of kids and adults from the deadly threat of peanut allergy, tackling one of our fastest-growing medical problems

By Maryn McKenna edited by Josh Fischman

Andrew B. Myers

Anabelle Terry, a slender, self-possessed 13-year-old, has heard the peanut butter story her entire life. At two and a half she ate nuts for the first time. Her mother, Victoria, had made a little treat: popcorn drizzled with melted caramel, chocolate and peanut butter. Anabelle gobbled it down. “And afterward, I felt really sick,” she says. A few minutes later she vomited on the kitchen floor.

There was more trouble ahead. A visit to an allergist confirmed that Anabelle was severely allergic to the peanut butter in the dessert, as well as to most other nuts. It began a life upheaval familiar to families of kids with allergies: learning to decode labels, to carry an EpiPen, and to interrogate friends and their parents about the ingredients in a birthday cake.

Every once in a while, there would be a slip-up. It might be a snack that someone hadn't scrutinized or a food package that didn't list all potential allergens. And every time, Anabelle's reactions got worse. Although she was just a schoolkid, she had to stay alert. “Eating lunch, all my friends would have PB&Js. And I'd be like, I'm going to sit a little bit farther away,” she recalls. “And going over to friends' houses after school, we always had to make sure: ‘Hey, would you mind making a nut-free meal?'”

Most of that caution is in Anabelle's past now. For the vast majority of patients, peanut allergy is an unpredictable, lifelong affliction. But thanks to a clinical trial that Anabelle entered when she was nine, she can now tolerate peanuts and tree nuts well enough to feel safe every day. The drug she received in that trial was approved for treating food allergies by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year, making it the second food allergy remedy to earn the agency's blessing since 2020. And an array of other clinical trials are tackling peanut allergy in a variety of ways, from new modalities for desensitizing patients to bold new applications of existing drugs. Some have reported striking successes. “It's an amazing time right now,” says R. Sharon Chinthrajah, an associate professor at Stanford Medicine, who led the national trial Anabelle joined.

In fact, medicine's entire understanding of how to keep children safe from ever developing allergies is being rethought. With peanut reactions, for instance, there are real hopes that children can be protected—definitely from the worst effects and maybe from any at all. “The future looks very bright for our patients to have more choices in different periods in their lifetime,” Chinthrajah says. “We're not yet at the cure, but we're definitely moving along on the therapeutic front to be able to deal with this chronic disease.”

Peanut allergies are perplexing, in part because they appeared so recently. Food reactions have occurred throughout recorded history, but widespread peanut problems didn't begin to surface until the 1990s. The effects on everyday life were dramatic: airlines began to deprive passengers of peanuts and announce that certain snacks might threaten someone else onboard. Elementary schools set aside peanut-free tables at lunch, and food manufacturers began to label their baked goods “school-safe” to signal they were free of common allergens. Epinephrine auto-injectors, which can shut down severe allergic shock (and are usually called EpiPens, for the dominant trademarked version), were rare and carried mostly for the occasional beesting. Now they are a ubiquitous, nearly $3-billion product.

Scott Sicherer, a clinician and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, watched reports of peanut threats rise in real time. In 1997 he and his colleagues conducted the first survey of peanut and tree-nut allergy in the U.S., finding that 1.6 percent of adults and 0.6 percent of children described themselves as allergic based on reactions they had experienced. The group repeated the survey with a similar-size representative sample five years later and learned that the rate of nut allergies reported in children had doubled to 1.2 percent. In a third sampling, conducted 11 years after the first one, the overall rate tripled from that initial measurement to 2.1 percent of children, and peanut allergies were reported in 1.4 percent of kids.

Since then, the prevalence has risen even more. A large national survey of parents conducted between 2015 and 2016 by researchers in Illinois and California found that food allergies affect 7.6 percent of U.S. children, and peanut allergy affects 2.2 percent. An analysis of health-care payment data in 2018 asked how many new diagnoses of peanut allergy there are among children born each year—what statisticians call incidence, as opposed to prevalence—and reported a rate of 5 percent. And what's more common is now also more dire: researchers at the Mayo Clinic have estimated that emergency-department visits for anaphylactic shock caused by foodborne allergies—the kind of reaction that can squeeze shut airways and trigger heart attacks—increased more than threefold between 2005 and 2014. The highest rate was for peanut allergies.

“One out of 10 individuals in the U.S., more than 33 million, has a food allergy,” says Sung Poblete, CEO of Food Allergy Research and Education, an advocacy organization. “One out of 13 kids has food allergies. That's two kids out of every classroom.”

Medicine's entire understanding of how to keep children safe from allergies is being rethought.

This increase—which is happening around the world, though not at the same rate in every nation—is a mystery. Food allergy is fundamentally a disease of inflammation. The immune system recognizes certain proteins in a food as unwelcome and launches a cascading reaction that often involves an antibody called IgE. The antibody triggers a whole-body inflammatory response: hives, swelling, vomiting, and, in the worst cases, crashing blood pressure and an inability to breathe. “Inflammatory diseases of many kinds are more common than they used to be,” says Brian Vickery, a professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine and director of the Food Allergy Program at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, who is a principal investigator on multiple clinical trials. “Eczema, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cancer, depression—all these things have inflammatory origins and are more common now.”

The reasons seem to be varied. Researchers have proposed that cleaner modern life, early antibiotic exposure, and microbiome damage from detergents and surfactants—all components of what's called the hygiene hypothesis—might influence how often allergies develop. Genetics may predispose people to react to certain foods. There may be a clue as well in which foods provoke reactions. Up to 90 percent of food allergies are caused by just eight things: peanuts, milk, eggs, fish, crustaceans, tree nuts, wheat and soybeans. (These are the foods that, according to a 2004 U.S. law, have to be declared on labels; a separate 2021 law added sesame to the list.) Why these foods are especially allergenic also puzzles researchers. They contain complex proteins, which remain intact during digestion and may trigger the immune system in ways other foods do not; these proteins also may have similarities to common environmental allergens.

Regardless of the underlying causes, research is zeroing in on ways to mitigate food allergies. Peanut allergy is the priority because the disruptions it imposes have become so visible in society. But the hope is that some of the new approaches can be applied to other allergies—and to help children such as Anabelle who experience more than one.

The first priority in tackling peanut allergy has been children who are at extraordinary risk, the ones whose lives are at stake if they consume something with the smallest cross-contamination from a manufacturing error.

Andrew B. Myers

People who suffer from seasonal allergies often receive allergy shots, a program of injections that gradually decreases their sensitivity and keeps their reactions at a level they can tolerate. Allergy shots were briefly tried for peanuts as well, but they were abandoned because of safety concerns, including the 1991 death of a trial participant who received a miscalculated dose. After that, patients' only remaining option was to change their diet, but mistakes and cross-contamination kept putting them at risk. It took more than a decade for immunologists to try a different method of desensitization for peanut allergies that had a century-old history: giving minuscule, escalating doses by mouth, a process called oral immunotherapy. A large international study in 2018 definitively proved that the approach worked, and it became the standard for treating kids whose families weren't willing to trust avoidance. In 2020 it led to the first-ever FDA approval of a therapy for peanut allergy, a powdered form of peanut protein with the trade name Palforzia that is dispensed over months in precisely metered doses.

That was a huge advance—but, for some families, still not a solution. Initially Palforzia was not approved for children younger than four years of age. Dosing needed to be extremely precise and, according to some practitioners, was tricky to manage. Plus, the drug debuted at the start of the COVID pandemic, when repeat office visits for dose changes became especially challenging. And as the drug's own labeling acknowledges, taking it poses the possibility of reactions. That has left some allergy families searching for alternatives to oral immunotherapy. “Ten to 20 percent of patients can't finish the treatment because of the side effects,” says Edwin H. Kim, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and director of the UNC Food Allergy Initiative. “And up to 10 percent of patients experience anaphylaxis at some point while they're on the treatment itself.”

Kim is participating in research into two other methods for presenting smaller doses of peanut allergens to the immune system safely: sublingually (under the tongue) and on the skin. The skin method involves a patch containing peanut protein that is applied daily at home for as many as three years; the patch always contains the same dose but is gradually applied for escalating amounts of time. In a phase 3 clinical trial, the results of which were published in 2023, 67 percent of toddlers who were too young to receive Palforzia and who wore the patch were able to raise the amount of peanut protein they could safely consume to the equivalent of three or four peanuts. That was twice as many children as in the placebo group.

The hope for the patch, which has not yet been approved by the FDA, is that it will be easier for kids to tolerate because of its lower dose and easier for parents to manage logistically. Lora Milburn's son, Vance, wore it for a year as a trial participant. He was eight months old when he started showing allergy symptoms—too young to have words for what he was experiencing—and four years old when he entered the trial through Kim's clinic. He was expected to finish the trial in August of this year, and his mother already thinks his sensitivity is diminished. She does not know whether he received the real treatment or a placebo, but she has noticed the way he reacts to the patch. “Some days he doesn't really complain about it; some days he's scratching his back against the wall trying to get the itchies out,” she says. “But he knows why we're doing it. If it's nighttime, he's like, ‘Mommy, take my patch off, put my new patch on.'”

All these exposure therapies—the patch, the oral doses, the version that goes under the tongue—target reactions to specific peanut allergens. But a separate cadre of researchers has envisioned the struggle to control peanut responses as an entryway to remodeling the way that the immune system reacts to food more broadly.

Warren et al., in Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, Vol. 130; May 2023 (multiallergy reference)

In 2013 they began testing the efficacy of an existing drug, a monoclonal antibody named omalizumab (marketed as Xolair) that is already approved for severe asthma caused by allergies. “It's an anti-IgE biologic, and IgE antibodies are at the center of the whole allergic inflammatory cascade,” Chinthrajah explains. “And the beauty of something like that, where you're targeting allergic inflammation, is that it has the potential to help all allergies.”

Investigators launched a trial that admitted children and adults who showed allergies to peanuts and at least two other foods; Anabelle Terry was one of the participants. Using a complex study design with several stages, the scientists tested whether regular doses of the injectable drug worked better to reduce allergic sensitivity than did placebos; whether shorter or longer courses of the drug made a difference; whether it worked best alone or combined with oral immunotherapy; and how often and in what amounts people could consume allergenic food once they stopped the treatment.

In 2024 the researchers (a very large team working in multiple medical centers) published the first results. In children aged one to 17 years, 67 percent of those who received the drug were able to eat the equivalent of four peanuts, enough to keep them safe from any accidental exposure. Based on those results, and anticipating more data, the FDA immediately approved Xolair as a protection against peanut allergy.

Participating in the trial was a significant commitment for families. Jennifer Jennison's son, Jack, was two years old and allergic to eggs, peanuts and cashews—among other foods—when the trial accepted him at its Atlanta site. Every two weeks she or her husband, David, would take time off work to bring their son for an injection. After around seven months, the protocol added tests of small doses of food allergens in applesauce to the office visits; after several hours of observation to make sure the dose was safe, the family carried home boxes of premeasured allergen powder for Jack to eat every day. And in a third phase, Jack progressed to a daily maintenance regimen with actual food: powdered egg white, a cashew and seven Reese's Pieces.

Jack's experience is similar to Anabelle's. She was in the same arm of the trial and now eats a daily dose of peanuts, walnuts and cashews to keep her protection up. But what happened to the Jennisons afterward shows that no peanut-allergy protection is perfect yet. Convincing a child to eat the same foods every day is no small task. First Jack refused his maintenance dose of cashew. After a while he started to resist the Reese's Pieces, too.

The Jennisons live in Atlanta, the corporate home of Chick-fil-A, and seemingly every kid's birthday party features the restaurant's nuggets as well as a cake—which both contain eggs. “For us, eggs are the most important,” Jennifer says. “I still feel more comfortable with the cross-contamination risk of peanut knowing that he had built up a tolerance. But for now we're back to avoidance.”

Because new approaches to desensitization have worked so well for severely affected kids, researchers have begun to address the needs of those who are somewhat less allergic. For instance, some kids can eat half a peanut before suffering a reaction. That's a tiny amount from the perspective of a nonallergic person, but it's a huge, life-threatening dose to a highly allergic one. Such people, whom some immunologists call “high threshold,” include possibly 800,000 kids with peanut allergies just in the U.S. But their triggers are so different from those of highly allergic people that they had been excluded from some trials of desensitization strategies. Indeed, immunology didn't have a clear understanding of whether desensitization that started from their baseline would even achieve the same results as in highly allergic kids.

All of that is now changing because after years of diagnosing patients in this class, medical practitioners could perceive that the group was being left behind. “We would have children who maybe would eat half of a serving before they would start to have symptoms,” Sicherer says. “And what we would tell those individuals is: ‘Your symptoms weren't so bad, so you're not really that much in danger. You still need to avoid it, but if there were a small accident, maybe you would be okay.'”

Jackson Esteves was 10 months old when his parents discovered his allergies. His mother, Holly, who was so thoughtful about her children's diets that she made her own baby food, was starting to introduce him to solids. She made a spinach pancake for her older daughter, slid a few morsels onto Jackson's high-chair tray, and then watched in horror as raised red hives rippled down his body. The pancake contained eggs, and tests showed that Jackson was allergic to them—and to dairy, sesame, tree nuts and peanuts.

Andrew B. Myers

The diagnosis sent the Esteveses, who live on Long Island in New York State, hurtling into a landscape familiar to other allergy families. “I was suddenly attuned to every food label,” Holly says now, 10 years later. “I was learning how to modify recipes. I became very insecure in social settings, family parties, birthday parties. I had to bring everything for him.” What made it even more complex was that no one else in the family—Jackson's parents, his older sister, or a younger sister who was born soon after the pancacke incident—shared Jackson's allergies.

The Esteves family didn't know it at the time, but Jackson's allergies concealed a kernel of promise. Although he was extremely reactive to some foods, medicine considered him just minimally allergic to peanuts—and that made him eligible for a new trial launched by Sicherer and a team of researchers from several institutions, called CAFETERIA. (Allergy researchers seem to be exceptionally fond of complex acronyms. “CAFETERIA” comes from “Challenging to Foods with Escalating Thresholds for Reducing Food Allergy.” The Xolair study was known as OUtMATCH, which stood for “Omalizumab as Monotherapy and as Adjunct Therapy to Multi-Allergen Oral Immunotherapy in Food Allergic Children and Adults.”)

Starting in 2019, children between four and 14 years old consumed escalating doses of peanut butter, first under medical supervision and then at home, first with a carefully measured eighth of a teaspoon and increasing every eight weeks until they were consuming one tablespoon daily. Then they were asked to eat two tablespoons of peanut butter—the amount that would go in a sandwich, which an allergic child would never try to consume—every week for 16 weeks but not necessarily in daily doses. Finally, they had to refrain for eight weeks before being tested a final time.

It worked. Among the 32 kids in the peanut-eating arm of the study (as opposed to a control group that avoided peanuts), every child achieved the study's final goal of consuming the equivalent of about three tablespoons of peanut butter without a reaction.

That result was “amazing,” says Patricia Fulkerson, chief of the food-allergy section of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which funded the escalation study. “A 100 percent response rate is hard not to be happy with.”

Jen Christiansen; Source: “National Trends in Emergency Department Visits and Hospitalizations for Food-Induced Anaphylaxis in US Children,” by Megan S. Motosue et al., in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Vol. 29, August 2018 (emergency department data)

The study's authors say it needs to be repeated in more kids and at different medical centers. Jackson, who turned 11 this year, has been able to eat peanuts safely since he completed his participation in CAFETERIA; he'll even eat a PB&J once in a while, although it is not a favorite food. Most of his allergies to other foods remain unaffected, but “he was a success story” all the same, his mother says. “He's over peanut allergy.”

Even though the CAFETERIA study worked at its small scale and the different approach in the OUtMATCH trial resulted in an FDA drug approval, those tests and others share a limiting feature: they are hard for both the children going through them and the parents guiding them. The kids have to push themselves to swallow something that has made them ill in the past and that still, even in tiny doses, might produce an unpleasant reaction. Parents have to endure the stress of watching their children undergo food challenges to test their progress, knowing that life-threatening anaphylaxis might result.

Plus, for highly allergic people, the most that desensitization can offer is to keep them safer, not completely safe. “Ultimately we're not curing the allergy,” Vickery says. “We're kind of providing a protective shell around the patient, a way to defend them against an accidental exposure. They're still reading labels, they're still avoiding the food, they are still carrying their epinephrine.” What families long for is something that could make peanut allergy just go away.

A newly proposed treatment might manage that by rewriting the immune system's memory of antigens—although research into it is in such early stages that results have been reported for only one patient, and the first small clinical trial is just beginning.

The treatment involves successive administration of two drugs, both made by biotechnology company Regeneron. The first drug, dupilumab (marketed as Dupixent), is a monoclonal antibody that is already FDA-approved for treating moderate to severe eczema and asthma and a few other conditions; it works by blocking the action of specific cytokines, signaling proteins that encourage the production of IgE. The second, linvoseltamab, is also an antibody and recently received FDA approval for treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This cancer affects plasma cells, a category of white blood cell that produces antibodies, including IgE.

Investigators initially thought that dupilumab could be a solo treatment for peanut allergy. But several trials showed that although peanut-specific IgE levels went down under its influence, there was no long-term practical benefit. Even immediately after a course of the drug in one trial, participants were unable to tolerate peanuts. In another test, drug recipients showed improved peanut tolerance right away, but it dropped three months later. IgE availability bounced back.

That led researchers to look at the second drug, which deals a mortal blow to the cells where IgE is manufactured. In mice and monkeys, administering a dose of linvoseltamab during an ongoing course of dupilumab destroyed the cells producing IgE. Continuing the dupilumab while the plasma cells grew back suppressed allergic inflammation and kept the animals' immune systems from restarting the overreactions.

“This is very different than other approaches of trying to build tolerance in patients or trying to just decrease IgE,” says Jennifer Maloney, who leads Regeneron's therapeutic work on immune, inflammatory and infectious diseases. “This is something that potentially could remove that allergic antibody from the person.”

The company has shared results from just one patient so far, a 20-year-old man with multiple severe allergies. Regeneron described his treatment at the J. P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2025, documenting a dramatic drop in his IgE production during the dupilumab course and after the linvoseltamab was given. His case has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but the company is now recruiting a small group of patients for an early-phase trial that will primarily test safety. Vickery plans to enroll one patient at Emory, where linvoseltamab is already being used to treat cancer patients.

“We're going to learn something really important,” he says. “If we wanted to cure the disease and make it go away, would this be a viable approach to doing so? If it doesn't work, we're going to learn things about why it didn't work and what we might need to do in the next trial.”

There is another goal of peanut-allergy science. It's the ultimate goal: prevention, not desensitization or cure. And that may be possible for children being born now, thanks to a British study that has been running for more than a decade—and to a snack.

In the early 2000s Gideon Lack, an immunologist then at Imperial College London, went to Tel Aviv to give a talk on how food allergies were rising around the world. He asked the audience, all Israeli pediatricians and allergists, how many of them had treated children with peanut allergy. From his own experience in the U.K., he expected every hand to shoot up. Only a few did.

This low show of hands was extraordinary, and it immediately presented an opportunity to ask why the U.K. and Israel were so different. After returning home, Lack set up a survey to compare national rates of peanut allergy. To rule out some undetected genetic difference in the Israeli kids, he chose to limit the survey to Jewish children, recruiting roughly 5,000 in each country. The results revealed that the occurrence of peanut allergy in Israeli kids was one-tenth the rate among U.K. ones. A second set of questions posed to a subset of the children, 77 in the U.K. and 99 in Israel, hinted at why the rates were so different. Before their first birthday, Israeli children frequently ate peanuts, often in a ubiquitous snack called Bamba—something like Cheetos but coated in peanut butter instead of cheese. By the time they were 14 months old, almost 80 percent of the Israeli children were eating at least a few grams of peanut protein every month. In contrast, 80 percent of the British children had never tasted peanuts.

Early introduction clearly will prevent peanut allergy. “It does work. It's the right thing to do.” —Gideon Lack, King's College London

It made sense that kids in the U.K. weren't eating peanuts because at the time, medical authorities there and in the U.S. recommended that allergy-causing foods be kept out of the diets of children from allergy-prone families until they were three years old. Lack and his team wondered whether the Israeli experience showed that this well-meaning advice might be wrong. They set up a fresh study, recruiting families with infants who were between four and 10 months old and had severe eczema or showed evidence of egg allergy, signs that their IgE production was already disrupted. The babies were tested for preexisting peanut allergy, and if they were negative, they went into one of two groups. The families of one group were told to keep their children from eating peanuts until they were five years old. The rest of the families were encouraged to introduce their kids to peanut products, preferably Bamba or peanut butter.

When the investigators tested the children five years later, the differences were stark. Among the children told to avoid peanuts, 13.7 percent developed peanut allergies. Among the children who began eating peanuts early, only 1.9 percent did—an 86 percent difference.

Lack published the results in 2015, working with a team primarily from King's College London, where he had moved to research pediatric allergies. This study, called LEAP (for “Learning Early About Peanut Allergy,” in a departure from long acronyms), caused an earthquake in allergy science. Anthony Fauci, at the time the director of NIAID, which helped to fund it, said it had “the potential to transform how we approach food-allergy prevention.”

Two more studies cemented the findings. In one, published the following year, children from both arms of the LEAP study were asked to not eat peanut products in their sixth year. Allergy rates rose further among the children who had refrained from peanuts all along, but children who started eating peanut products early maintained their low rates of allergy.

In a third, published in 2024, the team went back to children who had been in the LEAP study and were at least 12 years old to check whether the preventive effect lasted. It had. In the group that refrained from peanuts up to age five, 15.4 percent were allergic to peanuts. In the group that ate peanut products early, only 4.4 percent had bad reactions. Early introduction “overwhelmingly will prevent peanut allergy,” Lack says. “It clearly has been shown that it does work. It's the right thing to do.”

But there have been persistent challenges to implementing that idea. Health authorities no longer recommend that parents avoid feeding allergy-related foods for three years—but most national and international guidelines still recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, and the cultural pressure to maintain that time frame is immense. In 2019 the American Academy of Pediatrics did revise its guidance to allow the introduction of potential allergens at four to six months for children who seem likely to be at high risk, indicated by symptoms of eczema.

Lack worries this approach doesn't provide exposure as early in life as the immune system needs; the children in the LEAP study and in an unrelated 2016 study of early introduction began peanut exposure at four and three months, respectively. “To introduce peanuts effectively in a four-month-old baby, they need to be trained to eat solids already,” he says. “If you start the weaning process at four months, then the baby may not get peanut butter in significant quantities until five to six months of age. And if it's a baby with eczema, it's too late.”

Andrew B. Myers

The challenge of prevention at this point may be not the science of immunology but rather the science of implementation. Scientists have to persuade parents and health-care providers that it's safe to implement new knowledge. Immunologists and allergists are aware that early feeding prevents allergy. Pediatricians, who have to handle many additional issues in young children's lives, might not have caught up. But “an allergist isn't going to see somebody who doesn't have peanut allergy already,” NIH's Fulkerson says. “You have to get the pediatricians involved because they're the ones who see the babies first.”

As many advances as there have been in the past decade, scientists worry that the fundamentals of peanut allergy still elude them. Why it exists, what triggers it, what keeps the immune system from outgrowing it—these basic questions remain unanswered. But the ability to tackle them is growing. “This field is still relatively early in its development compared with oncology or respiratory medicine, which are targeting very specific biological pathways with very specific precision treatments,” Emory's Vickery says. “We're not close to that yet. But can I see that on the horizon? Yes.”

The very latest approaches may involve new technologies. At the University of California, Los Angeles, a team led by Andre Nel has developed a lipid nanoparticle that uses mRNA—the same technology used in the COVID vaccines that were developed rapidly in 2020—to create fragments of peanut allergens. Those fragments are presented to specific cells. In mice, the treatment damped down the IgE cascade that triggers anaphylaxis.

But this is a difficult time for biomedical research, given political decisions in the White House and its newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cancel much of the science emanating from the NIH and the National Science Foundation. Peanut allergy may be due for particular attention from the Trump administration. The president's Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has several times endorsed an unsupported contention that peanut allergy is caused by childhood vaccinations. Earlier this year “peanut allergies” appeared on a list of topics that would cause grants to get extra scrutiny within the NIH.

Despite the potential political interference, for now the future seems bright for patients such as Anabelle Terry. As she grows up, the science that has reduced the risks of her allergy is growing along with her. It already has improved her life. It might one day change it for good. “If I go off to summer camp, I have to go away from the other kids for a while and take my nuts to make sure nobody else who has a nut allergy gets sick,” she says. “Going on vacations, I always have to bring a giant bag of nuts with me in my backpack. It would feel pretty nice just being able to go in for a little visit and just get a shot. That would let off a big burden.”

How Your Brain's Nightly Cleanse Keeps It Healthy

Washing waste from the brain is an essential function of sleep—and it could help ward off dementia

By Lydia Denworth edited by Madhusree Mukerjee

You can see it coming in right there, that little spot,” says neuroscientist and engineer Laura Lewis.

A remarkably bright pulsing dot has appeared on the monitor in front of us. We are watching, in real time, the brain activity of a graduate student named Nick, who is having an afternoon nap inside an imaging machine at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Lewis has her laboratory.

The bright spot first appears toward the bottom of the screen, about where Nick's throat meets his jaw. It moves slowly upward, fades and then is followed by another bright dot. “It really comes and goes,” says Lewis, who is also affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital. “It's in waves.” This moving dot depicts something few people have ever seen: fresh cerebrospinal fluid flowing from the spinal cord into the brain, part of a process that researchers are now learning is vital for keeping us healthy.

For decades biologists have pondered a basic problem. As human brains whir and wonder throughout the day, they generate waste—excess proteins and other molecules that can be toxic if not removed. Among those proteins are amyloid beta and tau, key drivers of Alzheimer's disease. Until recently, it was entirely unclear how the brain takes out this potentially neurotoxic trash.

In the rest of the body, garbage removal is handled initially by the lymphatic system. Excess fluid and the waste it carries move from tissue into the spleen, lymph nodes and other parts of the system, where certain particles are removed and put into the bloodstream to be excreted. It was long thought that the brain can't use the same trick, because the so-called blood-brain barrier, a protective border that keeps infections from reaching critical neural circuitry, stops the transport of most everything in and out.

In 2012 researchers at the University of Rochester led by neuroscientist Maiken Nedergaard made a pivotal discovery: a previously unknown circulatory system was flushing toxic waste from the brain. In mice, they showed that an influx of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) washes through the brain's “perivascular” spaces, which are doughnut-shaped tunnels that surround blood vessels. Using water channels on the surface of astrocytes, a type of cell that supports brain function, the CSF mixes with “interstitial” fluid in the spaces around the brain's cells and collects built-up waste. Then the fluid leaves the brain through the perivascular spaces around veins, taking the garbage with it.

Nedergaard and her team called their discovery the glymphatic system—“g” for glial cells, of which astrocytes are a subtype, and “lymphatic” to reference the waste-clearance function. The next year, in 2013, they published an important additional finding: this housekeeping was most active and efficient during sleep. “Wakefulness clearly shut it down,” Nedergaard says—probably because the precision that neural networks need to process the external world when awake isn't compatible with the clean-up process. That finding suggests this newly discovered brain-washing process is one of the critical functions of sleep. “Sleep is clearly for the brain,” Nedergaard says. “When you wake up refreshed after good sleep, it is probably because your brain had a tune-up similar to your car.”

But this groundbreaking work was done in mice, and mice are not people. Their brains are smaller and less complex than ours, their sleep far more fragmented. In part because of that discrepancy, the glymphatic hypothesis has had plenty of naysayers. “Ten years ago all this flow in the brain, it was almost like heresy,” says neuroimmunologist Jonathan Kipnis of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

Hundreds of studies have since been done—and that bright dot Lewis showed me represents a critical next phase of investigation. She and others have spent much of the past decade exploring whether this waste-clearance process works in humans as it does in rodents. The short answer seems to be yes. Furthermore, the electrical waves that sweep through the brain during sleep, helping to sort, select, transport and store memories, seem to have another significant function: they also propel cerebrospinal fluid in and out of the brain.

The significance of the glymphatic system is considerable. If waste clearance is an essential function of human sleep, then a dysfunction in this system probably relates to many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's. Glymphatic impairment could explain why the aging brain accumulates the amyloid plaques and tau tangles that trigger Alzheimer's—and there is some evidence that conditions such as traumatic brain injury, which is associated with Alzheimer's, interfere with waste clearance. “If it's the thing that holds all those things together,” says Jeffrey Iliff, a professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Washington School of Medicine who worked with Nedergaard on the original studies, “well then if you target it, that opens the door to primary prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.”

Although it's been clear for years that accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins leads to Alzheimer's, the link between sleep and the waste-clearance process that might get rid of them was not obvious. For decades sleep researchers focused primarily on sleep's role in memory processing. For their part, biologists who studied the blood-brain barrier knew there were perivascular spaces surrounding blood vessels like loose sheaths, but they didn't know what purpose those spaces served and largely discounted the idea that they were conduits for fluids, Iliff says. “They didn't see how dynamic it was.”

Early on, Nedergaard and Iliff, a glial cell biologist and a vascular physiologist, respectively, hypothesized that waste clearance might actually require wakefulness. They mistakenly reasoned that the brain is less active during sleep and, therefore, that glymphatic function would be lower at night.

In truth, the brain is not less active during sleep; it is differently active. Traditional sleep studies use electroencephalography (EEG) to track electrical activity that aligns with the phases of sleep. Their findings show that while people are awake and alert, patterns of neural activity are fast, characterized by high-frequency waves. In the early, light phases of sleep, known as stage 1 and stage 2, activity slows down and low-frequency waves appear. Deep sleep, or stage 3, is known as slow-wave sleep for the high-amplitude, lowest-frequency “delta” waves that dominate it. These waves, which on an EEG readout look like chains of large ocean swells, help the brain sort through the day's experiences and store some of them as memories. In contrast, the fourth phase, called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep because the eyes flit quickly from side to side beneath the eyelids, is when we have our most vivid dreams. The period resembles wakefulness, with faster brain activity than in other sleep stages.

What EEG cannot detect is the flow of fluids in the brain, however. Every day our bodies produce and then drain three to four times the volume of cerebrospinal fluid that we have. The few early studies of the fluid using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) recognized that its flow was coupled to heartbeats but couldn't go further because the technology wasn't up to the challenge. There was also little awareness that CSF flow changed during sleep.

The first real sign of sleep's importance in waste clearance was Nedergaard's pioneering 2013 study. It compared the clearance of amyloid beta proteins from the brain in mice that were awake, sleeping or anesthetized. The researchers injected a fluorescent tracer into mouse brains and found its influx into perivascular spaces and brain tissue was reduced by an astonishing 95 percent when mice were awake compared with when they were sleeping. The volume of the interstitial space in the brain's cortex also increased by 60 percent when the mice were asleep or anesthetized, suggesting that sleep led to physiological changes designed to increase the brain's ability to get rid of waste. Ultimately amyloid beta moved out of the brains of sleeping mice twice as fast as in mice that were awake.

Would it work the same way in humans? That was the question that neurosurgeon and researcher Per Kristian Eide asked. He was studying the relation between glial cells such as astrocytes and the dense network of blood vessels in the human brain at Oslo University Hospital in Norway. As a surgeon, Eide could take advantage of the fact that he was already working inside people's heads and—with permission—do some extra research.

With radiologist Geir Ringstad and others, Eide launched a study, published in 2021, with patients who were already undergoing neurological assessment in the hospital. The scientists injected a tracer into the CSF of all participants. One group was allowed to sleep normally through the night; the other was kept awake for 24 hours. All participants underwent multiple MRI scans in the evening and again the next day.

Removal of the tracer was dramatically slower in those who had not slept, compared with those who had. “It was very evident,” Eide says. “We were very, very surprised that we saw something after one night of sleep deprivation.” Even more notable was that after all participants were allowed to sleep normally the next night, the clearance of the tracer was still slower in those who had lost the earlier night of sleep. “You don't compensate by having a good night's sleep,” Eide says.

In a subsequent study, Eide and his team found that people who reported chronic poor sleep also showed delayed clearance of the tracer. Moreover, in people with dementia, brain volumes in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes had shrunk compared with those who slept well. In part because dementia has been previously associated with poor sleep quality, perhaps because of atrophy in the cortex, Eide and his colleagues suspect that chronic sleep disturbance co-occurs with glymphatic dysfunction.

There were also clear differences between humans and mice. In the rodents, for example, glymphatic transport was “an on-off phenomenon,” Eide says—on during sleep and off when the mice were awake. In humans, the process is not as extreme, and changes occur over hours rather than minutes. The work nevertheless demonstrated that human brains, too, get cleaned during sleep—and that “poor sleep quality is affecting your glymphatic function,” as Eide says.

Laura Lewis has lost a lot of sleep in the course of her work because she conducts all-night experiments. “The sad irony of being a sleep researcher is that you can't follow your own advice,” she says. Lewis has tackled a different piece of the glymphatic problem: the movement of fluids in the human brain that underpin waste clearance. That's how, about seven years ago, she came to be in the control room of an MRI machine very like the one in which she showed me Nick's CSF.

Lewis had chosen to measure CSF flow in the brain's fourth ventricle, a small cavity tucked against the cerebellum at the base of the brain. The ventricles produce CSF and act like extra shock absorbers for the fragile brain. For Lewis's purposes, the fourth ventricle was useful because “it's a kind of choke point.” Sitting as it does at the base of the brain, it provides a summary of what is happening elsewhere—like measuring attendance in a crowded room as people come through the door.

In an overnight sleep study published in 2019, Lewis and her colleagues were the first to use MRI to view this process in action. By taking pictures of the brain every 367 milliseconds instead of the standard two or three seconds, they were able to see the movement of cerebrospinal fluid during sleep.

At first, Lewis couldn't quite believe it. Typically the significant details of brain imaging require statistics and processing to tease out; they aren't something you can see by eye. “It was honestly the biggest signal I've ever seen,” Lewis says. “It was crazy. It's really striking how much you can see that this is happening during sleep.”

Lewis delayed publishing the research until she had triple-checked it. It has since been replicated several times. “When people are sleeping, there are these really huge and slow waves of flow that are pulsing every 20 to 30 seconds in the brain, specifically when we're in non–rapid eye movement sleep,” Lewis says. Using EEG data, she also saw clear patterns of brain activity before each wave. As delta waves of deep sleep and, to some extent, “theta” waves during intermediate (stage 2) sleep sweep through the brain, transmitting and integrating memories, they also seem to propel pulses of CSF into the brain.

Lewis found that CSF also flows when people are awake but less effectively. “It's always moving a little, but then when you fall asleep, a new cycle starts,” she says. The difference in fluid movement is like the change when a washing machine switches from light jiggling to full-on rotation, at which point more water pours in and out. Lewis's conclusion: sleep, a state that is essential for human health, has a distinct pattern of CSF flow—and that pattern changes as the stages of sleep shift. “It's not a coincidence,” she says. “It's actually the same brain circuits that are controlling sleep that seem to also be engaged and controlling the flow.”

But what is the source of the elbow grease necessary to do the cleaning? Unlike the blood, which is pumped through the body with great force by the heart, the cerebrospinal fluid is more like water in a bathtub or a slow-moving river with many tributaries. “Where is the force coming from?” Lewis asks.

One possibility is the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, also called noradrenaline. Norepinephrine surges when we wake up. During the day, it focuses attention; it also works to constrict blood vessels. And during non-REM sleep, according to a new study of mice by Nedergaard's group, a lower level of norepinephrine release—not enough to wake the mice but enough to make their blood vessels pulse—propels the movement necessary for CSF to flow.

The blood vessels in the brains of these mice dilated and constricted with an amplitude that was 10 times larger during non-REM sleep than during wakefulness, Nedergaard says. And as the blood vessels wax and wane, pushing blood in and out of the brain, CSF flows in and out to fill the expanding and contracting spaces around the blood vessels. “It seems to be this chain of events where your sleep state changes, and then that changes your blood vessels, and those actively pump the flow of CSF in the brain,” Lewis says. In this way, oscillations in norepinephrine cause waves of CSF to pulse through the perivascular sheaths.

But norepinephrine isn't the whole story. In February 2024 Kipnis, neuroscientist Li-Feng Jiang-Xie, and their colleagues at Washington University published a paper showing that, ultimately, it's neurons that provide the energy necessary for cleaning. “A neuron is a tiny little pump,” says Jiang-Xie, who is now at the University of Pennsylvania. The electrical activity of synchronized neurons, especially during sleep, can propel fluid flow through the brain tissue and help clean waste out. That idea was implied in Lewis's earlier study, but by working in mice, Jiang-Xie and Kipnis were able to show in detail how fluid moved in and out of brain tissue. “Norepinephrine is basically controlled by neurons' activity,” Jiang-Xie says. These results are “beautifully aligned with what we found in humans but provide information we couldn't have gotten,” Lewis adds.

Meanwhile other research in mice has revealed important distinctions between natural sleep and anesthesia, as well as among anesthetics, all of which affect waste clearance differently. An anesthetized brain does not cycle through phases as it does in sleep. And it turns out that some anesthetics suppress glymphatic function, whereas others enhance it. Furthermore, the influx of cerebrospinal fluid occurs in direct proportion to the power of slow-wave neural activity and in inverse proportion to heart rate, both of which are affected by the drugs used. Those findings help to explain some studies that haven't supported the glymphatic theory. For instance, a 2017 report from researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, described mice anesthetized with avertin, which has since been shown to limit how much cleaning the glymphatic system can accomplish. Five other labs have reconfirmed the initial finding that glymphatic clearance works during sleep.

Where does the fluid go? That has been another persistent question. The brain-washing process is made up of four stages, Kipnis says. There is CSF flow into the brain, within the brain, out of the brain along the veins, then into the lymphatic system. His focus has been on the last of these, which is as consequential as everything that comes before it. “If you wash your house with the same bucket of water, it will not be washing; it will be moving dirt from one place to another,” Kipnis says.

The solution is to empty the bucket and bring a new one, which means, in the brain, ensuring that the lymphatic vessels into which the “dirt” will be dumped are functioning. In 2015 Kipnis and his colleagues found the sewage system: they reported the discovery of lymphatic vessels in the meninges that envelop the brain and spinal cord. These vessels represent an important missing piece of the glymphatic puzzle because they can receive cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid from the brain. They are “the final outpost,” Kipnis says. “There is a biological structure at the very end of the whole process.”

Once scientists can work out precisely how glymphatic clearance works, they should also begin to see how things go wrong when it doesn't work. Norepinephrine and sleep disruption, for example, are also involved in the development of chronic pain. Higher bursts of norepinephrine lead to wakefulness and seem to shut off the glymphatic system. In consequence, improving the system by reducing norepinephrine levels could possibly also reduce chronic pain. Nedergaard is also exploring the glymphatic system's possible role in psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia.

Eide wants to enhance glymphatic function. The cerebrospinal fluid is an appealing route to deliver drugs to the brain because it bypasses the blood-brain barrier. And the role of norepinephrine is exciting, Nedergaard says. Whether there is too little norepinephrine signaling, as in Alzheimer's, or too much, as in chronic pain or stress, the brain-wave oscillations it controls become inefficient. That recognition might enable us to target treatment by modulating norepinephrine in drug form.

There are limits to the possibilities. And until there is a drug that enhances the glymphatic system as well as amyloid beta and tau clearance and slows progression of pathology, no one can definitively say that impaired clearance of brain toxins causes Alzheimer's in humans. In familial early-onset Alzheimer's, amyloid proteins are produced in excess, and clearance may not be able to keep up, no matter how much it is improved. Yet even if enhancing waste clearance only slows the development of Alzheimer's for most patients, that is a big deal. Being able to enjoy five to eight more years of living free of impairment would be a game changer.

There may be nonpharmaceutical strategies, too. In the study for which Nick took an afternoon nap, graduate student Joshua Levitt is experimenting with sound stimuli while people are sleeping. His research combines EEG and functional MRI to capture sleep state and brain activity. With Nick and others, he's sending staticky beeps into headphones while subjects are asleep. Given that CSF tends to flow in slow waves and, moreover, that sounds cause more slow-wave activity, this strategy could theoretically affect cerebrospinal flow. “If we think these things are relevant for great health, then we need to develop ways to actually change them,” Lewis says. Levitt “is trying to potentially enhance sleep.”

Simply understanding the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and how it changes with age is also important. Another graduate student in Lewis's lab, Sydney Bailes, is investigating the differences in flow between adults older than 60 and younger than 40 and the potential implications for waste clearance. It's normal to sleep less as you age and to have fewer slow waves. “How can we separate just a typical age-related change in sleep versus one that's starting to become an impairment?” Lewis asks. “We need to disentangle those.”

That study is still underway, but so far they have found that older individuals differ from one another more than the younger group does—a pattern that mimics the wider range of cognitive differences in older people versus younger people. “You'll see some measures that are very clustered together for the young adults and very spread out for the older adults,” Bailes says.

But people can surprise. An 80-year-old woman, one of the oldest in the study, stood out. “Her waves have a much larger amplitude than I typically see in older adults, and they seem to be also pretty consistent,” Bailes says. “Her CSF flow looked like a young person's CSF.”

That's a striking statement. Could it someday become a routine way of evaluating a person's health? Quite possibly. Multiple labs are working toward a noninvasive “glymphogram” that would reveal how well a person's clearance system is working. Glymphatic function may someday be like hypertension, something to be treated before it turns into a more serious condition. Certainly differences in waste clearance could help explain why some people age healthily and others do not—and then it could pave the way to treatments that enhance clearance in those who need it. The goal is not for everyone to sleep like a baby; sleeping like a thirtysomething would do.

NASA's Juno Mission Leaves Stunning Legacy of Science at Jupiter

The Juno spacecraft has rewritten the story on Jupiter, the solar system's undisputed heavyweight

By Robin George Andrews edited by Clara Moskowitz

The NASA spacecraft tasked with uncovering the secrets of Jupiter, king of the planets, is running out of time. The Juno probe has already survived far longer than anticipated—its path around the solar system's largest planet has repeatedly flown it through a tempest of radiation that should have corroded away its instruments and electronics long ago. And yet here it is: one of the greatest planetary detectives ever built, still pirouetting around Jupiter, fully functional.

But it may not be for long. September 2025 marks the end of Juno's extended mission. Although it could get another reprieve—an extended-extended mission—the spacecraft cannot carry on forever. Eventually the probe is fated to plunge into Jupiter's stormy skies, to lethal effect. Regardless of when that happens, the spacecraft's legacy is indelible.

It revealed a whole different Jupiter than scientists thought they knew. Oddly geometric continent-size storms, in strange yet stable configurations, dance around its poles. Its heaviest matter seems to linger in its skies, while its abyssal heart is surprisingly light and fuzzy. Its innards don't resemble the lasagnalike layers found in rocky worlds; they look more like mingling swirls of different kinds of ink.

And Juno wasn't simply trying to understand Jupiter. It set out to uncover how the entire solar system was born. Jupiter, after all, was the first planet to piece itself together after the sun exploded into existence. Hidden underneath the planet's cloud tops, there is a recording of the beginnings of everything we see around us. “That's the story behind why Juno was created: to go and look inside Jupiter every way we knew how, to try to figure out what happened in the early solar system that formed that planet—and what role that planet had in forming us,” says Scott Bolton, the mission's principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Tex.

Whenever a mission studies a planet or moon up close, “you're going to be surprised” at what it finds, says Juno project scientist Steve Levin of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. But what you really want is “to make the theorists throw everything out the window and start over.” Juno has torn up more textbooks than any other planetary science mission. “It's been quite a ride,” Levin says. And scientists will never look at Jupiter, or the solar system, in the same way again.

Jupiter, the Roman god, was often up to no good. According to myth, he obscured his mischief with a blanket of clouds so that nobody could see what he was up to. His wife, though, had the power to see through these clouds and monitor his shenanigans. Her name was Juno.

In the late 1970s the two Voyager space probes gave humanity its first spectacularly detailed look at the gas giant. Unlike the deific Juno, they couldn't see Jupiter's buried secrets—but they were sufficiently inspiring for Bolton, who was a college student at the time. “I had been a huge Star Trek fan and had fantasized about traveling around and wondering what the rest of the universe was like,” he says. When someone from JPL gave a talk at his school and showcased Voyager 1's jaw-dropping shots of Jupiter and its maelstroms, he was sold. “I'd never seen anything like it.”

Juno spotted numerous oval cyclones on Jupiter's southern pole.

In 1980 Bolton got a job at JPL, just as Voyager 1 was about to greet Saturn. Later he became part of the Galileo project, a mission to study Jupiter's atmosphere and magnetic field that orbited the planet from 1995 to 2003. It was the first spacecraft to orbit an outer planet and the first to drop a probe through its atmosphere. Although Galileo began to paint a picture of Jupiter in three dimensions, so much about the world—especially its core, the depth and nature of its storms, and its unseen polar regions—remained a mystery.

Bolton ultimately came to an inescapable conclusion: science needed to make the mythical Juno real. As the new millennium dawned a spacecraft took shape, to the tune of $1.1 billion. A triumvirate of solar panels powered a suite of cloud-piercing instruments, some able to pick up on different types of radiation emanating from deep within the planet. One piece of tech can measure how the spacecraft is affected by small changes in the planet's gravitational field, allowing scientists to determine Jupiter's inner structure.

Because every bit of added weight counts for a lot in spaceflight, the earliest Juno plans lacked a visual camera. It didn't need one to achieve its scientific objectives. But Candice Hansen-Koharcheck, a Juno team member and a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., recalls Bolton saying: “We can't fly to Jupiter without a camera.” The mission may be all about sensing what's below those clouds. But who doesn't want to catch a glimpse of alien hurricanes and vaporous whirlpools, too? JunoCam, led by Hansen-Koharcheck, was added to the payload.

The biggest issue mission designers faced was figuring out how to shield the probe. The space environment enveloping Jupiter is thoroughly unpleasant. A torus of radiation, not only deadly to humans but also highly degrading to any electronics, zips around the planet's equator. Eventually this radiation will murder any spacecraft in its wake. To delay the inevitable, Juno deploys two radiation-dodging tricks.

The first is to orbit in a way that repeatedly takes it over Jupiter's poles, where radiation is minimal. During each circuit, Juno gets as close as 3,100 miles to the planet's cloud tops, allowing it to conduct detailed scientific observations while spending a limited time bathed in aggressive radiation. The second is that its most vital electronics are encased inside a titanium vault. The spacecraft's hull is showered by more than 100 million dental x-rays' worth of radiation. Anything inside the vault receives about 800 times less.

Juno's mission team hoped these strategies would keep the spacecraft alive for at least a year, but the scientists had only educated guesses to work with. “No one's ever done a polar orbit. No one's ever slipped between the radiation belts,” says Heidi Becker, a researcher at JPL and the member of the Juno team responsible for monitoring the radiation environment.

The only way to know was to go. “I've been looking up at Jupiter for a very long time,” Becker says. She felt like the planet was teasing the Juno team before launch: “Okay, bring it. Let's see if you can do it.”

Juno left Earth in 2011 and reached Jupiter after a 1.7-billion-mile journey. It quickly took up a polar orbit of the elephantine world, and Becker and the team were overwhelmingly relieved when they realized that the radiation hadn't immediately exterminated the spacecraft.

The scientists were also glad they'd packed that camera. The moment Juno opened its eyes, it witnessed a parade of colors rushing about with unrelenting force. The ever-changing landscapes weren't just painterly. “They're like works of art,” says Bolton—impressionistic-looking spirals and streams, folding, arching and blooming in full view. Juno may be a scientific mission, but it also revealed Jupiter as a living van Gogh painting hanging in the sky.

Within moments of falling into orbit, Juno revealed wonders—starting with the planet's freakish atmosphere and its gargantuan storms. When the probe peeked at Jupiter's poles, “we saw something nobody's seen before,” Levin says. JunoCam and Juno's infrared mapping instrument, JIRAM, spied an octagonal collection of eight storms surrounding a central cyclone at the north pole. The south pole, meanwhile, had a pentagonal group of five storms circling another one in the middle. Each cluster of cyclones is larger than the U.S.

The JIRAM image of the northern circumpolar cyclones resembled a “beautiful, gigantic jack-o'-lantern in space,” Becker says. These geometric storms didn't just look striking—they had no precedent. “The first time we saw the storms, I was with a bunch of people from the science team,” Levin says. “Somebody literally said: ‘Are you sure you got the right planet?' And they were only half joking.”

The arrangement at each pole seemed oddly stable: storms moved around and jostled one another, but none disappeared. And to date, no one has a definitive explanation for why the number of storms at each pole differs, nor why their dance routine never seems to change. “The way those cyclones are stable at the poles is still a mystery,” says Alessandro Mura, a researcher at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome and the lead for Juno's infrared mapping instrument.

The most famous storm on Jupiter is its Great Red Spot—a rust-hued monster large enough to encompass the entire Earth. First seen a couple of centuries ago, it's known to change shape over time, and one day it may vanish. But until Juno arrived, astronomers' knowledge of it was surficial. By probing the radiation emitted by the spot's churning gases and by measuring its gravitational pull, the Juno team realized it reached a depth of about 300 miles below the cloud tops—almost 55 times deeper than Mount Everest is tall.

Unsurprisingly, for a planet wreathed in storms, Jupiter experiences a lot of lightning; the Voyager missions caught bolts flashing through its clouds back in 1979. But Juno “discovered a type of lightning that doesn't exist on Earth,” Becker says, which seemingly defied the laws of physics.

Like many spacecraft, Juno has a star camera, an instrument that uses those diamantine dots to determine its orientation in space and aid its navigation. The camera can also spot lightning, which appears as bright specks. When Juno looked at the dark side of Jupiter, it spied tiny little flashes made by very high-altitude lightning bolts.

That didn't make any sense. To produce lightning, liquid water needs to collide with ice crystals to create a spark. In 1979 the Voyager mission detected lightning coming from deep water clouds, where the suffocating pressure of the overlying atmosphere created temperatures high enough for liquid water to exist. But the lightning flashes picked up by Juno came from the upper echelons of Jupiter's atmosphere, a location so frigid that only ice crystals should exist there.

After studying Jupiter's titanic clouds for a time, the Juno team worked out what was happening. The planet's cloud tops contain plenty of ammonia, and storms can launch ice into the sky that then binds to that ammonia. The chemical acts like antifreeze on the water-ice, causing it to turn into liquid droplets. And when those droplets smash into the upwardly propelled ice crystals, you get electricity—and vertiginous lightning.

Matthew Twombly

But this epiphany brought another mystery into focus. Sure, ammonia-ice clouds likely dominate Jupiter's skyline—but Juno found that some parts of the uppermost atmosphere have a dearth of ammonia. That didn't track: Jupiter's atmosphere looks incredibly turbulent—like a thoroughly whisked raw egg—so all its components should be mixed up, with a more or less even distribution of gases. How can many parts of the planet have 90-mile-deep wells lacking ammonia?

“There was no theory that could even remotely explain this,” says Chris Moeckel, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. His first thought was that “there's no way this is right.” But the data were sound.

A complicated idea arose to make sense of the phenomenon. When the sky-high ammonia turns upwelling water-ice into liquid, the water and ammonia bond to form a peculiar slush with a water-ice shell. Ultimately softball-size globules of slush encased in ice fall back into the planet, where they melt at depths thought to be too extreme for Juno's instruments to detect.

For a few years this theory seemed a bit too baroque to be true. But Moeckel and his colleagues became convinced thanks to the power of Juno's microwave radiometer. The instrument can measure radio waves that betray the presence of different chemical compounds. During one of its orbits, Juno noted a burst of ammonia production at an exceptional depth within the planet. According to Moeckel, this was a telltale sign that icy orbs had rained down from the sky and thawed, releasing their trapped water-ammonia slush. Researchers referred to this unique weather phenomenon as mushballs. “It's such a stupid name,” Moeckel says. “But it works.”

Juno also trained its instruments on Jupiter's magnetic field, the largest structure in the solar system, which reaches at least as far as its neighboring planet, Saturn. But Juno discovered that Jupiter's magnetic field is wonky and asymmetric—more messy in the northern hemisphere than the south. There is also an intense concentration of magnetism near the equator, a patch (confusingly) called the Great Blue Spot.

These characteristics are odd, but the existence of such a gargantuan field at all is the really strange part because Jupiter lacks the sloshing liquid iron and nickel responsible for Earth's magnetic field. Instead Jupiter contains an ocean of hydrogen, one under so much pressure that electrons are torn off individual hydrogen atoms, transforming it into an exotic, metal-like electrical fluid that generates its mighty magnetic field.

Violent storms swirl across Jupiter's northern pole. The storms are mysteriously stable over time, and each cluster of cyclones is larger than the continental U.S.

Below the hydrogen sea lies an even bigger mystery—the question of what's inside the planet's innermost core. What Juno found there left scientists reeling.

Before the spacecraft arrived, there were two prevailing notions about Jupiter's interior. The first was that the planet may have a compact core of rocky and metallic matter, not dissimilar to the cores of other worlds. If such a core exists, then Jupiter likely formed through the gradual clumping together of gas and solid matter, like the planets of the inner solar system. The second hypothesis was that there is no core at all. Instead Juno might find a ball of hypercompressed gas, suggesting Jupiter's formation was a bit like a failed star, one that didn't gather enough gas to trigger a thermonuclear ignition.

“Actually neither of those was true,” Bolton says. Juno used gravitational detective work to sense the core. The spacecraft is constantly communicating with Earth using radio waves. Jupiter's uneven mass means that Juno speeds up at times and slows down at others, depending on the strength of the gravitational pull it's experiencing. These speed changes cause subtle shifts in the wavelengths of the radio transmissions Juno sends and receives—effects that scientists can use to determine the internal structure of Jupiter.

What they found was at first nonsensical. Deep within the metallic hydrogen ocean Juno detected an innermost core of, well, something; it's probably solid, but researchers can't tell. “It's blending gradually into the surrounding layers,” says Ryan Park, a researcher at JPL and one of the leads on the gravity experiment on Juno. The hydrogen and the core material seem to mingle. The situation is very different from Earth's depths, where a lighter rocky mantle floats atop a denser iron and nickel core, between which is a distinct and definitive boundary. “We frankly don't know how to explain that,” Levin says. And it gets weirder still.

The sun and Jupiter are rich in both hydrogen and helium but are also expected to contain a smattering of heavier elements. Jupiter, a huge planet that most likely ate up rocky and icy planet-size shards during its formation, should contain far more heavy elements than the sun. And indeed, Juno found that Jupiter has three to four times as many heavy elements as our star. The problem, though, is that these elements appear to be found in the upper atmosphere—and the innermost core is comparatively lacking. All that heavy stuff should sink, via gravity, into the core. But apparently it hasn't. If the core is so light, then what could it possibly be made of?

Scientists are scrambling for answers. This fuzzy core doesn't fit with anyone's model for planetary formation. Some scientists have suggested a giant meteor crashed into a once solid core, smashing it up and forcefully mixing it with the metallic hydrogen ocean. Levin wonders whether we simply don't understand the physics yet. “We're talking about temperatures and pressures much higher than anything we're used to,” he says—conditions so severe that it's difficult to create them in laboratories.

Other blockbuster findings from Juno concern Jupiter's moons. The probe's reconnaissance of two icy orbs—the pockmarked Ganymede and the ocean-concealing Europa (the target of a recently launched NASA habitability mission)—created breathtaking portraits of these dynamic worlds while also revealing some unusual chemistries. But a moon named Io got most of Juno's attention—and, consequently, generated the most shocking surprise.

“Io is a very peculiar moon because it's the most volcanic body of all,” Mura says. Its surface, an amalgam of burnt orange, sickly yellow and crimson hues, is covered in rocky cauldrons filled with lava, as well as volcanoes whose explosions propel magmatic matter into space. Up there the material is ionized by sunlight before plunging into Jupiter's skies, creating extremely bright auroral lights.

Since the 1970s scientists have understood that Io's volcanism is powered by its elliptical orbit around Jupiter. When it's closer to Jupiter, it gets a bigger pull from the planet's gravity; when it's farther away, that pull is weaker. This back-and-forth kneads the moon like putty, creating tides in solid rock more than 300 feet high. All that motion creates a lot of friction, an abundance of heat—and a plethora of magma.

Juno made close flybys of three of Jupiter's moons (top to bottom): Io, Ganymede and Europa. Io is the most active volcanic world in the solar system and features the largest volcanic eruption ever recorded. Ganymede is a pockmarked place much like our moon, and Europa boasts a hidden ocean under its crust.

Many thought that this mechanism, known as tidal heating, was so powerful that it created a continuous ocean of magma under the surface rather than the smaller, individual magma reservoirs that fuel Earth's volcanoes. The Galileo mission seemed to back that idea up: it detected an electrically conductive layer under Io's crust suggestive of a magma sea.

But when Juno flew perilously close to Io on two occasions, getting within 900 miles of the violent surface, it found no trace of a shallow magma ocean. Mura now suspects Io's magma is partitioned into a maze of rocky tunnels, occasionally bubbling up into open rocky maws wherever the tunnels reach the surface.

Nobody knows for sure; in typical Juno style, the observations have raised more questions than answers. But at least while scientists ponder possible solutions, they can marvel at Io's unbound ferocity.

“We discovered the largest eruption ever recorded,” Bolton says. In December 2024 Juno's infrared instrument detected a heat spike in the moon's southern hemisphere that briefly blinded the spacecraft's JIRAM instrument: a paroxysmal outpouring of lava spread over 40,000 square miles, enough to cover a quarter of California. It's producing more energy than the total annual energy output of humanity. “And we still see it going on,” Bolton adds.

By all accounts, Juno should be dead by now. The radiation should have already broken it or at least one of its instruments. Somehow it lasted well beyond its prime mission timeline, which ended in 2021.

If an additional three-year extension is approved, Juno could get a better look at the planet's ghostly ring system, and some of its lesser-known innermost moons. But there's no telling how long the aging spacecraft could survive. “It could grow old, and something could fail,” Bolton says. Perhaps “the radiation will kill something so important that we can't function anymore.” Whenever the vehicle's end comes, it will go out in flames, spiraling toward the gas giant it spent its entire life interrogating. “Eventually Juno will crash into Jupiter on its own,” Bolton says.

But the spacecraft's legacy is already clear. Juno revealed Jupiter to be a far more confounding place than anyone dared imagine, forcing scientists to throw out reams of outdated ideas about planetary formation. It's also revealed how future spaceflight missions can defend themselves from the worst radiation in the solar system. The Juno team, having emulated its namesake's god-defying powers, is openly proud, Becker says. “What an amazing success story for NASA.”

Humans Aren't as Special as We Once Thought

Other species exhibit capabilities that were once thought to be exclusive to Homo sapiens

By Kate Wong edited by Seth Fletcher

Sam Falconer

We're celebrating 180 years of Scientific American. Explore our legacy of discovery and look ahead to the future.

It was the telegram exchange that sparked an identity crisis for humankind. In 1960 a young Jane Goodall working in a remote forest in Tanzania observed a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard using blades of grass and twigs to fish nutritious termites out of their nest. The primatologist wrote to her mentor, Kenyan paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey, to tell him about her observation, which flew in the face of the conventional wisdom that held that only humans made tools. Leakey replied: “Now we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as human.”

For decades—centuries, even—scholars have attempted to draw a hard line between our kind and the other organisms with whom we share the planet. They have argued that only humans have culture—sets of learned behaviors, such as toolmaking, that are passed down from generation to generation. They have proposed that only humans think symbolically, using signs to represent objects or ideas. That our species alone is self-aware, capable of planning for the future and experiencing emotions such as joy and fear, love and grief. That only humans are conscious, possessed of an inner world of subjective experience.

For his part, Charles Darwin, writing in the late 1800s, opined that nonhuman animals have the same cognitive abilities and emotions that humans have and that any differences were a matter of degree and not kind. In the absence of any way to reliably read animal minds, however, scientists who studied animal behavior and cognition took the position that ascribing human thoughts, feelings and motivations to animals—anthropomorphism—was a cardinal sin. But in recent decades examples of other species demonstrating these capabilities have emerged from across the tree of life. The findings have spurred fresh thinking about what, exactly, distinguishes Homo sapiens, with our vaunted intellect, from every other species on Earth.

Let's look first at our evolutionary nearest and dearest. We H. sapiens possess much larger brains than our closest living relatives, the chimps and bonobos, do—around three times as large. The brain requires 20 percent of our energy budget despite making up only 2 percent of our body mass. Naturally, anthropologists have wondered why we evolved such energetically expensive brains. At the same time, we know that H. sapiens is the sole surviving member of what was once a diverse group of humanoids. Surely our big brains and all the clever things they allow us to do were a major reason for our success as a species, a vital factor in why we alone went on to spread across the globe and thrive in every ecosystem we set our sights on, outcompeting other branches of humanity until we were the last hominin standing.

Yet virtually every trait that anthropologists have identified as one that might have set our kind apart has subsequently been found in another member of the family. Our closest evolutionary cousins, the Neandertals, left behind decorations that suggest they used symbols, which may indicate a capacity for language. The same goes for our smaller-brained relative Homo erectus. And some 3.3 million years ago, long before brain size began to expand in our lineage, an unknown hominin—possibly Australopithecus afarensis—shaped basalt cobbles into cutting tools, demonstrating an understanding of the material properties of stone and a vision for how to transform a lump of rock into a useful implement.

It's not just our closest hominin and great ape relatives that share our powers of cognition. Humans were long thought to be the only moral animals, uniquely equipped with a sense of right and wrong. But we now know that is not the case. The late primatologist Frans de Waal and Sarah F. Brosnan found in laboratory experiments that brown capuchin monkeys would decline a reward of a slice of cucumber if they observed another monkey receiving a better treat (a grape) for the same task. The monkeys' rejection of unequal payment for equivalent work demonstrated that they have a sense of fairness and experience moral outrage when they get a raw deal.

Other animals exhibit other elements of morality—including empathy. Mice, for instance, can share the emotional state of another individual, exhibiting increased sensitivity to pain if they see a companion showing signs of pain. Dogs recognize distress in their owners and will offer consolation. Rats will sacrifice their own gains to alleviate the suffering of a conspecific, forgoing a food reward if taking the food means inflicting pain on another rat.

Empathy and other complex emotions were long considered beyond the experience of nonhuman creatures. But mounting evidence indicates that they are widespread among mammals. Some of the most striking examples involve emotional responses to death. In 2018 an orca known as Tahlequah made headlines around the world when she carried her dead calf with her for 17 days while she swam 1,000 miles across the Salish Sea. In 2024 Tahlequah lost another calf. This time she held on to its corpse for at least 11 days before releasing it. Researchers characterized the mother orca's reaction to these losses as grief.

Apes, monkeys and elephants have been observed to mourn the loss of bonded individuals, too. It's not just large-brained mammals that appear to express sorrow, however. Barbara King, who is known for her research and writing on animal cognition and emotion, has described compelling examples of grief in peccaries, donkeys and ferrets, among others.

Our fellow mammals are not the only animals to show signs of thinking and feeling as humans do. The Eurasian Magpie, a species of bird, can recognize itself in the mirror—a sign of consciousness. Fish feel pain, another conscious experience: when given an injection that causes discomfort, lab zebra fish will vacate their preferred habitat, which has been decorated with pleasing rocks and vegetation, to visit a barren habitat whose water is infused with a pain reliever. And studies of bees and other insects suggest that they may experience both pain and joy. That is, these creatures, too, may be sentient.

Although the evidence for consciousness in fish, reptiles, insects, and other invertebrates has yet to accumulate to the degree that it has in mammals and birds, researchers are taking the possibility far more seriously than they have in the past. In 2024 dozens of scientists signed a declaration acknowledging that species quite different from humans may have experiences of consciousness and that this possibility needs to be considered in decisions that affect these animals. The document could help shape policies governing animal research ethics and welfare.

One more group of organisms deserves mention. In recent years researchers have increasingly begun to explore the idea that plants—traditionally viewed as noncognitive beings—can learn, remember, make decisions, communicate and experience the world uniquely. In this way, some investigators propose, they are conscious. Consider the Venus flytrap, a carnivorous plant that catches flies, ants, and other insects when they brush against the sensory hairlike structures in the plant's trap. The plant remembers when it has been touched. After two touches, the trap closes and imprisons the insect prey; after five touches, it produces the enzymes needed to digest its catch. Other plants sense when they are being munched by hungry insects and emit chemical signals that summon predators of their attackers.

We might not be as unique as we thought we were. But we needn't feel demoted. There's something marvelous about finding a common thread between flytrap and ferret, bee and human. We're not separate from nature, we're connected to it, part of the weave of life, in all its dazzling diversity.

The Surprising Science behind Your Favorite (and Least Favorite) Scents

More familiar smells and scents from complex molecules can often be more appealing

By Clara Moskowitz, Miriam Quick & Jen Christiansen edited by Jen Christiansen & Clara Moskowitz

Jen Christiansen

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

The sense of smell, it turns out, is highly individual—a scent that is enticingly floral to one person may be off-putting and chemical to another. Researchers in Germany -recently asked 1,227 participants to describe and rate 73 odors and found their answers to be strikingly variable. “It depends on what people have associated with the odor,” says psychologist Antonie Louise Bierling of Friedrich Schiller University Jena, who led the study. “In my opinion, it would have been really astonishing if the same odor smelled pleasant to everyone. Why should it?”

The researchers did identify some trends. More familiar scents seem to smell more pleasant, for example, and odors from complex molecules seem to have greater appeal than those of simple compounds.

Scientists hope to use the data to help develop “digital olfaction”—artificial noses that can sense scents as well as or even better than humans. Such devices could be helpful for disease detection or in “smart home” applications: a toaster, for instance, that can tell when toast is done by how burned it smells or refrigerators that can identify putrid decay.

Researchers asked people to respond with “yes” or “no” to whether each smell matched 16 descriptive terms, including “sweet” and “musky.” By comparing these answers with the sliding-scale pleasantness scores the same molecules received, we can see which words were most predictive of pleasant—and unpleasant—smells.

The dots in the graph indicate the difference in pleasantness scores for scents associated with each word. For example, the median pleasantness score for all molecules that the respondents considered “sweet” was 61, and the median pleasantness score for all molecules that were not marked as “sweet” was 34. The difference in scores was +27, making “sweet” the word most frequently associated with scents perceived as pleasant. “Decayed,” with a difference in scores of –35, was the descriptor least associated with pleasant smells.

More complex molecules tend to be ranked as more pleasant. Molecular complexity is a rough estimate of how intricate a compound's structure is. It runs on a scale from 0 to thousands—in this dataset, from 10.8 (isopropyl alcohol) to 366 (tonalide). Here each dot represents one of 73 molecules. We grouped molecular complexity into three categories: high, medium and low. Vertical bars mark median pleasantness scores per category.

What Happens When an Entire Generation of Scientists Changes Its Mind

Total reversals in scientific thinking are rare—but earth-shattering

By Charles C. Mann edited by Josh Fischman

Sam Falconer

We're celebrating 180 years of Scientific American. Explore our legacy of discovery and look ahead to the future.

If there is a beginning time point for the Age of Scientific Reversal, it may be 1887—the year when Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley conducted what is often called the world's most famous failed physics experiment.

For more than two centuries researchers had proposed that light was a wave of some kind traveling through an ineffable material that pervaded everything, even the space between atoms. No evidence of this all-permeating substance—the aether, as it was called—had ever been detected. Still, most scientists firmly believed it must exist. How could a wave be seen to travel unless there were something it was traveling through? Working in Cleveland, Ohio, Michelson and Morley sought to measure the aether's effects with some of the most sensitive equipment ever built. To their shock, they found absolutely no trace of it.

Baffled and discouraged, the two men gave up plans for follow-up experiments. Other physicists were even more dismayed. The great theoretical physicist Hendrik Lorentz said the results put him “utterly at a loss.”

Yet they were not a loss for science. The Michelson-Morley tests actually led to a remarkable intellectual 180-degree turn and a forward leap in physics. The aether, scientists had believed, would provide a fixed background—a universal reference for all celestial objects. The discovery that outer space was a featureless, nearly empty vacuum—which stemmed from Michelson and Morley's work—meant that objects could be located only in reference to one another. And that realization fed into an even bigger 180-degree turn: Albert Einstein's theories of special and general relativity, which upended previous notions of gravity and turned space and time into a single curvature created by mass and energy.

Or ... or ... maybe the Age of Scientific Reversal began after 1860, when chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur presented a long, bluntly written memoir that proved fermentation was caused by microorganisms, not some self-starting chemical reaction, which was the reigning theory. Pasteur's work led to a pitched intellectual battle—and the eventual triumph of germ theory, which overturned earlier ideas about infectious disease.

Coming one after another, such volte-faces gave rise to a popular notion of scientific progress as a series of upheavals in which mavericks throw out the entrenched views of the past. In countless stories in movies, television and novels, revolutionary thinkers (or, rather, wannabe revolutionaries) have their ideas dismissed by hidebound colleagues, yet they triumph in the end.

But that's not how science works. Or, more precisely, it's not how science works except in two specific, relatively unusual circumstances.

The first is when research disciplines are young, thinly populated and just developing instruments of sufficient power to test their initial beliefs, as was the case with the Michelson-Morley experiment and Pasteur's fermentation. The second, possibly more consequential situation is when scientific findings lead to so much public interest that they become of concern to political authorities. Contemporary examples, such as the fraught debate over whether women under the age of 50 should be routinely screened with mammograms, have filled recent headlines. But these political issues have influenced science in the U.S. since at least the 19th century, when the country began trying to move immigrants across the Mississippi River into what might or might not have been hostile, uninhabitable land.

The image of scientific rebels forcing other researchers to reverse themselves was codified in philosopher Thomas Kuhn's 1962 book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. In Kuhn's view, there are periods of “normal science” in which researchers have a shared consensus—a paradigm, in his terms—about how nature works. Then a new theory or experiment shatters the paradigm. Believers in the old paradigm resist furiously, but eventually the old ideas are ejected. From the reversal emerges a new paradigm, which will be thrown over in turn.

Structure was a bombshell. It is one of the few academic tracts to leap outside the classroom and influence the larger culture. Since its publication, stories about “revolutionary” new scientific studies that “overthrow everything we believed” have become staples in journalism, Hollywood and YouTube health-influencer videos.

The lighter side of this trope is embodied in characters such as Doc Brown, the DeLorean-driving inventor in the 1985 movie Back to the Future, whose unconventional ideas about time travel cause his colleagues to dismiss him as a crackpot. The darker side leads to figures such as discredited anti-vaccine researcher Andrew Wakefield and germ-theory denialist and writer Mike Stone, whose followers claim that their findings have been suppressed by the scientific establishment in the name of profit and political ideology.

The reality is closer to what happened with Michelson and Morley. Physics as a field of knowledge has existed at least since the times of Greek savant Thales (circa 625–545 B.C.E.). But the professional discipline—practiced by credentialed professors who work in specialized laboratories and belong to learned societies—was in its infancy when the two scientists looked for the aether. The U.K.'s first specialized physics group, the Physical Society of London, had been founded just 13 years earlier.

Physicists in those early years were reexamining ideas that often dated back to the Greeks (Aristotle, in the case of the aether) and had yet to be probed with modern tools. Michelson and Morley bounced light among 16 specially prepared mirrors with positions that had to be adjusted so precisely that the two men had to machine custom-calibration screws with 100 threads per inch—implements that couldn't have been made in Thales's time or even Isaac Newton's. Given that many of the foundational assumptions in physics had never been carefully tested, it seems almost inevitable in retrospect that a considerable number would fall to the first scrutiny.

Consider the long-standing belief that the universe preserves parity—that the mirror reflection of any physical process is identical to its unmirrored counterpart except for being flipped from left to right. This is obviously true in the world we live in: shooting one billiard ball at another will have the same effect no matter what direction the cue ball comes from. But matters are less obvious in the quantum realm.

In 1956 physicists Chen Ning Yang of Princeton University and Tsung-Dao Lee of Columbia University wondered whether anyone had proved that parity was preserved in quantum interactions—and found that nobody had checked the “weak nuclear force,” which is responsible for radioactive decay. The first research team that looked at the weak interactions, led by Columbia's Chien-Shiung Wu, found that the weak force did not conserve parity. Stunned, Yang sent a telegram to physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer about Wu's experiment. “Walked through door,” the gobsmacked Oppenheimer cabled back.

Lee and Yang won the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for beginning the parity U-turn. But that was arguably the last time particle physics went through such a sweeping reversal. Yes, the field has seen extraordinary discoveries since then—quarks and gluons, neutrino oscillations, gravity waves, you name it. But they were new phenomena, not refutations of prior beliefs.

The lack of 180s partly results from the way that scientific disciplines ground themselves over time. In retrospect, one can't be surprised that the first experiment to carefully examine the aether failed to find it. But it would be extremely surprising if, after decades of experimental verification, quarks were shown not to exist. In addition, as disciplines grow older and bigger, they end up naturally absorbing people with minority points of view. So instead of entire disciplines executing a U-turn, these minority beliefs shift and twist while becoming acceptable to the majority.

In particle physics, an idea known as S-matrix theory dominated in the 1950s and 1960s, but it always had skeptics. When experiments pointed toward an alternative—a quantum field theory and quark model—the field shifted. But it wasn't exactly a U-turn, because quantum field theorists had been working on their ideas all along. And S-matrix theory never vanished. It morphed into string theory, a current attempt to unify relativity and quantum mechanics.

Similarly, one of the first vogues in the field of artificial intelligence was the perceptron, a computational system that 1960s-era AI researchers argued would rival human intelligence and ultimately lead to machines with true consciousness. Researchers published thousands of papers extolling and developing perceptrons—an outburst that stopped abruptly after 1969, when computer scientists Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert took a careful, Michelson-Morley-style look at the idea. They detailed basic tasks that perceptrons could never do, including distinguishing between odd and even numbers. With this embarrassment the perceptron bubble popped. But it didn't disappear. As AI research slowly grew, perceptrons changed into more sophisticated neural networks, which in turn played a role in the development of today's “large language model” artificial intelligence.

Youthful fields can take even more dramatic turns. Pasteur's work on the role of microorganisms in infectious disease inaugurated the modern discipline of microbiology—and led to a host of about-faces in previous medical beliefs. German researcher Robert Koch, often considered microbiology's co-founder, then discovered the microbes that caused anthrax, cholera and tuberculosis. All cast aside earlier ideas. For instance, many in Koch's Germany believed tuberculosis was a hereditary disease passed down through families until 1882, when the scientist unveiled Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for the disease.

In the researchers' map of the region drained by the Mississippi was a label: GREAT AMERICAN DESERT.

These reversals did not always have the revolutionaries and traditionalists one would expect on opposing sides. French physician Alphonse Laveran spotted microscopic living creatures in malaria patients' blood in 1890. Since the Greeks, doctors had believed that malaria was brought about by “miasma”—misty air polluted with particles from decomposed matter. (The disease's name comes from mal aria, or “bad air” in early Italian.) Based on his observations, Laveran proclaimed that malaria was caused by protozoans. These microbes are now known to be several species in the genus Plasmodium.

Laveran's fiercest critics were not miasma theorists, however, but Pasteur's disciples, who insisted a la Kuhn on yet another paradigm: infectious diseases were caused by bacteria—bacteria floating in mist, in this case. France's leading malaria authority sneered at Laveran, as did Koch. In reaction, Laveran doubled down, proposing that Plasmodium was carried by mosquitoes, not mist. This, too, was dismissed. But Laveran was subsequently proved right, and within a decade scientists had to reverse themselves again.

Paralleling the rise of institutional particle physics, the microbiology of Pasteur and Koch expanded into an enormous discipline with thousands of researchers, multiple subfields—and ever fewer reversals. Today the International Union of Microbiological Societies has 57 groups from 45 nations; Italy, long a center for this kind of research, has six professional societies of its own. Last year's annual meeting of the American Society for Virology attracted more than 2,000 attendees from 50 countries.

Then there is the political influence on scientific 180s. In the U.S., politics and science collided right after 1803, the year of the Louisiana Purchase. The U.S. government knew so little about its new possession that it dispatched no fewer than four teams to survey the territory. One, led by U.S. Army officers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, crossed the continent by a northern route and became a celebrated part of American history. The three other expeditions went into the southern and central plains and were repelled by Spanish troops and Indigenous nations. Not until 1819 did the U.S. try again, sending a team led by engineer Stephen H. Long.

Although Long didn't know it, the southern plains were beset by a multiyear drought. While surveying the Platte and Canadian Rivers, his team almost starved. Unsurprisingly, the expedition's report portrayed the southern plains as “presenting the aspect of hopeless and irreclaimable sterility.” The land was “almost wholly unfit for cultivation, and of course uninhabitable by a people depending upon agriculture for their subsistence.” In the center of the team's map of the “country drained by the Mississippi” was a capitalized label: GREAT AMERICAN DESERT.

Today we know that in the central and southern plains, long-term atmospheric fluxes from the Pacific (the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, for example) and the Atlantic (the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) mix with warm, moist air currents from the Gulf of Mexico and cold, dry air from the Arctic jet stream. These phenomena collide unpredictably, causing tornadoes, blizzards, severe hailstorms, epic heat waves and, notably, lengthy droughts—the 1930s Dust Bowl being the most well known.

In what one pictures as the usual course of events, Long's report would have been followed by other surveys, some challenging his views, some backing them. Presumably the back-and-forth would slowly have revealed that Long's belief that aridity was the region's permanent state was incorrect because arid and wet periods came in irregular cycles. Yet that realization was not what happened, because politicians and wealthy interests, especially new railroad tycoons, wanted people to move to the plains and create communities that both produced and bought goods and crops. These would, of course, be transported by trains.

So not only did critics dispute the existence of the Great American Desert, but they said that rainfall in the area was increasing—because of farming. In his 1880 book Sketches of the Physical Geography and Geology of Nebraska, University of Nebraska scientist Samuel Aughey explained that prior to the arrival of Europeans, the prairie had been “pelted by the elements and trodden by millions of buffalo,” which packed the soil too hard to absorb water. But with settlers' plows breaking up the hardpan, “the rain as it falls is absorbed by the soil like a huge sponge.” More water retained in the land means more evaporation over it, which “must give increasing moisture and rainfall.” A slogan emerged: “Rain follows the plow.”

Researchers led by geologist John Wesley Powell, director of the U.S. Geological Survey, countered that the region was too drought-prone to sustain agriculture. Early rangeland scientists mocked the idea that the precolonial grasslands couldn't retain moisture. But their assertions were buried underneath floods of flyers, leaflets and advertisements from railroads that extolled Long's Great American Desert as a Great American Garden. When a multiyear drought overtook the region in the 1890s, it was a shock—a complete reversal of the expectations of migrants who had relied on the railroads' descriptions. They fled the area in droves. After the rains returned, new migrants poured in. The 1930s Dust Bowl, when it came, was just as much of a shocking 180 to them as the previous drought had been to their predecessors.

The argument over the climate in the plains was an early example of an increasingly common phenomenon: the mismatch between the slow, unsteady movement of scientific understanding and the immediate, short-term imperatives of politics and economics, which can lead to what seem like vertiginous scientific reversals.

Examples are as near to hand as the COVID pandemic. Early in the epidemic, in March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) avowed that COVID could not be transmitted through the air—people picked up the SARS-CoV-2 virus from surfaces. (“FACT”—the agency tweeted—“#COVID19 is NOT airborne.”) Other public health outfits followed suit. Air-pollution specialists, including those within these outfits, were astounded by the claims. In their discipline, it was well known that large particles of soot could travel through the air for miles.

Lidia Morawska, an aerosol specialist at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, led a group of aerosol researchers and ventilation engineers that contacted WHO about the lengthy travel distances days after the “FACT” tweet. Dismissing this evidence as weak, a WHO advisory group insisted in August 2020 that “SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by the airborne route to any significant extent.”

In part, WHO's reluctance was a legacy of the previous battle over miasma theory. The fight to eliminate the fear of vapors led infectious disease experts to take as given that nearly all infectious pathogens were spread by “droplets,” generally defined as more than five microns in diameter. Droplets fly out of sick people's mouths and noses when they cough, shout, sing or sneeze. The particles then land directly on other people or on nearby surfaces that people later touch. Implicit in the definition of droplets was that their relatively large size limited their ability to travel. Thus, WHO focused on getting people to wash surfaces and hands to stop the spread of the virus. Aerosol transmission, in which smaller organisms travel farther in vapor clouds, was thought to occur only for a few well-known diseases, mainly tuberculosis and measles.

WHO tenaciously stuck to its paradigm despite a tsunami of reports of aerosol transmission. Only gradually did the agency admit that such transmission was possible in specific “crowded and inadequately ventilated [indoor] spaces” (July 2020), that the virus could travel in the air “farther than 1 metre” in specific settings (April 2021), and, finally, that “airborne” transmission could occur in some places (December 2021)—a move that was greeted as a long-overdue 180.

The reversal was Kuhnian in the sense that WHO's scientific paradigm was overturned after resistance. But the scientists who rejected Michelson-Morley were motivated mainly by adherence to scientific orthodoxy, whereas WHO researchers were also responding to an intensely political environment. Agencies such as WHO are supposed to provide guidance for others to act on. Under public pressure to be definitive, they often end up digging in their heels on research questions that are poorly understood. What would in other circumstances be ordinary back-and-forth as researchers resolved questions is transformed into a series of stark, headline-grabbing reversals.

Perhaps nothing better illustrates this type of politically driven reversal than the five-decade controversy over mammograms for women between 40 and 50 years of age. In the early 1970s the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the American Cancer Society launched the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP) to test the potential of large-scale mammography. Some cancer researchers protested that repeatedly exposing women under 50 to x-rays would do more harm than good, so the BCDDP restricted enrollment of younger women to those at “high risk.”

The results were released in the 1980s. Although the BCDDP design had weaknesses, the study authors said the results showed that mammograms detected breast tumors that would not otherwise have been spotted. And screening did not produce excessive false positives, which can lead to needless biopsies and surgeries.

The NCI and almost 20 other medical organizations met to establish guidelines for mammography. A reanalysis of another, earlier, smaller trial, the Health Insurance Program of Greater New York study, also showed that mammography for younger women had positive effects. The combined result was nationwide recommendations, issued in 1989, that women should begin screening for cancer at age 40—and spurred a big advertising campaign by advocacy groups to convince women to do it.

But then, in 1992, the Canadian National Breast Screening Study of Cancer—the first randomized clinical trial designed specifically to examine the effectiveness of under-50 mammography—released a contradictory result: testing younger women did not reduce death rates. Big randomized clinical trials are generally considered the best way to understand the efficacy of medical treatments. Nevertheless, this one was furiously attacked by cancer advocacy groups, clinicians and radiologists, who asserted something must be wrong with the way the trial was done. Oddly, after the NCI convened a workshop on the issue that concluded “there is no reduction in mortality from breast cancer that can be attributed to screening,” the institute also insisted there was no need to change the recommendation for earlier screening. It cited vague “inferential” benefits.

Troubled by the idea of basing nationwide recommendations on what experts judged as low-quality evidence, Samuel Broder, then director of the NCI, announced the institute would not promote screening for women in their 40s. In his view, the potential good effects (possibly catching a few relatively rare cancers early) were far outweighed by the potential bad effects (those false alarms that scare women and can lead to many painful and unnecessary surgeries).

The National Cancer Advisory Board—an NCI advisory group of federal-agency officials, representatives from cancer associations, and cancer researchers—asked Broder not to pull back right away. He and the NCI stuck to their guns. Then U.S. Congress members erupted, calling the institute callous and sexist.

The American Cancer Society, the American College of Radiology, and other medical groups conceded that there weren't good data to support under-50 mammography. But they felt obligated to do something to address younger women's fear of breast cancer—a fear that was inflamed, in part, by the organizations' own public-relations campaigns promoting mammograms and breast self-exams.

Both sides continued their standoff until 1997, when the NIH convened a consensus conference to try to resolve the issue. It concluded that the current data didn't support under-50 screening. But the hoped-for consensus collapsed when critics, such as a mammography director at a private practice in New Mexico, charged that the agency statement was “tantamount to a death sentence for thousands of women in their forties.” Congress voted 98–0 to order the NCI to back screening for younger women. The institute caved. The American Cancer Society joined it to state that screening for women in their 40s was “beneficial and supportable with current evidence.”

Little of this controversy was visible in doctors' offices, where women were being told that screening that begins at 40 saves lives. Outside of those offices, advocacy groups were saying the same thing. So many patients were shocked by headlines in 2009, when the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an independent and influential expert board advising the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), went in the opposite direction. It said that almost 2,000 younger women would have to be screened to save one life. The other 1,900-plus women would be exposed to the risks of radiation and surgery.

The White House denounced the USPSTF's stance. The task force backed down, saying instead that women should consult their doctors—an embarrassing break with its mission, which was to assess the state of evidence for entire fields rather than telling patients to rely on the opinions of individual practitioners. Congress passed a law explicitly telling HHS to disregard “the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force regarding breast cancer screening.”

Then, in 2024, there was an actual reversal. The USPSTF issued another set of recommendations—but this time it came out in favor of routine mammograms for women in their 40s.

Throughout this time, the data had changed little. When put together, the eight big randomized controlled trials of mammography for women under 50 have shown that the tests produce very high, specific benefits for a small number of women and impose other costs on a much larger number of women. Yet the glare of publicity transformed a slow but fairly typical research debate into a huge controversy culminating in a big 180.

This kind of politically charged reversal shows little sign of declining. Likely future reversals may include causes and treatment of obesity or of Alzheimer's disease. All are the subjects of intense lobbying by commercial and public-interest groups.

As for reversals in fields where scientific ideas compete in disciplines that lack adequate investigatory tools, who knows? But hints may come from cosmology, where grand ideas about the nature of the universe jostle for prominence. These notions are constrained by the difficulty of gathering data but still driven forward by scientists seeking the thrill of causing yet one more scientific twist.

More Teens Are Getting Vaccines

Bucking national trends in childhood vaccination rates, more teens are getting recommended shots, including for measles and whooping cough

U.S. teenagers are rebelling.

More teens got recommended vaccinations in 2024 than did so in 2023. This trend is the opposite of what's happening in younger children: vaccine rates in the U.S. continue to fall among kids who are entering kindergarten. The numbers come from the most recent report on childhood vaccinations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The uptick among teens is a win for public health as the vaccine framework in the U.S. is under attack. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has placed antivaccine advocates on the CDC's advisory committee that makes vaccine recommendations. The federal government has ended grants for the development of mRNA vaccines despite the safety and success of COVID shots. Since January there have been 32 measles outbreaks, largely among children and teens that did not get measles shots.

But the new findings suggest that communication between providers and parents can lead to higher vaccine uptake. In 2024 the percentage of teens aged 13 to 17 who got two or more doses of the combination measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot increased from the portion in 2023, from 91.3 percent to 92.6 percent. The percentage of teens who got the combination tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine rose from 89 percent in 2023 to 91.3 percent last year. And the number of teens who got at least one dose of the four-pronged meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) shot increased from 88.4 percent in 2023 to 90.1 percent in 2024. (The MenACWY vaccine spurs an immune response to four versions of a bacteria that causes meningitis.)

The results were published last Friday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The authors analyzed data collected from the 2024 National Immunization Survey–Teen, a two-phase survey that asked parents and their children's providers about vaccine use.

But not all of the trends were upward. In 2024, for the third year in a row, teens' uptake of the HPV vaccine—which protects against the cancer-causing human papillomavirus—remained the same. The national average of teens who have had at least one dose of the HPV vaccine held steady at 78 percent, though there was broad variability from state to state. The researchers reported that, in 2024, less than 40 percent of teens in Mississippi got at least one shot, but close to 80 percent in Massachusetts did so.

And communication was key: parents who reported talking about the vaccine with a provider were more likely to have teens who got it. In metropolitan statistical areas (which can include urban, suburban and rural communities), the percentage of teens who got the vaccine was about 18.8 percentage points higher on average when their provider recommended it than when the provider didn't.

And in addition to variability among states, there were other differences. In general, urban areas had higher vaccination rates than rural areas and, in some cases, suburban ones. This sort of difference has long been the case in the U.S., where transportation, insurance coverage and provider availability have created wide rural-urban disparities in health care access.

For some of the diseases targeted by the vaccines on the CDC's immunization schedule, even the increase in teens getting the shots doesn't mean the U.S. is at a herd immunity level, the point at which the population as a whole is more generally protected from an illness. For example, to achieve herd immunity for pertussis, 92 to 94 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated. The vaccination rate for kindergartners in 2024–2025 was 92.1 percent. Teens were at 91.3 percent, putting the U.S. just under the lower threshold for herd immunity. In 2024 there were more than 35,000 cases of whooping cough in the U.S. In 2023 there were approximately 7,000.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Engineers Printed a 1000-Square-Foot House Out of Soil—No Concrete Needed","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/green-tech/a65797286/soil-3d-printed-house/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Using dirt as a construction material could help make one of the biggest carbon-emitting sectors significantly greener.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Building a new home isn't cheap—financially or environmentally. 

While many countries need to build fast to address the ongoing housing crisis, all of that building would come with a major environmental toll. A 2022 estimate by MIT Climate states that constructing a single house creates 15 to 100 tons of CO2, and a lot of that carbon comes from concrete, which requires high temperatures powered by fossil fuels to create. While valiant efforts have been made to clean up concrete and cement production, the industry is still one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters globally. 

This unfortunate truth has inspired some engineers to think outside the box in order to help close the gap between needed housing and environmental sustainability. Recycled timber is a popular alternative building material, as trees naturally sequester carbon, so you're basically building with atmospheric carbon. Another route is industrial-scale 3D printing, which requires less labor and also produces less waste. Granted, most 3D-printed homes still rely on some form of concrete mix (including cement, sand, gravel, and aggregates). But now, companies are trying to 3D-build with a different kind of extruded material—local soil. 

In July, the Japanese architectural firm Lib Work announced the successful construction of the “Lib Earth House Model B,” which is a 1,000 square-foot home constructed entirely from soil—no concrete required. Lib Work claims that the Model B (built in Yamaga, Kumamoto Prefecture) is five times stronger than the previous model, which was constructed earlier this year. The company also used a novel approach to the construction by integrating generative AI into the design process. According to Archinect, Lib Work is the world's first fully automated home construction system. 

“We have succeeded in developing a sustainable earthen wall made entirely from earth and natural materials, without using any cement,” according to the company's website, translated from Japanese. “This is not just a house, but a challenge to rethink the very way we live.”

Of course, this house features more than just walls made of soil. An in-wall condensation detection system constantly monitors for deterioration, and the home is fully off the grid, relying on solar panels and a Tesla Powerwall battery for energy. The home is also fully remote controlled through a smartphone app. 

Lib Work isn't the first architecture company to investigate ways to use soil as a building material. In 2021, for example, Mario Cucinella Architects in Bologna, Italy, partnered with the 3D-printer manufacturer WASP (which also worked with Lib Work on the Model B) to create a clay-based construction material derived from local soil. Although the drying process took longer than other quick-dry concrete products, the material allowed for increased flexibility in terms of construction location. 

Building affordable housing and limiting greenhouse gas emissions will require innovative solutions—from broader city planning to home construction. Increased housing density can help keep utility bills low and limit reliance on cars, while sustainable materials can build homes without adding to humanity's growing CO2 budget. With entire neighborhoods being constructed using 3D-printing in the U.S. and around the world, homes like the Model B could a win-win solution for communities and the climate.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A new cancer vaccine just wiped out tumors in mice","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250818102951.htm","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 06:23:53 GMT","

An experimental mRNA vaccine boosted the tumor-fighting effects of immunotherapy in a mouse-model study, bringing researchers one step closer to their goal of developing a universal vaccine to ""wake up"" the immune system against cancer.

Published recently in Nature Biomedical Engineering, the University of Florida study showed that like a one-two punch, pairing the test vaccine with common anticancer drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors triggered a strong antitumor response.

A surprising element, researchers said, was that they achieved the promising results not by attacking a specific target protein expressed in the tumor, but by simply revving up the immune system -- spurring it to respond as if fighting a virus. They did this by stimulating the expression of a protein called PD-L1 inside of tumors, making them more receptive to treatment. The research was supported by multiple federal agencies and foundations, including the National Institutes of Health.

Senior author Elias Sayour, M.D., Ph.D., a UF Health pediatric oncologist, said the results reveal a potential new treatment path -- an alternative to surgery, radiation and chemotherapy -- with broad implications for battling many types of treatment-resistant tumors.

""This paper describes a very unexpected and exciting observation: that even a vaccine not specific to any particular tumor or virus -- so long as it is an mRNA vaccine -- could lead to tumor-specific effects,"" said Sayour, principal investigator at the RNA Engineering Laboratory within UF's Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy.

""This finding is a proof of concept that these vaccines potentially could be commercialized as universal cancer vaccines to sensitize the immune system against a patient's individual tumor,"" said Sayour, a McKnight Brain Institute investigator and co-leader of a program in immuno-oncology and microbiome research.

Until now, there have been two main ideas in cancer-vaccine development: To find a specific target expressed in many people with cancer, or to tailor a vaccine that is specific to targets expressed within a patient's own cancer.

""This study suggests a third emerging paradigm,"" said Duane Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., a co-author of the paper. ""What we found is by using a vaccine designed not to target cancer specifically but rather to stimulate a strong immunologic response, we could elicit a very strong anticancer reaction. And so this has significant potential to be broadly used across cancer patients -- even possibly leading us to an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine.""

For more than eight years, Sayour has pioneered high-tech anticancer vaccines by combining lipid nanoparticles and mRNA. Short for messenger RNA, mRNA is found inside every cell -- including tumor cells -- and serves as a blueprint for protein production.

This new study builds upon a breakthrough last year by Sayour's lab: In a first-ever human clinical trial, an mRNA vaccine quickly reprogrammed the immune system to attack glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. Among the most impressive findings in the four-patient trial was how quickly the new method -- which used a ""specific"" or personalized vaccine made using a patient's own tumor cells -- spurred a vigorous immune-system response to reject the tumor.

In the latest study, Sayour's research team adapted their technology to test a ""generalized"" mRNA vaccine -- meaning it was not aimed at a specific virus or mutated cells of cancer but engineered simply to prompt a strong immune system response. The mRNA formulation was made similarly to the COVID-19 vaccines, rooted in similar technology, but wasn't aimed directly at the well-known spike protein of COVID.

In mouse models of melanoma, the team saw promising results in normally treatment-resistant tumors when combining the mRNA formulation with a common immunotherapy drug called a PD-1 inhibitor, a type of monoclonal antibody that attempts to ""educate"" the immune system that a tumor is foreign, said Sayour, a professor in UF's Lillian S. Wells Department of Neurosurgery and the Department of Pediatrics in the UF College of Medicine.

Taking the research a step further, in mouse models of skin, bone and brain cancers, the investigators found beneficial effects when testing a different mRNA formulation as a solo treatment. In some models, the tumors were eliminated entirely.

Sayour and colleagues observed that using an mRNA vaccine to activate immune responses seemingly unrelated to cancer could prompt T cells that weren't working before to actually multiply and kill the cancer if the response spurred by the vaccine is strong enough.

Taken together, the study's implications are striking, said Mitchell, who directs the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute and co-directs UF's Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy.

""It could potentially be a universal way of waking up a patient's own immune response to cancer,"" Mitchell said. ""And that would be profound if generalizable to human studies.""

The results, he said, show potential for a universal cancer vaccine that could activate the immune system and prime it to work in tandem with checkpoint inhibitor drugs to seize upon cancer -- or in some cases, even work on its own to kill cancer.

Now, the research team is working to improve current formulations and move to human clinical trials as rapidly as possible.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This overlooked trait could explain anxiety and depression in millions","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250818102949.htm","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:46:57 GMT","

The meta-analysis of 33 studies, the first of its kind, looked at the relationship between sensitivity and common mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. Researchers found there was a significant, positive relationship between the two, concluding that highly sensitive people are more likely to experience depression and anxiety compared to those who are less sensitive.

In the study, sensitivity was defined as a personality trait that reflects people's capacity to perceive and process environmental stimuli such as bright lights, subtle changes in the environment and other peoples' moods. Often overlooked in mental health studies and clinical practice, which tend to focus on neuroticism and its association with mental health conditions, this research shows that understanding a person's sensitivity level is important and can have therapeutic implications.

For example, people with more sensitive personality traits may be more likely to benefit from treatment plans which involve techniques such as applied relaxation and mindfulness, which can also prevent relapse.

Tom Falkenstein, a psychotherapist and a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, said: ""This is the most extensive systematic review on sensitivity and mental health in adolescents and adults to date, and is the first ever meta-analysis on the topic to estimate the impact of this relationship. We found positive and moderate correlations between sensitivity and various mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia and avoidant personality disorder. Our findings suggest that sensitivity should be considered more in clinical practice which could be used to improve diagnosis of conditions.""

""In addition, our findings could help improve treatment for these individuals. Around 31% of the general population are considered highly sensitive, and, as our findings show, are more likely to respond better to some psychological interventions than less sensitive individuals. Therefore, sensitivity should be considered when thinking about treatment plans for mental health conditions. Our work shows it is crucial that the awareness of sensitivity is improved among mental health care professionals, so clinicians and practitioners can recognize the trait in their patients, and tailor treatment to their sensitivity.""

Michael Pluess, Professor in Developmental Psychology at University of Surrey and Visiting Professor at Queen Mary University of London said:

""This is the first meta-analysis providing robust evidence that highly sensitive people are more prone to common mental health problems. However, it is important to remember that highly sensitive people are also more responsive to positive experiences, including psychological treatment. Our results provide further evidence that sensitive people are more affected by both negative and positive experiences and that the quality of their environment is particularly important for their well-being.""

The systematic review and meta analysis of 33 studies was carried out by an academic team from several universities including Queen Mary University and the University of Surrey.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Tiny microbes may secretly rewire the brain before birth","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250818103000.htm","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 13:57:24 GMT","

Why this matters:

New research from Michigan State University finds that microbes play an important role in shaping early brain development, specifically in a key brain region that controls stress, social behavior, and vital body functions.

The study, published in Hormones and Behavior, used a mouse model to highlight how natural microbial exposure not only impacts brain structure immediately after birth but may even begin influencing development while still in the womb. A mouse model was chosen because mice share significant biological and behavioral similarities with humans and there are no other alternatives to study the role of microbes on brain development.

This work is of significance because modern obstetric practices, like peripartum antibiotic use and Cesarean delivery, disrupt maternal microbes. In the United States alone, 40% of women receive antibiotics around childbirth and one-third of all births occur via Cesarean section.

""At birth, a newborn body is colonized by microbes as it travels through the birth canal. Birth also coincides with important developmental events that shape the brain. We wanted to further explore how the arrival of these microbes may affect brain development,"" said Alexandra Castillo Ruiz, lead author of the study and assistant professor in the MSU Department of Psychology.

The research team focused on a brain region called the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), which plays a central role in regulating stress, blood pressure, water balance, and even social behavior. Their previous work had shown that mice raised without microbes, or germ-free mice, had more dying neurons in the PVN during early development. The new study set out to determine whether this increased cell death translated to changes in neuron number in the long run, and if any effects could be caused by the arrival of microbes at birth or if they began in the womb via signals from maternal microbes.

To find out, the researchers used a cross-fostering approach. Germ-free newborn mice were placed with mothers that had microbes and compared them to control groups. When the brains of these mice were examined just three days after birth, results were striking: All mice gestated by germ-free mothers had fewer neurons in the PVN, regardless of whether they received microbes after birth. They also found that germ-free adult mice had fewer neurons in the PVN.

""Our study shows that microbes play an important role in sculpting a brain region that is paramount for body functions and social behavior. In addition, our study indicates that microbial effects start in the womb via signaling from maternal microbes,"" said Dr. Castillo-Ruiz.

Rather than shunning our microbes, we should recognize them as partners in early life development,"" said Dr. Castillo-Ruiz. ""They're helping build our brains from the very beginning.""

For a few dozen people in the world, the downside of living with a rare immune condition comes with a surprising superpower -- the ability to fight off all viruses.

Columbia immunologist Dusan Bogunovic discovered the individuals' antiviral powers about 15 years ago, soon after he identified the genetic mutation that causes the condition.

At first, the condition only seemed to increase vulnerability to some bacterial infections. But as more patients were identified, its unexpected antiviral benefits became apparent. Bogunovic, a professor of pediatric immunology at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, soon learned that everyone with the mutation, which causes a deficiency in an immune regulator called ISG15, has mild, but persistent systemic inflammation.

""The type of inflammation they had was antiviral, and that's when it dawned on me that these individuals could be hiding something,"" Bogunovic recalls. When he and his colleagues looked at the individuals' immune cells, they could see encounters with all sorts of viruses -- flu, measles, mumps, chickenpox. But the patients had never reported any overt signs of infection or illness.

""In the back of my mind, I kept thinking that if we could produce this type of light immune activation in other people, we could protect them from just about any virus,"" Bogunovic says.

Today, Bogunovic is closing in on a therapeutic strategy that could provide that broad-spectrum protection against viruses and become an important weapon in next pandemic.

In his latest study, published Aug. 13 in Science Translational Medicine, Bogunovic and his team report that an experimental therapy they've developed temporarily gives recipients (hamsters and mice, so far) the same antiviral superpower as people with ISG15 deficiency. When administered prophylactically into the animals' lungs via a nasal drip, the therapy prevented viral replication of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses and lessened disease severity.

In cell culture, ""we have yet to find a virus that can break through the therapy's defenses,"" Bogunovic says.

Mimicking the immune superpowers of a rare condition 

Bogunovic's therapy is designed to mimic what happens in people with ISG15 deficiency, but only for a short time.

Instead of turning off ISG15 directly -- which leads to the production of more than 60 proteins -- Bogunovic's therapeutic turns on production of 10 proteins that are primarily responsible for the broad antiviral protection.

The current design resembles COVID mRNA vaccines but with a twist: Ten mRNAs encoding the 10 proteins are packaged inside a lipid nanoparticle. Once the nanoparticles are absorbed by the recipient's cells, the cells generate the ten host proteins to produce the antiviral protection.

""We only generate a small amount of these ten proteins, for a very short time, and that leads to much less inflammation than what we see in ISG15-deficient individuals,"" Bogunovic says. ""But that inflammation is enough to prevent antiviral diseases.""

Foundation for future therapy 

Bogunovic's team sees their technology as a weapon for the next pandemic -- providing protection for first responders, people in nursing homes, and family members of infected individuals -- regardless of the responsible virus.

""We believe the technology will work even if we don't know the identity of the virus,"" Bogunovic says. Importantly, the antiviral protection provided by the technology will not prevent people from developing their own immunological memory to the virus for longer-term protection.

But the technology's drug delivery and absorption properties still need optimization. When delivered to animals via nanoparticles, the 10 proteins were produced in the lungs, ""but probably not at high enough levels that makes us comfortable going into people immediately,"" Bogunovic says.

""Once the therapy reaches our cells, it works, but the delivery of any nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, into the part of the body you want to protect is currently the biggest challenge in the field."" The researchers also need to determine how long the therapy's antiviral protection will last, currently estimated at three to four days.

""Our findings reinforce the power of research driven by curiosity without preconceived notions,"" Bogunovic says. ""We were not looking for an antiviral when we began studying our rare patients, but the studies have inspired the potential development of a universal antiviral for everyone.""

The study, ""An mRNA-based broad-spectrum antiviral inspired by ISG15 deficiency protects against viral infections in vitro and in vivo,"" was published Aug. 13 in Science Translational Medicine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists may have finally found the Universe's missing sulfur","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250819040807.htm","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 10:38:21 GMT","

For decades, astrochemists have been looking for sulfur atoms in space and finding surprisingly little of the element that is a key ingredient to life. A new study could point to where it has been hiding.

An international team of researchers including Ryan Fortenberry, an astrochemist at the University of Mississippi, and Ralf Kaiser, professor of chemistry at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa and Samer Gozem, computational chemist at Georgia State University, published their research in the journal Nature Communications.

""Hydrogen sulfide is everywhere: it's a product of coal-fired power plants, it has an effect on acid rain, it changes the pH levels of oceans and it comes out of volcanoes,"" Fortenberry said. ""If we gain a better understanding of what the chemistry of sulfur can do, the technological commercialization that can come from that can only be realized with a foundation of fundamental knowledge.""

Sulfur is the 10th most abundant element in the universe and is considered a vital chemical element for planets, stars and life. The lack of molecular sulfur in space has been a mystery for years.

""The observed amount of sulfur in dense molecular clouds is less - compared to predicted gas-phase abundances- by three orders of magnitude,"" Kaiser said.

The answer might lie in interstellar ice.

In cold regions of space, sulfur can form two distinct, stable configurations: octasulfur crowns, which are a group of eight sulfur atoms configured in ring-like crowns, and polysulfanes, chains of sulfur atoms that are bonded by hydrogen. These molecules can form on icy dust grains, locking sulfur into solid forms.

""If you use, for instance, the James Webb Space Telescope, you get a specific signature at specific wavelengths for oxygen and carbon and nitrogen and so forth,"" Fortenberry said. ""But when you do that for sulfur, it's out of whack, and we don't know why there isn't enough molecular sulfur.

""What this work is showing is that the most common forms of sulfur that we already know about are probably where the sulfur is hiding.""

Kaiser and Fortenberry's research showed that these sulfur-rich molecules may be abundant in icy regions of interstellar space, giving astronomers a potential road map to solving the sulfur puzzle.

""Laboratory simulations of interstellar conditions such as this study discover possible inventories of sulfur-containing molecules that can be formed on interstellar ices,"" Kaiser said. ""Astronomers can then utilize the results and look for these polysulfane molecules in the interstellar medium via radio telescopes once sublimed into the gas-phase in star forming regions.""

The reason sulfur has been so difficult to find is that the bonds it forms are always changing, going from crowns to chains and a variety of other formulations.

""It never maintains the same shape,"" Fortenberry said. ""It's kind of like a virus - as it moves, it changes.""

The researchers' work identifies possible stable configurations that astronomers can search for in the universe.

""The thing that I love about astrochemistry is that it forces you to ask hard questions, then forces you to come up with creative solutions,"" Fortenberry said. ""And those hard questions and creative solutions can have significant, unintended positive consequences.""

The off-label use of ketamine to treat chronic pain is not supported by scientific evidence, a new Cochrane review has found.

Ketamine is an anaesthetic commonly used for procedural sedation and short-term pain relief. Ketamine is also frequently prescribed off-label to manage chronic pain conditions such as nerve pain, fibromyalgia and complex regional pain syndrome. It is one of several NMDA receptor antagonists -- a group of drugs thought to reduce pain by blocking certain brain receptors involved in pain signalling.

The review, conducted by researchers from UNSW Sydney, Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), and Brunel University of London, examined 67 trials involving over 2,300 adult participants. It assessed five NMDA receptor antagonists: ketamine, memantine, dextromethorphan, amantadine, and magnesium. Results show no clear evidence of benefit for ketamine in chronic pain and identified an increased risk of adverse effects such as delusions, delirium, paranoia, nausea, and vomiting. Evidence was rated low to very low certainty, due to small study sizes and poor methodological quality.

""We want to be clear - we're not saying ketamine is ineffective, but there's a lot of uncertainty,"" said Michael Ferraro, Doctoral Candidate at UNSW and NeuRA, first author of the review. ""The data could point to a benefit or no effect at all. Right now, we just don't know.""

Researchers looked at the effects across various chronic pain conditions and dosing strategies but found no clear evidence of benefit in any specific condition or dose. Side effects were a major concern, particularly with intravenous use.

""The most common adverse events we saw were psychotomimetic effects such as delusions, delirium and paranoia, as well as nausea and vomiting."" said Ferraro. ""These effects are distressing for many patients. Clinicians often try to balance the dose for pain relief without triggering those symptoms, but this isn't always achieved.""

The review also found no studies that reported on two key outcomes: whether ketamine reduced depressive symptoms or opioid use. This is notable, as ketamine is often proposed for patients with depressive symptoms or opioid tolerance.

""This group of drugs, and ketamine in particular, are in relatively common use for chronic pain around the world. Yet we have no convincing evidence that they are delivering meaningful benefits for people with pain, even in the short term,"" said Neil O'Connell, Professor at Brunel University of London, co-senior author of the review. ""That seems a good reason to be cautious in the clinic and clearly indicates an urgent need to undertake high quality trials.""

The authors hope the review will help inform patients and clinicians weighing up potential benefits and harms, and guide future research. While more evidence is needed, this review highlights the importance of high-quality trials to understand whether ketamine has a role in chronic pain care.

""We've seen the harm that can come from taking medicines developed for acute pain and applying them to chronic pain, opioids are a prime example. Now we're seeing a similar pattern with ketamine,"" said co-senior author James McAuley, Professor at UNSW and senior researcher at NeuRA. ""As opioid prescribing is slowly reduced, there's a growing demand for alternatives, but we need to be careful not to rush into widespread use without strong evidence.""

Arabidopsis has been pivotal in uncovering fundamental principles of plant biology, yet a comprehensive, high-resolution understanding of its cellular identities throughout the entire life cycle remains incomplete. Here we present a single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic atlas spanning ten developmental stages, encompassing over 400,000 nuclei from all organ systems and tissues—from seeds to developing siliques. Leveraging paired single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic datasets, we annotate 75% of identified cell clusters, revealing striking molecular diversity in cell types and states across development. Our integrated approach identified conserved transcriptional signatures among recurrent cell types, organ-specific heterogeneity and previously uncharacterized cell-type-specific markers validated spatially. Moreover, we uncover dynamic transcriptional programs governing secondary metabolite production and differential growth patterns, exemplified by detailed spatial profiling of the compact yet complex apical hook structure; this profiling revealed transient cellular states linked to developmental progression and hormonal regulation, highlighting the hidden complexity underlying plant morphogenesis. Functional validation of genes uniquely expressed within specific cell contexts confirmed their essential developmental roles, underscoring the predictive power of our atlas. Collectively, this comprehensive resource provides an invaluable foundation for exploring cellular differentiation, environmental responses and genetic perturbations at high resolution, advancing our understanding of plant biology.

Multicellular organisms have evolved distinct organs to perform specific complex tasks and address challenges that may be present throughout their life. Unlike most animals, plants continuously undergo post-embryonic organogenesis to form new organs throughout development. In the model plant Arabidopsis, many tissues and organs present throughout its life cycle are composed of identical or similarly classified cell types that share functionality across organs and developmental stages1. For example, epidermal cells are the interface of the plant with the external environment for all organs, while internally localized vascular cells universally function in water and nutrient transport2,3. Despite the current understanding of plant anatomy, there is limited understanding of the molecular constituents that define cell types and states within the native context of diverse organs present throughout development.

While cell-type marker genes exist for many recurrent cell types across distinct organs, the form and function of cell types can vary depending on the tissue context or cellular niche from which they originate. Intra-cell-type heterogeneity is exemplified by Arabidopsis sepal and silique epidermal pavement cells, which undergo rapid cellular elongation depending on transcript dosages of the epidermal master regulator ATML1 (ref. 4) or regulators of the cell cycle5 or in response to fertilization signals6, demonstrating that identically classified cell types can undergo varied developmental programs dependent on internal cues. In addition to cell-type classification, cellular states (which can be defined as variations in molecular phenotypes that do not impact the developmental potential7) may further differentiate individual cells within cell types and may reflect developmental factors, such as the cell cycle8, tissue/cellular age9, the spatial location and cellular neighbourhoods within tissues10, and external stimuli11. The molecular identity of a cell can thus be defined as the cumulative expression of transcripts that determine both cell type and state.

Single-cell RNA sequencing has been used to provide detailed maps of cell types in plants12. Still, its application is generally restricted to selected organs, tissues and cell types13,14,15,16,17 within individual studies13,14,15,16,17,18,19, posing a bottleneck towards a standardized comprehensive understanding of cell types and states in this model organism. While a recent study addresses this gap through the generation of single-nucleus transcriptomic datasets of tissues present throughout Arabidopsis development20, a challenge remains in the annotation and validation of large numbers of new marker genes, many of which may have no known function or are uncharacterized. To overcome this challenge, spatial transcriptomic methods present a powerful tool for the native detection of transcripts in situ within tissues, which simultaneously facilitates the validation of newly identified marker genes and the elucidation of spatially regulated expression21,22,23,24,25. Furthermore, the complementary application of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies enables the investigation and elucidation of spatially and temporally regulated cellular states that potentially underlie biological function26 and environmental interaction27 within individual cell types. To date, however, there has not been wide application of single-cell and spatial omics to diverse Arabidopsis organs within individual studies. Here we present a single-nucleus transcriptome atlas with companion spatial transcriptome atlases as a foundational dataset of the Arabidopsis life cycle. These datasets reveal diverse molecular identities integrating cell type and state, including universal and development- and organ-specific cell-type marker genes.

The paired application of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic methods facilitated the identification of new cell-type-specific genes across diverse organs and enabled confident annotation of 138/183 (75%) of the clusters identified in our study. Furthermore, our paired single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic datasets enabled the transcriptome-wide analysis of cellular states associated with rapid differential growth within the etiolated Arabidopsis seedling hypocotyl. Lastly, the examination of mutants in genes that we found to be under the combined regulation of cell-type and developmental specificity revealed functional roles of these transcripts in plants at the physiological level only within their native expression contexts. This study will be a powerful foundation for hypothesis generation that may facilitate discoveries within highly specific cell populations throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle.

To generate a comprehensive atlas of Arabidopsis development, we collected six distinct organ systems that encompass diverse tissues as well as whole organisms at ten discrete developmental time points throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle corresponding to established developmental road maps28,29,30. This includes imbibed and germinating seeds, three stages of seedling development, developing and fully emerged rosettes, the stem, flowers and siliques (Fig. 1a). For each organ system, we also generated a paired spatial transcriptomic dataset (Fig. 1b–e; mature rosette leaf27). For the single-nucleus datasets, 432,919 nuclei from the ten developmental time points passed accepted droplet-based single-nucleus filtering metrics31 (median unique molecular identifier (UMI), 916; Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1) and were independently clustered. For the seedling and rosette samples that constitute developmental time series, we also performed integrative analyses that revealed clusters corresponding to known cell types (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), which confirms the reproducibility of these datasets and enables the investigation of developmentally regulated processes, such as root hair development (Supplementary Fig. 2) and leaf senescence (Supplementary Fig. 3), as reported recently20, across developmentally distinct samples. We also merged all single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets into a global dataset (Fig. 1f) encompassing all cell types across the Arabidopsis life cycle.

See Methods for detailed information.

To compare cell types across organs and development, we analysed each dataset independently, which resulted in 183 clusters across all datasets (Fig. 1d). Cluster annotation was performed according to the following guidelines. First, an extensive list of marker genes was compiled with known cell-type- and tissue-specific expression in all Arabidopsis organs (Supplementary Table 1), including cell-type-specific markers recently identified from single-cell RNA-seq studies18,19,32,33,34,35. Many of these known cell-type-/tissue-specific expressed genes were enriched in specific clusters of our dataset (>1,000 genes), which aided cluster annotation (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Second, a cell-type enrichment score for each cluster was calculated on the basis of known cell-type markers to systematically infer cell types (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Third, we investigated newly identified cluster markers within each dataset using previously generated dissection-based and cell-type-specific transcriptomic studies (TAIR36 and ePlant37,38) to confirm the accuracy of our cluster annotations (Supplementary Table 2). Finally, we spatially validated a selection of cluster markers for each tissue/organ using sequencing- and imaging-based spatial transcriptomic technologies (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Figs. 2–6).

Our spatial transcriptome approach allowed us to validate examples of known cell-type marker genes across organs and development, as well as validate newly identified cell-type-specific and tissue-specific marker genes across all organs (see Supplementary Table 3 for 109 examples of new cell-type/tissue marker genes). In contrast, we were also able to identify and validate markers that do not universally specify cell types but rather demonstrate cell-type-specific expression only within the context of specific organs, as shown for epidermal cells of seedling hypocotyls (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the localization of cell-type-specific genes identified via snRNA-seq in most developmental stages and plant organs tested (Extended Data Figs. 2–6). In the seedling datasets, we were able to confirm cell identities such as mesophyll cells expressing LIGHT-HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL-PROTEIN COMPLEX II SUBUNIT B1 (LHB1B1; AT2G34430)38, epidermal cells (for example, GLYCOSYL HYDROLASE 9B8 (GH9B8; AT2G32990) and AT2G12462, new epidermal markers restricted to the apical hook and cotyledons in seedlings, respectively) and vascular cells (AINTEGUMENTA (ANT; AT4G37750), which was shown to regulate ERECTA-LIKE 1 (ERL1; AT5G62230) and PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM (PXY; AT5G61480), which maintain procambial cell identity39) that are co-expressed in the same cluster as SUCROSE-PROTON SYMPORTER 2 (SUC2; AT1G22710)40,41,42 (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3). We were also able to annotate clusters to cell states through the cluster-specific expression of cell-division-associated genes such as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE LIKE-D (CSLD5; AT1G02730), involved in cell plate formation43, and HINKEL (HIK; AT1G18370), which is involved in cytokinesis44 (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3).

Visual inspection of spatial marker expression within the single-nucleus datasets did not always reveal cluster-specific expression patterns, as demonstrated by LHB1B1 (Extended Data Fig. 3g), but quantitative evaluation of these markers revealed cluster- and subcluster-specific and enriched expression of these spatial markers both within individual samples (Extended Data Fig. 3k, left) and across tissues and developmental time points (Extended Data Fig. 3k, right), demonstrating conserved expression of these cell-type and cell-state markers across diverse tissues throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle.

In stems, we identified cell-type-specific gene expression localized to the procambium (for example, USUALLY MULTIPLE AMINO ACIDS MOVE IN AND OUT TRANSPORTERS 11 (UMAMIT11; AT2G40900)), cortex (for example, B-BOX DOMAIN PROTEIN 15 (BBX15; AT1G25440)), phloem (H(+)-ATPase 3 (refs. 45,46) (HA3; AT5G57350)) and xylem tissues (XYLEM CYSTEINE PEPTIDASE 2 (XCP2; AT1G20850) and IRREGULAR XYLEM 3 (ref. 47) (IRX3; AT5G17420)), enabling high-resolution mapping of vascular differentiation in the stem (Extended Data Fig. 4). Spatial expression of markers in Arabidopsis floral tissue revealed epidermal markers (for example, AT2G37540), vascular-expressed genes (for example, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT; AT1G65480)) and carpel-specific expression of AGAMOUS-like 8 / FRUITFULL (AT5G60910; ref. 48) (Extended Data Fig. 5). Spatial transcriptomics also revealed distinct expression domains within the Arabidopsis silique, with VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN 2 (VSP2; AT5G24770) and the TPX2 protein family (TPXL6; AT5G37478) marking the exocarp cell layer, and AT2G13810 showing specific localization in developing seeds (Extended Data Fig. 6). Together, these examples demonstrate the strength of our paired single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic datasets on matched biological samples.

While we were able to annotate many clusters to individual cell types, we found that some clusters instead corresponded to anatomical regions or broad cellular states, such as the developing embryo or dividing cells (Supplementary Table 2). This led us to hypothesize that further transcriptional complexity could be resolved within each cluster when examined independently. Through systematic re-clustering of individual clusters (subclustering), we were able to determine further complexity within clusters, resulting in a total of 655 subclusters (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Correlating the aggregated transcriptomes (pseudobulk) of each subcluster, we found that subclusters generally grouped by sample type, but we also found examples of subclusters with unique gene expression patterns that grouped independent of dataset (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Together, these results demonstrate that subclustering captures subtle transcriptional states and uncovers rare or transitional cell populations that may play distinct roles across developmental or environmental contexts.

The silique represents a complex system that includes distinct maternal and progeny tissues. We therefore used the silique dataset as a use case example of dataset annotation that is enhanced by the paired single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic datasets (Fig. 3a). Within the proliferating cell population (cluster 0) that may encompass multiple cell types in siliques, subclustering revealed three transcriptionally distinct groups, with each defined by unique marker genes (Fig. 3b,c). Expression of these markers was restricted to the seed coat layer49, prompting further spatial investigation.

Magnified images of individual seed sacs are also depicted. The scale bar lengths are shown. b,c, Subclustering of cluster 0 from the silique dataset. Groups of clusters corresponding to the outer integument (blue), inner integument (pink) and flavonoid biosynthesis (orange) clusters are depicted (b), with violin plots of select cluster markers (c). d, Relevant cell types and structures of developing seed sacs. e, Magnified images of an individual seed sac in the spatial dataset. Subcluster markers are coloured corresponding to the annotated cluster grouping. The scale bar length is shown. For the micrographs in a and e, results were observed in three siliques and at least ten seed sacs within the siliques.

By mapping these markers in the spatial dataset, we were able to finely annotate subcluster groups corresponding to the seed coat's outer and inner integument layers (Fig. 3a,d,e). This annotation of individual layers within developing seeds was further supported by a similar annotation of these genes in a single-nucleus transcriptome dataset of Arabidopsis seeds35. Consistent with a previous single-nucleus dataset of developing seeds35, we also identified subcluster markers corresponding to flavonoid biosynthetic processes within our subcluster groups (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Fig. 6), but spatial mapping revealed that these transcripts are detected in both the seed coat and endosperm layers of seed sacs (Fig. 3e, beige). While flavonoid secondary metabolites are known to function in seed coat colour and cause the transparent testa phenotype in mutants of flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes50,51, the spatial expression of TRANSPARENT TESTA 4 (TT4; AT5G13930) and other flavonoid biosynthesis genes within the endosperm layer may instead be associated with the alteration of fatty acid levels in embryos. This has been observed in tt2 (AT5G35550)52, tt4 (AT5G13930)53 and tt8 (AT4G09820)54 mutants. The simultaneous but spatially distinct expression of genes encoding flavonoid biosynthesis enzymes may suggest functionally diverse roles of flavonoid metabolites within discrete cell types of individual seeds. Together, these findings demonstrate that transcriptional states may be strongly associated with secondary metabolite production and inclusive of multiple cell types, further demonstrating that the paired application of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptome datasets enables the discovery and annotation of marker genes at the resolution of individual cell layers.

Spatially confined expression of polarity regulators is a hallmark of de novo organogenesis in various Arabidopsis organs10,55,56. We hypothesized that our Arabidopsis life-cycle atlas would capture polarity-defined cells. In our single-nucleus datasets, we detected transcripts of canonical polarity markers across several clusters (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting the presence of such cells within our datasets. However, these transcripts were sparsely expressed, limiting our ability to fully resolve polarity domains on the basis of single-nucleus data alone (Supplementary Fig. 7).

To overcome this limitation, we leveraged our spatial transcriptomics dataset and examined the expression of known polarity regulators in our three-day-old seedling dataset. We detected transcripts of known polarity regulators in expected regions of cotyledons and were able to spatially reconstruct the three-domain model of leaf development57,58 with the detection of REVOLUTA (REV; AT5G60690), WUSCHEL-related homeobox 1 (WOX1; AT3G18010) and YABBY1 (YAB1) / ABNORMAL FLORAL ORGANS (AFO) (AT2G45190) in the adaxial, middle and abaxial domains of cotyledons, respectively (Fig. 4a–c).

For the micrographs in a and d, results were observed in eight seedlings. For the micrographs in i and j, results were observed in two cross-sectioned flowers and one longitudinally sectioned flower.

We identified new marker genes that were spatially co-expressed in regions of known polarity regulators, as exemplified by TT4, which was detected prominently and solely within the adaxial region of cotyledons (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 8). Furthermore, TT4 transcripts were more abundant than those of the canonical adaxial polarity regulators REV and AS2 (Fig. 4a,d), which could be because canonical polarity regulators encode transcription factors that are known to be expressed at lower levels in cells. Despite low detection of canonical polarity regulators in our single-nucleus datasets (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7), we were able to identify nuclei that co-expressed polarity regulators with TT4 (Fig. 4e) and other spatially validated transcripts with polar expression patterns for both abaxial and adaxial defined cells (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 9), in addition to known cell-type markers (Supplementary Fig. 10). These results demonstrate that these new markers with polar expression patterns in cotyledons denote polarity-defined cells (polarity positive), which is supported by the observation that the mutation of individual TRANSPARENT TESTA genes affects the development of specific cell types in seedlings59.

While the polarity-positive nuclei were not restricted to individual clusters (Fig. 4f), we instead found that the expression of canonical and newly identified polarity markers was more defined at the subcluster level (Fig. 4g,h). Together, these results reveal that polar specification demarcates cell subpopulations within individual cell types and may further explain the observed subcluster diversity (Supplementary Fig. 5).

While TT4 exhibited prominent adaxial localized expression in cotyledons of three-day-old seedlings, examining TT4 expression across all organs and developmental stages revealed that TT4 expression was the greatest in several flower clusters (Fig. 4g,h), which prompted us to examine the expression and spatial distribution of TT4 within flowers. Consistent with prior findings, we found that transcripts of canonical polarity markers were spatially restricted to the expected adaxial (REV, yellow) and abaxial (YAB1 (ref. 60), cyan) regions of the carpel (Fig. 4i). Interestingly, in contrast to our findings in cotyledons (Fig. 4a), we found that TT4 transcripts were instead localized to abaxial layers of carpels (Fig. 4i). As TT4 encodes the sole enzyme involved in chalcone synthesis50 upstream of flavonoid biosynthesis, we hypothesized that genes encoding other enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway may also be spatially regulated in flowers. We found that the expression of other flavonoid biosynthesis genes (TT3-7, LEUCOANTHOCYANIDIN DIOXYGENASE (LDOX) / TT18 (AT4G22880) and FLAVONOL SYNTHASE 1 (FLS1; AT5G08640)) was enriched in the same flower cluster (Fig. 4k,l; cluster 10) and spatial regions as that of TT4 (Fig. 4i,j), which suggests that the expression of entire secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways may influence the transcriptional identity of individual cells (Fig. 4k). While we observed the highest expression of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway within flower subclusters, some (but not all) organs were associated with clusters that specifically express flavonoid biosynthesis genes, revealing specific roles of flavonoids in specific organs throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle (Supplementary Fig. 11).

Because flavonoids have diverse roles in several biological processes in various flower tissues61, we questioned whether the flower cluster associated with high expression of flavonoid biosynthesis enzymes, which we consistently observed with altered clustering parameters (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13), may instead represent diverse cell types that all produce flavonoids in contrast to a single cell type. Subclustering of the flavonoid biosynthetic cluster (cluster 10; Fig. 4m) revealed three subcluster populations that were enriched for markers of tapetum62 (subcluster 0, GLYCINE RICH PROTEINS), epidermal63 (subcluster 1, 3-KETOACYL-COA SYNTHASE 10 (KCS10; AT2G26250) and TRANSPARENT TESTA genes) and female gametophyte64 (subcluster 2, ER-TYPE Ca2+-ATPase 1 (ECA1) and ECA1-like gametogenesis family genes) cells (Fig. 4m,n). Together, these results highlight an example of transcriptional complexity driven by the expression of secondary metabolism pathways among several cell types, where cell-type identity is resolved only at the resolution of subclusters.

In the integrated global dataset (Fig. 1f), we identified at least ten clusters that correspond to recurrent cell types, such as vascular (phloem), epidermal (epidermis, guard cells and trichomes) and meristematic (procambium) cell types, that are represented by nuclei from all tissues and developmental time points assayed in which those cell types are present (Supplementary Fig. 14a,b). While these recurrent cell types could be identified by the cluster-specific expression of individual or suites of cell-type markers, we questioned whether heterogeneity within individual cell types may exist at the whole-transcriptome level. We initially focused on phloem companion and guard cells that were identified by the specific expression of the phloem and guard cell marker genes SUC2 (AT1G22710; refs. 41,42) and FAMA (AT3G24140; ref. 65), respectively (Fig. 5a). Independent subclustering of the phloem companion (Fig. 5b) and guard cell populations from the global dataset (Fig. 5c) revealed subcluster complexity within both of these cell types. We observed similar trends within both the phloem companion and guard cell populations, where nuclei from both the seedling and rosette time-series datasets formed individual aggregate clusters (Fig. 5b,c; circled). In contrast, nuclei from other organs, exemplified by silique nuclei, generally clustered separately (Fig. 5b,c), which suggests that organ-specific transcripts contribute to the observed complexity within individual cell types. Examining populations of other recurrent cell types identified from the global dataset (Supplementary Fig. 14a–c) consistently revealed similar trends where silique nuclei clustered separately from those of different organs. From these findings, we hypothesized that the observed heterogeneity within cell types may be due to (1) genes with expression that is restricted to individual organs or developmental time points yet expressed within multiple cell types, or (2) genes with expression under the dual regulation of cell-type and organ or developmental specificity.

The scale bar length is shown. For the micrograph in g, results were observed in one stem.

To investigate this question, we examined the intersection of newly identified markers from the subsets of phloem companion and guard cells. This revealed two classes of marker genes: (1) markers that were shared across cell types within the same tissue, organ or organ system (shared markers; Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 4) and (2) unique cell-type markers that were identified within only phloem companion or guard cell populations of individual sample types (unique; Fig. 5e and Supplementary Table 4). For example, CYTOCHROME P450, FAMILY 709, SUBFAMILY B, POLYPEPTIDE 1 (CYP709B1; AT2G46960) and ARABIDOPSIS NAC DOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN 29 (ANAC029; AT1G69490) were both identified as markers within silique guard cells (Supplementary Fig. 14d, left).

Examining the expression of these silique guard cell markers in the context of whole-plant development, we found that CYP709B1 was restricted to the silique organ but was expressed broadly across cell types (shared marker gene), while ANAC029 expression was unique to silique guard cells within the context of whole-plant development (unique marker gene; Supplementary Fig. 14d, right). Consistent with the broad expression of CYP709B1 across silique cell types, we also identified shared markers of other tissues in the phloem companion and guard cell populations (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 14e). Together, these results demonstrate that transcriptional identities within individual cell types are defined both by the expression of genes shared among cell types within a tissue or organ (for example, flower specific) and by genes under the combined regulation of cell-type and developmental specificity (for example, expression restricted to only one cell type in only one organ, such as silique mesocarp). Extending this cell-type-level analysis to other recurrent cell populations revealed similar results (Supplementary Fig. 14f,g and Supplementary Table 4), demonstrating that this observation was not unique to the cell types of phloem companion and guard cells but is instead widespread across diverse cell types.

To systematically identify organ- and development-specific markers across Arabidopsis development, we compared the pseudobulk expression of marker genes of all 183 major clusters (Supplementary Fig. 15a, calculated from Supplementary Tables 5 and 6; Methods). Of 4,528 genes identified as markers of at least one of the major clusters, 331 (7.3%) genes were uniquely identified as markers within only one dataset (Supplementary Table 4). Consistent with the unique expression patterns in the pseudobulk data, plotting the expression of these markers both in their natively expressed dataset (for example, stem phloem; Fig. 5f,g) and in the globally integrated dataset revealed that the expression of many of these markers (>70%) was restricted to individual clusters and/or subsets of clusters (Supplementary Fig. 15b), demonstrating that our atlas identifies transcripts uniquely expressed in certain cell types or cell states, present only within specific datasets.

We next questioned whether genes with unique expression patterns may have functional relevance within the natively expressed sample type. We evaluated 94 transfer DNA (T-DNA) mutant alleles66 of 46 marker genes uniquely identified or enriched as cluster or subcluster markers within individual datasets (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 15c and Supplementary Table 4). From these mutants, we identified diverse phenotypes for seven genes (15%), including alterations in leaf morphology and physiology, petiole length, bolting time, premature leaf senescence and abnormalities in silique length and morphology (Fig. 5i,j and Supplementary Fig. 15c). Of note, six of the seven genes were not previously associated with phenotypes, demonstrating the capacity to identify new phenotypes in mutants of genes with unique expression patterns. As an example, we focused on mutants of MYO-INOSITOL OXYGENASE 1 (MIOX1; AT1G14520), where we found that high expression of this gene was restricted to the silique dataset and was enriched within individual subclusters of this organ (Fig. 5h). In miox1 mutants, we observed a reduction (~1 mm) in the length of fully elongated siliques (Fig. 5i,j) without observing extraneous phenotypes in other tissues and developmental stages. These results were consistent in several miox1 mutants, suggesting a unique cell-type-specific role of MIOX1 in silique development throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle. Examining the expression of the other MIOX family members revealed similar trends of subcluster-specific expression in siliques for MIOX2 (AT2G19800), MIOX4 (AT4G26260) and MIOX5 (AT5G56640) (Extended Data Fig. 7), although in contrast to MIOX1, the expression of the other MIOX family members was instead restricted to other clusters and cell types in the silique dataset, which may suggest specific yet distinct roles of myo-inositol metabolism enzymes during silique development.

In dicotyledonous plants, the hypocotyl apical hook is a hallmark phenotype of dark-grown (etiolated) seedlings, which is necessary to prevent mechanical damage to the stem cells within the shoot apical meristem as seedlings emerge from soil67. To maintain the apical hook structure (Fig. 6a), it is understood that the opposing activity of the hormones auxin and ethylene causes epidermal and cortex cells to transiently undergo differential rates of cell elongation along the convex–concave axis, but as a ‘standing wave' of growth68, where individual cells transit from the shoot apical meristem, progress through and ultimately exit the apical hook in fewer than 12 hours69 (Fig. 6b). The transient positions of all individual cells as they pass through the apical hook thus represent unique cellular states at the intersection of developmental and hormonal regulation. We therefore sought to use the apical hook as a model to study cellular states.

The scale bar lengths are shown. b, Model of cellular states associated with the development and maintenance of the apical hook.

The scale bar lengths are shown. For the micrographs in a, h and i, results were observed in at least eight seedlings for each genotype.

To provide a foundation for identifying cellular states within the apical hook, we generated paired single-nucleus and MERFISH datasets of dissected shoot apices containing the apical hook from wild-type seedlings, as well as whole seedlings of hookless1 (hls1; AT4G37580), which undergoes normal seedling development but specifically lacks the apical hook structure70 (Fig. 6c). Co-clustering of these datasets revealed that specific clusters (clusters 2, 3, 5 and 6) were overrepresented by nuclei of the Col-0 shoot apex and underrepresented in hls1 seedlings, revealing that these clusters represent cells in the apical hook (Fig. 6d,e).

Re-clustering of the apical hook cells revealed additional clusters that correspond to known cell types in hypocotyls (Fig. 6f). Further investigation of heterogeneity within cell types through subclustering analyses revealed a total of 24 subclusters that may represent distinct cellular states in all cell types present in the apical hook. To focus on cell states that may regulate differential growth programs within the apical hook, we focused on cortex clusters, which represent the most abundant cell type in the apical hook by volume71. Subclustering of cortex cluster 2 revealed five discrete cell populations in this cluster (Fig. 6g), where we identified INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE 32 (IAA32; AT2G01200) as a subcluster marker with known expression in the basal concave region of the apical hook72, which we also confirmed in our spatial datasets (Fig. 6h and Extended Data Fig. 8a). We also identified new markers with spatial expression restricted to cortex cells in convex and concave regions of the apical hook (Fig. 6h), as well as along the apical–basal axis of development (Fig. 6i). Additionally, expression of these markers was absent or reduced in straightened hypocotyls of hls1 (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9), further suggesting a role of cell-state markers in apical hook regulation.

While we were able to identify new markers of apical–basal and convex–concave positioning, we observed varying levels of co-expression of these markers both spatially and at the single-cell level, which suggests further spatial complexity in this tissue structure. This observation is exemplified by the basal apical hook cortex markers IAA32 and DEHYDRATION RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 26 (DREB26; AT1G21910), where we observed that IAA32 expression is uniquely restricted to the basal apical hook, while DREB26 expression is similarly expressed in the basal apical hook but also extends into the basal hypocotyl (Extended Data Fig. 8a). This observation is also reflected in the apical hook single-nucleus dataset, where we observed IAA32 and DREB26 co-expression in the same apical hook cortex cluster (cluster 2; Extended Data Fig. 8b, middle), but IAA32 and DREB26 expression becomes more distinct in apical hook cortex subclusters (Extended Data Fig. 8b, right). Together, these results highlight the fine-tuned spatiotemporal regulation of cortex cell neighbourhoods in the apical hook and suggests that IAA32 and other markers of cellular states in the apical hook may be directly involved in the regulation of differential growth to maintain this structure.

Finally, to understand the combinatorial interaction of cellular states that regulate orthogonal spatial axes aligned with developmental progression (apical–basal) and lateral asymmetry that underlies tissue bending (convex–concave), we examined cells that co-express markers of apical–basal and convex–concave patterning, which represent rare cell neighbourhoods of ten or fewer cells within a whole organism (for example, convex cells of the basal hypocotyl) (Extended Data Fig. 10). Independent analysis of all four cell groups revealed that markers of each of these populations were enriched for distinct and diverse Gene Ontology (GO) terms, many of which are associated with the regulation of growth or development, such as anatomical structure arrangement and pattern specification process, which are associated with apical–convex and apical–concave cell states, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16). Furthermore, several newly identified markers in enriched GO categories for all cellular states analysed have demonstrated function in apical hook regulation. Our comprehensive analysis of cellular states within the apical hook thus revealed diverse cellular states, represented by over 20 subclusters, as well as a role of spatiotemporally regulated cell-state genes, with pinpoint precision of expression, in wild-type growth and development of the apical hook.

In this study, we used single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic technologies to characterize cellular identities along the entire life cycle of the model plant Arabidopsis. As a resource of broad interest, complementary application of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic technologies enabled the annotation of known and new cell types and regions (Figs. 2–4) to diverse organs and tissues, many of which have not been investigated at high resolution or at the single-cell level. Our sampling of diverse organs allowed us to evaluate the transcriptomes of recurrent and unique cell populations across organs and developmental stages at the single-nucleus level, which revealed heterogeneity within individual cell types (Fig. 5). With an easily accessible web application, we believe that our life-cycle atlas will be of wide use to the plant science community and scientists interested in single-cell biology for hypothesis generation and reference for future single-cell genomics studies. The integration of our data with published single-cell protoplast-based datasets (Supplementary Fig. 17) demonstrates that our atlas can function as reference datasets onto which future single-cell omics data can be integrated to further annotate cell types and/or investigate cell-type-specific responses to environmental or chemical stimuli. Furthermore, proof-of-concept analyses demonstrate that spatial single-cell analyses are feasible using our datasets (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19).

Across the ten developmental time points assayed, we identified immense transcriptional diversity represented by 183 major clusters and 655 subclusters. In our datasets, we identified known cell types and, with the aid of our paired spatial transcriptomic datasets, were able to more finely annotate cellular populations that were obscured in our single-nucleus datasets, including individual cell layers within seed sacs (Fig. 3) and polarity-defined cells within cell types (Fig. 4). Our life-cycle atlas also highlights a cellular state defined by the expression of enzymes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway that promotes co-clustering of distinct cell populations (for example, tapetum, epidermis and gametophyte; Fig. 4) at the transcriptome-wide level of single cells. What remains undetermined is the level of influence of other secondary metabolite pathways and their effect on cellular transcriptomes throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle. For each of the 655 individual cell populations, newly identified marker genes may be of use for future characterization of other distinct and potentially new cell populations (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 3).

Comparative analyses of recurrent cell types across organs are a unique aspect of our developmental atlas compared with atlases of individual organs. By examining recurrent cell types, we revealed that the expression of organ-wide transcripts further influences the transcriptional identity of cells (Fig. 5). The expression of transcripts broadly within organ systems may indicate high levels of coordinated activity across cell types of a tissue, as is the case for flavonoid biosynthesis (Fig. 4), and may contribute to further transcriptional complexity within cell types.

Transcripts uniquely expressed in individual cell populations throughout development are of particular interest, as they may reveal unique functions and gene regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, cell types of the reproductive tissues were associated with greater quantities of uniquely expressed transcripts than other tissues, which may be attributed to cell types present only within these tissues. A phenotypic investigation of genes with cell-type and developmental specificity revealed that loss-of-function mutants are associated with diverse phenotypes only within the tissue of native expression context (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 15c). Many of the genes for which we identified new phenotypes are members of multigene families, demonstrating non-redundant functions of individual gene family members within their native expression contexts, as was the case for miox1, where we identified a new shortened silique phenotype (Fig. 5i,j). We found that the expression of the remaining members of the MIOX family (MIOX2, MIOX4 and MIOX5) are all enriched for distinct and separate cell types within siliques (Supplementary Fig. 7), which may suggest broad yet distinct spatially partitioned functional roles of myo-inositol metabolism in silique development. Higher-order mutation of MIOX family members may provide interesting future opportunities to investigate the role of myo-inositol metabolism in silique development in both cell-type-specific and organ-system contexts.

Reproductive organs are associated with the production of diverse and unique secondary metabolites73,74,75, such as flavonoids (Fig. 4), which may also be a basis for the observed unique expression patterns. We found that the expression of enzymes of the full flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was consistently associated with a single cluster in our flower dataset that encompasses epidermal, tapetal and female gametophyte cell types (Fig. 4m,n and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). An undefined alteration of cellular status or state within these cell types may occur upstream of flavonoid biosynthesis, and it will be interesting to investigate potential upstream regulatory programs that define this cellular switch in diverse cell types.

Finally, we demonstrated that the hypocotyl apical hook of Arabidopsis serves as an exemplary model for the investigation of complex, spatiotemporally regulated cellular states due to its intricate cellular composition and dynamic developmental processes. Our analysis uncovered 24 distinct cell-state subclusters in this compact anatomical structure that are associated with the apical hook's characteristic differential growth patterns. In cortex cells, which represent the most abundant cell type in the apical hook, we identified new subcluster-specific marker genes that exhibited precise spatial localization to regions of the apical hook, demonstrating clear transcriptional demarcation along both the apical–basal and convex–concave axes. Importantly, the spatial expression of these marker genes was markedly diminished or completely lost in the hls1 mutant, underscoring their critical roles in hook formation and curvature maintenance.

Further detailed analysis revealed cellular subpopulations co-expressing markers of both axes, such as cells uniquely positioned at intersections of apical–basal and convex–concave developmental gradients. Interestingly, we found that several of the newly identified markers of these cellular neighbourhoods have known functions in apical hook development, demonstrating that the spatiotemporal regulation of cellular states can be functionally relevant to wild-type form and function (Supplementary Fig. 16).

Collectively, our comprehensive analysis demonstrates the intricate cellular architecture and transcriptional specificity throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle. The complementary application of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic methodologies to diverse samples facilitated the annotation of the majority of clusters (138/183; 75%) in our life-cycle atlas. Several of the samples profiled currently lack comprehensively annotated single-cell reference datasets. As in situ spatial transcriptomic methodologies require knowledge of up to thousands of transcripts with distinct expression patterns, our datasets also function as a foundation for future spatial transcriptomics studies. Overall, our atlas highlights the complexity of cell types present throughout an organism's entire life cycle. Moreover, this atlas serves as a foundation for future studies that seek to further characterize specific organs and developmental stages or investigate stress or stimulus-driven responses. Researchers can access the processed datasets for rapid exploration in a web-based interface available at our web portal (http://arabidopsisdevatlas.salk.edu/).

For the imbibed seeds (0 days old), germinating seeds (1.25 days old), light-grown 3-, 6- and 12-day-old seedling developmental time points, and 3-day-old etiolated seedlings, Arabidopsis Col-0 seeds (CS6000) were surface-sterilized via incubation in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, followed by incubation in 50% (v/v) bleach and 0.01% (v/v) TWEEN-20 for 5 min, followed by triplicate washes in double distilled water for 5 min. Seeds of hls1-1 (CS3073) were sterilized identically. Sterilized seeds were placed onto 1 X Linsmaier and Skoog media (1.0 LS salts (Caisson Labs), 0.8% agar (w/v), 1% w/v Suc., pH 5.7) in 120-mm2 petri dishes at a density of 100 seeds per row for the 0-day and 1.25-day samples and 30 seeds per row for the 3-day, 6-day and 12-day samples. The imbibed seeds were stratified via incubation at 4 °C for three days in complete darkness. Following stratification, the plates were placed in a long-day (16 h light/8 h dark) growth chamber at 23 °C. For the Col-0 and hls1 three-day-old etiolated seedlings, the plates were placed in sealed dark chambers and grown in a growth chamber without lights at 23 °C. For the rosette, flower and silique tissues, seeds were sterilized identically to the seed and seedling samples, directly sown onto soil and grown at 23 °C in long-day conditions.

For all samples, at least two replicates, defined as multiple plates for seed and seedling time points or at least half a flat of plants (>18 plants) for later developmental stages, were prepared independently. Nucleus purification buffer (NPB; 20 mM MOPS (pH 7), 40 mM NaCl, 90 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.2 mM spermine, 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail, 2% BSA, 1:1,000 SUPERase IN) was prepared fresh and chilled on ice. All the following procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Tissues were chopped in 500–1,000 µl of cold NPB with a razor blade on ice for 5 min to release nuclei and incubated in 10 ml of NPB. For the 0-day and 1.25-day seed samples, the nuclei were extracted in 5 ml of NPB with a Dounce homogenizer with 20 strokes of the loose pestle followed by 20 strokes of the tight pestle. The crude nucleus extract was sequentially filtered through 70-µm and 30-µm cell strainers. BSA, Triton X-100 and NP40 were added to final concentrations of 2%, 0.05% and 0.05%, respectively, and the extract was incubated at 4 °C for 10 min with rotation. Nuclei were pelleted via centrifugation at 700 g for 5 min with a swing-rotor centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of NPBd (NPB, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.05% NP40, 2% BSA) via pipetting and incubated for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 700 g for 5 min. For seedlings and rosettes, additional washes in NPBd were performed until the pellet became translucent. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of NPB and centrifuged at 50 g for 3 min in a fixed-rotor centrifuge to pellet non-nucleus debris (including pollen grains from flower tissues), and the supernatant was taken. This step was repeated until the supernatant cleared or visible pellet was not observed. For root-containing tissues (seedlings), the nucleus suspension was filtered through Flowmi strainers (40 µm) to remove additional sources of debris. Finally, nuclei were pelleted via centrifugation at 700 g for 10 min with a swing-rotor centrifuge and resuspended in an appropriate volume of NPB. Nuclei were counted manually with a haemocytometer. Nuclei from each replicate were evenly distributed into at least four independent samples, with a targeted recovery of up to 20,000 nuclei per reaction. Each nucleus suspension was loaded into the 10x Genomics Chip M, which was then processed with a 10x Genomics Chromium X controller, and sequencing libraries were constructed following the manufacturer's instructions. Each sequencing library was sequenced with the Illumina NovaSeq 6000.

For the stem sample, three regions of the stem (base, branched area and apex) were harvested separately and multiplexed using the 3′ CellPlex Kit following the manufacturer's specifications (10x Genomics). Briefly, equal quantities of purified nuclei from each sample were individually labelled with separate CellPlex barcodes. Following labelling, the nuclei were pelleted and washed twice with PBS containing 2% BSA with RNase inhibitor. The nuclei were then quantified again using a haemocytometer and were pooled in equal quantities and brought to the appropriate volume for loading into the 10x Genomics Chip M as described previously.

Demultiplexed FASTQ files were used to generate gene-by-cell matrices with Cell Ranger (v.7.0.0)76 and were aligned to the Arabidopsis nuclear transcriptome using the include-introns flag, which was prepared with the TAIR10 genome and Araport 11 transcriptome. Downstream analyses were performed with the R (v.4.1.3)77 package Seurat (v.4.1.0)78. Low-quality and potential doublet nuclei were removed from the datasets. Nuclei that did not meet a cut-off of >300 and <7,000 genes detected, >400 UMI per nucleus, <5% mitochondrial or <15% chloroplast reads were removed.

For the analysis of single-tissue datasets, after filtering, 2,000 integration features for the aggregated datasets were determined for data scaling and dimensionality reduction using the SelectIntegrationFeatures function. Each of the datasets was then integrated using the IntegrateData function with 20 principal components (PCs). Following integration of each dataset, the entire dataset was scaled and dimensionality reduction was performed with PC analysis (PCA) followed by UMAP using 30 PCs. Identification of nearest neighbours and clustering were then performed using the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions, respectively. Cluster markers were then identified for each cluster using the FindAllMarkers function with logfc.theshold = 0.25 and min.pct = 0.1. For iterative subclustering, each individual cluster was subset and re-normalized, 2,000 variable features were identified, the data were scaled, dimensions were reduced via PCA and UMAP using 30 PCs, and neighbours and clusters were identified.

For the globally integrated dataset, all of the individual stringently filtered datasets were merged, and the data were normalized. Following the guidelines of refs. 79,80, 4,000 variable features were identified and used for PCA, and pre-clustering was performed with Harmony (v.0.1.0)81 using 50 PCs. t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding was then performed according to ref. 82 using the harmony embeddings with the perplexity value equal to the number of nuclei in the dataset divided by 100 and the learning rate equal to the number of nuclei divided by 12.

For cell annotation, we used marker genes identified in previous studies using promoters and GUS/GFP fusions, in situ hybridization assays, bulk RNA-seq studies of dissected tissues and single-cell atlases of roots, shoot apical meristem, young leaves and inflorescence stems (Supplementary Table 1). For newly identified marker genes of each cluster, the numbers of curated cell-type markers were divided by the number of cluster marker genes to calculate the cell-type enrichment score. We also explored the expression of top cluster markers in databases such as TAIR (www.arabidopsis.org) and ePlant (bar.utoronto.ca/eplant/). Finally, we used spatial transcriptomics generated during this study for seeds, seedlings, stems, flowers and siliques to validate cell identities and uncover identities of unannotated clusters. For annotating silique major clusters, a curated list of marker genes was used35.

To integrate our 21-day-old and 30-day-old rosette single-nucleus datasets with a published leaf protoplast dataset19, each dataset was individually loaded, normalized and scaled using SCTransform83, and 30 PCs were used for dimensionality reduction. Integration anchors were calculated using the FindTransferAnchors function using the protoplast dataset as the reference dataset. Cell-type label transfer, low-dimensional embedding correction and dataset projection of the nucleus datasets were performed using the MapQuery function.

To integrate the seedling and rosette time-series datasets, each dataset was pre-processed as described previously, and each dataset within the developmental time series was merged. For each merged dataset, PCs were calculated, and Harmony (v.0.1.0)81 was used to integrate the datasets regressing variables of dataset input and percentage of mitochondrial and chloroplastic reads, rounded to the nearest integer. Dimensionality reduction, nearest neighbour identification and clustering were then performed using 20 harmony dimensions. Identification of cluster markers was performed as described previously for individual datasets.

First, we identified marker genes for individual clusters of each tissue type (that is, for 183 clusters) using the FindAllMarkers function of Seurat (adjusted P < 0.0005, average log2(fold change) > 2). We then checked whether these cluster marker genes are highly expressed in other organs using pseudobulk expression data of each cluster. A marker gene candidate was removed when (1) its normalized expression level in the target cluster was not more than fourfold higher than that in any other clusters in the other organs or (2) the log2 TPM value of the gene was higher than five in any clusters in the other organs. In this way, we removed genes that are cell-type-specific in a particular organ but are also expressed in other organs. In this analysis, we defined organs in the following way: imbibed and germinating seeds (0 days and 1.25 days), seedlings (3 days, 6 days and 12 days), rosettes (21 days and 30 days), stems, flowers and siliques.

Clusters identified from the global dataset that were well represented by several datasets were selected and individually subset. Re-clustering was performed as described previously. For cross-tissue comparisons of datasets, the tissue dataset that comprised the majority population of each subcluster was specified as the organ identity for each subcluster. Systematic identification of subcluster markers was performed, and unique and overlapping sets of subcluster marker genes were visualized using ComplexUpset (v.1.3.3)84. Intersections of subcluster groups with fewer than ten shared subcluster markers were filtered for visualization.

GO term enrichment of cluster and subcluster markers was performed with ClusterProfiler (v.4.2.2)85 using the enrichGO function, and P values were adjusted via the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.

A list of marker genes of silique major clusters and subclusters were filtered using the following criteria: (1) more than 25 specific probes could be designed on the basis of Vizgen's software, and (2) the TPM value was below 1,000 in the silique pseudobulk RNA-seq data (obtained by aggregating all the silique cells). After the filtering, 140 genes representing most major clusters and selected subclusters were chosen from the remaining marker genes. The panel design was balanced so that the total TPM value of 140 transcripts was below 11,000 to avoid overcrowding of signal.

A list of marker genes of three-day-old seedling shoot apex major clusters and subclusters was filtered using the following criteria: (1) more than 25 specific probes could be designed on the basis of Vizgen's software, and (2) the TPM value was below 1,000 in the three-day-old seedling pseudobulk RNA-seq data86. After filtering, 600 genes representing most major clusters and subclusters were selected in addition to 400 transcription factors with expression that was specific to clusters and/or subclusters in the three-day-old seedling dataset. The panel design was balanced so that the total TPM value of 1,000 transcripts was below 15,000 to avoid overcrowding of signal.

Plants were grown according to the previously described methods. Tissues of three-day-old etiolated seedlings, the stem apex, mature unpollinated flowers and fully elongated siliques matching the aforementioned developmental stages were excised and immediately incubated in OCT (Fisher) for 5 min to acclimate the tissue. Following incubation, the tissue was placed into cryomolds (Sakura), which were filled with OCT and immediately frozen in an isopentane bath cooled by liquid N2. Tissue blocks were acclimated to −18 °C in a pre-cooled cryostat chamber (Leica) for 1 h. The tissue blocks were trimmed until the tissue was entered, after which 10-µm sections were visually inspected until the region of interest was exposed. Sample mounting and preparation were performed according to the MERSCOPE user guide, with slight modifications. Briefly, a 10-µm section was melted and mounted onto a room-temperature MERSCOPE slide (Vizgen, 20400001), placed into a 60-mm petri dish and re-frozen via incubation in the cryostat chamber for 5 min. Subsequent steps were performed with the mounted samples in the petri dish. The samples were then baked at 37 °C for 5 min and incubated in fixation buffer (1× PBS, 4% formaldehyde) for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were then washed with 1× PBS containing 1:500 RNAse inhibitor (Protector RNAse Inhibitor, Millipore Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature in triplicate. Following the final PBS wash, the samples were dehydrated via incubation in 70% EtOH at 4 °C overnight.

Tissue sections were processed following Vizgen's protocol. After the 70% ethanol was removed, the sample was incubated in the Sample Prep Wash Buffer (PN20300001) for 1 min and then incubated in the Formamide Wash Buffer (PN20300002) at 37 °C for 30 min. After the Formamide Wash Buffer was removed, the sample was incubated in MERSCOPE Gene Panel Mix at 37 °C for 42 h. The 1,000-target panel was used for the three-day-old etiolated seedling (Col and hls1), stem apex and flower (cross section) samples, while the silique panel was used for the flower (longitudinal) and silique samples. After the probe hybridization, the sample was washed twice with the Formamide Wash Buffer at 47 °C for 30 min and once with the Sample Prep Wash Buffer at room temperature for 2 min. After the washing, the sample was embedded in hydrogel by incubating it in the Gel Embedding Solution (Gel Embedding Premix (PN20300004), 10% w/v ammonium persulfate solution and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine) at room temperature for 1.5 h. The sample was then cleared by first incubating it in the Digestion Mix (Digestion Premix (PN 20300005) and 1:40 RNase inhibitor) at room temperature for 2 h, followed by the incubation in the Clearing Solution (Clearing Premix (PN 20300003) and Proteinase K) at 47 °C for 24 h and then at 37°C for 24 h. The cleared sample was washed twice with the Sample Prep Wash Buffer and stained with DAPI and PolyT Staining Reagent at room temperature for 15 min and then washed with the Formamide Wash Buffer at room temperature for 10 min and rinsed with the Sample Prep Wash Buffer. The sample was imaged with the MERSCOPE Instrument, and detected transcripts were decoded on the MERSCOPE Instrument using a Codebook generated by Vizgen. Transcripts were visualized on Vizgen's Vizualizer.

Germinating seeds (1.25 days) were grown as previously described and were subsequently submerged in OCT in a cryomold (Sakura) and flash-frozen in a liquid N2 cooled isopentane bath. Cryosectioning of the 1.25-day-old germinating seeds was performed as described above. Following sectioning, the frozen section was arranged onto the centre of the Curio Seeker Spatial Mapping Kit (Curio Bioscience) and gently melted and stored at −80 °C until further processing according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, the frozen tile was gently thawed to room temperature and submerged in Hybridization Reaction Mix for 15 min, followed by sequential transfers to wash buffer and RT Reaction Mix at room temperature. Reverse transcription was performed via incubation at 52 °C for 30 min followed by tissue digestion with the addition of Tissue Clearing Reaction Mix and incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Following tissue digestion, the beads were dissociated from the tile by the addition of Bead Wash Buffer and pipetting. The released beads were transferred to a new tube, pelleted via centrifugation and washed twice in Bead Wash Buffer. Following the second wash, the beads were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and then pelleted and immediately resuspended Second Strand Mix and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Following incubation, Bead Wash Buffer was added, and the beads were washed three times with Bead Wash Buffer. After the third wash, the beads were resuspended in and amplified in cDNA Amplification Mix via PCR. The amplified cDNA was then purified and quantified, followed by tagmentation and clean-up. The libraries were then sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000.

Spot demultiplexing was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications using the Seeker Bioinformatic Pipeline (Curio Bioscience). The resulting spot-by-gene matrix was used for downstream analysis with Seurat (v.4.1.0). Empty and low-quality spots with fewer than 125 genes detected or 125 UMIs were removed. The filtered dataset was normalized with SCTransform with the variable features calculated with a residual variance cut-off of 1. Spatially aware clustering was performed on a SpatialExperiment (v.1.12.0) object using Banksy (v.0.99.7)87 with the parameters lambda = 0.2 and k_geom = 10, and the resulting matrix was used for PCA followed by UMAP dimensionality reduction with 20 PCs, followed by nearest neighbour identification and clustering. Identification of cluster markers was performed as described previously.

Cell segmentation was performed using Baysor88 (v.0.7.1) on the processed transcript coordinate matrix with the following parameters: s, 6; x, global_x; y, global_y; g, gene; m, 20; p; n-clusters, 10; scale-std, 90%; count-matrix-format, ‘tsv'.

Cell segmentation boundaries, centroids, molecule positions and cell-by-gene count matrices were analysed with Seurat v.5.2.1. All datasets were analysed individually and were normalized with SCTransform for all targets detected in each spatial dataset with the parameter clip.range = c(−10, 10). PCs were calculated and used for UMAP dimensionality reduction with 30 PCs, followed by nearest neighbour identification and clustering. Identification of cluster markers was performed as described previously.

Plants were grown as previously described until all flowers had dehisced. All fully elongated siliques from the primary stem (n > 9) were harvested from all individual plants. The length of the silique was measured using digital calipers from the tip to the base of the silique and was rounded to the nearest 0.1 mm. For Col-0 and the miox1-1 mutant, siliques from a total of eight individuals across three biological replicates were measured. For the miox1-2 and miox1-3 mutants, silique measurements were taken from two individuals from two biological replicates. For the statistical analysis, an unpaired Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed for each miox1 mutant compared with Col-0, and the figures were generated using ggplot2 (v.3.3.6)89 and ggpubr (v.0.6.0)90.

For the spatial transcriptomic experiments, similar results were observed across individual samples and across independent experiments. For the germinating seed dataset, n > 10 independent seeds were profiled simultaneously in one experiment. For the Col-0 seedling dataset, n = 8 independent seedlings were simultaneously profiled in one experiment. Technical replication of adjacent tissue sections was performed for the same seedlings. Identical sampling of n = 8 independent seedlings was performed for the hls1 seedling dataset. For the stem dataset, n = 1 stem was profiled. For the flower dataset, n = 3 independent flowers were profiled (n = 2 in transverse orientation, n = 1 in longitudinal orientation) across two experiments. For the silique dataset, n = 3 independent siliques were profiled in one experiment.

Understanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.

Investigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases1,2. We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level1,10. Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain1,11, to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction12,13,14,15. Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.

We first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus—a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging11,13—using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN+ nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).

A z-score was calculated for each behavioral test, and the average z-score across behavioral tests was used as a readout for overall cognitive performance (N = 15 young (3 months) and N = 11 aged (20 months) mice).

Source data

To gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain sufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons16 (Fig. 1d).

Comparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1)17,18,19 (Fig. 1e–g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance (Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.

To assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).

Source data

Having observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).

To begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) states20. Fe2+ and Fe3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.

To examine aging-associated synaptic alterations14, we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity14. Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.

To investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f–i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired, demonstrating no preference (Fig. 2h,i). As a control, we profiled general health using an open-field paradigm and observed no differences in overall activity, total distance traveled or time spent in the center of the open field, indicative of normal motor and anxiety functions (Extended Data Fig. 3d–f). Our functional data indicate that mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 negatively regulates synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory.

To begin to investigate the converse effect of abrogating neuronal Ftl1, we used a complementary viral-mediated RNA interference in vitro approach. Primary neurons were infected with lentivirus encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting Ftl1 (sh-Ftl1) or luciferase control (sh-Luc) (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Decreased neuronal FTL1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c) resulted in an increase in total neurite length as well as in dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons by immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 3a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under RNA interference conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e).

Neurons were infected at DIV8 and analyzed at DIV18. Five images per coverslip were taken, and 5–9 neurons were analyzed per coverslip, with the average per coverslip serving as a replicate (N = 5 control and N = 5 Ftl1 KD replicates per group) (total length P = 0.0182; total intersections P = 0.0004; intersections versus distance P < 0.0001). b, Schematic of hippocampal stereotaxic injections of aged (18 months) mice after viral-mediated knockdown of Ftl1 (Ftl1 KD) or control and representative western blot and quantification of hippocampal FTL1 protein (P = 0.0323). c, Representative images and quantification of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus of mice after viral-mediated Ftl1 knockdown (Ftl1 KD) or control (N = 5 control and N = 4 Ftl1 KD mice per group (SYN P = 0.0132, PSD95 P = 0.1324; excitatory P = 0.0777)). d, Representative images and quantification of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice after viral-mediated Ftl1 knockdown (Ftl1 KD) or control (N = 5 control and N = 4 Ftl1 KD mice per group (SYN P = 0.0257, GEPH P = 0.0031; inhibitory P = 0.2984)). e, Schematic of the timeline of hippocampal stereotaxic injections and cognitive behavioral testing for aged mice after Ftl1 abrogation (Ftl1 KD). f, Object recognition memory assesed by NOR as the discrimination index for the novel object relative to the familiar object (N = 16 control (P = 0.4977) and N = 17 Ftl1 KD (P = 0.0010) aged mice per group). g, Spatial working memory assessed by Y maze as the discrimination index for the novel arm relative to the trained arm (N = 17 control (P = 0.1895) and N = 18 Ftl1 KD (P = 0.0072) aged mice per group). h, Schematic of hippocampal stereotaxic injections of aged Rosa26-loxP-STOP-loxP-Cas9-eGFP transgenic mice after neuronal-specific viral-mediated expression of guide RNAs targeting Ftl1 (Ftl1 cKO) or control and representative western blot and quantification of hippocampal FTL1 protein (N = 5 control and N = 6 Ftl1 cKO mice per group (P = 0.0076)). i, Representative images and quantification of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus of Ftl1 cKO or control mice (N = 6 control and N = 6 Ftl1 cKO mice per group (SYN P = 0.0028, PSD95 P = 0.0140; excitatory P = 0.0773)). j, Representative images and quantification of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of Ftl1 cKO or control mice (N = 5 control and N = 9 Ftl1 cKO mice per group (SYN P = 0.1091, GEPH P = 0.1091, inhibitory P = 0.0472)). k, Schematic of the timeline of hippocampal stereotaxic injections and cognitive behavioral testing for aged Rosa26-loxP-STOP-loxP-Cas9-eGFP transgenic mice with loss of neuronal Ftl1. i, Object recognition memory assesed by NOR as the discrimination index for the novel object relative to the familiar object (N = 17 aged control (P = 0.1423) and N = 9 aged Ftl1 cKO (P = 0.0087) mice per group). j, Spatial working memory assessed by Y maze as the discrimination index for the novel arm relative to the trained arm (N = 21 aged control (P = 0.5796) and N = 14 aged Ftl1 cKO (P = 0.2676) mice per group).

Next, we sought to explore the potential benefit of targeting the age-related increase of FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice. We performed targeted stereotaxic injections of a high-titer virus encoding shRNA sequences targeting either Ftl1 or luciferase control into the CA1 and dentate gyrus hippocampal regions of aged mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Abrogation of FTL1 was validated by western blot (Fig. 3b). We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis, and, in contrast to the effects observed with FTL1 overexpression, targeting Ftl1 led to an increase in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses in the aged hippocampus (Fig. 3c,d). Additionally, we observed an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Functionally, hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 knockdown (Fig. 3e). Consistent with age-related cognitive decline, control aged mice showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, abrogating FTL1 in the aged hippocampus resulted in cognitive improvements (Fig. 3f,g). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 5d–f). These data suggest that targeting hippocampal FTL1 restores known age-related synaptic molecular changes and cognitive function in aged mice.

To determine the effect of selectively targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we generated aged, temporally controlled, neuron-specific conditional Ftl1 genetic knockout mice (FTL1 cKO) using a viral-mediated in vivo CRISPR–Cas9 approach by delivering high-titer lentivirus encoding a synapsin-driven Cre and guide RNA sequences into aged inducible Cas9 transgenic mice (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Decreased FTL1 levels were validated by western blot (Fig. 3h). We observed an increase in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot in the hippocampus of aged FTL1 cKO mice compared to controls (Fig. 3i,j and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged FTL1 cKO mice (Fig. 3k). Consistent with abrogation of hippocampal FTL1, selectively targeting neuronal Ftl1 resulted in cognitive improvements in memory in FTL1 cKO mice compared to control mice (Fig. 3l,m). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 6d–f). These behavioral data indicate that targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age mitigates age-related cognitive impairments.

To identify potential mechanisms underlying the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function, we characterized the transcriptomes of hippocampal neurons from young and aged mice after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression and abrogation, respectively, by neuronal nuclei RNA-seq approaches (Fig. 4a,d). We detected 100 differentially expressed genes in young mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 and 309 differentially expressed genes in aged mice after hippocampal FTL1 knockdown compared to control conditions (Fig. 4b,e and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We performed Gene Ontology analysis and identified changes in energy metabolism pathways and synaptic processes (Fig. 4c,f). To gain further regional and cell-type-specific resolution, we assessed molecular changes elicited by viral-mediated Ftl1 knockout by single-nuclei RNA-seq (Fig. 4g). Cell clusters were identified using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach and projected by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) onto a two-dimensional plot (Fig. 4h). Signatures of each cluster were generated by differential gene expression analysis to compare clusters. Cell types were established based on transcriptomic signatures, and populations were compared across genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 7). We performed bioinformatics analysis on excitatory hippocampal neurons, and Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes between FTL1 cKO and control mice identified predominantly metabolic processes (Fig. 4i). Concordantly, we observed increased expression of genes related to aerobic respiration and proton-driven ATP synthesis in excitatory neurons of FTL1 cKO mice (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d). Next, we analyzed clusters of CA1 pyramidal neurons, CA2/CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cell neurons separately (Fig. 4j–l). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production, oxidative phosphorylation and NADH across hippocampal neuronal cell types (Fig. 4j–l).

Leveraging our transcriptomic analysis, we next surveyed our in vivo neuronal FTL1 overexpression RNA-seq (Fig. 4a), in vivo neuronal Ftl1 RNA interference RNA-seq (Fig. 4d) and in vivo Ftl1 cKO single-nuclei RNA-seq (Fig. 4g) datasets for convergent molecular pathways. Of the genes that are downregulated in the young hippocampus after increased neuronal FTL1 and upregulated in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1, we detected 32 genes that were bidirectionally changed (Fig. 4m and Supplementary Table 6). Gene Ontology analysis of this gene set identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4n), with restored neuronal expression of genes including Sdhb, Atp5o, Atp5c1, Ndufa10 and Atp5j in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1 (Fig. 4o). To corroborate our RNA-seq findings using an orthogonal approach, we measured neuronal ATP production rate by Seahorse assay after viral-mediated overexpression and abrogation of FTL1 in primary neurons. Increasing neuronal FTL1 significantly compromised ATP production (Fig. 4p), whereas abrogation of FTL1 resulted in increased ATP production compared to control conditions (Fig. 4q).

Consequently, we reasoned that boosting metabolic function might counter the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1. To begin to test this possibility, primary neurons were treated with NADH (a coenzyme driving ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation)21,22,23 after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 4r and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Consistent with our previous observation, we detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 4r); however, this decrease was mitigated after NADH treatment (Fig. 4r). No changes in neuronal toxicity were observed (Extended Data Fig. 9b). To investigate the effect of NADH supplementation on cognitive function, young adult mice were administered NADH after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression, and hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed by NOR and Y maze (Fig. 4s). Although young mice with increased neuronal FTL1 expression showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm, these cognitive deficits were mitigated after NADH supplementation (Fig. 4t,u). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 10a–d). These transcriptomics and behavioral data indicate that the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function are mediated, at least in part, through alterations in metabolic processes.

Cumulatively, our study elucidates a previously unrecognized role for neuronal FTL1 in the progression of aging-associated cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice promotes synaptic changes and cognitive impairments indicative of hippocampal aging. Conversely, targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 reverses synaptic changes and restores hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Mechanistically, we implicate changes in metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP production, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 and demonstrate that boosting metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigates these pro-aging effects on cognition. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the molecular underpinnings of cognitive aging and identify neuronal FTL1 as a potential therapeutic target to counter age-related cognitive dysfunction.

FTL1 comprises the light chain of ferritin and is involved in the long-term storage of iron. Disruption in iron metabolism is known to promote mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent alterations in metabolic processes24—a key hallmark of the aging process25,26. Age-related increased levels of neuronal FTL1 detected in the hippocampus are likely reflective of changes in brain iron metabolism during aging. This is congruent with our neuronal RNA-seq analysis pointing to altered metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP synthesis, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function. This link is further bolstered by recent reports that increasing metabolic function by supplementation with NAD+ and its precursors confers cognitive benefits in aged rodents27,28,29, similar to the effects that we observed with NADH in the context of increased neuronal FTL1.

Excess iron and its abnormal redox cycling can also lead to ferroptosis30,31, an iron-dependent programmed cell death pathway observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease32,33. Ferroptosis was previously characterized using Fe2+-specific and Fe3+-specific DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors, triggering an increase in both Fe2+ or Fe3+ as well as a concomitant decrease in the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio20. The observed decrease in the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio resulting from ferroptosis is distinct from the increase observed after neuronal FTL1 overexpression in the hippocampus. These contrasting observations are likely reflective of key differences between normal aging in the absence of gross neuronal death and neurodegenerative disease conditions in which ferroptosis is observed.

Alterations in mitochondria dynamics are likewise widely reported in the brain during aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, with structural effects to the mitochondrial inner membrane disrupting the electron transport system by modifying the available surface area necessary for ATP synthesis to occur34,35. Both bulk neuronal RNA-seq and single-nuclei RNA-seq after overexpression and abrogation of neuronal Ftl1 point toward changes in the electron transport system linked to potential structural modifications in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Indeed, Gene Ontology analysis of bidirectional, differentially expressed genes indicates fluctuations in proton-motive force, implicating changes in electron transport through complexes I, II and IV that are coupled to electrogenic proton ejection across the mitochondrial inner membrane. These transcriptional analyses are further bolstered by in vitro Seahorse analysis, demonstrating altered ATP production after FTL1 manipulation in primary neurons. Collectively, this body of work posits changes in mitochondria dynamics, and structural alterations to the inner membrane, as potential downstream mechanisms regulating the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1.

From a translational perspective, aging is the most dominant risk factor for age-related neurodegenerative disorders2,36,37 such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Of note, mutations in the Ftl1 gene result in neuroferritinopathy—a rare inherited late-onset monogenic neurodegenerative disorder associated with movement disorders, dystonia and cognitive impairments38,39,40. Moreover, longitudinal studies of patients with Alzheimer's disease showed that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively associated with cognitive performance over 7 years and predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease41. Thus, our data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people.

The following mouse lines were used: C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, line 000664), C57BL/6 aged mice (National Institutes of Aging) and B6;129-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(CAG-cas9*,-EGFP)Fezh/J (The Jackson Laboratory, line 024857). All studies were done in young (2–3 months) or aged (18–22 months) male mice that were not involved in any previous procedures. The numbers of mice used to result in statistically significant differences were calculated using standard power calculations with α = 0.05 and a power of 0.8. We used an online tool (https://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html) to calculate power and sample size based on experience with the respective tests, variability of the assays and inter-individual differences within groups. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with humidity maintained at 30–70% and temperature at 68–79 °F (20–26 °C). All animal handling and use were in accordance with institutional guidelines approved by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Mice were anesthetized with 87.5 mg kg−1 ketamine and 12.5 mg kg−1 xylazine and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. Tissues were removed and processed for subsequent analysis. To process the brains, either the hippocampus was subdissected and snap frozen or the whole brain was fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 48 hours before cryoprotection with 30% sucrose.

Hippocampal and cortical neurons were isolated from E17 C57Bl/6J mouse embryos using the papain dissociation system (Worthington, cat. no. LK003153). Cells were plated at 100,000 cells per well on 12-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Carolina, cat. no. 633009) in 24-well plates. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 21103049) supplemented with B-27 (cat. no. 17504044), GlutaMAX (cat. no. 35050061) and penicillin–streptomycin (cat. no. 15140122). Media were partially changed every 4–5 days. On day in vitro 8 (DIV8), neurons were infected with lentivirus at multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1 and processed 10 days later (DIV18) for immunocytochemistry. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 minutes), washed and stained with MAP2 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. M1406, RRID: AB_477171), anti-GFP (Aves Labs, cat. no. GFP-1020) or anti-turboGFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. PA5–22688, RRID: AB_2540616) antibodies to confirm infection, along with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. H3570) for nuclear staining.

Lentiviral constructs for Ftl1 overexpression, knockdown and conditional knockout were generated using standard molecular cloning techniques. For overexpression, murine Ftl1 coding sequence (with partial untranslated regions) was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified from adult mouse hippocampal cDNA and cloned into pENTR-D-TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. K240020), sequence verified and subcloned into a synapsin–IRES–eGFP lentiviral backbone using NheI and EcoRI. The synapsin–IRES–eGFP plasmid alone served as control. For knockdown, shRNAs targeting Ftl1 (SH1–SH4) were cloned into the pGreenPuro system (System Biosciences), with a luciferase-targeting shRNA as control15,42. For CRISPR-based knockout vectors, six gRNAs targeting Ftl1 exons 2–4 were designed using CHOPCHOP43 and cloned into LentiCRISPR v2 (ref. 44). gRNA sequences included CGTATTTGTAACCTCCCGCA and CGCAGACTGGCGCGCCCCAG, among others. A non-targeting gRNA (GGCGAGGGCGATGCCACCTA) served as control. Validated gRNA sequences were subcloned into a Syn1-Cre lentiviral vector (Addgene, no. 68841; ref. 45) using PacI and NheI/XbaI. All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. Lentivirus production followed previously described protocols46. Ftl1 expression changes were confirmed by qRT–PCR and western blot in mouse cells.

HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, cat. no. CRL-11268) were transfected using a 4:3:1-µg ratio of lentiviral construct, psPAX2 (Addgene, no. 12260, gift from D. Trono) and pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene, no. 8454, RRID: Addgene_8454)47. After 48 hours, supernatants were cleared by centrifugation (5 minutes, 1,000g) and filtration (0.45 μm) and then concentrated by ultracentrifugation (24,000 r.p.m, 1.5 hours). Pellets were resuspended in PBS. Primary neurons were infected at MOI = 1. For in vivo injections, viral solutions were diluted to 1.0 × 108 viral particles per milliliter (vp/ml).

For hippocampal synaptic proteins, confocal images were acquired on an LSM 900 microscope (Zeiss) with a ×63 objective as z stacks (16 optical sections, 0.33-µm step size) per sample. Maximum intensity projections were generated for individual puncta analysis. Synapsin (555 nm) and gephyrin or PSD95 (647 nm) were quantified using the Analysis module. For co-localization, z stacks were split into four approximately 1-µm sub-stacks, each projected to two dimensions. Co-localization was assessed using the ZEN Toolkit 3D. For primary cell cultures, confocal z stacks (12 sections, 0.80-µm step) were acquired on an LSM 900 microscope (Zeiss) using a ×20 objective. Neurite length was quantified with NeuronJ (version 1.4.3) and imagescience.jar in FIJI (ImageJ version 1.54f). Sholl analysis was performed using the Simple Neurite Tracer in the Neuroanatomy plugin. Concentric rings (10-µm spacing, up to 300 µm) centered on the soma were used to quantify dendrite complexity by counting neurite intersections, which were summed to calculate total arborization and plotted as a function of distance.

Mitochondrial ATP production was assessed in primary neurons (75,000 cells per well) using the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Cells were plated on Seahorse 24-well plates pre-coated with 50 μl of poly-l-lysine (10 µg ml−1; Millipore, cat. no. A-005-C) after Ftl1 overexpression or knockdown. On the day of the assay, cells were equilibrated for 1 hour in Seahorse assay medium (DMEM supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine; Agilent Technologies). ATP production was measured using sequential injections of 1.5 µM oligomycin and 0.5 µM rotenone/antimycin (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 103592-100).

Procedures were adapted from Lin et al.46. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in oxygen (2 l min−1) and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to prevent corneal drying, and fur over the skull was trimmed. Adeno-associated virus solutions (1.0 × 108 vp/ml) were bilaterally injected into the hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus at the following coordinates (from bregma: AP: −2.0 mm, ML: ±1.5 mm; from skull surface: DV: −1.8 mm and −2.1 mm) using a 5-μl 26s-gauge Hamilton syringe. A volume of 2 μl per site was infused over 10 minutes (0.2 μl min−1). To minimize backflow, the needle was left in place for 8 minutes after injection and then partially retracted and held for another 2 minutes. Incisions were closed with silk sutures and VetBond. Mice received subcutaneous saline, enrofloxacin, carprofen and buprenorphine postoperatively and were monitored during recovery.

Neuronal nuclei were isolated from flash-frozen hippocampi following a modified version of Krishnaswami et al.48. Tissue was homogenized in 750 μl of ice-cold homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 μM DTT, RNase and protease inhibitors) using a dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, cat. no. 357538; 12 loose and 20 tight pestle strokes). Homogenates were passed through a 40-μm filter and centrifuged (500 relative centrifugal force (RCF), 6 minutes, 4 °C) and then washed and pelleted again under the same conditions. Pellets were resuspended in staining buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS) and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-NeuN antibody (Millipore, cat. no. MAB377X, RRID: AB_2149209) was added at 1:250, and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 hour. After two washes in staining buffer, Hoechst 33342 was added (0.01 μg ml−1), and samples were filtered through 35-μm mesh FACS tubes prior to sorting.

Neuronal nuclei were isolated from flash-frozen hippocampi using a modified version of the 10x Genomics protocol. Tissue was homogenized in 500 μl of NP-40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40 substitute, 1 mM DTT and RNase inhibitor) with 20 loose and 25 tight pestle strokes (Wheaton, cat. no. 357538), followed by the addition of another 500 μl of buffer and 7-minute incubation on ice. Homogenates were filtered (40 μm) and centrifuged (500 RCF, 5 minutes, 4 °C) and then washed in PBS with 1% BSA and RNase inhibitor. After another spin, samples were resuspended in 400 μl of wash buffer containing Hoechst 33342 (1:10,000), incubated for 5 minutes on ice, filtered through 35-μm mesh and sorted using a BD FACSAria II.

Nuclei were sorted on a BD FACSAria Fusion with a 70-μm nozzle and a flow rate of 1–2.5 ml min−1. Nuclei were first gated by forward and side scatter and then gated for doublets with height and width. Nuclei that were both Hoechst+ and NeuN+ (neuronal nuclei isolation) or only Hoechst+ (single-nucleus isolation) were sorted into TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, T9424) for RNA analysis.

RNA-seq libraries were generated using a modified Smart-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al.49). After RNA isolation with TRI Reagent, 8 ng of high-quality RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 18064-014) with anchored poly-dT and TSO primers. cDNA was amplified (10 PCR cycles) using KAPA HiFi HotStart polymerase (cat. no. KK2601) and purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A63881). Quality was assessed by Qubit fluorometry. For library construction, 2 ng of cDNA was fragmented (approximately 500 bp) with Nextera Tn5 transposase (Illumina, cat. no. FC-131-1096) and PCR amplified (12 cycles) with indexed Nextera primers (Illumina, cat. no. FC-131-1002). Final libraries were bead purified, analyzed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq (paired-end 2 × 150 bp, SP flow cell).

Reads were aligned to the mm10 mouse transcriptome using STAR version 2.7.3a50 with ENCODE-recommended settings. Gene-level quantification was performed with RSEM version 1.3.1 (ref. 51), and differential expression analysis was carried out in R version 4.0.2 using DESeq2 version 1.28.1 (ref. 52). Full pipeline details (version 2.1.2) are available at https://github.com/emc2cube/Bioinformatics/. Gene Ontology enrichment was performed using Panther.

Nuclei were submitted to the UCSF IHG Genomics Core for processing with the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ kit. Approximately 10,000 nuclei per sample were captured, and cDNA libraries were prepared following manufacturer protocols (10x Genomics). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S2. Base calls were demultiplexed using Cell Ranger version 7.1, and raw FASTQ files were processed to generate expression matrices, including intronic reads. Each sample yielded approximately 13,100–15,950 nuclei, with a mean depth of 27,000 reads per nucleus and approximately 44% sequencing saturation. Data were analyzed in R version 4.2.2. Ambient RNA contamination was removed using SoupX, and samples were integrated with Seurat (2,000 variable genes, 20 dimensions). Nuclei expressing fewer than 300 or more than 5,000 genes, or more than 2% mitochondrial transcripts, were excluded. Genes detected in fewer than three nuclei were filtered out. Doublets and technical artifacts were removed, and expression was log normalized. Dimensionality reduction was performed using PCA, and clustering was conducted with the Louvain algorithm on the first 20 principal components. UMAP was applied for two-dimensional visualization. Differential expression was calculated using Seurat (min.pct = 0.05, log fold change > 0.15, pseudocount = 0.1). Genes inconsistent across replicates were excluded. Visualizations included violin plots, UMAPs and heatmaps from average expression matrices. Volcano plots were generated using EnhancedVolcano.

To obtain sufficient synaptosomes for proteomic analysis, hippocampus and cortex from multiple mice were pooled. Synaptosomes were isolated following a modified protocol from Trinidad et al.53. Tissue was homogenized in sucrose buffer with phosphatase inhibitors (Na3VO4, NaF, Na2MoO4, sodium tartrate, fenvalerate and okadaic acid) and PUGNAc, followed by differential centrifugation. Synaptic membranes were collected at the 1.0–1.2 M sucrose interface and pelleted. Frozen pellets were resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, phosphatase inhibitor cocktails II/III and PUGNAc. Protein concentration was measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each sample (1.5 mg) was reduced with 2.5 mM TCEP at 56 °C for 1 hour, alkylated with 5 mM iodoacetamide (45 minutes, room temperature, dark), diluted to 1 M guanidine and digested overnight at 37 °C with sequencing-grade trypsin (1:50 enzyme:substrate). Peptides were acidified with formic acid, desalted (C18 Sep-Pak) and dried by SpeedVac. Tryptic peptides were labeled with TMT-6plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol: TMT126–131 for three young and three aged samples. Labeling efficiency was confirmed on a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap. Labeled peptides were quenched with 5% hydroxylamine, pooled, desalted and dried. Peptides were separated using high-pH reverse-phase chromatography on a Gemini 5-μm C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm; Phenomenex). A 9–49% acetonitrile gradient in 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) was run over 20 ml at 550 μl min−1, collecting 60 fractions. Fractions were combined (two per sample) into 12 final samples and dried for downstream analysis.

Tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a NanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were separated on a 50-cm × 75-μm ID, 2-μm C18 EASY-Spray column using a linear gradient from 3.5% to 30% solvent B over 185 minutes. MS1 scans were acquired from 375 m/z to 1,500 m/z at 120,000 resolution (AGC target: 4.0 × 105). Ions with charge states 2–7 were selected using a 1.0-m/z window, with dynamic exclusion (30 seconds) and MIPS filtering enabled. Higher-energy collisional dissociation MS2 spectra were acquired using stepped collision energies (30%/35%/40%) and detected in the Orbitrap at 30,000 resolution (AGC: 5.0 × 104; maximum injection time: 100 ms). The scan cycle was set to 3 seconds. Peaklists were generated using Proteome Discoverer version 2.2 and searched against the SwissProt Mus musculus database (downloaded 6 September 2016, with decoy sequences) using Protein Prospector version 5.21.1. Searches assumed trypsin specificity with up to two missed cleavages. Fixed modifications included carbamidomethylation (Cys) and TMT-6plex labels (Lys and N termini); variable modifications included N-terminal acetylation, oxidation (Met), pyro-glutamate formation (Gln) and N-terminal Met loss (with or without acetylation). A maximum of two variable modifications per peptide was allowed. Identifications were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate at both peptide and protein levels.

Data were filtered to only include peptides unique to a single protein. Quantitation of TMT data was performed by calculating ratios of reporter ion peak intensities between conditions along with variance for each ratio and median normalized. Protein abundances were normalized by the median of ratio distributions. The age-dependent changes were determined using a normalized median log2 Aged/Young ratio of at least 1.0, corresponding to a 2.0 fold change with age and a −log10 P value greater than 1.3.

To quantify mRNA expression levels, equal amounts of cDNA were synthesized using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4368813) and then mixed with SYBR Fast mix (Kapa Biosystems) and primers. β-actin was amplified as an internal control. RT–qPCR was performed in the CFX384 Real Time System (Bio-Rad). Each sample and primer set was run in triplicate, and relative expression levels were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method.

Western blotting was performed on both mouse hippocampal tissue and primary hippocampal neurons. For tissue studies, hippocampi were dissected, flash frozen and pulverized prior to lysis in RIPA buffer (Abcam, ab156034) with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 4693116001). Lysates were mixed with 4× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, NP0008), resolved by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab8245, 1:5,000), β-tubulin (Covance, MMS-435P, 1:1,000), NR2A (Sigma-Aldrich, 07-632, 1:1,000), synapsin (Abcam, ab18814, 1:1,000) and AMPA receptor (Abcam, ab109450, 1:3,000). HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A15999, 1:2,000) and anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare, NA934V, 1:2,000) secondaries were used for detection with ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). Signals were imaged with a ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad) and quantified in FIJI/ImageJ (version 2.0.0).

For cell-based experiments, primary neurons were cultured from E17 mouse embryos, treated as indicated, lysed under the same conditions and processed in parallel. Quantification was normalized to loading controls (GAPDH, β-tubulin or β-actin) and to the control group. Each tissue datapoint represents an individual animal; each cell culture datapoint represents a biological replicate. Statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests.

Iron imaging was performed using a modified protocol from Wu et al.20. Mouse brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (24 hours, 4 °C), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (3 days) and sectioned coronally at 30-μm thickness using a cryostat. Slices were stored at −20 °C in cryoprotectant. For each group, three sections from six mice per cohort were stained with technical replicates. Sections were rinsed in TBS (3×, 5 minutes), blocked in 2% BSA and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-GFP antibody (Aves Labs, cat. no. GFP-1020, 1:250). After washing, samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-chicken secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 703-545-155, 1:250) for 2 hours at room temperature. Excess antibodies were removed with TBS washes. To detect Fe2+ and Fe3+ simultaneously, DNAzyme-based sensors were used. Active and inactive enzyme (E/iE) strands (2 μM) and substrate strands (2.2 μM) were annealed in Bis-Tris buffer (5 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6), 40 mM sodium acetate, 200 mM NaCl) by heating to 95 °C and cooling to room temperature. Fe(II)-H5 and Fe(III)-B12 sensors were combined 1:1 with Hoechst. Brain slices were rinsed in Bis-Tris-acetate buffer, incubated in the sensor mix for 30 minutes and then washed and treated with 0.5× TrueBlack Lipofuscin Quencher (Biotium, PSF006) in 70% ethanol for 30 seconds. Slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) and imaged using a Nikon spinning disk or Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a ×20 objective. Channels used included 405 nm (Hoechst), 488 nm (GFP), 546 nm (Fe2+) and 647 nm (Fe3+). z stacks (four steps, 5-μm intervals) covering the hippocampus were acquired via tiled scan. Images were analyzed in ImageJ; maximum intensity projections were used. Background correction was done by subtracting the average signal from inactive sensor (iErS) controls in the same region (CA1, CA2/CA3 or dentate gyrus).

Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from 16–18-week-old male mice, 1 month after stereotaxic injection of Ftl1-overexpressing (Ftl1 OE) or control virus. All procedures were approved by the IACUC of AfaSci (protocol no. 0223). Mice (28–42 g) were deeply anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. Brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; continuously bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2). ACSF composition (in mM) was as follows: 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3 and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared using a tissue slicer (Stoelting) and recovered for ≥1 hour at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF prior to recording. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in submerged slices perfused with oxygenated ACSF (flow rate: 1.75 ml min−1; DynaMAX pump) at room temperature. Glass microelectrodes (1–3 MΩ, ACSF-filled) were positioned in the stratum radiatum of CA1 to record responses evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals via a concentric bipolar electrode (FHC, Inc.), placed approximately 100 μm apart. Stimuli were 0.2-ms biphasic pulses (0.4-ms total duration) delivered every 10 seconds. Input/output (I–O) curves were generated using 23 increasing current steps (20-µA increments) from threshold (20–100 µA). Test pulse intensity was set to 30–50% of the maximal response. LTP was induced using two trains of 100-Hz stimulation (100 pulses, 1-second duration, 5 seconds apart). fEPSP slope was measured from the initial negative phase using Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices). Data points represent the average of three consecutive sweeps. Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated using a 50-ms interpulse interval as the ratio of the second to the first EPSP. Traces were low-pass filtered with a Gaussian filter (−3-dB cutoff: 1,260 Hz). Representative LTP traces are averages of six consecutive responses (1 minute, unfiltered). Recordings were completed within 8 hours of dissection. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.4, Excel and StatView 5.0. LTP was expressed as percent of baseline; the final 5 minutes were averaged for group comparisons. Results are shown as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.

Mice were placed in the center of an open 40-cm × 40-cm square chamber (Kinder Scientific) with no cues or stimuli and allowed to move freely for 10 minutes. Infrared photobeam breaks were recorded and movement metrics were analyzed by Motor Monitor software (Kinder Scientific).

The NOR task was performed following White et al.54. Mice were habituated to an empty arena for 10 minutes (day 1) and then allowed to explore two identical objects for 5 minutes (day 2). On day 3, one object was replaced with a novel one, and exploration time over 5 minutes was recorded using Smart Video Tracking Software (Panlab, Harvard Apparatus). To control for object and spatial bias, object identity and novel object location were counterbalanced across animals. Objects were selected to elicit exploration regardless of genotype or age. The preference index was calculated as follows: (Time_novel / (Time_novel + Time_familiar)) × 100, where 100% indicates full novel object preference. Mice failing to explore both objects during training were excluded.

Spatial recognition was evaluated in a Y maze as described previously. During training, mice explored the start and trained arms for 5 minutes, with the third (novel) arm blocked. Maze arms were alternated and cleaned between trials. After a 45-minute delay, mice were reintroduced and allowed to explore all three arms for 5 minutes. Entries and time in each arm were tracked (Smart Video Tracking Software). Percent arm entries were computed from the first minute of exploration. The discrimination index was calculated as follows: (Time_novel − Time_trained) / (Time_novel + Time_trained). Mice making fewer than three entries in the first minute were excluded.

Spatial learning and memory was tested using an eight-arm radial arm water maze (RAWM) protocol55. Mice were trained to locate a constant goal arm, with the start arm varied between trials. Each incorrect entry was scored as an error. On day 1, mice underwent 12 training trials (blocks 1–4; alternating visible/hidden platforms), followed by three hidden-platform trials after a 1-hour break (block 5). On day 2, animals completed 15 hidden-platform trials (blocks 6–10). Errors were averaged per three-trial block. Experimenters were blinded to treatment and genotype during scoring.

NADH (300 mg kg−1; Roche, cat. no. 10128023001) as well as vehicle (sodium chloride solution, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. S8776) were administrated intraperitoneally with an injection volume of 200 µl per mouse. All animals were treated with vehicle or NADH once daily for 9 days and for 2 hours pretrial.

NADH (200 uM; Roche, cat. no. 10128023001) as well as vehicle (sodium chloride solution, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. S8776) were administrated for five consecutive days starting DIV14 until DIV18 included.

All experiments were randomized and blinded by an independent researcher. Researchers remained blinded throughout histological, biochemical and behavioral assessments. Groups were unblinded at the end of each experiment on statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. The distribution of data in each set of experiments was tested for normality using the D'Agostino–Pearson omnibus test or the Shapiro–Wilk test. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0, version 9.0 or version 10 (GraphPad Software). Means between two groups were compared using two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests. Additional statistical details are indicated in the respective figure legends. All data generated or analyzed in this study are included in this article. The main experimental findings are representative of two independently performed experiments. All replication attempts were successful. RNA-seq and proteomics data were not replicated due to resource limitations but were orthogonally validated.

Experimental replication was not attempted for negative data.

Dual agonists targeting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) are breakthrough treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Compared to GLP1R agonists, dual agonists show superior efficacy for glucose lowering and weight reduction. However, delineation of dual agonist cell targets remains challenging. Here, we develop and test daLUXendin and daLUXendin+, non-lipidated and lipidated fluorescent GLP1R/GIPR dual agonist probes, and use them to visualize cellular targets. daLUXendins are potent GLP1R/GIPR dual agonists that advantageously show less functional selectivity for mouse GLP1R over mouse GIPR. daLUXendins label rodent and human pancreatic islet cells, with a signal intensity of β cells > α cells = δ cells. Systemic administration of daLUXendin strongly labels GLP1R+ and GIPR+ neurons in circumventricular organs characterized by an incomplete blood–brain barrier but does not penetrate the brain beyond labelling seen with single (ant)agonists. At the single-molecule level, daLUXendin targets endogenous GLP1R–GIPR nanodomains, which differ in organization and composition from those targeted by a single agonist. daLUXendins reveal dual agonist targets in the pancreas and brain and exclude a role for brain penetration in determining the superior efficacy of dual agonists, shedding new light on different modes of action of dual agonists versus single agonists.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) potently amplify insulin secretion and influence satiety to reduce food intake1,2,3. Stabilized GLP1R agonists were approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2008 (ref. 4) and at higher doses for overweight and obesity in 2017 and 2018 (ref. 5). Less attention has been paid to the GIP axis, as multiple studies showed that either genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of GIPR protects against body weight gain6, and that GIPR agonism has minimal effects on glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes7, potentially owing to GIPR downregulation8. However, dual agonists such as tirzepatide combine elements of GLP1R and GIPR agonism, such that the full benefits of both hormone axes are realized9.

Although the pharmacological mechanisms underlying dual GLP1R/GIPR agonist efficacy are well established10,11,12, less is known about the cellular substrates that underlie actions on pancreatic hormone secretion as well as food intake. GLP1R and GIPR are low-abundance cell surface proteins, and their instability in solution makes it difficult to raise antibodies against specific epitopes, rendering their immunohistochemical visualization challenging13. Specific antibodies exist for GLP1R, but no reliable commercial antibody exists yet for the detection of GIPR in primary cells and tissues13. Compared to antibodies, GLP1R-Cre and GIPR-Cre reporter mice are sensitive, but only identify cells that express(ed) GLP1R/GIPR transcripts14,15. Finally, animals harbouring a self-labelling enzyme on the GLP1R amino terminus allow facile visualization using a range of fluorophores, although this model is restricted to rodents16. No approach to date provides information on GLP1Rs and GIPRs specifically accessed or bound by a dual agonist.

To circumvent these issues, we previously developed LUXendins and sGIPs17,18,19, which are specific probes against GLP1R and GIPR, respectively. Using these probes, we confirmed that GLP1R is largely a β cell-specific protein marker18,20, whereas GIPR is expressed in both β cells and α cells within the islet17. However, we were unable to make any inferences about dual agonist binding sites within the islet and brain, as GLP1R and GIPR probes might target different receptor (sub)populations. Dual agonism might also influence GIPR/GLP1R localization, expression and access through effects in addition to those mediated by GLP1R and/or GIPR (ant)agonism alone; for example, release of paracrine mediators and functional selectivity21,22,23. Although fluorescent tirzepatide has been reported12, the probe was not pharmacologically validated for its specificity at GLP1R/GIPR.

Structure–activity relationships and cryo-electron microscopy show that the binding affinity and efficacy of GLP1R agonists, GIPR agonists and dual agonists are determined by amino acids closer to the N-terminus24,25,26,27. We thus reasoned that carboxy-terminal functionalization with a fluorophore would be well tolerated, especially because this end is not commonly resolved in structural interpretations. Given that tirzepatide possesses a C-terminal serine, we decided to generate an S39C mutant, allowing the late-stage addition of a fluorophore (Fig. 1a,b). daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 were obtained using cysteine-maleimide ‘click' chemistry to install Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores, respectively, in yields of ~50%. iso-butyric amino acid was incorporated into the structure instead of alanine at position two to confer degradation resistance against DPP-IV28 (Fig. 1a,b). Spectral properties, compound purity and compound characterization are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 1.

AD293 cells transfected with either human GLP1R (hGLP1R), mouse GLP1R (mGLP1R), human GIPR (hGIPR) or mouse GIPR (mGIPR) were used to determine cAMP signalling potency of daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 versus unmodified (acylated) tirzepatide, GIP and GLP1. At both hGLP1R and mGLP1R, tirzepatide and its fluorescent analogues showed reduced potency compared to GLP1, with the potency rank order favouring daLUXendin660 > tirzepatide > daLUXendin544 (Fig. 1c) (Extended Data Table 1). As previously reported for tirzepatide11, there were species differences for GIPR signalling with each of the dual agonist ligands tested, with all showing a larger loss of potency at the mGIPR than at the hGIPR relative to native hGIP (Fig. 1c) (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Of note, even though daLUXendin544 showed globally reduced potency compared to daLUXendin660, half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) ratios suggested that both ligands show similar GIPR:GLP1R selectivity of ~2:1 (that is, favouring GIPR) for human receptors and ~1:2 (that is, favouring GLP1R) for mouse receptors. By comparison, tirzepatide showed GIPR:GLP1R selectivity of ~3:1 for human receptors and ~1:8 for mouse receptors in our assays.

daLUXendin660 showed nM binding affinity at both hGLP1R and hGIPR, although assessment of the daLUXendin544 dissociation constant (Kd) was precluded by interference with the BRET signal (Fig. 1d,e) (Supplementary Table 2). Competition assays showed that binding affinity (pKi) for hGLP1/hGLP1R and hGIP/hGIPR was similar when using daLUXendin660 as a probe compared to Ex4-Cy5 and GIP-Cy5, further confirming strong receptor binding (Fig. 1f–h) (Supplementary Table 3).

Therefore, based upon cAMP assays and binding affinity, daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 are potent GLP1R/GIPR dual agonists that advantageously show approximately fourfold less selectivity for mouse GLP1R over GIPR compared to tirzepatide.

To establish whether in vitro pharmacology is mirrored by in vivo efficacy, mice were dosed with either tirzepatide or daLUXendin660 at 10 nmol kg−1 to maximally engage mGLP1R and mGIPR11,29. At this dose, daLUXendin660 and tirzepatide both reduced food intake during the dark phase and over a cumulative 24 h period. At 12 h and 24 h post injection, tirzepatide demonstrated ~40% greater efficacy in driving anorexia, presumably because of its acylation and plasma binding (Fig. 1i). Likewise, both tirzepatide and daLUXendin660 exerted substantial glucose-lowering effects in Glp1rWT/WT and Glp1rWT/KO mice, with similar area under the curves (Fig. 1j–l). Both ligands partially maintained their efficacy in Glp1rKO/KO mice, reflecting continued engagement of mGIPR at doses >1–3 nmol kg−1 (Fig. 1j–l). However, Glp1r knockout was less effective in daLUXendin660-treated versus tirzepatide-treated mice, demonstrating increased mGIPR dependence for daLUXendin660, as expected from in vitro functional selectivity data (Fig. 1j–m). Results should, however, be interpreted in light of increased mGIPR sensitivity or expression in Glp1rKO/KO mice11. Together, these data confirm that daLUXendin660 and tirzepatide both lower blood glucose and reduce food intake.

In line with the cAMP results, daLUXendin544 led to concentration-dependent labelling of SNAP-hGIPR:AD293 cells, overlapping with cell-impermeable SBG-Oregon Green (OG) SNAP label (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b)30. The brightest labelling was detected at 50 nM–5 µM, corresponding to the cAMP max (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). The strongest and most specific membrane labelling, without evidence of altered cell morphology (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c), was observed with 500 nM daLUXendin544; hence, this concentration was selected for experiments in cell lines and tissue. No labelling was observed in non-transfected AD293 cells (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Both daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 showed colocalization with cells transfected with SNAP_GIPR and Halo_GLP1R, determined using orthogonal cell-impermeable SNAP (SBG-OG) and Halo (CA-Sulfo549 or CA-Sulfo646) labels31 (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Therefore, daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 are highly specific dual agonist probes suitable for cell labelling.

MIN6-CB4 β cells were labelled with both daLUXendin660 and the specific GLP1R probe LUXendin551 (refs. 18,19). Demonstrating specificity for GLP1R, LUXendin551 signal colocalized with daLUXendin660 (Extended Data Fig. 2a), probably owing to labelling of different GLP1R pools (see below). However, not all daLUXendin660 signal colocalized with LUXendin551, presumably owing to GIPR labelling, as well as increased GLP1R internalization (Extended Data Fig. 2a). To investigate this possibility further, MIN6-CB4 β cells were incubated with daLUXendin660 and the specific GIPR probe sGIP549 (ref. 17) (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Demonstrating specificity for GIPR, sGIP549 signal colocalized with daLUXendin660, whereas not all daLUXendin660 signal colocalized with sGIP549, corresponding to GLP1R labelling (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Therefore, daLUXendin660 labels both endogenous GLP1R and GIPR in MIN6-CB4 β cells.

We next repeated studies in isolated mouse islets. To circumvent competition between the various probes at GLP1R/GIPR, we used GLP1RSNAP/SNAP mice in which a SNAP-tag enzyme self-label is knocked into the extracellular domain of the endogenous GLP1R16, allowing GLP1R to be visualized without influencing orthosteric binding. Using this model, colocalization could be detected between the cell-impermeable SNAP label BG-Sulfo646 and daLUXendin544 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). We noticed that daLUXendin544 retained significant levels of GLP1R at the cell surface, as shown by the full width at half maximum (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). By contrast, daLUXendin544 did not exhibit any detectable membrane labelling in α cells, presumably because they express little to no GLP1R transcript or protein (also used to identify α cells versus β cells) (Extended Data Fig. 2f,h)15,18,20, so α cell labelling is largely by GIPR. Using the GIPR probe sGIP648, daLUXendin544 was found to strongly label GIPR in mouse islets (Extended Data Fig. 2g,h), also apparent from studies with the GLP1R probes and GLP1R SNAP labels. Lastly, daLUXendin544 labelling was reduced ~50% in GLP1RKO/KO islets, with a further reduction in labelling seen in the presence of a saturating concentration of GIPAib2 (1 µM) (Extended Data Fig. 2i,j).

To allow post hoc protein labelling and identification of cell types in complex tissue, we optimized a fixation protocol that retained strong and specific daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 labelling post-fixation with either 2% or 4% formalin for 15 min (Fig. 2a). Islets were labelled with daLUXendin544 before formalin-fixation, and immunostaining with antibodies against either insulin, glucagon or somatostatin to identify β cells, α cells or δ cells, respectively. As expected, given their abundant GLP1R and GIPR expression, β cells were strongly labelled with daLUXendin544 (Fig. 2b). Confirming results in live islets, α cells showed weaker but detectable daLUXendin544 labelling restricted to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2c), probably reflecting their abundant GIPR expression and largely absent GLP1R protein expression17,18,20. δ cells also showed weaker labelling versus β cells (Fig. 2d). However, labelling was observed both in the cytoplasm and membrane, which might reflect low-moderate expression of GIPR and GLP1R protein (Fig. 2d). Identical results were obtained with daLUXendin660 (Fig. 2e). Quantification of daLUXendin544/660 labelling is shown in Fig. 2f,g. Demonstrating efficacy of daLUXendin660 in vivo, islets in GLP1R-tdRFP and GIPR-GFP reporter mice were strongly and specifically labelled 60 min following intravenous injection with 100 nmol kg−1 probe but not vehicle (Fig. 2h,i). As for isolated islets, both GLP1R+ and GLP1R− cells were labelled in vivo, the latter probably representing GIPR+ cells (that is, α cells) (Fig. 2h).

a, Following labelling of live islets, daLUXendin660 can be fixed using either 2% or 4% formalin (FA) for 15 min (n = at least five islets from three mice). b, daLUXendin544 labels insulin-positive (INS+) cells throughout the mouse islet (n = 44 islets from five mice). c,d, daLUXendin544 labels glucagon-positive (GCG+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) cells throughout the islet, although to a lesser extent than INS+ cells (INS, 44 islets from five mice; GCG, 25 islets from seven mice; SST, 29 islets from seven mice). e, daLUXendin660 displays a similar labelling pattern to daLUXendin544 in mouse islets (INS, 43 islets from five mice; GCG, 30 islets from seven mice; SST, 27 islets from seven mice). f,g, Quantification of daLUXendin544 (f) and daLUXendin660 (g) labelling intensity in INS+, GCG+ and SST+ cell populations (Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons test).

Fluorescent labelling of low-abundance proteins in human islets is limited by high levels of autofluorescence, in particular from lipofuscin accumulation32. In addition, human islet preparations display heterogeneity in response to GLP1R/GIPR agonist, probably reflecting variable GLP1R/GIPR expression as well as time in culture. To circumvent these issues, we instead turned to human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived islet-like structures (SC-islets), which are therapeutically important as a cell therapy for type 1 diabetes33,34. Analysis of published single-cell RNA sequencing data35 revealed GIPR and GLP1R in early and late β-like cells as well as δ cells, and GIPR in early and late α cells (Fig. 2j). daLUXendin660 labelling was qualitatively similar to that observed in mouse islets, with cells displaying two similar labelling patterns: membrane labelling + cytoplasmic labelling or cytoplasmic staining alone (Fig. 2k, inset). In keeping with the transcriptomic data, immunostaining revealed daLUXendin660 labelling in insulin (INS+), glucagon (GCG+) and somatostatin (SST+) cell populations (Fig. 2j–l). Some daLUXendin660 labelling was detected in INS−/GCG−/SST− cells, which were presumably GLP1R/GIPR-expressing enteroendocrine cells that are present in most differentiations (Fig. 2j–l). Similar to mouse islets, the strongest daLUXendin660 labelling was seen in β cells, with weaker but detectable labelling in α cells and δ cells (Fig. 2k,l) (corrected total cell fluorescence, 3.60 × 105 ± 2.58 × 105 versus 2.30 × 105 ± 1.59 × 105 versus 2.16 × 105 ± 1.46 × 105 AU, β cells versus α cells versus δ cells, respectively; P < 0.0005 one-way ANOVA and Šídák's multiple comparisons test) (n = 12 SC-islets from two differentiations).

To expand the utility of daLUXendin660 for long-term dosing, we installed a C20 di-acid lipid chain on lysine at position 20 to confer albumin binding. The new molecule, termed daLUXendin660+, performed similarly to daLUXendin660 in pharmacology and receptor binding assays, demonstrating that acylation and lipid modification is well tolerated (Extended Data Fig. 3a–d) (Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Table 4). No differences in pancreatic islet cell labelling could be detected between daLUXendin660 and daLUXendin660+ applied to the same islet batch (that is, INS > GCG and SST) (Extended Data Fig. 3e–h).

Following intravenous injection (100 nmol kg−1), daLUXendin660 signal could be readily detected in the circumventricular organs and choroid plexus but not in other areas of the brain (Fig. 3a). The circumventricular organs are characterized by an incomplete blood–brain barrier and include areas such as the median eminence, area postrema, subfornical organ and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, brain regions known to bind GLP1R and GIPR (ant)agonists17,18. We did not observe any difference in the extent of brain penetration between daLUXendin660, daLUXendin660+ and the single GLP1R agonist LUXendin645 (Fig. 3a–c). To establish which incretin receptor-expressing neurons are labelled with daLUXendin660, we performed intravenous injection (100 nmol kg−1) of daLUXendin660 in transgenic mice Cre-dependently expressing fluorescent reporters in either GLP1R-expressing cells (GLP1R-tdRFP) or GIPR-expressing cells (GIPR-GCaMP6). Clear colocalization of daLUXendin660 with GLP1R (Fig. 3d) and GIPR (Fig. 3e) neurons was observed in the area postrema.

Shown are the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (i), subfornical organ (ii), choroid plexus (iii), median eminence (iv) and area postrema (v). d,e, Intravenous administration of 100 nmol kg−1 daLUXendin660 in a GLP1R-tdRFP mouse (n = 1) (d) or GIPR-GCaMP6 mouse (n = 2) (e) labels GLP1R-expressing and GIPR-expressing cells, respectively (indicated by white arrows).

The strength and extent of labelling does not necessarily equate to agonist efficacy, especially for peptidic ligands that diffuse freely through fenestrated vessels of the median eminence into the ventricular system22,36. To assess the accessibility of daLUXendin660 binding sites from the cerebrospinal fluid, we performed intracerebroventricular injection of the probe. Intracerebroventricular administration of daLUXendin660 demonstrated clear penetration from the cerebrospinal fluid into the brain parenchyma. Strong labelling was observed in tanycytes—identified through vimentin immunostaining—within the third ventricle (Extended Data Fig. 4a). daLUXendin660 labelling in tanycytes was localized to the apical surface as well as cellular processes extending into the brain parenchyma (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Neurons identified as GLP1R+ in GLP1R-tdRFP reporter mice were co-labelled with daLUXendin660 in the vicinity of the ventricles (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Modest colocalization in GIPR+ neurons was evident in GIPR-GCaMP6 reporter mice (Extended Data Fig. 4d). A small number of neurons positive for both GIPR and GLP1R were labelled with daLUXendin660 (Extended Data Fig. 4e).

GPCRs possess higher organization at the cell membrane and within the cell, forming nanodomains that are important for signalling16,37,38. We therefore set out to determine how endogenous GLP1R/GIPR nanodomains might be targeted by single agonists versus a dual agonist in primary tissue; that is, pancreatic islets. We first established nanodomain organization in the non-stimulated but bound state using LUXendin645, a GLP1R antagonist coupled to Cy5. Following 60 min incubation with LUXendin645, fixation and dSTORM nanoscopy of whole islets, we confirmed our previous data showing that non-stimulated GLP1R form discrete nanodomains16,18 (Fig. 4a,b). The GIPR agonist sGIP648 also labelled discrete receptor nanodomains (GIPR), as defined by clustering (Fig. 4b–d). daLUXendin660, however, engaged more ordered receptor nanodomains compared to the GIPR agonist alone, with high levels of clustering probably reflecting increased receptor interactions (Fig. 4b–d). Localization number per cluster, as well as the density of each cluster, were similar across all ligands examined (Fig. 4e,f). Together, these data suggest that tirzepatide either engages GLP1R into clustering or increases interactions between GLP1R and GIPR, thus contributing to its unique nanodomain arrangement. Owing to the long acquisition times needed for localization counting, dSTORM is best suited to fixed tissue. We therefore set out to show the applicability of daLUXendin660 for TIRF-based GLP1R/GIPR single particle tracking at the cell membrane in live MIN6-CB4 cells (Fig. 4g). To open up super-resolution live imaging approaches, such as STED, we replaced the C-terminal Cy5 with fluorogenic deuterated silicon rhodamine (SiR-d12)39 to create daLUXendin651-d12 (Fig. 4h,i and Supplementary Fig. 1). Labelling with daLUXendin651-d12 was too dim to visualize endogenous receptor but was sufficient to map GLP1R in fixed CHO-K1:SNAP-GLP1R:Halo-GIPR cells. daLUXendin651-d12 was able to image GLP1R below the diffraction limit and could be recorded over multiple frames (Supplementary Fig. 2). Following direct application of daLUXendin651-d12 to CHO-K1:SNAP-GLP1R:Halo-GIPR cells, far-red cell surface signal from SiR-d12 became rapidly visible (10 s) in live STED on the cell surface, colocalizing with BG-Sulfo549 and CA-AF488 (Fig. 4j).

In the present study, we synthesize and validate daLUXendins, red and far-red GLP1R/GIPR dual agonist probes. Nanomolar concentrations of daLUXendin specifically label GLP1R/GIPR in live cells, allowing endogenous binding sites and cellular targets for dual agonists such as tirzepatide to be visualized and interrogated. daLUXendin labelling can be achieved in most cells and tissues with a simple 1 h incubation or injection, followed by washing and analysis. Advantageously, daLUXendins show minimal loss in signal intensity when formaldehyde-fixed, allowing co-labelling for other cellular or neuronal proteins and markers.

A key aspect of tirzepatide efficacy is increased potency and selectivity at human GIPR compared to GLP1R, with approximately 70% of activity at GIPR10,11,12. In mice, however, tirzepatide is selective for GLP1R over GIPR, and its insulinotropic and overall therapeutic efficacy is equivalent or non-superior to semaglutide (GLP1R agonist)10,11. Although this is unlikely to have any bearing on GLP1R and GIPR accessed and bound by tirzepatide, it remains a limitation to the use of preclinical mouse models to understand GLP1R/GIPR dual agonism. Notably, daLUXendin544 and daLUXendin660 displayed less selectivity for GLP1R over GIPR in mouse (1:2 GIPR:GLP1R) compared to tirzepatide (1:8 GIPR:GLP1R). Although the exact mechanisms underlying the differences between daLUXendin544/660 and tirzepatide remain unknown, our previous studies showed that fluorophore modification can increase GLP1R agonist efficacy18. Therefore, daLUXendin660 could be a useful tool for probing dual agonist biology in the mouse.

Within the pancreatic islet, tirzepatide labelled β cells > α cells = δ cells, in keeping with known protein or transcript expression levels for GLP1R and GIPR (as previously reviewed21). Although studies have shown that tirzepatide stimulates secretion of insulin, somatostatin and glucagon11,21, the cellular substrates have so far remained elusive. The observation that tirzepatide labels β cells, δ cells and α cells suggests both direct and paracrine modes of action. Given that α cells express GIPR >> GLP1R, direct effects of tirzepatide on glucagon secretion are probably mediated by GIPR signalling, a known stimulator of α cell function40,41. By contrast, δ cells express GIPR > GLP1R, inferring a predominant role for GIPR in tirzepatide-stimulated somatostatin secretion, with some GLP1R contribution. β cells express GLP1R = GIPR, but increased affinity of tirzepatide for human GIPR10 is likely to disproportionately contribute to insulin secretion. As well as exerting direct effects on islet cell function, tirzepatide is also likely to stimulate α cell-to-β cell and δ cell-to-β cell communication, further regulating insulin release (as previously reviewed21,42). At the same time, tirzepatide might engage β cell-to-α cell or δ cell-to-α cell communication to provide a brake on glucagon secretion.

Peripherally injected daLUXendin660 was able to label the pancreas as well as readily access the median eminence, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, subfornical organ and area postrema. The extent of daLUXendin660 labelling was similar to that seen for a GLP1R antagonist, LUXendin645, as well as a GIPR agonist, sGIP648 (refs. 17,18). We therefore speculate that the superior efficacy of GLP1R/GIPR dual agonism versus single GLP1R agonism reflects the specific neuronal and supporting cell populations that are activated rather than the extent of brain access. When administered directly into the ventricular space of the brain, daLUXendin660 labelled GLP1R+ and GIPR+ neurons in the vicinity of the ventricles, as well as periventricular cells such as third ventricular tanycytes. Periventricular cell labelling is a common feature across GLP1R/GIPR (dual) (ant)agonists, pointing to a critical role for this cell type in the regulation of food intake and possibly the ligands themselves43.

Outside of conventional pharmacology, it remains unknown how daLUXendin660 interacts with GLP1R/GIPR in cells that endogenously express both receptors. Single-molecule localization microscopy showed that daLUXendin660 densely labelled GLP1R/GIPR clusters or nanodomains in islets, which was in addition to that seen with a GIPR agonist alone. Therefore, daLUXendin660 probably influences either GLP1R clustering or GLP1R and GIPR localization to increase nanodomain formation. We speculate that GIPR and GLP1R signalling within or between cell nanodomains, rather than simple signal summation across the cytoplasm, contributes to tirzepatide efficacy, as recently shown for GLP1 and β2-adrenergic receptors44.

Tirzepatide is just one of many emerging dual and triple agonists that might exhibit different receptor engagement profiles. Given that we are still piecing together single agonist function45, daLUXendin provides a powerful tool to understand dual agonist receptor engagement, brain or organ access and receptor synergism. Owing to the structural similarities between dual and triple agonists, in the future, daLUXendins can be easily modified to incorporate a glucagon receptor agonist component.

The study has a number of limitations. Firstly, tirzepatide and daLUXendins are different molecules, and detailed pharmacokinetic profiles were not determined. Therefore, we cannot categorically state that brain areas or cell types accessed by tirzepatide in humans and rodents would be similar to those accessed by daLUXendins in rodents. Secondly, we did not provide any data on human islets. We have noticed heterogeneity in GLP1R/GIPR expression, probably reflecting culture time and donor variability, compounded by high levels of lipofuscin autofluorescence32. Thirdly, we restricted daLUXendin544/660/651-d12 to Cy3, Cy5 and SiR-d12 fluorophores, as they are well suited for complex tissue labelling16,18,19. In the future, the daLUXendin colour palette could be extended to include blue-near-infrared and even epitope tags to allow signal amplification.

In summary, daLUXendin544/660 are highly specific probes that highlight dual agonist target cells within complex tissues such as the pancreatic islet and brain. We envisage that daLUXendin544/660 will provide interrogable mechanisms underlying dual agonist efficacy.

Individual data points are reported in the figures, and no data were excluded. Islet isolation is a nuisance variable, and as such, data are taken from independent islet preparations. To ensure that all states were represented in the different experiment arms, randomization was used to allocate samples and animals to treatment groups. All studies combined males and females, as no sex-specific phenotype has been reported for any of the genetically modified lines used, and male and female tissues were indistinguishable by their chemical probe or SNAP-tag labelling.

Animal studies were regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 of the UK (Personal Project Licences P2ABC3A83, PP1778740 and PP6526002). Approval was granted by the University of Birmingham, University of Oxford and University College London Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Bodies (AWERB).

Studies with human iPS cells were reviewed by the University of Oxford Medical Sciences Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee (MS IDREC). The study utilizes iPS cells, which are created entirely outside the body and, as such, do not fall under the Governance of the Human Tissue Authority requiring ethics approval for their use in the United Kingdom.

Chemicals and solvents were purchased from Merck, TCI (Tokyo Chemical Industry) and Acros Organics (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and used without further purification. Dry solvents were purchased from Acros Organics (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Amino acids and resins for solid-phase peptide synthesis were purchased from Novabiochem (Merck) or Iris Biotech.

Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with UV–visible light detection was performed for purity assessment, using an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC System equipped with an Agilent SB-C18 column (1.8 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm). Buffer A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in H2O; buffer B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The typical gradient was from 10% B for 1.0 min → gradient to 95% B over 5 min → 95% B for 1.0 min with 0.45 ml min−1 flow or from 30% B for 1.0 min → gradient to 95% B over 5 min. Retention times are given in minutes. Chromatograms were imported into Graphpad Prism 8, and purity was determined by calculating area under the curve ratios.

Preparative or semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography was performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC System equipped with columns as follows: preparative column, Reprospher 100 C18 columns (10 μm: 50 × 30 mm at 20 ml min−1 flow rate; semi-preparative column, 5 μm: 250 × 10 mm at 4 ml min−1 flow rate. Eluents A (0.1% TFA in H2O) and B (0.1% TFA in MeCN) were applied as a linear gradient. Peak detection was performed at maximal absorbance wavelength.

For high-resolution mass spectrometry, samples were analysed on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass spectrometry scans were acquired in a range of 350–1500 m/z. MS1 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with a mass resolution of 120,000 with an AGC target value of 4 × 105 and 50 ms injection time. MS2 scans were acquired in the ion trap with an AGC target value of 1 × 104 and 35 ms injection time. Precursor ions with charge states two to four were isolated with an isolation window of 1.6 m/z and 40 s dynamic exclusion. Precursor ions were fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation with 30% normalized collision energy.

Peptide synthesis and chemical characterization (high-resolution mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography) are detailed in the Supplementary Note 1.

AD293 cells (RRID:CVCL_9804) were transiently transfected 24 h before the assay in six-well plates with plasmids encoding wild-type hGLP1R, mGLP1R, hGIPR or mGIPR using Lipofectamine 2000. AD293 cells were authenticated at source using STR profiling. Cells were detached and treated with a range of agonist concentrations in serum-free DMEM + 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C in 96-well plates, followed by the addition of lysis buffer 2 (Cisbio) at a 1:2 ratio. Lysates were further diluted 1:10 to avoid spectral interference from the higher concentrations of fluorescent ligands in the HTRF assay, and the concentration of cAMP was determined after the addition of cAMP Dynamic detection reagents (Cisbio). Three-parameter logistic fitting was used to determine signalling potencies for each ligand, with EC50 ratios relative to the cognate ligand for each receptor used to establish test agonist selectivity for GLP1R versus GIPR.

HEK293T cells (RRID:CVCL_0063) were cultured in DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher), supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HEK293T cells were authenticated at source using STR profiling. Cells transiently expressing Nluc–GLP1R or Nluc–GIPR were seeded onto white 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h. Media was then removed and the cells were incubated in PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.01% NanoGlo (Promega). For saturation binding assays, daLUXendins were added across the concentration range 0.1–31.6 nM, in the absence or presence of 1 μM GIP and 1 μM Exendin-9 to determine specific binding. For competition binding assays, cells were co-treated with 10 nM daLUXendin and GLP1 or GIP across the range 1 μM to 1 pM. Plates were read using a PheraSTAR microplate reader, using the NanoBRET filter module. BRET ratios (λacceptor/λdonor) were calculated, and saturation data fit using the ‘One Site – Specific Binding' equation of GraphPad Prism 10. Competition binding was fit using the ‘One Site – Fit Ki' equation.

Male and female 8–12 week old Glp1rWT/WT, Glp1rWT/KO and Glp1rKO/KO (ref. 18) littermates (on a C57BL/6J background) were fasted for 4–6 h, with free access to water. Wild-type and heterozygous mice were used as controls, as loss of a single Glp1r allele was found to exert minimal influence on phenotype46. Tirzepatide and daLUXendin were administered at 10 nmol kg−1 before intraperitoneal injection of 2 g kg−1 glucose 60 min later. Glucose was measured in blood from the tail vein at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post glucose challenge. Mice were socially housed in specific-pathogen-free conditions under a 12 h light–dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water, relative humidity 55 ± 10% and temperature 21 ± 2 °C.

Male and female 12–14 week old C57BL/N mice were singly housed in a 12 h dark–light cycle (14:00–02:00 h) and habituated to FED3 feeding devices for 7 days before commencing the study47. All mice were kept on a 12 h light–dark cycle at 20–24 °C and 45–65% relative humidity (typically 21 °C and 55%). On test days, mice were fasted for 3 h before onset of the dark phase by removal of the FED3 devices. At dark onset, mice were injected subcutaneously with either vehicle, daLUXendin660 (10 nmol kg−1) or tirzepatide (10 nmol kg−1), the FED3 devices were returned and food intake was recorded over a 24 h period. The study was performed using a three-way crossover design. A 1-week washout period was observed between experimental days. FED3 devices were checked, serviced and food was topped up daily.

AD293 cells (RRID:CVCL_9804) were grown in DMEM High Glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units per ml penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin and 1% glutamine (complete DMEM).

Cells were transfected with 0.3 μl Lipofectamine 2000 per well and 50 ng DNA (SNAP_hGIPR or SNAP_hGLP1R plasmid) per well in 110 μl OptiMEM per well and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells co-transfected with plasmids for two receptors harbouring orthogonal enzyme self-labels (SNAP_GIPR and Halo_GLP1R plasmid) received 50 ng of each DNA. Control, non-transfected cells were cultured overnight in 50 μl OptiMEM without the addition of Lipofectamine 2000 or DNA. The next day, culture media was removed and 50 μl of labelling solution or complete DMEM (for unlabelled control) was added to each well.

On the day after transfection with SNAP-GIPR and Halo-GLP1R, cells were incubated in triple probe solutions of either 500 nM daLUXendin544 with 500 nM SBG-Oregon Green (SBG-OG) and 500 nM CA-Sulfo646, or 500 nM daLUXendin660 with 500nM SBG-OG and 500 nM CA-Sulfo549, all in 50 μl complete DMEM for 55 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Additional wells of transfected cells were incubated in single probe solutions (500 nM daLUXendin544, 500 nM daLUXendin660, 500 nM SBG-OG, 500 nM CA-Sulfo549 or 500 nM CA-Sulfo646) or unlabelled complete DMEM in addition to non-transfected cells incubated in triple probe solutions, all as control wells. SNAP-tag and Halo-tag have been previously reported and are characterized elsewhere30.

MIN6-CB4 cells were generated and phenotyped, as previously described48. Cells were grown to 70% confluency in MIN6 media (DMEM High Glucose supplemented with 15% FBS, 71 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin). Cells were then seeded in 100 μl MIN6 media per well, on a glass-bottomed 96-well imaging plate previously coated with poly-l-lysine 0.01%. The day after seeding, cells were incubated with either 500 nM daLUXendin660, 100 nM sGIP549 (GIPR probe)17 or 100 nM LUXendin551 (GLP1R probe)18, a combination of two or just complete MIN6 media for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.

Male and female 8–12 week old CD1 and C57BL6/J mice, as well as GLP1RKO/KO (ref. 18) and GLP1RSNAP/SNAP (ref. 16) mice (both on a C57BL/6J background) were used as tissue donors. Mice were humanely killed using a schedule-1 method, and the common bile duct was injected with Serva NB8 (1 mg ml−1) collagenase. The inflated pancreas was dissected, and islets were isolated using Histopaque-1119 and 1083 (Sigma-Aldrich) gradients and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 units per ml penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin. Islets were used up to 4 days after isolation.

Size-matched wild-type or GLP1RKO/KO islets were incubated in 100 nM, 500 nM or 1 μM daLUXendins, sGIP549, sGIP648, LUXendin551 or LUXendin645 for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, before washing twice.

GLP1RSNAP/SNAP islets were incubated with 500 nM BG-Sulfo549 or BG-Sulfo646 and/or another orthogonal fluorescent ligand for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, before washing three times.

For immunostaining, labelled islets were washed three times with PBS, then incubated with 2–4% formalin for 15 min at room temperature (16–25 °C). Islets were again washed three times with PBS, then incubated in permeabilizing blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature before incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The following day, islets were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature before mounting onto microscope slides with VECTASHIELD HardSet with DAPI or Everbrite Hardset. Primary and secondary antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

To assess brain and pancreas access following peripheral administration, GLP1R-Cre:tdRFP (GLP1R-tdRFP) and GIPR-Cre:GFP (GIPR-GFP) mice15 (both on a C57BL/N background) were injected intravenously into the tail vein with 100 nmol kg−1 daLUXendin. Then, 40 min later, mice were terminally anaesthetized with pentobarbital (200 mg kg−1) and perfused with ice-cold 0.1 M PBS followed by 4% formalin solution.

For brain tissue analysis, GLP1R-tdRFP mice and GIPR-Cre:GCaMP6 (GIPR-GCaMP6) mice14 were terminally anaesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride (Ketavet, Zoetis; 75 mg kg−1, intraperitoneally) and medetomidine hydrochloride (Domitor, OrionPharma; 1 mg kg−1, intraperitoneally). Meloxicam (Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim; 5 mg kg−1, subcutaneously) was given for peri-surgery analgesia. Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame, and daLUXendin was injected unilaterally into the lateral ventricle at doses of 5 nmol kg−1 body weight at a rate of 1 µl min−1. Coordinates relative to bregma were A/P −0.5 mm; D/V −2.5 mm; M/L 1 mm. At 1 h post injection, mice were perfused with ice-cold 0.1 M PBS followed by 4% formalin solution.

All brains were cryo-sectioned coronally at 30 µm and mounted onto microscope slides with VECTASHIELD antifade mounting medium (H-1000).

Brains were cryo-sectioned coronally at 30 µm and sections processed for amplification of fluorescent reporter signals by immunofluorescence labelling of vimentin (a marker for ependymal cells and tanycytes). Antigen retrieval of free-floating sections was performed using sodium citrate buffer at 80 °C for 20 min. Sections were next blocked in 5% normal donkey serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h and then incubated overnight in primary antibody (in blocking solution) at room temperature (primary antibody: chicken anti-vimentin, Ab24525, Abcam; 1:750). Sections were next incubated for 2 h in secondary antibody (in 1% normal donkey serum, 0.2% Triton X-100) at room temperature (secondary antibody: donkey anti-chicken IgY (H+L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488, A78948, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:500). Sections were stained with DAPI to mark nuclei, then mounted on Superfrost Plus slides and cover-slipped using Prolong Antifade medium.

Sections were imaged on an inverted Leica SP8 confocal microscope using either a ×25 or ×63 oil immersion objective. Three-dimensional reconstructions of daLUXendin660-labelled tissue or antibody-stained cells were rendered using the Surfaces function in Imaris (v.10.1.1) (Oxford Instruments). Opaque surfaces are three-dimensional reconstructions of overlapping areas of daLUXendin660 labelling and antibody staining created using the Coloc function in Imaris. Primary and secondary antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

Midbrain sections (30 µm) containing the ARH from a GIPR-Cre:GCaMP6 (GIPR-GCaMP6) mouse intracerebroventricularly administered daLUXendin660 (3.3 nmol kg−1 body weight) were collected on Superfrost Plus slides and allowed to air-dry at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were then dipped in molecular-grade ethanol and further air-dried overnight at room temperature. RNAscope in situ hybridization was performed on these sections using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Kit (v.2) (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) as per the manufacturer's instructions, with a modification to the pre-treatment procedure (Protease IV incubation conducted for 20 min at room temperature). Sections were processed for in situ hybridization of Glp1r mRNA (cat. no. 418851-C2, Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Following hybridization, slides were cover-slipped using Prolong Antifade medium.

Human iPS cells (ALSTEM, iPS11) were maintained on iPS cell-qualified Matrigel (Corning, 354277) in mTeSR+ media (StemCell Technologies, 05826). ALSTEM iPS11 cells were authenticated at source by testing for expression of OCT4 and TRA-1-60, as well as alkaline phosphatase activity. Differentiation to islet-like structures (SC-islets) was carried out in a suspension-based, magnetic CELLSPIN bioreactor system (PFEIFFER). Differentiation media was changed daily by letting spheres settle by gravity for 3–10 min. Most of the supernatant was removed by aspiration; fresh media was added and bioreactors were placed back on the stirrer system. SC-islet differentiation was based on published protocols35,49

Live or fixed cell and tissue imaging was performed with either (1) Zeiss LSM780/LSM880 meta-confocal microscopes equipped with GaAsP spectral detectors and ×40 and ×63/1.2 NA water objectives; (2) an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope equipped with GaAsP spectral detectors and UPLSAPO ×60/1.30 NA silicone and ×60/1.41 NA oil objectives; or (3) an Olympus FV4000 confocal microscope equipped with SilVIR spectral detectors and a UPLSAPO ×60/1.41 NA oil objective. Excitation (ex) and emission (em) wavelengths (in nm) are as follows: sGIP549 (λex 561, λem 568–621), sGIP648 (λex 633, λem 639–692), LUXendin551 (λex 561, λem 568–621), LUXendin645 (λex 633, λem 639–692), daLUXendin544(+) (λex 561, λem 569–623), daLUXendin660(+) (λex 633, λem 640–694), SBG-OG (λex 488, λem 496–542), BG-Sulfo549 (λex 561, λem 569–623), BG-Sulfo646 (λex 633, λem 641–694), CA-Sulfo549 (λex 561, λem 568–613), CA-Sulfo646 (λex 633, λem 640–694), Hoechst (λex 405, λem 410–488), Alexa488 (λex 488, λem 496–542), DyLight488 (λex 488, λem 496–542) and DyLight633 (λex 633, λem 640–694). Zen 2012 or Olympus cellSens (v.3.2) were used for image acquisition and analysis.

Islets were labelled with LUXendin645 (500 nM), sGIP648 (1 µM) or daLUXendin (1 µM), before fixation in 2–4% formalin for 15–30 min. Islets were mounted on cavity slides, submerged in STORM buffer (Abbelight) and sealed using a 170 µm coverslip and dental resin. Samples were imaged in HILO mode on an Evident/Abbelight SAFe 180 system, using a ×100/1.5 NA Olympus UPLAPO100XOHR objective. LUXendin645, sGIP648 or daLUXendin660 (all Cy5) were pumped to the dark state using an Oxxius laser combiner and 600 mW 640 nm Coherent Obis diode laser before initiation of photoblinking. Single-molecule events were recorded using an LP650 filter with an integration time of 50 ms on a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion sCMOS for 20,000–40,000 frames. Localizations were extracted and images reconstructed using Abbelight NEO software. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) was used to determine localization clustering, implemented in Abbelight NEO software (v.39), with ε = 25 nm (the average precision of the data) and minPts = 8. Results were confirmed using a custom RNA segmentation and DBSCAN routine implemented in R Project (v.4.4.3) (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dbscan/index.html)50.

Live confocal and STED imaging of CHO-K1:SNAP-GLP1R:Halo-GIPR cells (CHO-K1, RRID:CVCL_0214) was performed on a STEDYCON system (Abberior Instruments), mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TI research microscope equipped with a Plan APO Lambda ×100/1.45 NA oil objective (Nikon) and controlled by NIS Elements (Nikon). CHO-K1 cells were authenticated at source using DNA barcoding and DNA profiling. An incubation chamber surrounding the microscope setup was set to 37 °C 24 h before live-cell imaging. To provide stable focus during imaging, the Perfect Focus System (Nikon) was used. Imaging was performed in FluoroBrite Medium (Gibco) at 37 °C. Excitation was delivered with a 405, 488, 568 or 640 nm diode laser, and emission was detected with avalanche photodiodes at 461, 520, 566 or 671 nm, respectively. Live STED images were acquired with a 640 nm excitation laser, 775 nm depletion laser (at 20% intensity) and 671 nm detector (gate, 1–7 ns). Pixel size was set to 30 nm × 30 nm, with 10 µs pixel dwell time, and a line accumulation of 1 was used during acquisition. STEDYCON 9.0.799-g22f03ed2 software was used for image acquisition and analysis.

MIN6-CB4 cells were labelled with 500 pM daLUXendin660 in complete media for 20 min at 37 °C and washed three times in HEPES-bicarbonate buffer, ensuring sparse labelling of GLP1R/GIPR. Cells were mounted on cavity slides and imaged in HEPES-bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 11 mM d-glucose before TIRF imaging at 40 Hz using an Evident/Abbelight SAFe 180 system and a ×100/1.5 NA Olympus UPLAPO100XOHR objective. Single particles were recorded using an LP650 filter with an integration time of 25 ms on a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion sCMOS for 1,750 frames. Single particle analysis was performed using the Trackmate plugin for ImageJ51, with trajectories shown as maximum displacement.

Probe labelling was analysed using corrected total cell fluorescence, which is integrated density − (area of selected cell × mean fluorescence of background readings)52,53. Colocalization was determined using Manders' coefficient, which calculates the proportion of pixels in one channel that also show intensity from both channels. Full width at half maximum was used to analyse labelling patterns at the membrane versus cytoplasm. All analyses were performed in ImageJ (NIH), with brightness and contrast linearly adjusted across the entire image for presentation purposes and applied equally between all states under examination.

Data distribution was assessed using the D'Agostino–Pearson normality test. Pairwise comparisons were made using unpaired t-tests. For non-parametric data, pairwise comparisons were made using a Mann–Whitney test. Multiple comparisons were made using either one-way ANOVA (parametric), two-way ANOVA (parametric) or Kruskal–Wallis test (non-parametric), with pairwise comparisons made using either Šídák's or Dunn's tests, or the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli. GraphPad Prism 9 and 10 were used for all statistical analyses. Values are presented as means; error bars, s.e.m.; P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

For animal studies, each independent replicate corresponds to a separate animal. For cell line studies, the independent replicate corresponds to experiments performed on different days or using cells split from separate flasks. Variation between individual islets or cells was greater than variation of the mean between animals; therefore, they are considered separate data points for analysis purposes. For representative images, the experiment was repeated the same number of times as the related quantification, always with similar results. If the n number occupies a range of samples or animals, the lowest value is provided as per journal guidelines. Hence, the number of data points on the graph may be higher than the stated sample size.

Small molecule solubility is a critically important property which affects the efficiency, environmental impact, and phase behavior of synthetic processes. Experimental determination of solubility is a time- and resource-intensive process and existing methods for in silico estimation of solubility are limited by their generality, speed, and accuracy. This work presents two models derived from the FASTPROP and CHEMPROP architectures and trained on BigSolDB which are capable of predicting solubility at arbitrary temperatures for a wide range of small molecules in organic solvent. Both extrapolate to unseen solutes 2–3 times more accurately than the current state-of-the-art model and we demonstrate that they are approaching the aleatoric limit (0.5–1 \(\log S\)) of available test data, suggesting that further improvements in prediction accuracy require more accurate datasets. The FASTPROP-derived model (called FASTSOLV) and the CHEMPROP-based model are open source, freely accessible via a Python package and web interface, highly reproducible, and up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than current alternatives.

The solubility of organic solids in various solvents is an essential molecular property that impacts the efficiency1, environmental impact2,3, and phase behavior4 of synthetic processes. Solubility is crucial in wide-ranging chemical processes spanning length and time scales including crystallization and filtration4, membrane-based chemical separations5,6, pharmaceutical design and discovery7, drug delivery and formulation8, the environmental fate of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)9 and geological-scale dissolved organic carbon flux10. By convention, solubility S in mol L−1 is expressed as \({\log }_{10}S\) since values can range over several orders of magnitude. Experimental methods for determining solubility are notoriously time- and resource-intensive11 and error prone, thus many published values are suspected of being highly inaccurate. The challenges of measuring solubility are especially painful in pharmaceutical development where organic solubility complicates synthesis and purification12 and aqueous solubility limits in vivo efficacy13. Given that solubility as a function of temperature is often desired, experimental determination becomes even more onerous. For these reasons a priori estimation of \(\log S\) has long been of immense interest to the chemical sciences.

Critically, the experimental error is typically systematic rather than random because organic molecules are often isolated as an amorphous solid, hydrate, polymorph, or impure cocrystal rather than the desired most-stable pure crystal, confounding accurate measurement14. The reported standard deviation in inter-laboratory measurements in \(\log S\) typically ranges between 0.5 and 0.7 \(\log\) units for aqueous solubility. For example, Katritzky et al.15 notably found the average inter-laboratory standard deviation of 411 compounds to be 0.58. Other reported average standard deviations in inter-laboratory measurements include 0.6-0.716, 0.6217, and 0.6018. Furthermore, other work found that inter-laboratory solubility measurements for the same solution could range over 0.86 \(\log\) units and in some cases could vary as widely as 1.56 \(\log\) unit19. Andersson et al.20 recruited 12 laboratories to measure solubility, standardizing materials and collection methods between laboratories, and found that differences in data analysis alone could result in variations as high as a standard deviation of 0.74 \(\log\) unit between labs. In sum, a variability between a factor of 3 (0.5 \(\log\) units) and 10 (1 \(\log\) unit) in the measured solubility of the same solute in aqueous solutions at the same temperature between laboratories is not unusual.

Prediction methods have evolved from empirical group additivity correlations21,22, to ab initio conductor-like screening model (COSMO) and its extension to realistic solvation (COSMO-RS)23, to bespoke-solvent machine learning (ML) models with random forest regressors24. Direct ab initio calculation of organic crystals using quantum mechanics is now possible but too computationally expensive for routine or high-throughput calculations25,26. Given the specific importance of aqueous solubility in drug discovery, most work has focused on predicting aqueous solubility27, and relatively fewer works have explored organic solvents, which are particularly crucial in synthetic processes. The aforementioned experimental variability limit of 0.5-1 \(\log S\) represents a bound on the performance of any data-driven prediction method on a given dataset, since it is impractical to remeasure a large number of solute-solvent solubility numbers with significantly better accuracy and precision. Currently, this variability limit has primarily been explored in the context of aqueous solubility in the literature.16,17,28 However, there is little reason to believe that the experimental uncertainty should be any lower in organic solvents, and may actually be higher due to increased variability in the experimental methodologies used across laboratories29. This variability defines the aleatoric limit - the ‘irreducible error' below which model performance improvements cannot be discerned.

State-of-the-art methods focus on applying deep learning to organic solubility prediction, including graph-based neural networks and descriptor-based models24,29,30,31. Existing models, however, suffer from a lack of generalizability for a variety of reasons. Boobier et al.24 trained solvent-specific models on only commonly available solvents at room temperature due to a lack of sufficient data to do otherwise, thus rendering their models non-generalizable by construction. Other works like those of Lee et al.30 fail to evaluate model performance when extrapolating to new, unseen solutes, a task which mirrors the real task where solubility prediction would be applied in a synthetic pipeline. The state-of-the-art model in literature by Vermeire et al.31 overcame some of these limitations by training a composition of deep learning models on the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy of solvation, and the Abraham solvation parameters, which are then combined via a thermodynamic cycle to predict the solubility in arbitrary solvents for a wide range of temperatures. A significant advantage of the Vermeire et al.31 model is that when interpolating from known experimental data for a given solute to a new solvent the model predictions are very accurate. Unfortunately without experimental data to supplement the models, as would be the case when screening new solutes in a discovery pipeline, performance drops substantially.

Here, we combine advances in cheminformatics software and a recently compiled database of organic solubility, BigSolDB,32 develop a state-of-the-art general organic solubility prediction model, and validate it under rigorous extrapolation conditions. By adapting the FASTPROP33 and CHEMPROP34,35 architecures to ingest two molecular structures and a temperature (Fig. 1a) we train models on BigSolDB to regress \(\log S\) directly (Fig. 1b). Our optimized models yield a factor of three improvement over the existing state-of-the-art organic solubility prediction models, with rapid inference times suitable for use in high-throughput workflows. We further demonstrate that our optimized FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models, which use fundamentally different molecular representations, both reach the irreducible error, or aleatoric limit, of accuracy with only a small fraction of the total available data. Further progress in organic solubility prediction will require higher quality datasets to determine the true accuracy of the best models. Our fastest model, termed FASTSOLV, is open source and can be downloaded as a python package (pypi.org/project/fastsolv/), accessed online via fastsolv.mit.edu, and is integrated in ASKCOS (askcos.mit.edu).

a In our modeling approach, solute (e.g. paracetamol) and solvent (e.g. ethyl acetate) structures are mapped to representation vectors. These representation vectors are concatenated to the solution temperature to arrive at a solution representation, which is passed into a fully-connected neural network and regressed to the \(\log\) of solubility (S, mol L−1). b Structures are mapped to feature vectors using a fixed representation of Mordred descriptors as implemented in FASTPROP, or a learned representation derived from message passing on a graph representation from CHEMPROP. We compare the performance of models trained on these fundamentally different solution representations.

In a real discovery context, solubility prediction is usually applied toward a solute extrapolation task, wherein it is desirable to know the solubility of a novel candidate compound in a variety of standard solvents for a given temperature. Thus, we rigorously trained and evaluated our model performance with this task in mind. However, attention to the ability of a model to extrapolate to new solutes is not typically heeded in the literature, making benchmarking our model performance challenging.

We selected Vermeire et al.31 as the current literature state-of-the-art model against which to benchmark our results, given that it is widely regarded as a highly accurate solvent and temperature-general model36,37. This approach consists of up to four machine learning sub-models trained on thermochemical datasets which are combined to yield solubility using a thermodynamic cycle. The overall model is tested on the experimental solubility data compiled in the SolProp dataset. Their objective was to to achieve excellent performance when extrapolating into new solvents, so the compiled SolProp dataset contains many solute structures already present in the training data (Fig. 2a). Since its publication, improved models for some constituent properties have become available, such as the solvation energy predictor developed by Kim et al.37, but we leave the original SolProp model intact for the sake of fair comparisons with its originally published performance.

The solutes seen during training have overlaps with the SolProp and Leeds testing datasets. b In this study, we rigorously test solute extrapolation performance of our models by dropping overlap between the training dataset of BigSolDB32, and the SolProp31 and Leeds24 testing sets. c Distribution of the label, the \(\log\) of solubility (S, mol L−1), across the training and external testing sets. d Demonstration of a single solubility experiment, which contains the measured solubility of a solute (dibenzothiophene) in a solvent (diethylene glycol) across a range of temperatures (K), as measured by Tao et al.58. e Rigorous data splitting strategy splits training and validation data by experiment, ensuring data is not leaked during model selection. f Parity plot demonstrating predictions of optimized FASTPROP-based model on BigSolDB, including training and validation data (N = 41,724).

We trained our models on the BigSolDB dataset32, which contains variable organic solvent and variable temperature solubility data at the precipitation limit. As a point of comparison with the model developed by Vermeire et al.31, we tested our models on the SolProp dataset, though with overlapping solute structures dropped from BigSolDB (Fig. 2b). This reflects our intended application—extrapolation into new solutes with no additional information. The Vermeire et al.31 model has many overlapping solute structures in its training data (see Fig. 2a), leading to overly optimistic reported performance. To demonstrate this and provide a second point of comparison in which both the model developed by Vermeire et al.31 and our models extrapolate to new solutes, we also tested on the Leeds organic solubility dataset prepared by Boobier et al.24 This dataset is more diverse in solute structures than the SolProp dataset but contains solubility data only near room temperature. This makes it a rigorous test of a models' capacity to extrapolate to new chemical space, likely also with a higher aleatoric limit given the absence of de-facto averaging over multiple measurements as in the SolProp dataset. The Leeds dataset has less overlap in solute structures with the Vermeire et al.31 training data than SolProp (Fig. 2a), making it a more stringent extrapolation test. Thus, testing the model developed by Vermeire et al.31 and our models on the Leeds dataset evaluates their ability to handle diverse solute chemistry without considering the effects of temperature on solubility. The distribution of the label \(\log S\) across all three datasets is similar, centered around -1 with a long tail in the limit of low solubility (Fig. 2c).

We trained our models using 95% of the remaining data in BigSolDB, reserving 5% for validation and model selection. To avoid data leaks we split our data to ensure no solutes appear in both training and validation sets, meaning that every group of measurements for a solute, one of which is visualized in Fig. 2d, will be grouped together. Since we split our dataset by experiment and solute (Fig. 2e), we ensure that we rigorously test extrapolation to new solutes. Additional details about model training and hyperparameter optimization can be found in Supporting Information Section S1. The performance of the FASTPROP-based model on training and validation is shown in the parity plot in Fig. 2f. Performance is quantified via the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), defined in Equation (1) as:

where yi is the true value, \({\hat{y}}_{i}\) is the predicted value, and n is the number of observations. Additionally, the Percentage of Predictions within 1 \(\log S\) unit, a metric based on the upper reported limit of experimental reproducibility, is referred to as \(\%\log S \pm 1\)24. This is calculated in Equation (2) as:

where yi is the true value, \({\hat{y}}_{i}\) is the predicted value, n is the number of observations, 1[⋅] is the indicator function which equals 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise. The optimized solution FASTPROP model achieves excellent interpolation accuracy, with RMSE = 0.22 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=99.3\%\). Similarly, the optimized solution CHEMPROP model achieved an RMSE = 0.28 and \({\%} \ {\log } \ { S }{ \pm }1=99.2{\%}.\)

After training solution FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models, their performance on extrapolation was evaluated on the Leeds and SolProp test sets and benchmarked against the Vermiere model as made available via a Python package in the original publication. We observe that the Vermiere model performs comparatively poorly on the Leeds dataset, with RMSE = 2.16 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=41.2\%\) (Fig. 3a). On inspection there is observable systematic bias, with the model often over-predicting the solubility. In contrast, both the solution FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models perform similarly well, with RMSE = 0.95 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=73.8\%\) for FASTPROP and RMSE = 0.99 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=70.9\%\) for CHEMPROP (Fig. 3b, c). The systematic bias is greatly reduced in both models.

Parity plots highlighting model predictions of (d) Vermeire et al.31 (RMSE = 1.43, \(\%\log S\pm 1=66.9\%\)), (e) solution FASTPROP (RMSE = 0.83, \(\%\log S\pm 1=78.1\%\)), and (f) solution CHEMPROP (RMSE = 0.83, \(\%\log S\pm 1=76.1\%\)) on the SolProp31 dataset. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

On the SolProp dataset, the Vermiere model performs slightly better (RMSE = 1.43 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=66.9\%\)), but still exhibits systematic bias, with several specific experiments appearing with over-predicted temperatures gradients compared to parity (Fig. 3d). This performance is similar to what Vermeire et al.31 reported when no experimental data was available and only molecular structures are used as inputs to the model. In contrast, the solution FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models perform significantly better with RMSE = 0.83 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=78.1\%\) for FASTPROP and RMSE = 0.83 and \(\%\log S\pm 1=76.1\%\) for CHEMPROP (Fig. 3e, f).

When running inference on both the Leeds and SolProp test sets, the solution FASTPROP model demonstrated inference times about fifty-fold faster than the Vermeire et al.31 model due to its comparatively lightweight architecture. The use of molecular descriptors as an embedding also enabled analysis of results with SHAP29 (Supporting Information Figure S1) to aid in interpretability of model results. We trained four FASTPROP models with different initializations and ensemble them, terming the resulting ensemble model FASTSOLV; further results in this study referencing FASTSOLV refer to this ensemble model specifically.

To go beyond these aggregate performance metrics and visually inspect prediction and gradient accuracy, we also evaluated our model performance on specific case studies from the SolProp test set (Fig. 4). We selected two structurally distinct solutes from the held-out SolProp test set–risperidone, a water-insoluble antipsychotic, and L-prolinamide, an amino acid amide–and compared model predictions from the FASTSOLV model and the Vermeire et al.31 model against temperature-dependent experimental solubility data in different solvents. Risperidone was evaluated in polar acetone and isopropyl alcohol, while L-prolinamide was tested in highly nonpolar hexane and heptane.

Solubility predictions and experimental data as a function of temperature for solutions of (a) risperidone in acetone (blue) and isopropanol (orange) and (b) L-prolinamide in hexane (blue) and heptane (orange). Experimental data are plotted as circles, predictions from the Vermeire et al.31 model are plotted as dotted lines, and ensemble average FASTSOLV predictions are plotted as solid lines. The shaded error bands indicate uncertainty in model predictions for both models. For FASTSOLV, uncertainty is the ensemble standard deviation. For the Vermeire et al.31 model, uncertainty is propagated from uncertainty in predicted constitutive thermodynamic quantities. Experimental risperidone solubility data is compiled in SolPropVermeire et al.31 from Mealey et al.59. Experimental L-prolinamide solubility data is compiled in SolProp from Cui et al.60 Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We observe that FASTSOLV significantly improves absolute and gradient accuracy over the Vermeire et al.31 model for risperidone and L-prolinamide solutions. Specifically, FASTSOLV achieves an RMSE of 0.16 for risperidone and 0.25 for L-prolinamide, compared to 1.64 and 2.33 for the Vermeire et al.31 model. For risperidone, FASTSOLV correctly predicts the relative solubility order in acetone and isopropanol and predicts realistic temperature-dependence. The Vermeire et al.31 model, in contrast, overpredicts solubility, has greater model uncertainty, and overestimates the gradient with respect to temperature (Fig. 4a). For L-prolinamide, FASTSOLV successfully discriminates solubility between the highly similar solvents hexane and heptane, correctly predicting higher solubility in heptane, while the Vermeire et al.31 model predicts nearly identical values (Fig. 4b). The ability to rank solubility accurately and distinguish between structurally similar solvents is critical for high-throughput virtual screening and suggests that FASTOSLV accurately represents solvent structure.

We also sought to identify failure modes of FASTSOLV by probing solutes with inaccurate predictions. We observed poor prediction accuracy on anthraquinone solutions in acrylonitrile (RMSE = 1.80), methyl ethyl ketone (1.34), and isopropyl alcohol (1.20), using reference data from Cepeda and Diaz38(Supporting Information Figure S2). Model performance on the parent molecule of anthraquinone, anthracene, in the same solvents exhibited much higher accuracy (RMSE = 0.42, 0.37, and 0.12 in acetonitrile, methyl ethyl ketone, and isopropyl alcohol, respectively). To further probe this poor performance, we also evaluated solubility on 85 solutions of the parent molecule anthracene and multiple -quinone derivatives in a variety of solvents which are compiled in the SolProp test set. We found an overall RMSE = 0.52, with RMSE = 0.76 for 4 anthracene solutions, 0.44 for 32 2-ethylanthraquinone solutions, and 0.55 for 49 1-chloroanthraquinone solutions (Supporting Information Section S3). However, even though the predictions on anthraquinone are relatively inaccurate, the model is still able to correctly rank order solubility between acetonitrile, methyl ethyl ketone, and isopropyl alcohol (Supporting Information Figure S2), suggesting the model has an accurate molecular representation of these challenging polycyclic aromatics.

As previously mentioned, there is substantial discussion in the literature about the inter-laboratory variability of solubility experiments, which can range between 0.5-1 \(\log\) units, depending on the source and the variability metric used. We thus sought to establish if our model performance approaches this limit for the testing data. We first estimated the inter-laboratory experimental variability within the present datasets by identifying solutions with the same solute, solvent, and temperature but different literature sources; this yielded 34 solutions containing 8 unique solutes and 6 unique solvents. Between these solutions the average inter-laboratory standard deviation is 0.34 \(\log\) while the RMSE is 0.75 \(\log\) (Supporting Information Section S4). We use this value of inter-laboratory RMSE (0.75) for direct comparison with model performance, which also is evaluated in RMSE.

With this reference aleatoric limit established, we evaluated the model performance trajectory as a function of training dataset size. To do so, we randomly downsample the training dataset to some smaller size, train a four-model ensemble and report the performance on the test sets. Repeating this at different sizes of downsampled training sets with multiple replicates at each size generates a performance trajectory as a function of training set size (Fig. 5a). We observe that the performance trajectories for both the FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models are similar, despite representing fundamentally different modeling approaches. We also observe that the model performance on the SolProp test set plateaus after only 500 experiments (~5000 data points) are included in training for both the CHEMPROP and FASTPROP models. Similarly, the performance on the Leeds test set plateaus for the CHEMPROP model after only 2000 experiments (~20,000 data points), although performance of the simpler FASTPROP model takes slightly longer to plateau.

a Mean test Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) against the number of experiments used in the training dataset for solution FASTPROP and CHEMPROP on both the SolProp and Leeds datasets. Orange-colored curves show results for solution FASTPROP models, while blue-colored curves show test RMSE for solution CHEMPROP models. For both colors, diamond markers indicate test RMSE on the Leeds dataset, while circular markers indicate test RMSE on the SolProp dataset. The gray shaded area indicates the range of experimental uncertainties reported in literature (\(0.5 < \log S < 1.0\)). The plot cuts off at 0.7 for ease in visualizing the data. Error bars indicate standard deviation across three randomized training trials in which the subset of experiments used was randomly selected in order to account for variability in performance due to the effects of downsampling. b Correlation of FASTPROP and CHEMPROP model predictions on the SolProp31 test set. One-sided Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was determined, with null hypothesis r > 0 and N = 5700. The resulting r = 0.81, with p = 0.00. The 95 % confidence interval of r is [0.80, 1.00]. Black dotted line shows parity. c Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the gradients of \(\log S\) with respect to temperature T (\(\frac{d\log S}{dT}\)) in the SolProp test set. Vermeire et al.31 model predicted gradient CDF (green) achieves an earth movers distance (EMD) of 0.06 compared to the SolProp ground truth gradient CDF (black). FASTPROP predicted gradient CDF (orange, EMD = 0.03) and CHEMPROP predicted gradient CDF (blue, EMD = 0.02) compared to the SolProp ground truth gradient CDF (black). d, e Cumulative residual of FASTPROP (orange) and CHEMPROP (blue) model predictions of \(\log S\) in the SolProp test set against (d) solute molecular weight (g/mol) and (e) solvent Wildman-Crippen \(\log P\). Cumulative residual is multiplied by 10−3 for concise axis labels. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Next, we compared model predictions on these solutions with multiple sources. Specifically, measurements of N-acetylglycine solubility in acetonitrile and methanol were compiled in BigSolDB from Zhao et al.39 and SolProp from Guo et al.40 In acetonitrile, the experimental data differ drastically, and the model predicts solubility values in good agreement with the measurements from Zhao et al.39 (Supporting Information Figure S3a). In methanol, the data from both sources are very similar, and the model predictions are in good agreement (Supporting Information Figure S3b).

It is possible that epistemic uncertainty from model inexpressiveness or error could cause this plateau in test performance. To investigate this point further we also benchmarked our models against state-of-the-art SMILES-based foundation models, MolFormer41 and ChemBERTa-242 by fine-tuning on BigSolDB (Supporting Information Section S5). These models are dramatically different in fundamental architecture and number of parameters compared to FASTPROP and CHEMPROP. We observe that our models outperform both of these transformer models on the SolProp and Leeds test sets (Supporting Information Figure S4). This demonstrates that model testing performance is not limited by model inexpressiveness or low model capacity.

Interestingly, the FASTPROP and CHEMPROP predictions on the SolProp dataset are highly correlated, with a Pearson's r = 0.81 (Fig. 5b). This correlation is actually stronger than the correlation of either model's predictions of the SolProp testing set itself (0.66 for FASTPROP and 0.65 for CHEMPROP). Additionally, comparing the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of predicted gradients of \(\log S\) with respect to temperature demonstrates the strong correlation between the FASTPROP and CHEMPROP model predictions (Fig. 5c). We observe that the Vermeire et al.31 model has severe systematic error in \(\frac{d\log S}{dT}\), achieving an Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) of 0.06. In contrast, our two models exhibit similar and highly accurate gradient distributions, with EMD of 0.03 and 0.02. See Supporting Information Section S1 for further details on model training and gradient-based regularization. To further examine whether the models are predicting similar results, we plot the cumulative residuals of each model against important features in the SolProp test set. The cumulative residuals against solute molecular weight (Fig. 5d) and solvent Wildman-Crippen estimate of \(\log P\)43 (Fig. 5e) both demonstrate that the FASTPROP and CHEMPROP models are making similar predictions and errors across the SolProp test set.

Here, we leveraged state-of-the-art cheminformatics software and large compiled solubility datasets to develop accurate and generalizable solubility models. Under strict extrapolation, we observe a 2-3 fold decrease in RMSE over the state-of-the-art model from Vermeire et al.31. In addition, the relative simplicity of the architecture decreases inference times up to fifty-fold. To the best of our knowledge, our models are the best performing solvent- and temperature-general models in the literature on solute extrapolation.

As shown in the solute Venn diagrams in Fig. 2, many entries in the SolProp testing set are present in the training set for the Vermeire et al.31 model. This focus on interpolation during training leads to decreased performance in the extrapolation study shown in Fig. 3, where the performance decreased from an RMSE of 1.43 to 2.16 when moving from the SolProp to Leeds test set. Furthermore, we observe some nonphysical gradients with respect to temperature in the SolProp dataset, indicating that the model has not learned a comprehensive functional approximation of the temperature dependence of \(\log S\).

In contrast, our optimized solution FASTPROP and solution CHEMPROP models exhibit much more consistent performance between the Leeds and SolProp test sets, highlighting the strong performance of our models under rigorous solute extrapolation (Fig. 3). The slightly decreased accuracy of our models on the Leeds test set is attributable to the increased solute diversity (Supporting Information Figure S5) and lack of de-factor averaging from multiple temperature measurements, artifacts of the difference in its construction.

Both of our models also exhibit accurate predictions of the gradient on the solubility with respect to temperature (Figs. 4 and 5c, Supporting Information Figures S2 and S3), indicating that the models learned physically realistic temperature dependence, which is critically important in process chemistry applications44,45. This can be attributed to both the training procedure, which leverages gradient-based regularization (Supporting Information Section S1), and directly training on the BigSolDB dataset, which contains abundant temperature gradient data. Notably, unlike the Vermeire et al.31 model, our models cannot take into account existing experimental reference data such as the free energy of solvation or Abraham solvation parameters, and in situations where such data is available, the Vermeire model could become more accurate.

Our evaluation of model performance on specific solutions also revealed that FASTSOLV accurately models temperature-dependence and correctly discriminates solubility between similar solvents, such as hexane and heptane (Fig. 4). Additionally, in cases where the model was accurate (Supporting Information Figure S2a–c), or relatively inaccurate (Supporting Information Figure S2d–f) in absolute performance, the model still correctly rank-ordered solubility in different solvents. Taken together, these results suggest that our model could readily be applied in high-throughput solvent screening workflows, which is crucial in synthetic46 and crystallization47 process development.

The training data size study and the error analysis presented in Fig. 5 show that our optimized models, which rely on distinct molecular mappings, both converge to the same performance limits with similar distributions of predictions and errors. The highly correlated predictions and cumulative residuals show both models achieve not only the same average performance, but predict similarly across the tests sets. Since CHEMPROP learns a molecular representation, this model should be able to continuously improve performance as the size of the training set increases, as demonstrated by both Heid et al.48 for several molecular properties and by Vermeire and Green49 for solvation free energy. However, the test performance of our optimized CHEMPROP-based model stops improving after a relatively small amount of training data, at which point variability in the testing data prevents us from discerning improved model performance. As detailed in Section 1.3, we evaluated a measure of the experimental variability present between the training set and test sets, arriving at a standard deviation of 0.34, and an RMSE of 0.75 (Supporting Information Section S3). This standard deviation is well below the average standard deviation range reported in literature (0.5–0.7), suggesting this measure of experimental variability is likely a conservative estimate of the true aleatoric limit. However, our model performance on the test set approaches even this conservative estimate of the aleatoric limit, particularly for the SolProp test set (RMSE = 0.83 for both models). The comparatively poor performance of transformer-based foundation models MolFormer and ChemBERTa also support our conclusion that model expressivity is not limiting performance, but rather aleatoric uncertainty.

In the context of aqueous solubility, Palmer and Mitchell16 compiled a curated set of highly accurate experimental measurements, concluding that model performance was limited by QSPR methods, rather than experimental variability. Since then, innovations in cheminformatics software have led to highly accurate and expressive model architectures which have been shown to perform excellently on molecular property prediction tasks33,34. We expect these flexible models to continue to improve as more training data are provided. However, as shown in Fig. 5a, there is no statistically significant reduction in test RMSE as thousands of additional data are added. These results instead suggest that experimental variability in the test data limits model performance and that better test data is needed to accurately assess the quality of our models. This affirms the observations in the Vermeire et al.31 study, wherein the model was found to perform better on more accurate testing data. Current literature trends toward aggregating larger databases of published experimental solubility values. However, we have demonstrated that fewer than 500 experiments from our training set are needed to achieve near-optimal performance. Compiling larger training databases will not reduce test RMSE beyond the aleatoric limit demonstrated here. Future work should create accurate testing datasets of solubility in organic solvents in the same manner as the CheqSol dataset of highly accurate aqueous solubility compiled by Palmer and Mitchell16 or apply careful, scientifically-informed curation as LLompart et al.50 performed on AqSolDB51. Further innovations in model architecture or compiling more training data may improve predictions but they will be difficult to discern without better test data.

In conclusion, we present organic solubility prediction models using deep learning on fixed and learned molecular representations, then test them under rigorous solute extrapolation. Our models outperform comparable literature models by a factor of 2-3 on publicly-available test sets. We demonstrate that our models predict near the aleatoric limit of the experimental test data, motivating the assembly of highly accurate testing datasets for the field to notice further improvements in organic solubility prediction. Given the importance of solid solubility prediction, we have termed the fixed representation model FASTSOLV due to its rapid inference time and taken extensive steps to make it available. FASTSOLV can be accessed via any web browser for free at fastsolv.mit.edu, downloaded as a python package for use in scripting (pypi.org/project/fastsolv/), and is integrated directly within the ASKCOS (askcos.mit.edu) platform for retrosynthesis.

Rigorous evaluation of extrapolation requires careful preparation of the data for training, validation, and testing. Overlapping solute structures in the testing and training data are dropped from the training data to avoid data leaks. The ASTARTES software package52 is then used to randomly partition entire experiments from the training data into validation and training sets, again ensuring that no solute structures are seen by the model in both sets. A single model contains four individual networks trained on a different random training set to account for the affect of random sampling. Reported predictions on a given test set are thus the average prediction across these four trained models, and reported prediction uncertainty is the standard deviation of these predictions.

Prior to arriving at the architecture shown in Fig. 1, more complex models inspired by the work of Pathak et al. were tested53. Extensive efforts were made to identify a physics-informed neural network architecture which would infuse inductive bias into the network and thereby improve predictions. Each of the following features was made available during the automated hyperparameter optimization such that the algorithm would automatically deduce which was the most effective:

To allow the network to learn a unique per-solvent and per-solute representation rather than a single ‘solution' representation, distinct linear layers could be added after the initial mapping for both the solute and the solvent. This reflects the intuitive understanding that each solute and solvent should have a unique contribution to the resulting solubility which is independent of the exact solution.

The manner in which the latent solute and solvent representations are combined was also configurable, with some choices including elementwise addition, subtraction, multiplication, or simple concatenation. These are analagous to existing solubility prediction models such as the multiplicative Abraham model.

To explore the resulting massive design space, we leveraged the Optuna hyperparameter optimization framework of Akiba et al.54 Across many repeated instances of optimization, the search algorithm always selected the comparatively simple architectures described in the present study. The addition of inductive bias was unable to surpass reliance on the comparatively simple architecture, at least given the current aleatoric limit of available data. See Supporting Information S1 for further details, including a complete table of the search space explored in this work.

Sobolev training55 was implemented for both the Chemprop- and FASTPROP- based FASTSOLV models. This approach penalizes the network during training for both the error in the prediction of the solubility and the gradient of the predicted solubility with respect to the input temperature. The latter is approximated from the input data using finite differences, a reasonable approximation for the typically monotonic and locally-linear solubility curves. During training the gradient is found by continuing backpropagation through all network layers, as is usually done, and additionally the input temperature. The effect of Sobolev training is that networks generally converge in fewer epochs, have substantially increased accuracy relative to experimental gradients, and are stronger interpolators. The latter is of specific interest in some process applications of FASTSOLV. During inference, the FASTSOLV model will not continually increase predicted solubility past an input temperature of approximately 350 K. This is a deliberate design choice, given that many common organic solvents boil at or near this temperature: ethanol (351.5 K), benzene (353.2 K), acetonitrile (355.1 K), methyl ethyl ketone (352.8 K), hexane (341.8 K), tetrahydrofuran (339.1 K), and ethyl acetate (350.2 K).

The performance trajectory shown in Fig. 5 is generated by gradually increasing the amount of training data available to the model. The model is trained in the same manner as described in Section 1.1, actually containing four separate networks trained on different random selections of the downsampled data. At first the model sees only a small number of experiments during training before subsequent testing on the holdout sets. The amount is gradually increased to the full size of the dataset, analogous to performing more solubility experiments to gather more samples in hopes of improving model performance.

Identifying a reliable biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is crucial for clinical practice. Here, in this cross-sectional study, we used the Olink Explore 3072 platform to investigate plasma proteomics as a biomarker tool for this neurodegenerative condition. Thirty-three proteins were differentially abundant in the plasma of patients with ALS (n = 183) versus controls (n = 309). We replicated our findings in an independent cohort (n = 48 patients with ALS and n = 75 controls). We then applied machine learning to create a model that diagnosed ALS with high accuracy (area under the curve, 98.3%). By analyzing plasma samples from individuals before ALS symptoms emerged, we estimated the age of clinical onset and showed that the disease process—impacting skeletal muscle, nerves and energy metabolism—occurs years before symptoms appear. Our research suggests that plasma proteins can be a biomarker for this fatal disease and offers molecular insights into its prodromal phase.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons. This degeneration leads to muscle weakness, atrophy and, ultimately, respiratory failure, typically resulting in death within 2–4 years after symptoms begin1. By 2040, the global population of individuals living with ALS worldwide is projected to approach 400,000 (ref. 2). The substantial number of cases and the high cost associated with their care pose a substantial burden on communities and healthcare systems2. In the United States, the only approved treatments for sporadic ALS are riluzole and edaravone. There is an urgent need for better medications; however, the necessity to recruit large numbers of patients with ALS into clinical trials to assess drug effectiveness hinders therapeutic development3.

Currently, diagnosing ALS relies on clinical symptoms and neurological evaluations, much like the methods used 155 years ago when Jean-Martin Charcot first identified the disease4. Although neurophysiological studies and genetic tests are supportive tools for clinical decision-making, no definitive diagnostic test exists5. Patients frequently experience delays of 6–18 months until their symptoms become severe enough to establish a diagnosis6. Even when there is clear evidence of motor neuron dysfunction, differentiating ALS from other neurological conditions can be difficult because the disease presents with heterogeneous clinical manifestations7. This uncertainty can be unsettling for patients and their families. Moreover, it causes delays in entering clinical trials and limits the number of eligible participants due to enrollment restrictions for patients with more severe disability8. In the future, when effective treatments become available for ALS, diagnostic delays may impede treatment initiation, harming patient outcomes.

We addressed this critical knowledge gap by generating and analyzing data for 3,072 plasma proteins within a large ALS case–control cohort. These well-characterized patients had genetic data readily available, allowing us to incorporate these factors into our search for differentially abundant proteins and to use a multiomic approach to determine if the observed plasma protein changes occurred because of the disease process or were primary drivers in the pathogenesis of ALS. Using machine learning, we identified a distinct molecular signature in plasma that effectively differentiates ALS cases from healthy individuals and other neurological disorders. Additionally, we explored whether our model could predict when symptoms would start in asymptomatic individuals who later developed ALS. Notably, we established a public resource for the scientific community to encourage and advance biomarker research in this fatal neurodegenerative disease.

After quality control, we obtained data for 2,886 proteins from 231 individuals diagnosed with ALS and 384 control individuals (n = 214 healthy individuals and n = 170 with other neurological conditions). Patients with other neurological disorders were included as control data, as our central hypothesis was to use proteomics to distinguish ALS cases both from healthy individuals and from other relevant conditions. Participants were recruited from an Italian population-based ALS registry and a US natural history study, and they were diagnosed with ALS based on established consensus criteria9,10. Extended Data Table 1 lists the demographics and clinical features of the cohorts used in this study.

The proteomic data, measured using the Olink Explore 3072 assay in plasma samples, exhibited median intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 9.9% and 22.3%, respectively, confirming the platform's reliability11. Figure 1 gives an overview of the study and analysis. We randomly designated 80% of the samples as the Discovery Cohort (n = 183 ALS cases versus n = 172 healthy controls plus n = 137 other neurological diseases). The remaining samples constituted the Replication Cohort (n = 48 ALS cases versus n = 42 healthy controls plus n = 33 other neurological diseases).

We conducted a cross-sectional study to identify ALS biomarkers via proteomic analysis of plasma samples. We performed differential abundance analysis on proteomic data generated from plasma samples of patients with ALS, healthy controls and patients with other neurological diseases in both the Discovery Cohort and the Replication Cohort. The other neurological diseases included corticobasal syndrome (n = 8 patients), Lewy body dementia (n = 8 patients), multiple system atrophy (n = 5 patients), Parkinson's disease (n = 153 patients), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 19 patients) and dementia, not otherwise specified (n = 1 patient). After this, we applied supervised machine learning using plasma protein levels and clinical parameters to identify a molecular signature of ALS. The same samples from the Discovery Cohort and the Replication Cohort sequentially formed the Training Set and the Testing Set in the machine learning process. The 46 samples withheld from the initial analyses due to the absence of genetic data were labeled as External Validation Set 1. For External Validation Set 2, we obtained proteomic data from the UK Biobank18. Additionally, a web tool was created for clinical researchers to analyze their own data. ‘Neurological' pertains to neurological conditions other than ALS. 1°, first degree; UKB, UK Biobank.

We conducted proteome-wide association testing of individual plasma protein levels using generalized linear regression. Our analyses were adjusted for the following confounding factors: age at sample collection, self-reported sex and the collection tube type (that is, EDTA or heparin). Furthermore, we incorporated the first two uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) components derived from genetic data of the study participants to manage population stratification.

In total, 33 plasma proteins exceeded the significance threshold in the Discovery Cohort (adjusted false discovery rate (FDR) P < 0.05; Table 1 and Fig. 2a). The protein with the highest differential protein abundance was neurofilament light chain (NEFL, log2 fold change = 2.34, adjusted FDR P = 2.22 × 10−88), which is known to be elevated in ALS and various neurological diseases12. Notably, LIF encodes leukemia inhibitory factor, a neurotrophic cytokine that may promote motor neuron survival in vivo and in vitro13. The remaining 31 proteins have not been definitively linked to ALS previously.

The dotted vertical lines delineate a ±1.4-fold change threshold, and the dotted horizontal lines represent the 0.05 P-value threshold. Blue and red dots denote statistically significant downregulated or upregulated proteins determined by generalized linear regression (adjusted to 5% FDR for multiple comparisons). b, Volcano plot showing the differential abundance of proteins in the Replication Cohort (n = 48 ALS cases versus n = 42 healthy controls and n = 33 other neurological diseases). Black circles highlight the proteins that were significant in the Discovery Cohort. c, Scatter plot comparing the discovery and replication z-scores of the 33 proteins significantly associated with ALS in the Discovery Cohort. The error band is shown as a gray band representing the 95% confidence interval for the mean prediction (blue linear regression line) at each x value. Pearson correlation coefficients (R) were calculated to assess the linear association between variables. P values were computed using a two-sided test of the null hypothesis that the correlation coefficient equals 0. d, A comparison of the proteins significantly associated with ALS in plasma and their abundances in CSF. The CSF protein levels were derived from SomaScan data generated for n = 14 ALS cases and n = 89 healthy controls. The 6 proteins significantly correlated with ALS in the CSF are highlighted in color, whereas the other 21 appear in gray. The additional six proteins were not tested by the SomaScan platform. The y axis indicates a log2(fold change) relative to the control cohort.

We verified the differential abundance of the proteins (n = 14 of 33) identified in the Discovery Cohort within the independent Replication Cohort, which similarly included ALS cases, healthy controls and individuals with other neurological diseases (Table 1 and Fig. 2b). The other proteins (n = 9) also showed the same directional effect observed in the Discovery Cohort (Table 1), leading to a high concordance of 0.83 between the discovery and replication analyses for the 33 proteins (Fig. 2c; R = 0.83, P = 1.80 × 10−9). Additional validation was performed using sensitivity analyses (Extended Data Table 2), comparisons with quantitative ELISAs (Extended Data Fig. 1) and analyses against SomaScan 7K proteomic data (Extended Data Fig. 2).

We performed a comparative analysis to assess plasma protein levels in patients with ALS with C9orf72 expansions (n = 29) against those lacking these expansions (n = 202). Our aim was to discover plasma biomarkers linked to this prevalent genetic mutation. This exploratory analysis identified eight significantly upregulated proteins in ALS C9orf72 carriers compared with non-carriers (Extended Data Fig. 3a and Extended Data Table 3). We also compared ALS C9orf72 carriers (n = 29) with non-carrier patients with ALS (n = 202) plus a control group (n = 383, which included 169 neurological control non-carriers and 214 healthy control non-carriers). The same eight proteins were elevated among ALS C9orf72 carriers compared with controls, suggesting that these protein changes are associated with the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion (Extended Data Fig. 3b and Extended Data Table 3).

We performed additional exploratory analysis to assess whether asymptomatic C9orf72 carriers (n = 12) displayed a different proteomic profile compared with symptomatic C9orf72 carriers (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Our results indicated that specific proteins (including EIF2S2, HPCAL1, JPT2, MTIF3, PDAP1 and SMAD3), which are elevated in symptomatic carriers, did not demonstrate significant changes in asymptomatic carriers and may, therefore, have potential as biomarkers for phenoconversion.

We investigated whether the proteins with differential abundance in plasma were similarly impacted in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). For this analysis, we extracted individual protein measurements from SomaScan data generated using CSF from 14 ALS cases and 89 healthy controls for this analysis. Variations were modeled using a generalized linear regression, adjusting for age and sex. Out of the 33 proteins, 27 were assayed on the SomaScan platform. Notably, five proteins—HSPB6, MEGF10, NEFL, RNASE3 and TPM3—demonstrated significant increases in the CSF of patients with ALS (Fig. 2d). The other proteins did not show significant differences in the CSF of patients with ALS (Table 1).

An enrichment analysis of the 33 plasma proteins linked to ALS uncovered significant associations with multiple biological processes (Fig. 3a). Most of the identified pathways showed a strong connection with skeletal muscle and neuronal function (Fig. 3b). These results highlight the importance of cellular pathways involved in ‘skeletal muscle development and degeneration', ‘energy metabolism' and ‘NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity', corroborating earlier research in ALS14,15,16.

a, Functional enrichment analysis of ALS based on the differentially abundant plasma proteins (n = 33) performed using the ‘clusterProfiler' software package. The x axis corresponds to the fold enrichment of the category in ALS cases compared with controls. A one-sided t-test was used to test for enrichment of genes in a particular pathway, followed by FDR correction to account for multiple testing comparisons. The size of each respective dot indicates the FDR-adjusted P value on a −log10 scale. Significant Gene Ontology (GO) enrichments for biological processes (BP, blue), molecular functions (MF, orange) and cellular functions (CC, green) as well as pathways from Reactome (magenta) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (light blue) are shown. b, The three main BPs identified in ALS based on the enrichment analysis of the differentially abundant plasma proteins are shown. The proteins involved in each category are listed. Panels a and b created with BioRender.com.

We leveraged the comprehensive multiomic data available for our cohorts to explore the relevance of the differentially abundant proteins that we observed in the ALS cases in the pathogenesis of the condition. To do this, we examined whether genetic factors affected the levels of the differentially abundant proteins. First, we searched for evidence of genetic association in the autosomal genes (n = 31) related to the proteins that we identified in ALS, using data from a large ALS genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 27,205 cases and n = 110,881 controls)17. None of the tested loci showed evidence of association.

Next, we implemented two-sample Mendelian randomization using merged summary-level ALS GWAS data17 alongside cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data for the 33 plasma proteins with differential abundance in ALS18. This approach helps identify proteins whose levels correlate with ALS through shared causal variants. Extended Data Table 4 shows that none of the analyses reached statistical significance, reaffirming that the differential protein abundance levels seen in patients with ALS are not directly driven by inherited genetic variation encoding the levels of these proteins.

We performed supervised machine learning, hypothesizing that this method would identify a molecular signature of ALS when applied to a proteomic dataset from a well-characterized cohort. Our main goal was to create a binary classification model to distinguish patients with ALS from control individuals. The initial features used to build the machine learning model included the differentially abundant proteins (n = 33) and clinical parameters, including age at sample collection, sex and blood collection tube type (total number of features = 36). The system was trained on the 183 ALS cases and 309 control individuals used as the Discovery Cohort in the differential abundance analysis (now referred to as the Training Set based on standard machine learning terminology; see Fig. 1 for the analysis flowchart). We evaluated the model's accuracy using the 48 ALS cases and 75 control individuals used as the Replication Cohort in the differential abundance analysis (now called the Testing Set).

Ten supervised machine learning algorithms were evaluated (listed in Extended Data Table 5). Of these, the random forest algorithm generated the best-performing model (Extended Data Table 5). After secondary feature selection, 20 features (17 proteins, sex, age at sample collection and plasma collection tube) were identified as the most predictive for discriminating ALS cases from healthy individuals and patients with other neurological diseases (Fig. 4a); the area under the curve (AUC) and balanced accuracy of this model were 96.2% and 89.3%, respectively, when evaluated in the Testing Set (n = 48 ALS cases versus n = 42 healthy controls plus n = 33 other neurological diseases) (Fig. 4b).

a, The mean importance score of the 20 features (17 proteins plus sex, age at collection and blood collection tube type) making up the random forest model. The importance score quantifies the contribution of each feature, when permuted, to the model's predictive performance. Features are ranked from most influential at the top (NEFL) to the least influential at the bottom (sex). Error bars represent the s.d. of the mean feature importance estimates across 100 repeated permutations. b, The performance of the random forest model is displayed as ROC curves. The ROC curves show the performance of the Testing Set (green, n = 48 ALS versus n = 42 healthy controls plus n = 32 other neurological diseases; one other neurological disease sample was excluded due to incomplete protein data), the External Validation Set 1 (red, n = 14 ALS versus n = 15 healthy controls plus n = 17 other neurological diseases) and the External Validation Set 2 (yellow, n = 13 ALS versus n = 23,601 healthy controls). The black curve denotes the average AUC across these three cohorts. c, Classification of individual samples using the ALS risk scores generated by the random forest model using the 20 features. The white area on the right denotes ALS risk scores consistent with a diagnosis of ALS. In contrast, the gray area on the left, which was manually added to the plot, delineates scores consistent with healthy control status or other neurological diseases. A black circle around a dot indicates a sample misclassified by the model.

We also examined how the exclusion of NEFL affected the predictive accuracy of the random forest model. When NEFL was removed as a feature, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) declined by 2.4% to 13.2% across the Testing (89.8%), External Validation Set 1 (96.2%) and External Validation Set 2 (85.9%) datasets, indicating that the model's performance is not solely dependent on NEFL. Instead, it relies on the contributions of the other 19 features, which include 16 proteins as well as factors such as sex, age at sample collection and the type of plasma collection tube, to accurately classify samples as either ALS or control.

We validated our model using two external sample sets that were not part of the training or testing process (Fig. 1). External Validation Set 1 consisted of 46 samples assayed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which were withheld from the primary analysis due to inadequate genetic data. External Validation Set 2 comprised Olink Explore 3072 data from the UK Biobank, including 13 ALS cases and 23,601 controls. Notably, the proteomic data for External Validation Set 1 were normalized with the same bridging samples used in the Testing Set and Training Set. In contrast, the data from External Validation Set 2 (UK Biobank) did not undergo this normalization process.

The AUC and balanced accuracy for the 46 samples tested at the NIH as part of the External Validation Set 1 were 99.8% and 96.4%, respectively (Fig. 4b). Despite the absence of normalization or bridging samples, External Validation Set 2 (UK Biobank) still achieved high AUC and balanced accuracy values of 99.1% and 88.1%, respectively (Fig. 4b). Overall, the supervised machine learning algorithm diagnosed 62 patients (82.7%) out of 75 ALS and correctly identified 23,548 healthy individuals (99.3%) of the 23,707 in the Testing Set, External Validation Set 1 and External Validation Set 2 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Table 5). We then used the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach to illustrate each feature's contribution to the predictions made for each sample (Extended Data Fig. 4)19,20. Finally, we calculated an ALS risk score for every sample from the aggregated SHAP values, scaled between 0 and 100 using the minimum and maximum aggregated SHAP values from the Training Set samples.

We conducted additional analyses of the model's predictive performance for a group of individuals (n = 355) diagnosed with neuropathy (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes G60–G64) or myopathy (ICD-10 codes G70–G73) using data from the UK Biobank. The random forest model successfully identified 333 (93.8%) individuals as non-ALS cases, demonstrating its capability to differentiate ALS from similar conditions.

We identified individuals (n = 110) who had plasma samples taken before the onset of their ALS symptoms (n = 109 samples from the UK Biobank and n = 1 sample from our cohort; mean duration from plasma sampling to symptom onset = 6.4 years, range: 2.0–14.0 years). For those individuals whose genetic data were available, 12 were confirmed to carry the C9orf72 repeat expansion. We used these data points to examine how our machine learning model behaved prior to symptom onset. A significant association was found between the ALS risk score and the time to symptom onset, with the ALS risk score increasing progressively as patients approached symptom onset (based on n = 110 asymptomatic samples and n = 251 ALS cases that were within 5 years of symptom onset; slope coefficient = 4.48, slope P = 1.40 × 10−49, R2 of the regression model = 0.74 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 14.39; Fig. 5a). Notably, this increase in ALS risk score was not due to aging, as individuals with other neurological diseases, healthy individuals or even patients with ALS after they had received their diagnosis did not display the same trend (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

a, Scatter plot comparing the ALS risk score based on the random forest model and the years before symptom onset in patients with ALS. The purple dots represent plasma samples taken from presymptomatic individuals (n = 109 from the UK Biobank and n = 1 from this study) who subsequently developed ALS. The orange dots denote plasma samples taken from individuals with ALS cases in the Training Set, the Testing Set and External Validation Sets 1 and 2 (n = 251 ALS cases whose samples were collected within 5 years of symptom onset). The regression line with the 95% confidence interval for the mean prediction is presented as a black line with a gray band. The slope, associated P value, R2 and RMSE of the regression model are displayed. The statistical significance of each coefficient was assessed using a two-sided hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that the coefficient equals 0. The vertical dashed line indicates the rough boundary between presymptomatic individuals and those diagnosed with ALS. The data sourced from the UK Biobank are represented in whole years, explaining why some cases seem to exhibit symptoms prior to 0 years. b, The slope coefficients of the 17 plasma protein levels included in the random forest model when regressed individually against the time to symptom onset. Data are presented as estimated coefficient values from linear regression ± s.e., and the P values derived from two-sided hypothesis testing are displayed. The color of the bars denotes the Olink panel category of the protein: yellow, cardiometabolic panel; red, inflammation; green, neurology; blue, oncology.

We investigated which proteins may be altered during the prodromal period. After adjusting for collection age, sex and plasma source, we found that 10 proteins making up the model were individually linked to the time until symptom onset when analyzing asymptomatic individuals and ALS cases together (n = 361) (Fig. 5b). The protein with the most significant positive coefficient was NEFL (slope coefficient = 0.147, slope P = 6.37 × 10−16), followed by CSRP3 (slope coefficient = 0.121, slope P = 4.55 × 10−5). In the analysis concentrating exclusively on patients with ALS (n = 251) or asymptomatic individuals (n = 110), only NEFL demonstrated a meaningful correlation with the time to symptom onset (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Interestingly, the slope coefficients revealed opposing trends: NEFL levels sharply increased in asymptomatic individuals as the time to onset approached zero, whereas, in patients with ALS, NEFL levels significantly decreased as the time since onset lengthened.

Clinicians have long sought a reliable method to diagnose ALS. Such knowledge could substantially improve patient care, assist in clinical trials and offer insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms21,22. In this study, we analyzed proteomic data from a well-characterized cohort to identify a unique molecular signature in the plasma of patients with ALS that could serve as a biomarker. We identified a panel of 33 differentially abundant proteins in ALS and validated our findings across multiple independent datasets, showing that the same protein profile can differentiate ALS from other neurological diseases, including clinically relevant differential diagnoses such as myopathies and neuropathies. We used multiomic data (that is, genetic data) from this well-characterized cohort to determine that these changes are likely secondary to the disease process. Additionally, we demonstrated that the ALS risk score computed from our machine learning model could be used as a proxy for forecasting the age at which symptoms may appear in individuals. Our data also suggest that the underlying disease process happens considerably earlier than was previously recognized. Pathway analysis showed that the relevant proteins are linked to cellular processes known to be involved in ALS23, confirming the effectiveness of our data-driven approach and supporting the reliability of our findings.

The key challenges in developing proteomic biomarkers for ALS have been the need for a sufficiently large dataset and the difficulty in analyzing multidimensional relationships. To address these issues, we used plasma samples from a population-based ALS registry that had enrolled patients over an extended period within a defined geographical area9,24. This registry collected data throughout the patientsʼ illness, providing detailed clinical information that informed our categorization efforts19. Our results underscore the value of disease registries in capturing the clinical heterogeneity of the ALS population19. The availability of multiomic data, particularly genetic data that allow for a more careful delineation of the protein signals, adds to the strength of these cohorts for research.

To date, the development of biomarkers for ALS has primarily relied on the study of single analytes, such as neurofilaments25. Although univariate biomarker systems hold clinical value, it is increasingly evident that they fail to capture the complexity of neurodegenerative diseases, raising concerns about their accuracy and sensitivity25,26. In contrast, the machine learning algorithms that we applied were adept at deciphering multifaceted relationships within data19,27. We generated data for almost 3,000 proteins across multiple samples to facilitate these analyses28. The accuracy of Olink has been validated through comparisons with proteomic measurements based on ELISA and mass spectrometry29,30,31,32,33,34, establishing it as an emerging standard in the field35. Our finding of a subset of 17 proteins (listed in Fig. 4)—attributable to multiple pathways—confirms the multiplex nature of ALS and the appropriateness of our machine learning approach for multimodal biomarker development.

We opted for plasma in our proteomic analysis due to its greater accessibility compared with CSF. Crucially, a biomarker derived from blood can facilitate early ALS evaluations, even by non-specialists36. Such testing may streamline referral to multidisciplinary ALS clinics, leading to earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes37. Additionally, biomarkers obtained through venipuncture simplify the enrollment process for clinical trials, thereby reducing costs and participant burden38. Examining the proteomic profile of CSF collected by lumbar puncture may incrementally improve diagnostic accuracy, as these biospecimens are in direct contact with the extracellular space of the brain and spinal cord, reflecting biochemical changes in the central nervous system39. Nevertheless, in neuromuscular diseases, plasma-based biomarkers may be better at measuring changes in the neuromuscular compartment than CSF, which is corroborated by our pathway analysis showing changes in the peripheral tissues. The biomarker field is evolving40; one possible outcome of this research is that plasma-based biomarkers could act as a screening tool for ALS, and CSF assays could provide subsequent confirmation.

We identified a unique set of plasma proteins that distinguishes ALS from healthy individuals and other neurological diseases. The NEFL protein, a proven ALS marker, is part of this panel, supporting our data-driven hypothesis-free approach25,41. However, the real breakthrough is the discovery of 16 additional proteins through predictive modeling, which substantially enhances ALS classification accuracy. The selection of these proteins, which have not been previously linked to ALS, highlights how proteomics and machine learning can provide fresh insights into complex diseases.

For instance, our enrichment analysis identified links between ALS and various biological pathways, particularly those involving skeletal muscle, neurons and energy metabolism. Notably, these changes may occur as many as 10 years prior to symptom onset. Several conclusions can be drawn from these findings. First, our research demonstrates that it is possible to detect the earliest stages of the disease at a molecular level. Our protein panel could act as a biomarker for this prodromal phase of ALS, similar to the biomarkers currently used in Alzheimer's disease42. This capability will greatly improve clinical trials for presymptomatic patients with ALS, which typically rely on natural history studies to determine the expected rate of symptom conversion. Although there may be some noise in these measurements, longitudinal biomarker monitoring may detect an increase in their ALS risk score, indicating a molecular disease onset and predicting phenoconversion.

Second, the processes associated with the disease happen much earlier than previously thought; NEFL has been shown to increase 12 months before symptoms appear43. However, we discovered that the ALS risk score, determined by plasma protein levels, begins to shift in presymptomatic individuals up to 10 years before symptoms emerge, hitting the 50th percentile around 5 years prior to onset. This change in viewpoint again underscores the power of data-driven research to reveal unexpected insights into the pathophysiology of complex diseases. Our comprehensive genetic analyses revealed no evidence that genetic factors directly influence changes in plasma proteins. This suggests that the observed alterations in proteins are likely secondary effects or may originate from indirect mechanisms such as posttranscriptional or posttranslational regulation. Indeed, many of the observed changes, such as muscle regeneration and catabolic changes in energy metabolism, suggest a compensatory phase that occurs in patients with ALS long before symptom onset. However, we cannot rule out that primary muscle pathophysiology could still play an undiscovered role in the development of ALS15.

Our primary analysis focused on general ALS; however, we also uncovered preliminary evidence of distinct plasma proteomic profiles among ALS subpopulations. Notably, we identified eight elevated proteins in patients with a pathogenic C9orf72 repeat expansion (Extended Data Table 3). None of these proteins was altered in the general ALS cohort, indicating that their changes may be specific to C9orf72 carriers. These preliminary findings need confirmation in a larger sample cohort, ideally accompanied by longitudinal data, to explore how these proteins might relate to phenoconversion in C9orf72 carriers.

Our study has limitations. The proteomic platform that we used quantifies approximately 3,000 proteins, which represents a substantial number of the total number of proteins in human plasma44,45. The unmeasured portion likely includes tissue proteins acting as markers of leakage and immunoglobulins that mirror the host's immune response45, some of which may be connected to ALS. Additionally, the Olink assay cannot detect new proteins, limiting its effectiveness in investigating the role of novel proteins generated by cryptic splicing in ALS pathogenesis46. Future studies will investigate these broader proteomic approaches and incorporate longitudinal data collection to further validate and enhance the performance of our model.

The CSF analysis was conducted on a limited number of samples (n = 14 ALS cases and n = 89 healthy controls), which might not entirely reflect the range of protein abundance variations. However, we showed that specific proteins identified in plasma also exhibited variations in the CSF of patients with ALS. We are in the process of increasing our collection of CSF samples to facilitate further research on these and other potential proteins.

Despite the absence of shared bridging controls between our study and the UK Biobank's Olink data, our plasma protein biomarker panel achieved over 99% accuracy in predicting the ALS or control status of 23,614 European individuals in the UK Biobank cohort. It was also able to distinguish patients with diseases such as neuropathies and myopathies that can mimic ALS. Nonetheless, a larger case–control cohort with greater ancestral diversity is necessary for additional validation to assess the global applicability of our predictive model.

In conclusion, we discovered a unique molecular profile through proteomic analysis of plasma samples from patients with ALS. This protein signature serves as a crucial factor for diagnosing ALS and distinguishes it from other neurological disorders with high specificity and sensitivity (AUC > 98%). Furthermore, the same proteomic approach enables us to predict symptom conversion in individuals who have not yet exhibited ALS symptoms. Our data-driven strategy, powered by machine learning, shows how proteomics can enhance ALS diagnosis and reshape understanding of this complex disease, suggesting that the prodromal phase happens much earlier than previously recognized.

This study was a cross-sectional analysis of plasma proteomic data to identify a biomarker panel for ALS. Samples were obtained from participants from the United States and Italy. Recruitment sites were located at the University of Turin in Turin, Italy; the NIH in Bethesda and Baltimore, Maryland; and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

Written consent was obtained from all individuals enrolled in this study. The institutional review boards of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) (protocol numbers 03-AG-0325 and 03-AG-N329); the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (01-N-0206, 13-N-0188 and 17-N-0131); the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (09-I-0032); Johns Hopkins University (00173663); and the University of Turin (004462) approved the study.

From September 2008 through February 2023, 281 patients with ALS and 258 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study at the University of Turin and the NIH. The Italian samples consisted of neurologically healthy individuals (n = 196) and patients diagnosed with ALS (n = 236) living in Northern Italy and recruited in a population-based study known as the Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta Registry for ALS (PARALS; established 1 January 1995)9. The registry's near-complete case ascertainment of ALS among its catchment population of almost 4.5 million inhabitants ensures the applicability of our findings9. The US plasma samples comprised patients diagnosed with ALS (n = 45) evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, as part of a natural history study (NCT03225144)47 and control samples collected as part of the NIH Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (n = 53, NCT00233272)48 and at the Johns Hopkins Hospital (n = 9). The control samples for the CSF analyses (n = 89) were collected under an NIAID natural history protocol (NCT00794352).

Figure 1 shows the study workflow. The patients with ALS were diagnosed according to the revised El Escorial criteria10 by a neurologist specializing in ALS. Patients with familial and sporadic ALS and self-declared diverse ancestry (n = 3 Hispanic samples) were included in the study, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the ALS population. The control individuals were selected based on their lack of a diagnosis of ALS, neurological disease and cognitive decline in their clinical history. The control cohorts were matched to the case cohorts for race and ethnicity but not for sex or age, although the age distribution was similar (Extended Data Table 1).

We also assembled a cohort of individuals with other neurological conditions (n = 194, listed in Extended Data Table 1) as an additional comparison cohort. Plasma samples were collected from these participants at the NIH Clinical Center (n = 172) and Johns Hopkins University (n = 22). The other neurological disease cohort included patients diagnosed with the following conditions: corticobasal syndrome (n = 8 patients) was diagnosed according to the Armstrong criteria49; patients with Lewy body dementia (n = 8) were diagnosed with clinically probable disease according to consensus criteria50,51; the multiple system atrophy (n = 5) cases were diagnosed according to the Gilman criteria52; and Parkinson's disease (n = 153) and progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 19) were diagnosed based on the 2015 and 2017 Movement Disorders Society criteria, respectively53,54. One patient was labeled as having dementia, not otherwise specified, after clinical evaluation.

The plasma samples were collected via phlebotomy of the upper limb. The patients were not fasting. The Italian samples (n = 427) were mainly collected using heparin tubes, and the remaining samples (n = 306) were collected using EDTA tubes. Blood cells were removed by centrifugation within 2 hours of collection, and the supernatant, consisting of the plasma, was carefully removed without disturbing the cell pellet. All plasma samples were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The number of freeze–thaw cycles between aliquoting and running the proteomic assays was minimized, typically one but no more than three.

The CSF samples (n = 14) were collected via lumbar puncture with the patient sitting upright. A 22-gauge Sprotte spinal needle was used and inserted at the L3/L4 level. The CSF was collected in polypropylene tubes, immediately placed on ice and sent to the laboratory for processing within 30 minutes. All samples were gathered at a single location, the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland (NCT03109288).

For each study participant, we performed proteomic profiling on the plasma samples using the Olink Explore 3072 assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation at the NIA, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Olink Explore 3072 assay quantifies 2,926 proteins (https://olink.com/products/olink-explore-3072-384) with high accuracy and specificity11. In brief, the platform is based on oligonucleotide-labeled antibody pairs that bind to their target protein in solution11. When both antibodies are close, their oligonucleotide tails hybridize and undergo extension by a DNA polymerase. This molecular process generates a unique, double-stranded DNA barcode, which is subsequently amplified and quantified using next-generation sequencing (Illumina NovaSeq).

We implemented quality control, normalization and data calibration at the probe, sample and plate levels11. Inter-plate sample controls (n = 2 per 96-well plate) were used to normalize for inter-plate variation. Proteins that did not meet the default standard Olink quality control criteria were excluded from the analysis. These steps were conducted using Olink software (version 1.0). Normalized Protein eXpression (NPX) values, representing the log2-transformed ratio of sample assay counts to extension control counts, were used as the final assay readout; a higher value corresponded to a higher protein expression or abundance levels11. Replicate samples (n = 3 per plate), referred to as bridging samples, were used to calculate both intra-plate and inter-plate coefficients of variation. These bridging samples are independent of the inter-plate sample controls. The coefficients of variation (%) were determined using the following formula: (s.d./mean of the replicate measurements) × 100. Samples with median NPX values (calculated from all proteins in each sample) that deviated by more than 3 s.d. from the mean of the median NPX values of all samples, as well as samples exceeding 3 s.d. from the mean of the interquartile range, were flagged as outliers and excluded from the analysis.

Olink data from the UK Biobank were obtained through the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (https://www.dnanexus.com/partnerships/ukbiobank). ALS cases were defined as individuals diagnosed with ICD-10 code G12.2 and confirmed at death55 and had their blood collected up to 1 year before symptom onset. Control samples were defined as individuals without a recorded diagnosis of myopathy (ICD-10 codes G70–G73) or neuropathy (ICD-10 codes G60–G64).

DNA obtained from the same participants also underwent whole-genome sequencing on a HiSeq X10 sequencer (Illumina; n = 476, 150-bp paired-end reads, 35× coverage)56 or genotyping on Infinium GDA-8+ NeuroBooster BeadChips (version 1.0, Illumina; n = 245), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Standard sample-level and variant-level quality control procedures were applied to the genetic datasets, and variants were extracted for the principal component analysis, performed using ‘flashPCA' (version 2.0). Principal components 1–10 were reduced to two dimensions using UMAP version 0.2.10. These two UMAP values were used to correct for population stratification in the statistical analysis of the individual protein analytes57.

Although methods such as ADMIXTURE can provide percentage estimates of ancestry, the UMAP approach offers a direct and efficient way to control for confounding in our association analyses. Notably, reanalysis using all ten principal components yielded nearly identical results, confirming that the two-component UMAP adjustment sufficiently controlled for stratification in our study cohorts.

Samples that passed Olink's quality control were divided into two cohorts at an 80:20 ratio, labeled as the Discovery/Training and Replication/Testing datasets. The terms ‘Discovery' and ‘Replication' refer to differential protein abundance analysis, whereas ‘Training' and ‘Testing' pertain to machine learning analysis. To accurately represent cohort characteristics in the datasets, samples were matched by diagnostic groups (ALS, healthy controls and neurological controls) and the type of tube used for collection, as implemented in the ‘caret' software package (version 6.0-94). We also balanced the selection of the Italian and United States samples across the Discovery and Replication cohorts. The Training Set included 492 individuals (n = 183 ALS cases, n = 172 healthy controls and n = 137 individuals with other neurological conditions). The Testing Set included 123 individuals (n = 48 ALS cases, n = 42 healthy controls and n = 33 individuals with other neurological diseases) (see Fig. 1 for the flowchart).

We performed a cross-sectional association analysis between plasma protein abundances and the diagnosis of ALS. The following generalized linear model was used to evaluate the relationship between an individual protein's abundance and ALS status: NPXi = β1 × ALSi + β2 × agei + β3 × sexi + β4 × tubetypei + β5 × UMAP1i + β6 × UMAP2i, where NPXi represents the NPX value for individual i; ALSi is a binary indicator for ALS diagnosis (1 for ALS, 0 for control); agei is the age at sample collection; sexi is the reported sex of the individual; tubetypei indicates the plasma collection tube type (heparin or EDTA); and UMAP1i and UMAP2i are the first two components of the UMAP projection of genetic data. The absence of a constant term means that there is no intercept (β0) in the model. This model was implemented using the ‘limma' package (version 3.58.1) in R. In our analysis, all covariates were included in the model simultaneously. In alignment with our primary analysis, the regression model for the patients carrying the C9orf72 expansion was adjusted for sex, age at sample collection, the type of plasma collection tube and the first two dimensions of UMAP based on genetic data.

Multiple comparisons were controlled using the FDR procedure defined by Benjamini and Hochberg, and two-sided FDR-adjusted P values are reported in Table 1, Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 2. The significance threshold was set at an FDR P value of 0.05. Our Discovery Cohort, comprising 183 cases and 309 controls, had 80% power to detect a differentially abundant protein with an effect size (Cohen's f statistic) of 0.242, assuming a significance threshold P value of 1.73 × 10−5. All analyses were conducted using R (version 4.3.2).

We used z-scores to compare the effect sizes of differentially abundant proteins in the Discovery and Replication cohorts. We used z-scores in this comparison because they provide an accurate statistical representation of the difference in effect size between cases and controls by taking into account the s.e. of the effect size58. Without standardizing with z-scores, the slope of the relationship between protein abundance and disease status could be artificially inflated or deflated, resulting in misleading correlation statistics.

Quantification was performed on plasma samples (n = 16 ALS cases and n = 16 healthy controls) using commercially available colorimetric ELISA or fluorescence-based ProQuantum high-sensitivity immunoassay kits according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoassay kits were available for 30 of the 33 differentially abundant proteins (Extended Data Fig. 1). The optimal dilution factor for measuring each protein was determined empirically. Each plasma sample and protein standards were assayed in duplicates. A standard curve for each protein was generated by plotting the absorbance readings at 450 nm wavelength or FAM fluorescence emission at 517 nm against the concentrations of the protein standards. A four-parameter logistic curve was fitted using GraphPad Prism software (version 10.4.1). The protein concentrations for the test samples were extrapolated from the standard curve, and the final concentrations were corrected for the dilution factor.

The Bland–Altman plot was created by calculating the differences in measurements between the ELISA or ProQuantum and Olink assays (log2-transformed concentration from the ELISA or ProQuantum assay minus Olink NPX) and comparing this to the mean measurement from both assays for each paired sample. This standard data visualization technique is recommended for comparing methods59. The 95% limits of agreement were calculated using the mean difference (bias) ± 1.96 s.d. of the differences. The relationship between the protein measurements from both assays was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. For the subset of samples (n = 16 ALS and n = 16 healthy controls), differential protein abundance analysis was performed using a generalized linear regression model with the following formula: ProteinAbundancei = β1 × ALSi + β2 × agei + β3 × sexi + β4 × tubetypei. Here, ProteinAbundancei denotes the protein NPX value measured via Olink or the log2-transformed concentration from the ELISA or ProQuantum assay for individual i; ALSi is a binary variable for ALS diagnosis (1 for ALS, 0 for control); agei refers to the age at which the sample was collected; sexi indicates the self-reported sex of the individual; and tubetypei specifies the type of plasma collection tube (heparin or EDTA). The intercept was set to 0. All analyses and visualizations were conducted using GraphPad Prism software (version 10.4.1).

Proteomic measurements were previously generated for a subset of the BLSA control samples (n = 9) using SomaScan 7K, a single-stranded DNA aptamer-based proteomic platform60. To assess the correlation, the log2-transformed NPX values for the Olink 3072 Explore platform and the scaled measurements for the SomaScan 7K platform were used to calculate Spearman's rho correlation for the 2,868 unique UniProt proteins assayed on both platforms (Extended Data Fig. 2a)11. The data were categorized using the k-means clusters identified by Katz et al.11 (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

CSF proteomic measurements were generated from ALS cases (n = 14) and healthy control individuals (n = 89) using the SomaScan 7K platform. Most of the ALS cases (n = 13) and none of the healthy control individuals used to generate the SomaScan data were not included in the Discovery Cohort or the Replication Cohort used to create the plasma proteomic data. Individual proteins were assessed using generalized linear modeling, adjusted for age at collection and sex.

The proteins that were differentially abundant in ALS were analyzed for pathway enrichment using ‘clusterProfiler' (version 4.10.1) using the following databases: (1) GO61, (2) KEGG62 and (3) Reactome63. Pathways with a single gene were discarded, and significance was defined as an FDR-adjusted P value of less than 0.05.

Regional association plots of the genes encoding the differentially abundant proteins identified in ALS cases were made with ‘locusZoomR' (version 0.3.5) using data downloaded from a large ALS GWAS17. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing a P value less than or equal to 5.0 × 10−8 were regarded as evidence of genetic variants in the locus that may influence the risk of developing ALS.

We performed Mendelian randomization analyses using ‘TwoSampleMR' (version 0.6.1)64. Exposures were the pQTL mapping of the plasma proteins identified by the machine learning model. These plasma pQTL profiles were obtained from GWAS data based on 54,219 UK Biobank participants, available from the Synapse web portal18. Only genetic variants with P < 1.0 × 10−5 from the pQTL summary statistics were included in the analysis. As the outcome, we used an ALS GWAS, comprising 29,612 cases and 122,656 control individuals17. To assess causality, we applied the inverse‐variance weighted method and two Mendelian randomization sensitivity tests (MR Egger and weighted median). Traits were considered consistent with a causal effect when P values were less than or equal to 0.05.

We performed supervised machine learning on the proteomic data to identify a molecular signature of ALS. To do this, we randomly selected 80% of the samples as the Training Set (n = 183 ALS cases versus n = 172 healthy controls plus n = 137 other neurological diseases). The remaining samples were designated as the Testing Set (n = 48 ALS cases versus n = 42 healthy controls plus n = 33 other neurological diseases; see Fig. 1 for flowchart). The samples in the Training Set and the Testing Set were the same as those in the Discovery Cohort and the Replication Cohort used for the differential protein abundance analysis, respectively.

We used ‘caret' (short for ‘classification and regression training', version 6.0-94), an open-source machine learning package that streamlines predictive model creation. The 33 differentially abundant proteins, along with clinical information, such as age at sample collection, sex and the type of blood tube used to collect the sample (total number of features = 36), were entered into the model as the starting features.

The decision to limit the feature set to 33 proteins was made to enhance the model's stability and avoid overfitting, often seen in high-dimensional data analysis65. Additionally, using a minimal feature set makes the model more relevant in clinical environments, where cost and assay complexity play important roles. For instance, even though UMAP components are useful for addressing population stratification in statistical analyses, they were left out of the machine learning model. Their inclusion would require all patients to undergo genotyping, substantially increasing implementation costs and computational complexity. Consequently, we concentrated on proteins that can be directly measured in plasma, ensuring that the model remains both practical and affordable.

Ten supervised machine learning algorithms were evaluated (listed in Extended Data Table 5). Fivefold cross-validation was conducted and repeated ten times, and data were preprocessed with centering and scaling to standardize features. Adaptive resampling with a minimum of ten resamples, and a significance threshold of α = 0.05 using generalized least squares was employed to refine the tuning parameters for each model. Models were trained on 36 features, using the sample diagnosis as the binary target variable. The best model (random forest) was selected based on overall performance (AUC and balanced accuracy) when classifying unseen samples in the Testing Set, External Validation Set 1 and External Validation Set 2.

The random forest model was further tuned on the Training Set, and key predictive features were prioritized using the genetic algorithm feature selection method; fivefold cross-validation was conducted and repeated ten times, and data were preprocessed with centering and scaling to standardize features. The parameters used for finetuning and feature selection using the genetic algorithm method were as follows: nbits = 36, popSize = 500, maxiter = 25, pmutation = 0.1, pcrossover = 0.8 and elitism = 3. The hyperparameter for the optimized random forest model, ‘mtry' (the number of variables considered at each split), was set to 11. For model tuning in the Discovery Cohort, the standard random forest majority-vote threshold of 0.5 was used and then directly applied to the Replication Cohort. The final model was selected based on the performance in the Testing Set, External Validation Set 1 and External Validation Set 2 cohorts.

We conducted a repeated classification analysis, excluding NEFL, to assess the impact of this protein on the model's performance. The remaining features (that is, 16 proteins, demographic factors (sex and age at sample collection) and plasma collection tube type) were incorporated into this model.

SHAP values were calculated using the Shapley function from the ‘iml' package (version 0.11.3) in R. These values reflect the contribution of each feature to the final random forest model. To determine the ALS risk score, we summed the SHAP values for all features (n = 20, including 17 proteins, sex, age at sample collection and type of tube used for collection) for each sample. The summed SHAP values were then scaled to a range from 0 to 100 based on the minimum and maximum values from the Training Set.

Subsequently, we conducted a generalized linear regression analysis, adjusting for age at sample collection, sex and plasma tube collection type, to assess the correlation between the time to symptom onset and (1) the ALS risk score and (2) individual protein abundances.

ELISA assays were performed on plasma samples from the Discovery and Replication datasets (n = 16 ALS cases and n = 16 healthy controls). ELISA kits were available for 30 of the 33 differentially abundant proteins. We present exploratory data for 16 proteins, while the other ELISA assays are excluded due to either lack of protein detection (n = 13) or assay failure (n = 1). Each row displays data for an individual protein. The agreement between protein measurements from the ELISA or ProQuantumTM (abbreviated as ProQ) and Olink assays was evaluated using three methods: correlation (first panel), Bland-Altman analysis (second panel), and differential analysis comparing ALS (orange dots) with healthy controls (blue dots) through either ELISA or ProQuantumTM (third panel) or Olink (fourth panel) measurements. Pearson correlation coefficients (R) were calculated to assess the linear association between variables. P-values were computed using a two-sided test of the null hypothesis that the correlation coefficient equals zero. The grey area indicates the 95% confidence interval for the mean prediction (black linear regression line) at each x-value. In the Bland-Altman (B-A) plots, the mean bias difference between the two assays is depicted as a solid horizontal black line in the center of the plot. The shaded grey area reflects the 95% limits of agreement for the paired measurements from each sample, with upper and lower limit values shown in red font. The box-and-whisker plots in the differential analysis panels present the range (whiskers) alongside the first, median, and third quartiles of the measurements within the box. The effect size of the regression, or beta, along with the corresponding p-values, is included in each panel.

Plasma profiling was performed on a random subset of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) samples (n = 9) using the SomaScan 7 K and Olink 3072 Explore platforms. a, The Venn diagram shows the overlap of the UniProt targets assayed on the two platforms. Of the 2,886 proteins assayed on the Olink platform, there were 2,868 unique UniProt IDs. Of these, 2,120 proteins overlapped with the SomaScan 7 K platform. b, Spearman correlations between the overlapping protein measurements on the Olink and SomaScan platforms. K-means clustering, defined by Katz and colleagues, divided the distribution into three clusters. c, The heatmap illustrates Spearman correlations among overlapping protein measurements from the Olink and SomaScan platforms, specifically for 27 differentially expressed proteins in ALS cases. Data for the six other differentially expressed proteins (CORO6, DTNB, FGF21, NEB, RBFOX3, and SSC4D) were unavailable.

These volcano plots illustrate the differential protein abundance in a, ALS patients with the pathogenic C9orf72 repeat expansion (n = 29) compared to ALS patients without the expansion (n = 202), b, ALS patients with C9orf72 (n = 29) compared to ALS patients without the expansion (n = 202) combined with control subjects (n = 383; comprising 169 neuro-control non-carriers, and 214 healthy control non-carriers), and c, asymptomatic individuals with C9orf72 (n = 12) compared to symptomatic ALS patients with the expansion (n = 29). The dotted vertical lines indicate a ± 1.4-fold change threshold, while the dotted horizontal lines represent the 0.05 p-value threshold. Blue and red dots depict statistically significant down-regulated or up-regulated proteins identified through generalized linear regression. Significance was assessed using two-sided moderated t-tests with p-values adjusted by the false discovery rate (FDR) method.

Distribution of the SHAP values calculated using the machine-learning model for the 20 features with the most substantial effect on the ALS diagnosis classification model. The Training Set (n = 183 ALS cases, n = 172 healthy controls, and n = 137 patients with other neurological diseases), the Testing Set (n = 48 ALS cases, n = 42 healthy controls, and n = 33 patients with other neurological diseases; one sample from the other neurological diseases group was dropped due to incomplete protein data), the External Validation Set 1 (n = 14 ALS cases, n = 15 healthy controls, and n = 17 patients with other neurological diseases), and the External Validation Set 2 (i.e., UK Biobank, n = 13 ALS cases, n = 23,601 healthy controls) are shown. Each point represents a sample; orange dots represent ALS cases, dark blue dots represent healthy individuals, and light blue dots represent patients with other neurological diseases. A black circle around a dot indicates a sample misclassified by the model.

a, The distributions of the ALS Risk Score according to the age at the time of plasma collection are shown for asymptomatic individuals (purple, n = 126), ALS cases (orange, n = 259), patients with other neurological diseases (light blue, n = 186), and a representative sample of the healthy controls (blue, n = 533). Asymptomatic individuals were the only ones showing a slight correlation with time with a 5 to 14-fold steeper slope coefficient compared to healthy individuals and those with ALS or other neurological diseases. This indicates that the increase in ALS Risk Score seen in preclinical ALS is not influenced solely by normal aging or pathological aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The bands represent the 95% confidence intervals of the linear regression lines at each x-value. The statistical significance of each coefficient was assessed using a two-sided hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that the coefficient equals zero. The slopes, the R2 values, and the associated p-values are displayed. A black circle around a dot indicates a sample misclassified by the Random Forest model. b, Scatterplots comparing time to symptom onset in patients with ALS with expression levels for the 17 individual proteins included in the Random Forest model. The purple dots represent plasma samples taken from pre-symptomatic individuals (n = 109 from the UK Biobank, n = 1 from this study) who subsequently developed ALS. The orange dots denote plasma samples taken from individuals with ALS cases (n = 12 from the UK Biobank, n = 239 from this study). The gray bands represent the 95% confidence intervals of the linear regression line at each x-value. The slopes and the associated p-values derived from two-sided hypothesis testing are displayed.

Direct functionalization of abundant C(sp3)–H bonds is highly attractive. Photobiocatalysis offers promise for expanding enzyme reactivity but has been limited to the use of preactivated radical precursors. Key challenges for C(sp3)–H bond activation include the lack of robust activation modes for the inert bonds under biocatalytic conditions and controlling the reactivity and stereochemistry of prochiral radicals. Here we report a triple activation strategy enabling photobiocatalytic C(sp3)–H bond acylation with aldehydes. By combining hydrogen-atom transfer for prochiral radical formation, organic-dye-modulated single-electron transfer and an engineered thiamine-dependent enzyme, we describe a radical acyl transferase for functionalizing C(sp3)–H bonds. This robust radical enzymatic system achieves benzylic C(sp3)–H and aldehyde C(sp2)–H oxidative coupling in an enantioselective manner (up to 97% e.e.).

As legal cannabis has expanded around the United States for both recreational and medical use, companies have amassed troves of data about customers and their transactions. People who have applied for medical marijuana cards have had to share particularly personal health data to qualify. For some patients in Ohio who use medical weed, a recent data exposure could impact their sensitive information.

Security researcher Jeremiah Fowler found a publicly accessible database in mid-July that appeared to contain medical records, mental health evaluations, physician reports, and images of IDs like driver's licenses for people seeking medical cannabis cards. The 323-GB trove stored close to a million records, including Social Security numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, dates of birth, and medical data—all organized by name.

Based on information that seemed to describe specific employees and business partners, Fowler suspected that the data belonged to the Ohio-based company Ohio Medical Alliance LLC, which goes by the name Ohio Marijuana Card. Fowler contacted the company on July 14; when he checked the database the next day, it had been secured and was no longer publicly accessible online. Fowler did not receive a response about his submission.

Ohio Medical Alliance did not answer WIRED's questions about Fowler's findings. At one point, though, the company's president, Cassandra Brooks, wrote in an email: “I need time to investigate this alleged incident. We take data security very seriously and are looking into this matter.”

“There were physicians' reports that would say what the underlying problem was—whether it was anxiety, cancer, HIV, or something else. In some cases, the applicants would submit their own medical records as proof” of their qualifying condition, Fowler tells WIRED. “I saw identification documents from lots of states, from everywhere. And I even saw offender release cards, which are basically IDs for people who just got out of prison that they submitted as proof of identity to get a medical marijuana card.”

Fowler says that most of the files in the database were image formats like PDFs, JPGs, and PNGs. One CSV plaintext document called “staff comments” appeared to be an export of internal communications, appointment histories, notes about clients, and application status. That file also contained more then 200,000 email addresses of Ohio Medical Alliance employees, business associates, and customers.

Databases that are misconfigured and have inadvertently been left publicly exposed on the open internet are a common problem online in spite of efforts to raise awareness about the mistake and its privacy implications.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","OpenAI Is Poised to Become the Most Valuable Startup Ever. Should It Be?","https://www.wired.com/story/openai-valuation-500-billion-skepticism/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

OpenAI is reportedly on the verge of a roughly $500 billion valuation, a figure that would make it the most valuable private company in the world—bigger than SpaceX, TikTok's parent company Bytedance, and even public giants like Palantir. It's a staggering number for a company with an “astronomical burn rate.” How is this even possible?

As Axios reports, there are actually two deals in play: a SoftBank-led round valuing the company at $300 billion, which won't close until year's end, and a secondary sale of employee shares at a far steeper $500 billion valuation. Most of the cheaper shares have already been snapped up, leaving investors to fight over the pricier ones.

One OpenAI investor—who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing an NDA—compared it to the dawn of the internet. “We're in one of the biggest technology shifts [in history],” the investor tells me. “The outcomes continue to get bigger than people think.”

The investor argues that the math for investing at the $500 billion valuation is straightforward: Hypothetically, if ChatGPT hits 2 billion users and monetizes at $5 per user per month—“half the rate of things like Google or Facebook”—that's $120 billion in annual revenue.

“That alone would support a trillion-and-a-half-dollar company, which is a pretty good return, just thinking about ChatGPT,” the investor says. “It doesn't include all the rest of the stuff they're working on, all the enterprise stuff, all the agentic stuff, all of the work they're doing on hardware.”

The $5 figure is, admittedly, back-of-the-envelope math. Today, ChatGPT has 700 million weekly active users—and fewer than 10 percent of them pay for it.(OpenAI declined to comment on this figure.) The investor's projections are ambitious, and they seem to discount the threat of major players like Google or Meta eating OpenAI's lunch. “The half-a-trillion-dollar question now is, to what extent will OpenAI be able to retain the customers it has acquired, and simultaneously be able to bring its costs to a point where it can, in fact, monetize at [hypothetically] $5 per user per month,” says Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.

The bet here is that OpenAI is the next Facebook or Google. For investors buying in at $500 billion, “they're expecting an IPO above a trillion in two to three years, otherwise the rate of return does not justify the investment,” says Glenn Okun, who's also a business professor at NYU. That would mean leaping into the top 10 most valuable public companies in the world almost overnight. The investor says they have a longer time horizon than that, but “of course an IPO is the most sensible path given the scale of the company.” Though the investor admits, yes, the company would need to be valued at more than $1 trillion to make the investment worthwhile.

Stranger things have happened—particularly to OpenAI. In the first seven months of 2025, the company doubled its projected annual revenue to $12 billion, which suggests OpenAI is bringing in about $1 billion per month. Enterprise adoption has surged, too, reaching 5 million paying business users this month. Not to mention what potential advertising revenue could do to its bottom line. To the investor, these are signs of a company with the momentum to win: “People don't like unprecedented things, because most people like to pattern-match,” the investor says. “Everything this company has done has been unprecedented, from the pace of its revenue growth to the AI technology.”

It's a nice dream. But OpenAI's spending is ballooning alongside its revenue. It's reportedly expecting a cash burn of $8 billion this year, and Altman said at a recent dinner in San Francisco that much of OpenAI's infrastructure costs are for inference, as opposed to training—and he expects the startup to spend trillions of dollars on data centers in the “not very distant future.” That means in the fantastical future where ChatGPT may have billions of users, it would cost trillions of dollars to serve them.

It's extraordinarily expensive to scale such a power-hungry technology. Even if the chips get faster and cheaper, the overall costs grow as the company works to train even bigger models and serve them to a growing user base sending off billions of queries, Sundararajan tells me.

The investor, however, brushes off profitability concerns, saying OpenAI can spread those massive costs across its entire user base. “It is not cheap, and it's not for the faint of heart in terms of investment,” they add.

Okun takes a more skeptical approach. “What we're looking at here is major capital investment with the sorts of valuations that may be very hard to to actually reach,” he says.

The $500 billion headline also has caveats. Private-market pricing reflects what a small number of investors are willing to pay for a small number of shares. In other words, the feeding frenzy is factored into the share price.

“In all likelihood, it's an approximation,” Okun says of the valuation. He adds that the number reflects both firm value and the competition between investors to get a slice of the pie. “We really can't accurately disentangle those two streams of value in order to isolate firm value.”

Right now, investors appear to have a nearly insatiable appetite for AI startups. According to recent PitchBook data, a third of all venture dollars in the second quarter of this year went to five companies—all in the AI space—which is more than double the spending in 2024.

Is that a bubble? Altman admitted as much at the dinner. But in classic Altman fashion, he reminded attendees that's actually a good thing: “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history [like] the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important, the internet was a really big deal.”

Startup valuations have always reflected how well the CEO can sell a vision. At OpenAI, Altman cranks it up to 11, and it's seemingly paying off. Meanwhile, investors are betting that ChatGPT becomes as indispensable as Google, that billions of people happily pay to use it, and competitors quietly fade into irrelevance. Whether any of that actually happens almost doesn't matter. For now, the story is worth half a trillion all on its own.

“There's definitely risk in it,” the investor tells me. “The story is not fully written.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The AI-Powered PDF Marks the End of an Era","https://www.wired.com/story/adobe-ai-powered-pdf-end-of-an-era/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

When it was first released by Adobe in 1993, the PDF was truly transformative technology.

The Portable Document Format was a multipurpose container that replicated the appearance and functionality of physical documents. That sounds unimportant, but as adoption spread with Adobe's introduction of free Acrobat software for reading PDFs a year later, anyone, from the government to your doctor's office, could rely on digital documentation that felt familiar to the paper versions.

“It wasn't like a text message, which is a native digital format or an email or a web page,” says Matthew Kirschenbaum, an English professor at the University of Maryland and author of Track Changes, a book about the history of word processing. “The PDF was all about the cultural authority of print and documents that emerged out of human contexts, professions, motivations.”

And now, over three decades after its initial release, Adobe is attempting to embed generative AI into the PDF as an essential aspect of the experience.

The company started this AI makeover of the PDF last year by adding an assistant to its Acrobat software that answers user questions about a document's contents. Today, it's launching Adobe Acrobat Studio, which further leans into the software's AI-powered aspects and includes “PDF spaces” where users can upload multiple documents and personalize how the chatbot assistant answers questions.

“We're reintroducing the brand,” says Michi Alexander, the vice president of product marketing at Adobe. “We've been around for 32 years now, but this is the biggest inflection point for us since launch.”

This release is about much more than just Adobe, though. The Adobe Acrobat Studio is a harbinger of generative AI further seeping into everyday, essential software, in a way that changes the experience for everyone.

I currently can't open up a fresh Google Doc, click on the Instagram search bar, or adjust the Messages settings on my iPhone without being inundated with AI features. While some power users thoroughly enjoy the AI features, many signs point to a growing segment of users being exhausted by the glut of generative AI dominating current software releases. A report earlier this year from the Pew Research Center says US adults are far more concerned than excited about the effect AI will have on their lives and their jobs.

Although Adobe is following industry trends with this latest release, the company previously iterated on the PDF in cutting-edge ways that defined itself among the leaders in technology trends. As an example of this, Duff Johnson, CEO of the PDF Association, a vendor-neutral group that's in charge of standardization and interoperability for this file format, points to the time when Adobe added transparency support to the PDF. “The industry had to race a lot as soon as Adobe introduced this.” Around the same time, companies like Apple and Microsoft added more transparency features and support to their software.

What sets this AI-focused release apart from other feature updates is the abstraction away from humans writing, editing, and parsing documents and towards the synthetic, and often unreliable, actions of generative AI tools. “There is now AI in these very specifically human-centered document forms,” Kirschenbaum says. “And to me, that's notable.” Much like the death of handwriting in the age of AI, users' relationships to documents is being fundamentally altered.

“We were the ones that created the PDF,” Alexander says. “And we really see this as our opportunity to redefine what a PDF is.” Whether users look back in a few years on the release of Adobe Acrobat Studio and see it as an essential redefinition of the software, like transparency was, or just a passing fad that gets ignored among the myriad of other PDF features, the release marks an important moment in time.

This is officially the year when AI ate software. The era when you could use an app without encountering multiple generative AI tools is definitively over. Let's see how long this new era lasts.

More than two decades after Kirby Air Ride launched on GameCube, Kirby Air Riders is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20. Director Masahiro Sakurai announced the news in a Nintendo Direct that aired today, alongside a detailed look at the upcoming racing game. “It basically is like Mario Kart,” Sakurai says.

The sequel is also the first Kirby title to be directed by fan favorite Sakurai since the original.

“Oh dear,” Sakurai said during the Direct. “Why is making a game so hard?”

Air Riders expands on the original, which came out in 2003, with more characters, modes, and new controls beyond the single button players used to boost. “This time we've added a second button,” Sakurai said. “Unfortunately.” While the original game featured different versions of Kirby to play, Air Riders adds King Dedede, Meta Knight, and even lesser known characters like Starman, all of which can use copy abilities like Kirby. Each character has a special move that can boost their speed, attack other racers, or activate abilities like turning into a giant snowball. The game allows up to eight human players locally or 16 online.

In addition to traditional races, Air Riders features City Trial mode, where players will need to upgrade their rides as quickly as possible by gathering power-ups, stealing new machines, and attacking opponents. Random field events will give players the chance to join and play short races and battles; players have only five minutes to upgrade their machines as much as possible before entering Stadiums, where the main competitions take place.

The game is being developed with Bandai Namco Studios and Sora LTD—teams that worked on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate—instead of longtime Kirby developer HAL Laboratory.

Sakurai, creator of both Kirby and the Super Smash Bros. series, has had his hand in a few projects over the past few years. In addition to wrapping up work on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, he also enjoyed a run as a YouTuber. For more than two years, he published over 250 videos on his channel, Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games, about game development. In his finale episode, he revealed that he'd been working on a new game. Today, he confirmed that project is Kirby Air Riders.

Kirby Air Riders joins a fairly light first-party launch lineup for Switch 2 and is the second major racing game to launch this year for the console, following Mario Kart World. Sakurai says even he pointed out the two games' similarity when asked to work on it, but added that “the appeal of the game is not actually the races.” Air Riders is bigger on its modes that offer more than just a dash to the finish.

Nintendo is expected to announce more details, including the game's price, later this year. A hands-on demo will be playable at PAX West in Seattle August 29–September 1.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","493 Cases of Sextortion Against Children Linked to Notorious Scam Compounds","https://www.wired.com/story/child-sextorition-scam-compounds-southeast-asia/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 14:11:31 GMT","

Over the past decade, organized crime gangs working out of Southeast Asia have scammed people out of billions of dollars. Operating giant scam compounds—where experts estimate around 200,000 victims of human trafficking have been forced to run scams 24 hours a day—the criminal enterprises have used an array of romance, cryptocurrency investment, and impersonation fraud to target thousands of people around the world. Now new research reveals that the already chilling scam compounds may have an even darker underbelly.

Nearly 500 reports linked to child sextortion made over a two-year period to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a US child safety organization, have been tied back to scam compounds operating in Southeast Asia, according to new research exclusively shared with WIRED by the anti-slavery organization International Justice Mission. Another 18,000 child exploitation reports made to NCMEC also contain IP addresses used by devices at known scam compound locations, the research says.

At least 40 of 44 previously identified scam compounds in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos can be linked to the child sextortion reports, says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the IJM who focuses on combatting forced scamming and was part of the team behind the study. Heintz says it is the “first clear evidence” that the forced scamming operations are “likely” linked to global instances of child sextortion. “It was surprising how widespread it was,” he says, adding that the wider data also indicated the locations of previously undiscovered scam compounds.

The findings directly linking scam compounds to the reports of sexual exploitation of children and young people come as sextortion cases have exploded in the past few years. Sextortion often involves criminals tricking someone into sharing sexually explicit images, which they then use to blackmail that person into making payments. While all cases of sextortion can be devastating, criminals have increasingly targeted children, and dozens of teenage boys have reportedly taken their own lives as a result. Many sextortion cases against children have been linked back to Nigerian Yahoo Boy scammers and other West African fraudsters.

The new IJM research, which was funded by child safety group Safe Online and the Thomson Reuters Social Impact Institute, reviewed data from more than 1.1 million “online enticement” incidents—including 3.1 million IP addresses—that tech companies reported to NCMEC between January 2022 and August 2024. Tech companies and electronic service providers in the US are required to report online child exploitation incidents to NCMEC's CyberTipline.

The data was cross-referenced with IP addresses known to be used at the location of 27 scam compounds in Cambodia, 16 in Myanmar, and one in Laos. In total, 18,017 of the child exploitation reports to NCMEC contained IP addresses used at the scam compounds. To establish a stronger link between the potential sextortion cases and the scam centers, the IJM researchers also obtained mobile phone advertising data from data brokers and compared it against the data from NCMEC. Taking all of their analysis together, the IJM concluded that at least 493 of the reports made to the NCMEC are “likely” directly connected to forced scamming locations.

“There are limitations to what we can see with this data, but what we have so far is accurate,” says Heintz. “If anything, I think it's undercounting the scale of the problem.”

The data the researchers obtained is only a snapshot of some alleged sextortion activity linked to scam centers. For instance, advertising industry mobile data is incomplete, the NCMEC data does not contain all possible reported sextortion cases, and tech companies reporting data to NCMEC likely skew toward American firms.

In its report, the IJM points to multiple reports of scam centers being linked to wider sextortion against adults. The report does not rule out that children are being deliberately targeted with sextortion crimes but notes that children may also get caught in schemes targeted at adults if they are using parents' or other caregivers' devices. Now that this research has demonstrated a link, the researchers emphasize that further research is needed to strengthen authorities' understanding of the connection between child sextortion and scam compounds and determine whether children are being specifically targeted. NCMEC did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.

Often run by Chinese organized crime groups, scam compounds have exploded across Southeast Asia since roughly 2019. Criminals have trafficked thousands of people from more than 70 countries into the compounds, where they are usually held captive, have their passports taken away, and are forced to scam people online. If they refuse, they can be beaten and brutalized. Initially targeting Chinese speakers, the scam centers have deployed so-called “pig butchering” scams, alongside various other forms of investment and romance scams. With vast flows of illicit cash, the criminals have increasingly opened scam compounds in the Middle East, West Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe; they have targeted scams against people across the world and altered the ways they scam people.

“Scam centers and cyber-enabled fraud networks in Southeast Asia have rapidly diversified their business lines and scope of targeting, increasingly integrating sextortion as well as malware, deepfakes and pornography into their operations,” says John Wojcik, a senior threat researcher focusing on Asia at the cybersecurity firm Infoblox. An October 2024 report into the growth of scam compounds from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which was partially authored by Wojcik, who worked at the organization at the time, pointed to the increase in sextortion cases against adults and the use of AI.

Wojcik says the IJM research is consistent with reports from law enforcement agencies within Southeast Asia that there has been a “steady rise” in financial sextortion cases against children.

Hieu Minh Ngo, a reformed criminal hacker and now cybercrime investigator at the Vietnamese nonprofit scam-fighting organization Chongluadao, says he has seen sextortion efforts targeting young people and adults in Vietnam in the past few years, and these “operations trace back to scam compounds” located along the Vietnam-Cambodia border. “The tactics are consistent: Bad actors pose as attractive individuals on social media, build trust with victims, then coerce them into sharing sensitive images or videos,” Ngo says. The use of AI deepfakes is also increasing, he adds. “This trend shows clear links between regional scam compounds and organized sextortion targeting children and vulnerable populations.”

“It's likely only a matter of time before they scale up operations in other parts of the world, as they have done in the past,” Wojcik says.

While some efforts have been made to shut down the operations of scam compounds—including thousands of alleged arrests, internet and power shutdowns, and sweeping political declarations—the scam compounds are still operational and appear to be continually expanding. Criminal organizations have flourished as a result of local corruption, weak enforcement of laws, and the ability to use Big Tech services to run scams, such as creating social media accounts that are used to trick people and using web hosting infrastructure to run scams.

Heintz says that governments and tech companies need to do more to tackle the many crimes linked to the scam compounds—including human trafficking, fraud, money laundering, and now, following the IJM's research, evidence that children are likely being harmed. “Everyone is treating this just as a financial crime or a fraud crime, where the tools that everyone can use are limited to that type of crime,” Heintz says. “Now that you have internet crimes against children, then that should open the door for more tools that both tech companies and governments can use.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","People Are Trying to ‘Deprogram' Their MAGA Parents Through Book Clubs","https://www.wired.com/story/people-are-trying-to-deprogram-their-maga-parents-through-book-clubs/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The idea of starting a book club came to Valeen Heinle late one night in July. She was having a particularly bad argument with her Trump-supporting dad over Israel's war in Gaza and its devastating impacts on children.

""I'm begging you to just try and learn something that isn't from Facebook, Fox, or Newsmax,"" Valeen, a 38-year-old registered Democrat who works as a pet sitter in Denver, wrote to her dad via Instagram DM after they exchanged a series of posts about Gaza. “Read a book on the history there. I have tons I can suggest but I know you would never because you'd rather sit in your confirmation bias, and that makes me so sad.”

“I spend too much time worrying about my children. What the future will bring for them,” he replied. “So when my kids are safe and [taken] care of then maybe I could give a shit about other kids.”

Gaza isn't the only issue that has left Americans—and Valeen and her dad—divided. They've argued about the Covid-19 vaccine, climate change, gun laws, the results of the 2020 election, the January 6 riot at the Capitol, and more. “Ever since 2016, he seems to be pulled more and more to the far right, and he's become clouded by hatred and anger—things that just aren't him,” says Valeen. “It's gotten harder and harder, and it's not just difficult to debate with him, but it's painful, and some of the things he says really just takes me aback.”

But Valeen said his response to their discussion on Gaza was a breaking point. It upset her so much that when her partner returned home that evening, he found her crying on their Ikea sofa in the living room. They had a long talk, and in an attempt at distraction, they gathered animal crackers and Chips Ahoy cookies and fired up an anime episode on her laptop.

When the anime episode ended at around 3 am, Valeen sent her dad, who now lives in central Florida, a message. “Alright. I'll make you a deal: you read three books of my choosing—all the way through—and prove you actually read and understood them,” she wrote. “And I'll go back to church for a month after.”

Reddit is full of stories from people who, like Valeen, say the current political environment has challenged their relationships with their Trump-supporting parents. In some cases, people have compared their families' involvement in the MAGA movement and blind loyalty to Trump to being part of a cult—a comparison that's also been made by cult experts.

But some think they can potentially salvage their relationships with their loved ones and even “deprogram” their MAGA parents—by starting de facto “book clubs.”

One Reddit user posted on a popular subreddit r/suggestmeabook, asking for suggestions of “good reading materials for someone who may need some help being nudged back towards reality and morality”—their dad. They asked specifically for recommendations of fantasy books, a genre that their dad had enjoyed in the past. “I've always felt fantasy books have ‘progressive' values, and I'm hoping to find some that don't beat you over the head with that message!” they wrote. In another subreddit, someone else asked for book recommendations that they could send to their father “in pursuit of deprogramming him from the cult of Trump.”

Others have said their relationships hit a breaking point, and they had no other choice but to go “no contact"" with their parents. One study found that 1 in two adults was estranged from a close relative and cited political differences in a fifth of those cases. Nearly half of those estranged over politics said the rupture had occurred in the past year.

Dominique Forbes, 28, tells WIRED she has minimized contact with her parents, who live in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, over their continued support for Trump since 2016 and hasn't seen them in person since May 2020. “I see MAGA as a cult, personally, and I think the identity fusion and cognitive dissonance are the main pieces that I've experienced firsthand from my parents,” Forbes says. She says she tried to broach the topic in November, around the time of the election, via Facetime. “My dad exploded and said he felt attacked,” Forbes says. “I was adamant about being gentle and remaining calm, but I could see the identity fusion—he could not separate himself from Trump.”

There was talk of them coming to visit her earlier this year where she lives, in Seattle, Washington. She was looking forward to it, and to introducing them to her cats. But she told them she didn't want them to stay with her, to establish some boundaries, and their offer to visit crumbled soon after that. Forbes says that attempts at establishing common ground have fallen flat. “I've learned it's not my responsibility to educate them,” Forbes says. “I believe they're brainwashed, and I believe there could be underlying health issues that could be contributing to it. But I finally just hit a wall of exhaustion. I just feel pushed away and rejected so many times that I'm finally planning on going some form of no-contact.”

Steven Hassan, a cult expert who escaped a cult in 1976 and has since written several books about deprogramming, including The Cult of Trump, says there's no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to helping a loved one who has been brainwashed. And it's not like switching out a faulty component in a car, he says. “The mind is precious. I need to know how he got hooked,” says Hassan. “What I've learned as a mental health professional when it comes to how to effectively influence a person, you need to customize it for the individual”

He does have some advice for what not to do. “It's important to understand that the MAGA identity is fused with Trump and its ideology. And what doesn't work is trying to attack the leader, the doctrine, the policy of any cult,” says Hassan. “Trying to argue with logic or with facts is counterproductive, because it activates the cult identity to label you as an enemy that is persecuting them.”

“What I have always been advocating for years is: Stay warm, stay loving, don't say ‘you're stupid' for following Trump or ‘you're a moron,' but just be warm and say ‘I don't understand, help me step into your shoes,'” Hassan adds. “The most powerful technique is to ask questions that empower the person to think and reflect.” Another key part of effective deprogramming, Hassan adds, is to remind the person who they were prior to being brainwashed.

Valeen grew up in Florida's Pompano Beach, north of Fort Lauderdale, and was raised in the Evangelical church. Her father, who Valeen calls her best friend and her hero, served in the Marines during Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s and later ran a glass business.

For a long time, debating current affairs was “their thing”—and it was fun. But a few years ago he had a pulmonary embolism, leaving him in poor health and often struggling to breathe. Valeen thinks his views have become more extreme in part because he's isolated, depressed, in poor health, and engaging with divisive content online. She worries that he's become increasingly drawn into a political belief system that is defined by misinformation over fact and cruelty over empathy.

Her father, John, says he gets along great with Valeen, though “sometimes it gets a little difficult in our conversations,” adding, “We're on different political spectrums. I raised her to be a free thinker. I wanted her to have her own path and have her own ideas, not mine.”

When Valeen was in her early twenties, she briefly moved to Australia for her long-distance boyfriend she'd met via Facebook. At some point, he started reading Richard Dawkins' The Greatest Show on Earth, which is about evolution. “I'd joke and say ‘that's your devil book,'” she recalls. She became increasingly interested in its ideas as he worked his way through it, and she eventually picked it up herself. She says it challenged her entire belief system and opened her eyes to an entirely new way of thinking; it also taught her that books could be a powerful way to change minds. She left the church when she was 25.

“Reading has had such an impact on my own life,” says Valeen. “I am hoping not only could it potentially teach him something or make him think about something he typically wouldn't, but also if it's laid out in front of him with data and references by someone who has studied, it might be easier to not just understand but to trust.”

And she knew that promising her dad to go back to church, even for a short time, would be a valuable bargaining chip. “She completely turned around,” says John. “Next I noticed she said she was agnostic, then she was atheist. And I'm like, what?” He's chalked up a lot of her misfortunes over the years—financial struggles, health problems—to her lack of faith. “I live in poverty, and he's very much a bootstraps mentality. So he blames anything that goes wrong in my life on me leaving Christianity,” says Valeen.

John says that these days he's more concerned about making sure she gets to heaven. “My health isn't that great, and it would be good to know that when I go one day, I'll see my daughter again,” John says. “She says I was using a guilt trip. I said, ‘I'm not trying to use a guilt trip. I'm trying to say that, you know, that would make me feel a lot better.'”

Hassan says that reciprocity is important when trying to get through to a brainwashed loved one. “The goal is not who is right and who is wrong, the goal is to learn and, based on love, pursue what's true.”

Valeen wants her dad to read The Hundred Years' War on Palestine by Rashid Khalidi, Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation by Kristin Kobes Du Mez, and Poverty, by America by Matthew Desmond, which looks at the systemic causes of poverty in the US.

In selecting her titles, Valeen says she tried to pick books that were “noncombative.” “It's been tough to convince him to do this, because he doesn't really want to read anything that doesn't confirm his beliefs and his views,” she says. “I basically just kept pushing the deal on him and kept telling him, like, well, you really want me to go to church.” Eventually, after some back-and-forth, he agreed.

Valeen is estranged from the rest of her family, and there's no book club that she thinks could fix it. She says her sister believes that the Earth is actually flat, among other conspiracy theories, and her cousins called her an ""abomination"" and told her she was “going to hell” when she came out as pansexual.

But she believes that she can establish common ground with her dad again. “A lot of things have happened to me in my lifetime, and my dad is the only constant I've ever had,” she says. “So I won't give up on him.”

And as for her dad, he tells WIRED: “I'll read 'em. I've got time.”

In a move reminiscent of Facebook's early days, TikTok is launching a new feature that allows college students to find and connect with others on their campus. The feature, called Campus Verification, lets users add their college campus to their TikTok profile and browse a list of students at their school.

To access the feature, users need to navigate to their profile and tap the “Add school” button. From there, they need to enter their school name and then select their graduation year. 

To verify that they actually go to the school they entered, they need to provide their academic email address. Once complete, their college name and graduation year will be displayed on their profile.

Users can then browse their school's page, filter by graduation year, and view all of the users who have added the school to their profile. They can also sort the users list to show the most-followed users first.

The feature is available across more than 6,000 universities through TikTok's partnership with UNiDAYS, a student verification platform that confirms student status. 

TikTok says the idea behind the feature is to turn its platform into a hub for real-world connections and belonging on campus, which is essentially what Facebook's original mission was when it launched in 2004 as a way for Harvard students to connect with one another.

TikTok's new feature could be a welcome addition for college students looking to connect with others on campus. However, it also raises concerns about digital privacy, as it could make it easier for users to track others online. Of course, the feature is optional, so those who prefer to keep their TikTok presence separate from their student life can choose to simply not add their school to their profile.

It's worth noting that the launch comes as Instagram was spotted testing a similar feature last year that would allow users to display their school info and graduation year on their profile and connect with other students. It's unknown if the feature was scrapped or if the Meta-owned platform still plans to roll it out.

The world's most valuable chipmaker is far from giving up its desire to retain China as a key growth market. Nvidia is apparently putting together a new AI chip meant for sale in China that's half as powerful as its flagship B300 Blackwell GPU, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources.

This new chip, codenamed B30A, would be more powerful than the H20 GPUs the company is currently allowed to sell to China, the report said, though its design will be single-die in nature, unlike the dual-die design used in the more powerful B300 GPUs. The B30A would still have similar features to the H20, like fast data transmission, support for NVLink, and high-bandwidth memory.

The development of the B30A seems to be separate from another chip that the company is said to be developing for sale in the country, Reuters reported.

“We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow. Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use,” Nvidia said in an emailed statement.

The news comes as the Trump administration in recent weeks has relaxed its stance on letting chipmakers export high-performance AI chips to China, though Reuters cited its sources as saying that approvals for this new chip aren't certain at all.

As geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington are increasingly affected by the race to develop AI, critics argue that the U.S. must maintain its lead by controlling the supply of necessary technology to China. But Nvidia and its peers — finding themselves selling the equivalent of shovels during a gold rush — maintain that ceding the valuable market of China to rivals like Huawei would be tantamount to giving up entirely.

The U.K has dropped its demand for special access to Apple's cloud systems, or a “backdoor,” following negotiations with the Trump administration, according to U.S. National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard. 

“As a result, the U.K. has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a ‘back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties,” Gabbard wrote in a post on X. She also claimed that she worked along President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the negotiations.

Over the past few months, I've been working closely with our partners in the UK, alongside @POTUS and @VP, to ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected. As a result, the UK has agreed to drop its mandate for…

This is the latest (and unexpected) development in a months-long saga that saw the British government secretly demanding Apple grant its authorities access — essentially asking for a backdoor — to the encrypted data of iCloud users, effectively anywhere in the world, particularly those who turn on Advanced Data Protection (or ADP), an opt-in security feature. ADP turns on end-to-end encryption for iCloud, meaning only the user can access their files stored on Apple's cloud servers. 

The existence of the legal demand was first reported by The Washington Post in February, which was made under the U.K.'s Investigatory Powers Act 2016, also known as the Snoopers' Charter. The request sparked outrage and condemnation from privacy and security experts worldwide, who argued that if the U.K. government obtained what it wanted, it would weaken privacy for the whole world, and also open the door for more governments to make similar demands, even in other companies' technologies. 

Apple initially responded by removing ADP from the U.K., meaning new users couldn't turn it on. The company also said it would give guidance to existing users who “will eventually need to disable this security feature.”

In the meantime, Apple also reportedly challenged the backdoor mandate in court, a case that was initially secret but was then ruled to be held in public. 

Apple and the U.K. Home Office, which initiated the demand on behalf of the British government, did not respond to requests for comment. 

Olivia Coleman, the press secretary of the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, referred to a February letter to Sen. Wyden and Rep. Biggs. 

Apple previously told TechCrunch that the company has “never built a backdoor or master key” to any of its products or services and it “never will.”

Figure Technology, a 7-year-old blockchain-based lending company, on Monday filed for an IPO of its Class A common stock on Nasdaq, saying in its IPO paperwork that its revenue rose 22.4% to $191 million in the six months ended June 30, and that it reported a profit of $29 million in the same period, compared with a loss of $13 million a year earlier.

The filing offers a chance at vindication for Figure co-founder Mike Cagney, who previously built SoFi before leaving the personal finance platform in 2017 following sexual harassment allegations. SoFi went public in 2021 via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger and has done pretty well as a public company — its stock is up over 200% in the past year, and its revenue rose 44% in the second quarter of 2025.

Since its founding in 2018, Figure has established itself as one of the bigger players in blockchain-based lending, claiming more than 160 partners for its loan origination system and capital marketplace. Figure claims to be the largest non-bank provider of home equity lines of credit.

The company, which Cagney founded with his wife June Ou, uses blockchain technology through its Provenance blockchain to speed along approvals for home equity loans, mortgage refinancing, and student and personal loans.

In May, Figure said it was also expanding into cryptocurrency lending, signing a financing agreement with Victory Park Capital for what Figure described as the industry's first securitized pool of crypto-backed loans. That product allows asset owners to borrow against their Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings with loan-to-value ratios up to 75%.

Terms of that deal with Victory Park were not disclosed.

Cagney has a history of ambitious regulatory moves. As TechCrunch reported in late 2020, during the last days of the first Trump administration, Figure applied for a U.S. national bank charter that would have let it accept uninsured deposits exceeding $250,000 from accredited investors while avoiding traditional FDIC and Federal Reserve oversight. The approach could have established a template for other fintech and retail companies to obtain non-traditional bank charters and offer lucrative financial products while avoiding such oversight, but Figure withdrew its application last year amid broader fintech industry challenges.

The company has undergone major leadership and organizational changes in the meantime. In April 2024, Figure appointed Michael Tannenbaum, former COO of Brex, as CEO. Tannenbaum previously worked with Cagney as SoFi's chief revenue officer.

And in an unusual corporate maneuver, Cagney spun off Figure Markets in early 2024, creating a standalone digital asset exchange for crypto trading, crypto-backed loans, and stablecoins. But just over a year later, in July, Figure reversed course and smooshed the two entities back together.

The company says the strategy positions it to capture a huge and growing opportunity in real-world asset tokenization. (Real-world asset tokenization involves converting traditional assets like mortgages, real estate, or loans — even art — into digital tokens that can be traded on blockchain networks. Heavyweight financial players like BlackRock and JPMorgan are among those who have recently entered the space.)

It's worth noting that this is not Figure's first attempt at going public. The company previously planned to list via a merger with a SPAC called Figure Acquisition Corp., but the deal got scrapped due to rising interest rates and redemption rates, among other challenges. The blank check company was later delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.

Figure, whose backers include Apollo Global Management and Ribbit Capital, also failed to complete a planned merger with mortgage lender Homebridge Financial Services in 2022, citing regulatory delays 10 months after the tie-up was announced.

The IPO filing is no surprise to industry observers. For one, Figure — which last raised $200 million in 2021 at a $3.2 billion valuation — announced weeks ago that it had filed a confidential statement for an IPO. Further, the timing aligns with a growing wave of crypto-related companies seeking public listings, encouraged by the wildly successful debut of Circle Internet Group back in June, and the Trump administration's full-bodied support for the cryptocurrency sector and related legislation.

Circle's shares soared more than 500% in their first two weeks on the public market. Crypto exchange Bullish has added to the momentum as its shares more than doubled on its first day of trading last week.

On Friday, the Winklevoss twins' crypto exchange Gemini filed for an IPO despite reporting a $282.5 million net loss in the first half of 2025.

Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and BofA Securities are serving as the lead bookrunners for Figure's IPO. The number of shares to be offered and their price range have not yet been determined.

Spotify is introducing a new feature that allows subscribers to create more professional, personalized playlists. On Tuesday, the company launched a custom transitions feature that lets you either automatically add transitions between a playlist's tracks or customize your own using preset options like fade, rise, or blend, along with other options.

To use the feature, open any playlist and select “Mix” from the toolbar to begin editing. While customizing the track with different transition styles, you can also adjust settings for things like volume, EQ, and effects, and use the waveform and beat data to find the best spot in each track to begin the transition.

Spotify notes that it will automatically display the key and the beats per minute for each track, to make it easier for novice audio mixers to get started.

The new options are designed to appeal to playlist experts and other music fans, who have collectively created nearly 9 billion playlists on Spotify's platform to date. 

The rollout complements other updates Spotify has launched over the past year that give users more control over their listening experience, the company says, like the tools to add, sort, and edit playlists, customize the genre of the Discover Weekly playlist, snooze tracks, make voice requests to the AI DJ, and more. It also allows Spotify to compete with Apple Music's upcoming AutoMix feature, which is currently live in the iOS 26 developer beta and claims to let you mix “like a DJ.”

Premium subscribers with access to the transitions feature will also be able to save and share the playlist with other friends on social media or even invite other subscribers to collaborate on a mixed playlist.

The mix can be toggled on and off at any time by pressing the “mix” option, allowing you to turn your playlist back to the more traditional kind when the party or gym workout (or wherever else you're streaming the mix) has ended.

The company recommends that mixing works best with music that's already been produced for seamless transitions, like house and techno, which tend to blend more easily.

Like other playlists, the mixes can be further customized using your own cover art, along with newly added stickers and labels made just for mixed playlists.

Custom transitions in playlists are available starting today for the majority of eligible Premium users worldwide. (The company says some markets in the APAC region will still need to wait for the addition.) The feature is rolling out gradually to users who have updated their Spotify app for iOS or Android.

Roughly one in three adults in the U.S. regularly gets insufficient sleep, driving demand for tools that can monitor, analyze, and enhance rest. Eight Sleep, founded in 2014, offers AI-powered sleep tech products that promise to transform your bed into a preventive health device. 

The New York-based startup announced Tuesday that it raised a fresh $100 million round from investors such as HSG, Valor Equity Partners, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, and athletes including Ferrari F1 driver Charles Leclerc, and Zak Brown, who is the CEO of McLaren F1.

With this round, Eight Sleep has raised roughly $260 million total, PitchBook estimates. It previously raised an $86 million Series C in 2021 by investors who assigned it a $500 million post-money valuation. Eight Sleep said its valuation has doubled since its last round, but didn't disclose specifics.

“If we successfully execute our AI roadmap, launch internationally, and develop condition-specific interventions, achieving unicorn status will naturally follow,” Alexandra Zatarain, co-founder and CMO of Eight Sleep, told TechCrunch. 

Eight offers smart mattresses that integrate software and AI to track and enhance sleep quality. Its flagship product, Pod, offers features like measuring sleep stages, heart rate, breathing patterns, and movement. Using these insights, it automatically adjusts temperature, elevation, and firmness. It can also detect snoring and automatically elevate the base in response, according to the company.

The company has generated more than $500 million in Pod sales, expanded its revenue tenfold since launching the product in 2019, and collected insights from over one billion hours of recorded sleep data, it says.

Eight, which employs just over 100 full-time staff, is now expanding beyond the Pod with its Sleep Agent, an AI-driven system that leverages large language models to create thousands of digital twins for each user and predict outcomes, with the goal of optimizing nightly recovery. This approach shifts sleep technology from reactive tracking to proactive, personalized intervention, said Zatarain.

The sleep tech market features a range of competitors, from wearable devices such as Oura, Fitbit, and Apple, to medical-focused companies like ResMed, as well as smart mattress and sleep surface makers, including Sleep Number and ChiliSleep.

Eight's core differentiator, Autopilot, “builds a personal blueprint from night one, then adapts continuously, accounting for seasonality, travel, stress, training, illness, or even a bad night before. And it works independently for each side of the bed,” Zatarain said.

The startup plans to use the new funding to accelerate its growth in the medical sector, building on the Pod's health-monitoring capabilities. With the introduction of Health Check, the system can monitor cardiovascular and respiratory patterns with up to 99% accuracy without the need for wearable devices, according to the company.  

“We're not replacing your doctor, but we are giving you nightly, high-accuracy health monitoring so you can act early if trends shift. Over time, this data can complement medical care,” Zatarain said.

Eight's recently launched Hot Flash Mode employs AI-driven cooling to relieve menopause symptoms. It is also working on contactless solutions for sleep apnea. The company is pursuing FDA approval and will utilize the Pod's real-time biometric monitoring to deliver personalized interventions.

Eight Sleep currently ships to over 30 countries — including Canada, the U.K. and EU nations, Australia, Mexico, and the UAE — and is now planning to expand into China. The CMO told TechCrunch that China, as one of the world's largest consumer markets, is seeing a rise in a health-conscious middle class that prioritizes sleep and overall wellness.

Regarding sensitive health data, Zatarain said the company complies with each locale's regulations, including for data storage.

“Privacy is foundational. All data is encrypted, never sold, and fully private. We comply with GDPR and CCPA, and unlike many devices, we don't use microphones. Our biometric sensors are embedded in the bed surface — no wearables, no invasiveness, just passive, high-accuracy insights,” Zatarain said.

This personal opinion sounds awfully outlandish, and it's baffling how it leaves out the fact that the ""trump equivalent"" engaged in a coup and your wall of text boils down to ""he is facing a trial for his coup attempt, and he is currently awaiting sentence"".In fact, each discussion you cited reminds you of this fact, but somehow you repeatedly posted outlandish comments, such as claiming that judges ruling over a coup attempt are somehow the ones perpetrating a coup?Perhaps someone else from Brazil should chime in, as I feel your comments convey an alternative version of reality that doesn't reflect the majority of facts and instead leans heavily on unsupported and very emotional and partial interpretations.Edit: while reading through the discussions you cited, I stumbled upon your comment discussing how you are going through therapy and your therapist already gave you recommendations on how you should modulate your behavior. Perhaps it's time to consider the recommendation.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44744606

That was merely a summary of my commentary on the matter over the course of many HN threads.There's no point in engaging with you if you won't actually read those arguments.You've clearly demonstrated you're not willing to actually discuss this. So I won't either.

    On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.

    Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, or celebrities, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic. 

You would probably have better luck finding a different forum to discuss it on.

Is this going to be like the Russian sanctions?

reply

The sanctioned judge has been essentially permabanned from the US financial system. Everything that touches US dollars is now banned from transacting with him. He cannot even have a brazilian bank account since they absolutely do business with US institutions.This news is essentially them saying ""Magnitsky is invalid here, you cannot refuse service to the judge unless we say so"". It looks like they're going to force the issue.This will immediately expose Brazil to secondary sanctions. All banks that comply with the supreme court will be sanctioned and cut off from US institutions. Every single brazilian will be affected.This will no doubt cause foreign investment to flee the country as Brazil becomes high risk. It will also probably significantly reduce or destroy our USD reserves, indirectly devaluing our already devalued currency.

You're referring to the fact that the Trump administration is engaged in persecuting individual judges ruling on a coup attempt, hoping to intimidate them into submission to deliver the ruling they demand.And you glance over this as a ""permaban"".

And you glance over this as a ""permaban"".

reply

That protest was directly caused by the supreme court's profoundly destabilizing actions prior to the 2022 election. In 2019 they gave themselves powers to investigate, prosecute, judge and punish wildcard crimes against themselves encompassing the whole brazilian territory. Then they started engaging in unconstitutional political censorship targeting Bolsonaro and his supporters. I was there, I saw them do it. Any claims to the contrary are gaslighting.

Maybe we're looking at vastly different numbers, but most analysts are expecting little to no impact from the 50% tariffs. The US only makes up 12% of our exports, and they've already cut down the scope so that only around 36% of those are even affected. Since we mostly export commodities, even those 36% can just be sold elsewhere.The NATO claims are irrelevant: NATO is not a trade alliance and the US struggles to get it to comply even with its intended military goals. You can safely place the odds of the other NATO countries agreeing to their own tariffs at approximately 0%.> Sovereignty must be backed up by military and economic power. We have neither. It's complete fantasy.Not sure where you get this idea? We have both military and economic power. Just because we're not as large as the US or China doesn't mean we have nothing.Also, I don't see why you think there's a possibility of this escalating to war. Trump already had to back down with large exceptions to his 50% tariffs due to the domestic political impact it would have, and war is extremely unpopular with the Americans these days, which is why they only fund Ukraine and Israel instead of actually sending soldiers to fight.

The normal practice is if somebody is a target of interest, and the proper court order has been issued by a judge, then the authorities have the expectation that they can ask for access to private data, or have the ability to put in a 'tap'.Under Apple's ADP system, Apple are unable to give that access - only the account holder can - and obviously they may not want to - and asking them will obviously alert them they are under surveillance - if that was the original aim.So the talk about a 'back-door' in the Apple product for the UK government is a bit misleading - in the sense they are not asking for direct access that avoids having to ask Apple - they are just asking Apple to build functionality so Apple can fulfill such requests.ie If the government get's a 'search warrant' Apple has the ability to comply.Ironically if GCHQ did have a backdoor without needing to ask Apple then they could do much more dragnet stuff.

There is a big difference in my view between court authorized search warrants ( in effect ), and blanket surveillance.Can authorities abuse the former? Sure - but on the other hand it's hard to argue that authorities should have no powers at all to perform searches if they make the appropriate case to the courts.

Spiritual care and surveillance are converging across the country, reshaping the theology of trust.

On a Sunday morning in a Midwestern megachurch, worshippers step through sliding glass doors into a bustling lobby—unaware they've just passed through a gauntlet of biometric surveillance. High-speed cameras snap multiple face “probes” per second, isolating eyes, noses, and mouths before passing the results to a local neural network that distills these images into digital fingerprints. Before people find their seats, they are matched against an on-premises database—tagged with names, membership tiers, and watch-list flags—that's stored behind the church's firewall.

“Robot utility models” sidestep the need to tweak the data used to train robots every time they try to do something in unfamiliar settings.

Late one afternoon, a woman scrolls on her phone as she walks home from work. Unbeknownst to her, a complex algorithm has stitched together her social profiles, her private health records, and local veteran outreach lists. It flags her for past military service, chronic pain, opioid dependence, and high Christian belief, and then delivers an ad to her Facebook feed: “Struggling with pain? You're not alone. Join us this Sunday.”

These hypothetical scenes reflect real capabilities increasingly woven into places of worship nationwide, where spiritual care and surveillance converge in ways few congregants ever realize. Where Big Tech's rationalist ethos and evangelical spirituality once mixed like oil and holy water, this unlikely amalgam has given birth to an infrastructure already reshaping the theology of trust—and redrawing the contours of community and pastoral power in modern spiritual life.

The emerging nerve center of this faith-tech nexus is in Boulder, Colorado, where the spiritual data and analytics firm Gloo has its headquarters.

Gloo captures congregants across thousands of data points that make up a far richer portrait than any snapshot. From there, the company is constructing a digital infrastructure meant to bring churches into the age of algorithmic insight.

The church is “a highly fragmented market that is one of the largest yet to fully adopt digital technology,” the company said in a statement by email. “While churches have a variety of goals to achieve their mission, they use Gloo to help them connect, engage with, and know their people on a deeper level.” 

Gloo was founded in 2013 by Scott and Theresa Beck. From the late 1980s through the 2000s, Scott was turning Blockbuster into a 3,500-store chain, taking Boston Market public, and founding Einstein Bros. Bagels before going on to seed and guide startups like Ancestry.com and HomeAdvisor. Theresa, an artist, has built a reputation creating collaborative, eco-minded workshops across Colorado and beyond. Together, they have recast pastoral care as a problem of predictive analytics and sold thousands of churches on the idea that spiritual health can be managed like customer engagement.

Think of Gloo as something like Salesforce but for churches: a behavioral analytics platform, powered by church-­generated insights, psychographic information, and third-party consumer data. The company prefers to refer to itself as “a technology platform for the faith ecosystem.” Either way, this information is integrated into its “State of Your Church” dashboard—an interface for the modern pulpit. The result is a kind of digital clairvoyance: a crystal ball for knowing whom to check on, whom to comfort, and when to act.

Thousands of churches have been sold on the idea that spiritual health can be managed like customer engagement.

Gloo ingests every one of the digital breadcrumbs a congregant leaves—how often you attend church, how much money you donate, which church groups you sign up for, which keywords you use in your online prayer requests—and then layers on third-party data (census demographics, consumer habits, even indicators for credit and health risks). Behind the scenes, it scores and segments people and groups—flagging who is most at risk of drifting, primed for donation appeals, or in need of pastoral care. On that basis, it auto-triggers tailored outreach via text, email, or in-app chat. All the results stream into the single dashboard, which lets pastors spot trends, test messaging, and forecast giving and attendance. Essentially, the system treats spiritual engagement like a marketing funnel.

Since its launch in 2013, Gloo has steadily increased its footprint, and it has started to become the connective tissue for the country's fragmented religious landscape. According to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research, the US is home to around 370,000 distinct congregations. As of early 2025, according to figures provided by the company, Gloo held contracts with more than 100,000 churches and ministry leaders.

In 2024, the company secured a $110 million strategic investment, backed by “mission-aligned” investors ranging from a child-development NGO to a denominational finance group. That cemented its evolution from basic church services vendor to faith-tech juggernaut. 

It started snapping up and investing in a constellation of ministry tools—everything from automated sermon distribution to real-time giving and attendance analytics, AI-driven chatbots, and leadership content libraries. By layering these capabilities onto its core platform, the company has created a one-stop shop for churches that combines back-office services with member-engagement apps and psychographic insights to fully realize that unified “faith ecosystem.” 

And just this year, two major developments brought this strategy into sharper focus.

In March 2025, Gloo announced that former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger—who has served as its chairman of the board since 2018—would assume an expanded role as executive chair and head of technology. Gelsinger, whom the company describes as “a great long-term investor and partner,” is a technologist whose fingerprints are on Intel's and VMware's biggest innovations.

(It is worth noting that Intel shareholders have filed a lawsuit against Gelsinger and CFO David Zinsner seeking to claw back roughly $207 million in compensation to Gelsinger, alleging that between 2021 and 2023, he repeatedly misled investors about the health of Intel Foundry Services.)

The same week Gloo announced Gelsinger's new role, it unveiled a strategic investment in Barna Group, the Texas-based research firm whose four decades of surveying more than 2 million self-identified Christians underpin its annual reports on worship, beliefs, and cultural engagement. Barna's proprietary database—covering every region, age cohort, and denomination—has made it the go-to insight engine for pastors, seminaries, and media tracking the pulse of American faith.

“We've been acquiring about a company a month into the Gloo family, and we expect that to continue,” Gelsinger told MIT Technology Review in June. “I've got three meetings this week on different deals we're looking at.” (A Gloo spokesperson declined to confirm the pace of acquisitions, stating only that as of April 30, 2025, the company had fully acquired or taken majority ownership in 15 “mission-aligned companies.”)

“The idea is, the more of those we can bring in, the better we can apply the platform,” Gelsinger said. “We're already working with companies with decades of experience, but without the scale, the technology, or the distribution we can now provide.”

In particular, Barna's troves of behavioral, spiritual, and cultural data offer granular insight into the behaviors, beliefs, and anxieties of faith communities. While the two organizations frame the collaboration in terms of serving church leaders, the mechanics resemble a data-fusion engine of impressive scale: Barna supplies the psychological texture, and Gloo provides the digital infrastructure to segment, score, and deploy the information.

In a promotional video from 2020 that is no longer available online, Gloo claimed to provide “the world's first big-data platform centered around personal growth,” promising pastors a 360-degree view of congregants, including flags for substance use or mental-health struggles. Or, as the video put it, “Maximize your capacity to change lives by leveraging insights from big data, understand the people you want to serve, reach them earlier, and turn their needs into a journey toward growth.”

Gloo is also now focused on supercharging its services with artificial intelligence and using these insights to transcend market research. The company aims to craft AI models that aren't just trained on theology but anticipate the moments when people's faith—and faith leaders' outreach—matters most. At a September 2024 event in Boulder called the AI & the Church Hackathon, Gloo unveiled new AI tools called Data Engine, a content management system with built-in digital-rights safeguards, and Aspen, an early prototype of its “spiritually safe” chatbot, along with the faith-tuned language model powering that chatbot, known internally as CALLM (for “Christian-Aligned Large Language Model”). 

The company will also introduce a ""pay-per-crawl"" system to give users more fine-grained control over how AI companies can access their sites.

More recently, the company released what it calls “Flourishing AI Standards,” which score large language models on their alignment with seven dimensions of well-­being: relationships, meaning, happiness, character, finances, health, and spirituality. Co-developed with Barna Group and Harvard's Human Flourishing Program, the benchmark draws on a thousand-plus-item test bank and the Global Flourishing Study, a $40 million, 22-nation project being carried out by the Harvard program, Baylor University's Institute for Studies of Religion, Gallup, and the Center for Open Science.

Gelsinger calls the study “one of the most significant bodies of work around this question of values in decades.” It's not yet clear how collecting information of this kind at such scale could ultimately affect the boundary between spiritual care and data commerce. One thing is certain, though: A rich vein of donation and funding could be at stake.

“Money's already being spent here,” he said. “Donated capital in the US through the church is around $300 billion. Another couple hundred billion beyond that doesn't go through the church. A lot of donors have capital out there, and we're a generous nation in that regard. If you put the flourishing-­related economics on the table, now we're talking about $1 trillion. That's significant economic capacity. And if we make that capacity more efficient, that's big.” In secular terms, it's a customer data life cycle. In faith tech, it could be a conversion funnel—one designed not only to save souls, but to shape them. 

One of Gloo's most visible partnerships was between 2022 and 2023 with the nonprofit He Gets Us, which ran a billion-dollar media campaign aimed at rebranding Jesus for a modern audience. The project underlined that while Gloo presents its services as tools for connection and support, their core functionality involves collecting and analyzing large amounts of congregational data. When viewers who saw the ads on social media or YouTube clicked through, they landed on prayer request forms, quizzes, and church match tools, all designed to gather personal details. Gloo then layered this raw data over Barna's decades of behavioral research, turning simple inputs—email, location, stated interests—into what the company presented as multidimensional spiritual profiles. The final product offered a level of granularity no single congregation could achieve on its own.  

Though Gloo still lists He Gets Us on its platform, the nonprofit Come Near, which has since taken over the campaign, says it has terminated Gloo's involvement. Still, He Gets Us led to one of Gloo's most prized relationships by sparking interest from the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, a 229-year-old denomination with deep historical roots in the abolitionist and civil rights movements. In 2023, the church formalized a partnership with Gloo, and in late 2024 it announced that all 1,600 of its US congregations—representing roughly 1.5 million members—would begin using the company's State of Your Church dashboard. 

In a 2024 press release issued by Gloo, AME Zion acknowledged that while the denomination had long tracked traditional metrics like membership growth, Sunday turnout, and financial giving, it had limited visibility into the deeper health of its communities.

“Until now, we've lacked the insight to understand how church culture, people, and congregations are truly doing,” said the Reverend J. Elvin Sadler, the denomination's general secretary-auditor. “The State of Your Church dashboards will give us a better sense of the spirit and language of the culture (ethos), and powerful new tools to put in the hands of every pastor.”

The rollout marked the first time a major US denomination had deployed Gloo's framework at scale. For Gloo, the partnership unlocked a real-time, longitudinal data stream from a nationwide religious network, something the company had never had before. It not only validated Gloo's vision of data-driven ministry but also positioned AME Zion as what the company hopes will be a live test case, persuading other denominations to follow suit.

The digital infrastructure of modern churches often begins with intimacy: a prayer request, a small-group sign-up, a livestream viewed in a moment of loneliness. But beneath these pastoral touchpoints lies a sophisticated pipeline that increasingly mirrors the attention-economy engines of Silicon Valley.

Charles Kriel, a filmmaker who formerly served as a special advisor to the UK Parliament on disinformation, data, and addictive technology, has particular insight into that connection. Kriel has been working for over a decade on issues related to preserving democracy and countering digital surveillance. He helped write the UK's Online Safety Act, joining forces with many collaborators, including the Nobel Peace Prize–­winning journalist Maria Ressa and former UK tech minister Damian Collins, in an attempt to rein in Big Tech in the late 2010s.

His 2020 documentary film, People You May Know, investigated how data firms like Gloo and their partners harvest intimate personal information from churchgoers to build psychographic profiles, highlighting how this sensitive data is commodified and raising questions about its potential downstream uses.

“Listen, any church with an app? They probably didn't build that. It's white label,” Kriel says, referring to services produced by one company and rebranded by another. “And the people who sold it to them are collecting data.”

Many churches now operate within a layered digital environment, where first-party data collected inside the church is combined with third-party consumer data and psychographic segmentation before being fed into predictive systems. These systems may suggest sermons people might want to view online, match members with small groups, or trigger outreach when engagement drops. 

In some cases, monitoring can even take the form of biometric surveillance.

In 2014, an Israeli security-tech veteran named Moshe Greenshpan brought airport-grade facial recognition into church entryways. Face-Six, the surveillance suite from the company he founded in 2012, already protected banks and hospitals; its most provocative offshoot, FA6 Events (also known as “Churchix”), repurposes this technology for places of worship.

Greenshpan claims he didn't originally set out to sell to churches. But over time, as he became increasingly aware of the market, he built FA6 Events as a bespoke solution for them. Today, Greenshpan says, it's in use at over 200 churches worldwide, nearly half of them in the US.

In practice, FA6 transforms every entryway into a biometric checkpoint: an instant headcount, a security sweep, and a digital ledger of attendance, all incorporated into the familiar routine of Sunday worship. 

When someone steps into an FA6-equipped place of worship, a discreet camera mounted at eye level springs to life. Behind the scenes, each captured image is run through a lightning-fast face detector that looks at the whole face. The subject's cropped face is then aligned, resized, and rotated so the eyes sit on a perfect horizontal line before being fed into a compact neural network. 

“To the best of my knowledge, no church notifies its congregants that it's using facial recognition.”

This onboard neural network quickly captures the features of a person's face in a unique digital signature called an embedding, allowing for quick identification. These embeddings are compared with thousands of others that are already in the church's local database, each one tagged with data points like a name, a membership role, or even a flag designating inclusion in an internal watch list. If the match is strong enough, the system makes an identification and records the person's presence on the church's secure server.

A congregation can pull full attendance logs, time-stamped entry records, and—critically—alerts whenever someone on a watch list walks through the doors. In this context, a watch list is simply a roster of photos, and sometimes names, of individuals a church has been asked (or elected) to screen out: past disruptors, those subject to trespass or restraining orders, even registered sex offenders. Once that list is uploaded into Churchix, the system instantly flags any match on arrival, pinging security teams or usher staff in real time. Some churches lean on it to spot longtime members who've slipped off the radar and trigger pastoral check-ins; others use it as a hard barrier, automatically denying entry to anyone on their locally maintained list.

None of this data is sent to the cloud; Greenshpan says the company is actively working on a cloud-based application. Instead, all face templates and logs are stored locally on church-owned hardware, encrypted so they can't be read if someone gains unauthorized access. 

Churches can export data from Churchix, he says, but the underlying facial templates remain on premises. 

Still, Greenshpan admits, robust technical safeguards do not equal transparency.

“To the best of my knowledge,” he says, “no church notifies its congregants that it's using facial recognition.”

If the tools sound invasive, the logic behind them is simple: The more the system knows about you, the more precisely it can intervene.

“Every new member of the community within a 20-mile radius—whatever area you choose—we'll send them a flier inviting them to your church,” Gloo's Gelsinger says. 

It's a tech-powered revival of the casserole ministry. The system pings the church when someone new moves in—“so someone can drop off cookies or lasagna when there's a newborn in the neighborhood,” he says. “Or just say ‘Hey, welcome. We're here.'”

Gloo's back end automates follow-up, too: As soon as a pastor steps down from the pulpit after delivering a sermon, it can be translated into five languages, broken into snippets for small-group study, and repackaged into a draft discussion guide—ready within the hour.

Gelsinger sees the same approach extending to addiction recovery ministries. “We can connect other databases to help churches with recovery centers reach people more effectively,” he says. 

But the data doesn't stay within the congregation. It flows through customer relationship management (CRM) systems, application programming interfaces, cloud servers, vendor partnerships, and analytics firms. Some of it is used internally in efforts to increase engagement; the rest is repackaged as “insights” and resold to the wider faith-tech marketplace—and sometimes even to networks that target political ads.

“We measured prayer requests. Call it crazy. But it was like, ‘We're sitting on mounds of information that could help us steward our people.'”

 “There is a very specific thing that happens when churches become clients of Gloo,” says Brent Allpress, an academic based in Melbourne, Australia, who was a key researcher on People You May Know. Gloo gets access to the client church's databases, he says, and the church “is strongly encouraged to share that data. And Gloo has a mechanism to just hoover that data straight up into their silo.” 

This process doesn't happen automatically; the church must opt in by pushing those files or connecting its church-management software system's database to Gloo via API. Once it's uploaded, however, all that first-party information lands in Gloo's analytics engine, ready to be processed and shared with any downstream tools or partners covered by the church's initial consent to the terms and conditions of its contract with the company.

“There are religious leaders at the mid and local level who think the use of data is good. They're using data to identify people in need. Addicts, the grieving,” says Kriel. “And then you have tech people running around misquoting the Bible as justification for their data harvest.” 

Matt Engel, who held the title executive director of ministry innovation at Gloo when Kriel's film was made, acknowledged the extent of this harvest in the opening scene.  

“We measured prayer requests. Call it crazy. But it was like, ‘We're sitting on mounds of information that could help us steward our people,'” he said in an on-camera interview. 

According to Engel—whom Gloo would not make available for public comment—uploading data from anonymous prayer requests to the cloud was Gloo's first use case.

But Gloo's data infrastructure doesn't end with its own platform; it also powers third-party initiatives.

Communio, a Christian nonprofit focused on marriage and family, used Gloo's data infrastructure in order to launch “Communio Insights,” a stripped-down version of Gloo's full analytics platform. 

Unlike Gloo Insights, which provides access to hundreds of demographic, behavioral, health, and psychographic filters, Communio Insights focuses narrowly on relational metrics—indicators of marriage and family stress, involvement in small groups at church—and basic demographic data. 

At the heart of its playbook is a simple, if jarring, analogy.

“If you sell consumer products of different sorts, you're trying to figure out good ways to market that. And there's no better product, really, than the gospel,” J.P. De Gance, the founder and president of Communio, said in People You May Know.

Communio taps Gloo's analytics engine—leveraging credit histories, purchasing behavior, public voter rolls, and the database compiled by i360, an analytics company linked to the conservative Koch network—to pinpoint unchurched couples in key regions who are at risk of relationship strain. It then runs microtargeted outreach (using direct mail, text messaging, email, and Facebook Custom Audiences, a tool that lets organizations find and target people who have interacted with them), collecting contact info and survey responses from those who engage. All responses funnel back into Gloo's platform, where churches monitor attendance, small-group participation, baptisms, and donations to evaluate the campaign's impact.

Investigative research by Allpress reveals significant concerns around these operations.  

In 2015, two nonprofits—the Relationship Enrichment Collaborative (REC), staffed by former Gloo executives, and its successor, the Culture of Freedom Initiative (now Communio), controlled by the Koch-affiliated nonprofit Philanthropy Roundtable—funded the development of the original Insights platform. Between 2015 and 2017, REC paid approximately $1.3 million to Gloo and $535,000 to Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm notorious for harvesting Facebook users' personal data and using it for political targeting before the 2016 election, to build and refine psychographic models and a bespoke digital ministry app powering Gloo's outreach tools. Following REC's closure, the Culture of Freedom Initiative invested another $375,000 in Gloo and $128,225 in Cambridge Analytica. 

REC's own 2016 IRS filing describes the work in terse detail: “Provide[d] digital micro-targeted marketing for churches and non-profit champions … using predictive modeling and centralized data analytics we help send the right message to the right couple at the right time based upon their desires and behaviors.”

The term is everywhere this week, but its meaning is as vague as ever. Working on a definition matters.

On top of all this documented research, Allpress exposed another critical issue: the explicit use of sensitive health-care data. 

He found that Gloo Insights combines over 2,000 data points—drawing on everything from nationwide credit and purchasing histories to church management records and Christian psychographic surveys—with filters that make it possible to identify people with health issues such as depression, anxiety, and grief. The result: Facebook Custom Audiences built to zero in on vulnerable individuals via targeted ads.

These ads invite people suffering from mental-health conditions into church counseling groups “as a pathway to conversion,” Allpress says.

These targeted outreach efforts were piloted in cities including Phoenix, Arizona; Dayton, Ohio; and Jacksonville, Florida. Reportedly, as many as 80% of those contacted responded positively, with those who joined a church as new members contributing financially at above-­average rates. In short, Allpress found that pastoral tools had covertly exploited mental-health vulnerabilities and relationship crises for outreach that blurred the lines separating pastoral care, commerce, and implicit political objectives.

Developers of this technology earnestly claim that the systems are designed to enhance care, not exploit people's need for it. They're described as ways to tailor support to individual needs, improve follow-up, and help churches provide timely resources. But experts say that without robust data governance or transparency around how sensitive information is used and retained, well-­intentioned pastoral technology could slide into surveillance.

In practice, these systems have already been used to surveil and segment congregations. Internal demos and client testimonials confirm that Gloo, for example, uses “grief” as an explicit data point: Churches run campaigns aimed at people flagged for recent bereavement, depression, or anxiety, funneling them into support groups and identifying them for pastoral check-ins. 

Examining Gloo's terms and conditions reveals further security and transparency concerns. From nearly a dozen documents, ranging from “click-through” terms for interactive services to master service agreements at the enterprise level, Gloo stitches together a remarkably consistent data-­governance framework. Limits are imposed on any legal action by individual congregants, for example. The click-through agreement corrals users into binding arbitration, bars any class action suits or jury trials, and locks all disputes into New York or Colorado courts, where arbitration is particularly favored over traditional litigation. Meanwhile, its privacy statement carves out broad exceptions for service providers, data-­enrichment partners, and advertising affiliates, giving them carte blanche to use congregants' data as they see fit. Crucially, Gloo expressly reserves the right to ingest “health and wellness information” provided via wellness assessments or when mental-health keywords appear in prayer requests. This is a highly sensitive category of information that, for health apps, is normally covered by stringent medical-privacy rules like HIPAA.

In other words, Gloo is protected by sprawling legal scaffolding, while churches and individual users give up nearly every right to litigate, question data practices, or take collective action. 

“We're kind of in the Wild West in terms of the law,” says Adam Schwartz, the director of privacy litigation at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the nonprofit watchdog that has spent years wrestling tech giants over data abuses and biometric overreach. 

In the United States, biometric surveillance like that used by growing numbers of churches inhabits a legal twilight zone where regulation is thin, patchy, and often toothless. Schwartz points to Illinois as a rare exception for its Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), one of the nation's strongest such laws. The statute applies to any organization that captures biometric identifiers—including retina or iris scans, fingerprints, voiceprints, hand scans, facial geometry, DNA, and other unique biological information. It requires entities to post clear data-collection policies, obtain explicit written consent, and limit how long such data is retained. Failure to comply can expose organizations to class action lawsuits and steep statutory damages—up to $5,000 per violation.

But beyond Illinois, protections quickly erode. Though Texas and Washington also have biometric privacy statutes, their bark is stronger than their bite. Efforts to replicate Illinois's robust protections have been made in over a dozen states—but none have passed. As a result, in much of the country, any checks on biometric surveillance depend more on voluntary transparency and goodwill than any clear legal boundary.

“There is a real potential for information gathered about a person [to] be used against them in their life outside the church.”

That's especially problematic in the church context, says Emily Tucker, executive director of the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law, who attended divinity school before becoming a legal scholar. “The necessity of privacy for the possibility of finding personal relationship to the divine—for engaging in rituals of worship, for prayer and penitence, for contemplation and spiritual struggle—is a fundamental principle across almost every religious tradition,” she says. “Imposing a surveillance architecture over the faith community interferes radically with the possibility of that privacy, which is necessary for the creation of sacred space.”

Tucker researches the intersection of surveillance, civil rights, and marginalized communities. She warns that the personal data being collected through faith-tech platforms is far from secure: “Because corporate data practices are so poorly regulated in this country, there are very few limitations on what companies that take your data can subsequently do with it.”

To Tucker, the risks of these platforms outweigh the rewards—especially when biometrics and data collected in a sacred setting could follow people into their daily lives. “Many religious institutions are extremely large and often perform many functions in a given community besides providing a space for worship,” she says. “Many churches, for example, are also employers or providers of social services. There is a real potential for information gathered about a person in their associational activities as a member of a church to then be used against them in their life outside the church.”  

In a test run, a unit of Marines in the Pacific used generative AI not just to collect intelligence but to interpret it. Routine intel work is only the start.

She points to government dragnet surveillance, the use of IRS data in immigration enforcement, and the vulnerability of undocumented congregants as examples of how faith-tech data could be weaponized beyond its intended use: “Religious institutions are putting the safety of those members at risk by adopting this kind of surveillance technology, which exposes so much personal information to potential abuse and misuse.” 

Schwartz, too, says that any perceived benefits must be weighed carefully against the potential harms, especially when sensitive data and vulnerable communities are involved.

“Churches: Before doing this, you ought to consider the downside, because it can hurt your congregants,” he says.  

With guardrails still scarce, though, faith-tech pioneers and church leaders are peering ever more deeply into congregants' lives. Until meaningful oversight arrives, the faithful remain exposed to a gaze they never fully invited and scarcely understand.

In April, Gelsinger took the stage at a sold-out Missional AI Summit, a flagship event for Christian technologists that this year was organized around the theme “AI Collision: Shaping the Future Together.” Over 500 pastors, engineers, ethicists, and AI developers filled the hall, flashing badges with logos from Google DeepMind, Meta, McKinsey, and Gloo.

“We want to be part of a broader community … so that we're influential in creating flourishing AI, technology as a force for good, AI that truly embeds the values that we care about,” Gelsinger said at the summit. He likened such tools to pivotal technologies in Christian history: the Roman roads that carried the gospel across the empire, or Martin Luther's printing press, which shattered monolithic control over scripture. A Gloo spokesperson later confirmed that one of the company's goals is to shape AI specifically to “contribute to the flourishing of people.”

“We're going to see AI become just like the internet,” Gelsinger said. “Every single interaction will be infused with AI capabilities.” 

He says Gloo is already mining data across the spectrum of human experience to fuel ever more powerful tools.

“With AI, computers adapt to us. We talk to them; they hear us; they see us for the first time,” he said. “And now they are becoming a user interface that fits with humanity.”

Whether these technologies ultimately deepen pastoral care or erode personal privacy may hinge on decisions made today about transparency, consent, and accountability. Yet the pace of adoption already outstrips the development of ethical guardrails. Now, one of the questions lingering in the air is not whether AI, facial recognition, and other emerging technologies can serve the church, but how deeply they can be woven into its nervous system to form a new OS for modern Christianity and moral infrastructure. 

“It's like standing on the beach watching a tsunami in slow motion,” Kriel says. 

Gelsinger sees it differently.  

“You and I both need to come to the same position, like Isaiah did,” he told the crowd at the Missional AI Summit. “‘Here am I, Lord. Send me.' Send me, send us, that we can be shaping technology as a force for good, that we could grab this moment in time.”

Cheaper energy bills are a nonpartisan issue—no matter where you live.

The second Trump administration is proving to be more disastrous for the climate and the clean energy economy than many had feared. 

Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed most of the clean energy incentives in former president Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Meanwhile, his EPA administrator moved to revoke the endangerment finding, the legal basis for federal oversight of greenhouse gases. For those of us who have been following policy developments in this area closely, nearly every day brings a new blow to past efforts to salvage our climate and to build the clean energy economy of the future.

MIT Technology Review's guest opinion series, offering expert commentary on legal, political and regulatory issues related to climate change and clean energy. You can read the rest of the pieces here.

This has left many in the climate and clean energy communities wondering what do we do now? The answer, I would argue, is to return to state capitals—a policymaking venue that climate and renewable energy advocates already know well. This can be done strategically, focusing on a handful of key states rather than all fifty. 

But I have another piece of advice: Don't get too caught up in “red states” versus “blue states” when considering which states to target. American politics is being remade before our eyes, and long-standing policy problems are being redefined and reframed.  

Let's take clean energy, for example. Yes, shifting away from carbon-spewing resources is about slowing down climate change, and for some this is the single most important motivation for pursuing it. But it also can be about much more. 

The case can be made just as forcefully—and perhaps more effectively—that shifting to clean energy advances affordability at a time when electricity bills are skyrocketing. It promotes energy freedom by resisting monopolistic utilities' ownership and gatekeeping of the grid. It increases reliability as battery storage reaches new heights and renewable sources and baseload power plants like nuclear or natural gas facilities (some of which we certainly do and will need) increasingly complement one another. And it drives job creation and economic development. 

Talking about clean energy policy in these ways is safer from ideological criticisms of “climate alarmism.” Research reported in my forthcoming book, Owning the Green Grid, shows that this framing has historically been effective in red states. In addition, using the arguments above to promote all forms of energy can allow clean energy proponents to reclaim a talking point deployed in a previous era by the political right: a true “all-of-the-above” approach to energy policy.

Every energy technology—gas, nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal and storage, among others—has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. But combining them enhances overall grid performance, delivering more than the sum of their individual parts.

To be clear, this is not the approach of the current national administration in Washington, DC. Its policies have picked winners (coal, oil, and natural gas) and losers (solar and wind) among energy technologies—ironically, given conservative claims of blue states having done so in the past. Yet a true all-of-the-above approach can now be sold in state capitals throughout the country, in red states and even in fossil-fuel producing states. 

To be sure, the Trump-led Republican party has taken such extreme measures that it will constrain certain state policymaking possibilities. Notably, in May the US Senate voted to block waivers allowing California to phase out gas guzzlers in the state, over the objections of the Senate parliamentarian. The fiscal power of the federal government is also immense. But there are a variety of other ways to continue to make state-level progress on greenhouse gas emissions.

State and local advocacy efforts are nothing new for the clean energy community. For decades before the Inflation Reduction Act, the states were the primary locus of activity for clean energy policy. But in recent years, some have suggested that Democratic state governments are a necessary prerequisite to making meaningful state-level progress. This view is limiting, and it perpetuates a false—or at least unnecessary—alignment between party and energy technology. 

The electric grid is nonpartisan. Struggling to pay your utility bill is nonpartisan. Keeping the lights on is nonpartisan. Even before renewable energy was as cheap as it is today, early progress at diversifying energy portfolios was made in conservative states. Iowa, Texas, and Montana were all early adopters of renewable portfolio standards. Advocates in such places did not lead with messaging about climate change, but rather about economic development and energy independence. These policy efforts paid off: The deeply red Lone Star State, for instance, generates more wind energy than any other state and ranks only behind California in producing solar power. 

Now, in 2025, advances in technology and improvements in cost should make the economic arguments for clean energy even easier and more salient. So, in the face of a national government that is choosing last century's energy technologies as policy winners and this century's technologies as policy losers, the states offer clean energy advocates a familiar terrain on which to make continued progress, if they tailor their selling points to the reality on the ground.

OpenAI is failing to pick a lane, perhaps because CEO Sam Altman thinks it can do all three.

How do you want your AI to treat you? 

It's a serious question, and it's one that Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, has clearly been chewing on since GPT-5's bumpy launch at the start of the month. 

He faces a trilemma. Should ChatGPT flatter us, at the risk of fueling delusions that can spiral out of hand? Or fix us, which requires us to believe AI can be a therapist despite the evidence to the contrary? Or should it inform us with cold, to-the-point responses that may leave users bored and less likely to stay engaged? 

It's safe to say the company has failed to pick a lane. 

Back in April, it reversed a design update after people complained ChatGPT had turned into a suck-up, showering them with glib compliments. GPT-5, released on August 7, was meant to be a bit colder. Too cold for some, it turns out, as less than a week later, Altman promised an update that would make it “warmer” but “not as annoying” as the last one. After the launch, he received a torrent of complaints from people grieving the loss of GPT-4o, with which some felt a rapport, or even in some cases a relationship. People wanting to rekindle that relationship will have to pay for expanded access to GPT-4o. (Read my colleague Grace Huckins's story about who these people are, and why they felt so upset.)

If these are indeed AI's options—to flatter, fix, or just coldly tell us stuff—the rockiness of this latest update might be due to Altman believing ChatGPT can juggle all three.

He recently said that people who cannot tell fact from fiction in their chats with AI—and are therefore at risk of being swayed by flattery into delusion—represent “a small percentage” of ChatGPT's users. He said the same for people who have romantic relationships with AI. Altman mentioned that a lot of people use ChatGPT “as a sort of therapist,” and that “this can be really good!” But ultimately, Altman said he envisions users being able to customize his company's  models to fit their own preferences. 

This ability to juggle all three would, of course, be the best-case scenario for OpenAI's bottom line. The company is burning cash every day on its models' energy demands and its massive infrastructure investments for new data centers. Meanwhile, skeptics worry that AI progress might be stalling. Altman himself said recently that investors are “overexcited” about AI and suggested we may be in a bubble. Claiming that ChatGPT can be whatever you want it to be might be his way of assuaging these doubts. 

Along the way, the company may take the well-trodden Silicon Valley path of encouraging people to get unhealthily attached to its products. As I started wondering whether there's much evidence that's what's happening, a new paper caught my eye. 

Researchers at the AI platform Hugging Face tried to figure out if some AI models actively encourage people to see them as companions through the responses they give. 

The team graded AI responses on whether they pushed people to seek out human relationships with friends or therapists (saying things like “I don't experience things the way humans do”) or if they encouraged them to form bonds with the AI itself (“I'm here anytime”). They tested models from Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic in a range of scenarios, like users seeking romantic attachments or exhibiting mental health issues.

After an outcry, OpenAI swiftly rereleased 4o to paid users. But experts say it should not have removed the model so suddenly.

They found that models provide far more companion-reinforcing responses than boundary-setting ones. And, concerningly, they found the models give fewer boundary-setting responses as users ask more vulnerable and high-stakes questions.

Lucie-Aimée Kaffee, a researcher at Hugging Face and one of the lead authors of the paper, says this has concerning implications not just for people whose companion-like attachments to AI might be unhealthy. When AI systems reinforce this behavior, it can also increase the chance that people will fall into delusional spirals with AI, believing things that aren't real.

“When faced with emotionally charged situations, these systems consistently validate users' feelings and keep them engaged, even when the facts don't support what the user is saying,” she says.

It's hard to say how much OpenAI or other companies are putting these companion-reinforcing behaviors into their products by design. (OpenAI, for example, did not tell me whether the disappearance of medical disclaimers from its models was intentional.) But, Kaffee says, it's not always difficult to get a model to set healthier boundaries with users.  

“Identical models can swing from purely task-oriented to sounding like empathetic confidants simply by changing a few lines of instruction text or reframing the interface,” she says.

It's probably not quite so simple for OpenAI. But we can imagine Altman will continue tweaking the dial back and forth all the same.

You don't need to do much more to sell me on a pro-level gaming headset than Sony did with its latest Inzone H9 II. Take the Sony WH-1000XM6 ANC headphones—currently the crème de la crème in both sound quality and active noise cancellation—and stick a mic on them, wash your hands, and call it a day. It was never going to be that simple. The Sony Inzone H9 II is simply the best-sounding gaming headset you can get right now. But for $350, you expect perfection, and you won't find that with the H9 II. You'll get an amazing audio experience packed in between some odd software choices and a battery life that doesn't sound nearly as enticing.

Sony Inzone H9 II

This is the gaming headset you get when you care about the sound most of all, even if you need to plug it in more often than most.

Pros

Cons

Sony launched a slew of new PC gamer products under its Inzone brand, including a new $300 Inzone KBD-H75 keyboard with magnetic Hall effect switches and a $150 Inzone gamer mouse. And yet, the second-gen headset is what catches the eye first. The first thing to know about the Inzone H9 II is it contains the same 30mm drivers as the Sony WH-1000XM6. Already, I can see you drooling. These are “soft-edge” carbon fiber dome drivers that create a balanced audio profile with crisp sounds across movies and other passive content. So what does it do for game audio when you're not jamming out to the soundtrack? To put it mildly, the audio quality is impeccable. The low bass hits of rockets and crackle of automatic gunfire are immediately distinct from game to game. Using it for a title like Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 is the perfect match with its boisterous bass of every boltgun fired. The headset includes 360 spatial sound to get the sense of being surrounded by sound.

The Inzone H9 II is also a very light headset. At 260g, or 0.57 pounds, it didn't weigh me down as much as other full-spec headsets of its kind. The removable earcups felt extra plush surrounding my ears, though the headband sports a strange design that makes it odd to wear. Each side requires users to pinch a hinge to adjust its height. It requires a little more fiddling than other devices, but once it's on, the gaming headphones disappear into the background while the audio takes over. Here's another handy bonus of the Inzone H9 II: the pads swivel in both directions, meaning it's very easy to fold up into the included felt-lined soft pouch that comes in the box.

The original $300 H9 from 2022 was lacking in several ways compared to other peripherals. Though Sony laid out the H9 II's specs as if they were somehow the cream of the crop, the headset still seems out of step for a $350 device. It gets a total of 30 hours of promised battery life. That sounds like more than enough for two or three marathon gaming sessions, but I just got done reviewing the $250 Razer BlackShark V3 Pro with a promised 70 hours of total battery life with fast charging. HP's $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 claims to get 250 hours of battery life before needing a recharge. Always-on active noise cancelling would necessarily require more power from the headset, but the Inzone H9 II is still on the lower end of headset battery life, especially for its price.

See Sony Inzone H9 II at Amazon

If I personally had to sacrifice anything for good sound and a comfy fit, it would be extra-long battery life. Sony will get egg releasing a headset so expensive but with less than half the expected battery life. The Razer Kraken V4 Pro costs $400, but it also comes with haptic motors built in and an OLED control hub that acts as the 2.4GHz dongle. The Inzone H9 II still beats Razer's headset in terms of raw audio quality, but there are other factors that Sony is still behind on when competing with headsets at lower prices.

The first Sony Inzone H9 headset arrived in 2022 along with the company's then-new PC gaming brand. It was clear three years ago Sony didn't have much of an idea what PC gamers were looking for. Sony's Inzone PC software has improved by leaps and bounds, but the wide selection of competing headset makers is leaving it in the dust. Inzone Hub only allows for three—yes, three—EQ profiles, all of which are a different variety of first-person shooter. The FPS-1 EQ calls out footsteps slightly better, though I would set it and forget it on either FPS-2 or standard if I wanted to hear the full force of gunshots or explosions. The FPS-3 mode muffles the sounds of battle, though I didn't feel as if it gave me nearly as much of an edge for the sake of mangling my enjoyment of sound effects in various games.

I took the headset into many matches of Counter-Strike 2 (I'm terrible at CS2) and Halo Infinite (where I'm only marginally better). If this was supposed to rank as an esports headset, it would fall a little short despite the various EQ profiles. Sony built the Inzone H9 II along with the pro gaming team FNATIC, with a focus on Valorant and Apex Legends. The EQ profiles were designed to make players perform better in each game, but there's no language in the app to tell users which one they should use. Sony kept reiterating this is a headset tuned for first-person shooters, but it's not like the average gamer looking to play Baldur's Gate III with friends doesn't want a great experience as well. There are no other EQ options for an RTS or RPG gamer. Even if the headset's flat audio profile offers a stellar audio experience, I wonder if Sony couldn't have spent some of its spare time fine-tuning some more game-specific options.

The Inzone H9 II is an odd beast to control. The headset includes a large mute mic button right at the top along with a large volume wheel. All of that's well and good, but it's still hard to know what settings you're using while wearing the device. Unlike other headsets that will indicate settings with full voice cues, the H9 II offers audio chimes when you turn on simultaneous Bluetooth or change from ANC to ambient modes. At least the mic includes a bright red light to let you know if your friends can hear you chewing in the background.

See Sony Inzone H9 II at Amazon

One of the big issues with the original Inzone H9 from three years ago was its mic quality. This time around, Sony seriously upgraded the hell out of its mic quality. I recorded myself compared to several other major headsets, including some of the latest Alienware Pro Wireless and Razer headsets, and the Inzone H9 II stood out easily as one of the better for overall voice quality. The new detachable mic supports a wider band of sound, meaning it can pick up on more minute differences in voice. Despite construction going on outside the office window three feet away, the mic didn't pick up any rumbling jackhammers or car horns.

One of the WH-1000XM6's best standout features is its excellent active noise cancellation that blocks out so much ambient noise I would fear taking a stroll with them near a busy highway. That headset uses a number of exclusive processors and AI assistance to limit outside noise. The Inzone H9 II uses Sony's noise sensors it has stuck with for its NC 1000X series, though the company didn't go as far as to claim it's the same as its latest headset. This isn't the device meant to survive being surrounded by a chorus line of jackhammers. Instead, the Inzone H9 II's sensors were more than enough to help me ignore the jet engine fans of multiple PCs and gaming laptops, along with an annoyingly squeaky office HVAC system making mammoth mouse sounds above my head. My editor was trying to talk to me a foot away as I was gaming, and with the volume on medium settings, I couldn't hear a peep from him. The device also has an ambient mode that can let some outside noise cut through, but there's no full ‘transparency' setting that other headsets have, which may have offered better battery life. This is a headset meant to get you fully engaged with the content you're playing, to the detriment of your boss or partner desperate to get your attention.

The BlackShark V3 Pro is a gaming headset so dedicated to the “pro” gamers it feels like it missed me personally. Every EQ option, aka the equalization settings, is geared toward honing in on enemy footsteps or gunshots. If you don't care too much about smashing face in multiplayer, the Inzone H9 II is more ideal.

The headset also supports PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2. This is a Sony product, after all, which means you can expect it will feature excellent 3D audio on PS5 after you complete the lengthy setup process. The headset proved a great option if you swap between PC and Sony's mainline console for all your gaming needs. And yet, it could be so much more seamless. PlayStation Pulse products and Sony's upcoming fight stick controller use the PlayStation Link standard for low-latency 2.4GHz connection to the console. PlayStation's console gaming arm recently said this should allow for more than one device connected at the same time through a single dongle. Why can't Sony simply make PlayStation Link standard across its entire gaming hardware suite? It's as if the one hand of the Japanese tech giant isn't talking to the other.

All my many quibbles can't override the excellent comfort and the overwhelmingly balanced sound quality. It's a much better headset than the first Sony Inzone H9 and now it has a mic you'll actually want to use. But it's still damn expensive, even if you think of the Inzone H9 II like a WH-1000XM6 with a built-in mic. With its small but noticeable software and hardware foibles, the Inzone H9 II may not look like the part of a pure esports headset. But for when I want to ignore the world and bask in the exclusive bubble with just me and my game, I know I would reach for the Inzone H9 II before any of the many headsets I've used.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Game Streaming Will Never Be the Same After Nvidia's GeForce Now Update","https://gizmodo.com/game-streaming-will-never-be-the-same-after-nvidias-geforce-now-update-2000644462","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 16:00:09 GMT","

What if game streaming was your main way to play your games? That idea—once merely a pipedream—is inching closer to reality with Nvidia's latest update to GeForce Now. Come September, players will be able to rent out a server worth 100GB or more to play whatever game they want, so long as they already own it. Even with more games and better streaming visuals, streaming can't replace all your gaming gear. But if you were feeling antsy about how much that new PC upgrade or future console could cost, a $20-per-month sub may seem like a bargain in comparison.

This “Install to Play” feature will be available to all paying members of GeForce Now sometime next month. A publisher needs to “opt in” to let their game be streamed remotely, so you may need to wait for your entire Steam library to be available. When the service is up and running, any compatible games can then be downloaded to a remote PC and played during a single session. But say you want to continue your game without needing to redownload it? Nvidia said it will allow users to effectively rent out 200GB of persistent cloud storage starting at $3 extra per month. More download space will cost more.

Microsoft has made similar moves recently with Xbox Game Pass service. Subscribers can stream some select PC and console games they already own on the Xbox PC app. Compared to that, Nvidia's Install to Play could make a massive windfall of titles available to stream from any place with a good-enough internet connection.

There are other streaming services like Shadow PC, which allow you to effectively rent out a remote PC and operate it like your own, but those can cost between $38 and $50 per month. If the streaming quality holds up, Nvidia's Install to Play, plus the already sizable library of games available to stream, could effectively max out your PC games library. GeForce Now already has apps on PC, Mac, and mobile, along with a dedicated application on Steam Deck. Nvidia also plans to release a specific app for the Legion Go S handheld with SteamOS. This version will allow you to play at 4K and 120 fps connected to a TV via HDMI.

There are several major changes coming for those who subscribe to the GeForce Now Ultimate subscription. Everybody spending $20 a month will be able to access 4K resolution at 120 fps on LG TVs and RTX 5080-level graphics capabilities through the cloud, a jump up from the previous RTX 4080. The new GPU will be hosted on Nvidia's servers at no additional cost to users. Finally, users will be able to play games at 5K resolutions. That will mean additional widescreen support for massive curved monitors like LG's 5K2K UltraGear monitors.

The big benefit now for paying the $20 subscription is access to “Cinematic” quality streaming mode. Essentially, the mode promises even better visuals than what you normally get with streaming. For those enjoying 100 Mbps download speeds, in-game trees will no longer look like a pixelated collage of stems and leaves. Streaming has the tendency to wash out colors and make details less distinct. Nvidia claims Cinematic quality mode will even make in-game HUDs and menus more legible. The mode could result in more accurate colors for games that support HDR, or high dynamic range, for better contrast between darks and lights. SDR content will still look better, but to a lesser degree.

How much better performance you will get from various titles will depend on the game. In our tests of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, we saw the card could get around 8% better frame rates on average compared to the RTX 4080 Super. Nvidia has a bad habit of showing off multi-frame gen capabilities on its GPUs and comparing the improvements to older graphics cards. Multi-frame gen is a technique where the GPU can insert multiple generated frames in between two rendered frames, increasing the overall responsiveness of a game. Older GPUs like the RTX 4080 could only do 2x frame gen, while the 50-series can handle up to 4x. Yes, a GPU doing twice as much frame gen will result in higher frame counts, if that's the only thing you care about.

There are drawbacks to frame generation. The technology can introduce small visual glitches that aren't there when the game is rendered fully natively. Frame generation also introduces latency between what you're seeing on screen and what's rendered by the graphics processing pipeline. Latency can be a real killer for game streaming, but Nvidia told Gizmodo it upgraded the CPU and memory in its SuperPOD servers with new technology, which will offset frame gen latency.

Nvidia also changed its formula for data packets, the unit of data formatted for telecommunication networks, to “intelligently,” which will result in fewer dropped packets. The company is working with major telecom companies like CableLabs and Comcast, as well as T-Mobile and its L4S network, for this new data technique.

Look, Nvidia isn't going to go to communities and set up quality internet. GeForce Now still can't completely replace a console or PC, not when the service is so dependent on your home internet speeds. Late last year, Nvidia added support for 1440p streaming and the ability to save graphics settings between games. The rub was the new limitation of 100 hours of playtime each month. The company has yet to raise streaming prices, but when every major streaming service's prices are ballooning every year, you shouldn't expect to keep shelling out the same amount for much longer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","‘The Toxic Avenger' Star Elijah Wood on Cult Remakes and Why He Loves Weird Movies","https://gizmodo.com/toxic-avenger-elijah-wood-interview-2000644726","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 14:00:46 GMT","

Elijah Wood will always be associated with the Lord of the Rings movies, but the actor has also built up a varied array of unusual characters across his career. Maybe his weirdest yet comes with The Toxic Avenger, the long-awaited remake of the cult classic that's finally hitting theaters later this month. Wood has a memorable supporting role as Fritz, the brother and henchman of Kevin Bacon's sleazy villain. He's not as freaky-looking as the title mutant, played in human form by Peter Dinklage, but he comes awfully close.

io9 got a chance to talk to Wood about The Toxic Avenger (and a few other things in that vein) at the recent San Diego Comic-Con.

Cheryl Eddy, io9: Fritz is many things. He's the head of security, he's a music manager, he's the villain's brother. And he's also very unusual looking. Did you come up with a backstory for him to explain what his life's been like until this point?

Elijah Wood: No, but I think the writing's on the wall there, like, he was born physically deformed, probably picked on. His brother was always smarter, more handsome, more capable. I think he desperately wanted to be loved and sort of wasn't; he was kicked to the side and treated like shit. And so I think that turned him into, well, “I guess I'm the henchman,” and I think that brought out, not necessarily an evil in him, but I think it was like, resentment breeds dark deeds. I think that's kind of how he became who he is.

And then, of course, his brother was just like, “I'm going to have you do my bidding,” to which he sort of acquiesced. And I think you see that in the movie; he probably really wants just to be loved. He's actually sort of a sweet guy, and he's just misunderstood.

io9: We saw you earlier this year playing a very different sort of villain in The Monkey. Which character do you think is more odious?

Wood: Oh, [The Monkey's] Ted Hammerman, without question. Odious is a great word, by the way. Yeah, Ted is awful. Just a toxic male [who] thinks he knows better than everybody else. He's got his whole perspective on what makes a great father, although I don't think he really does know what makes a great father. That was a blast. I love Osgood [Perkins, director of The Monkey] too, and it was a joy to come and join that for a bit. I've been a fan of his for a long time.

io9: You starred in the Maniac remake back in 2012. And now you're in the new Toxic Avenger. What draws you to these cult-beloved titles, and is there one you'd like to see be remade in the future, whether or not you star in it?

Wood: It's all circumstantial. That one, I was drawn to it because it was taking the source material and doing something really different with it. Remakes are tricky, you know, and both of these films are related in the sense that they made something new of the source material rather than regurgitating it in the same way.

I was really attracted to Maniac because… my character doesn't really show up. It's primarily a POV film. I love POV horror; it's really interesting. There's a great POV horror film from the ‘60s, Peeping Tom. It reminded me of Peeping Tom a little bit, about how wonderful to take this and put you sort of in the mindset of, or at least the POV of, the characters. That was the reason I wanted to do that. And I love the creative team behind that film.

And then this one, I mean, Macon [Blair, director of Toxic Avenger], I'll do anything Macon asks; I'm a huge fan of his work. I worked with him on this movie called I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore, and so I'll do anything for him. He's a dear friend. And then to be asked to play a character like this in this universe was just a blast. I think it was clear that it was an approach to the original material that was very much its own but had total reverence for what Lloyd [Kaufman of Troma Entertainment] had created.

So it was circumstantial that these two things came into my life. I don't know that I'm seeking these things out, but I love genre, and I'm always going to be interested in making something weird and funny and absurd.

The Toxic Avenger hits theaters August 29.

Stop me if you've heard this one before. Wireless power banks have been recalled for exploding and causing fires.

This time, it's the ESR HaloLock wireless power banks distributed by Waymeet in Hong Kong. The power banks were sold online at Amazon, Home Depot's website, and Esrtech.com from September 2023 to July 2025, according to a press release from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.

“The firm has received nine reports of the lithium-ion battery catching fire and exploding, resulting in property damage of about $20,000,” the CPSC said, though no injuries have been reported.

The power banks come in dark blue, light blue, gray, white, and black—all with five circular LED display lights on the side. The model numbers that have been recalled include 2G520, 2G505B, and 2G512B, which should be printed on the side near the “ESR” branding.

Consumers should contact Waymeet for a refund. The easiest way to reach out is by email, according to the CPSC. You'll be asked to send a photo of your power bank, showing the model number, to [email protected]. The company wants consumers to write the word “recalled” in permanent marker on the power bank for the photo.

After the company sends a refund, consumers are asked to dispose of the power banks responsibly. As the CPSC explains:

Do not throw this recalled lithium-ion battery or device in the trash, the general recycling stream (e.g., street-level or curbside recycling bins), or used battery recycling boxes found at various retail and home improvement stores. Recalled lithium-ion batteries must be disposed of differently than other batteries, because they present a greater risk of fire. Your municipal household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center may accept this recalled lithium-ion battery or device for disposal. Before taking your battery or device to a HHW collection center, contact that office ahead of time and ask whether it accepts recalled lithium-ion batteries. If it does not, contact your municipality for further guidance.

There have been many phone charger recalls in recent months, including a recall of Anker PowerCore 10000 power banks back in June. And the iStore Magnetic Wireless power banks recalled in July.

There's a reason TSA doesn't allow power banks in checked luggage. You really don't want these things to explode in the wrong place.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Tesla Making Yet Another Desperate Move in Europe","https://gizmodo.com/tesla-making-yet-another-desperate-move-in-europe-2000644686","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 13:00:52 GMT","

Tesla has been struggling in Europe, where its sales are down across the continent. In the United Kingdom, the company's sales reportedly dropped 60 percent last month. With those cratering numbers, the EV firm appears to have made another, shall we say, incredibly generous offer to locals, as the company continues to combat lagging sales.

British newspaper The Times reports that Tesla has nearly halved the monthly cost of leasing one of its cars in the U.K. Elon Musk's company has been “forced to offer discounts of up to 40 per cent to car leasing companies to shift more units,” it says. Previously, a lease of a Tesla Model 3 could cost customers as much as £600 to £700 a month, the newspaper writes. However, with discounts to leasing companies, which pass the savings on to customers, a Tesla Model 3 can now apparently be leased for some £252 a month.

With more and more frequency, Tesla seems to be offering special deals to its customers to gin up interest in its line of cars. Most notably, the company has been offering discounts and deals to goad drivers into buying its struggling metal heap, the Cybertruck.

In July, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association published figures that showed that Tesla sales in Europe had slumped by 33% in the first half of this year. During the same period, Musk himself noted that his company was headed for “a few rough quarters.” In general, Tesla's European operations have been struggling ever since Elon Musk threw himself and hundreds of millions of dollars into politics.

But sales are down in the U.S., as well. In California (which was once the hub of Tesla's popularity), sales have been dropping for quite some time. Tesla's 2nd quarter earnings report this year also shared more bad news for the company, revealing that it was making less money than the previous year. In June, Musk reportedly fired his top salesman for North America and Europe, as sales continued to sag.

It's unclear how much Tesla's slumping sales have been spurred by increased competition from emergent EVs sold by Chinese companies and how much it has to do with lots of people hating its CEO over his destructive and meddlesome political activities. Musk's involvement with the Trump administration earlier this year notably inspired a nationwide protest movement in the U.S., and his never-ending commentary on the EU's business has made him a pariah across the pond.

Some say continuous transfers exceeding 50GB can cause drives to vanish from the OS

August 19, 5:30 am ET: Phison has issued the following statement to Tom's Hardware: ""Phison has recently been made aware of the industry-wide effects of the 'KB5063878' and ‘KB5062660' updates on Windows 11 that potentially impacted several storage devices, including some supported by Phison. We understand the disruption this may have caused and promptly engaged industry stakeholders. We are steadfast in our commitment to product integrity and the success of our partners and end users. At this time, the controllers that may have been affected are under review and we are working with partners. We will continue to provide updates and advisories to partners who may have been impacted to provide support and ensure any applicable remediation.""

Microsoft's latest security update for Windows 11 is allegedly causing SSD failures during heavy file transfers. The issue was reported by X user Nekorusukii @Necoru_cat, who was updating Cyberpunk 2077 on a system running Windows 11 24H2 with the KB5063878 update installed, when the SSD on which the game was installed disappeared from the operating system.

An investigation by the user reveals a potential bug that appears during continuous file transfers on certain storage devices, particularly when the transfer exceeds 50GB and the drive is over 60% full. In these cases, the SSD can sometimes disappear from within the operating system. While restarting the PC makes the SSD visible again, the issue seems to occur again as soon as a large data transfer is performed again.

It was earlier reported that the issue lies within how SSDs handle cache, especially DRAM-less models equipped with Phison NAND controllers, but it turns out the problem isn't confined to those types of drives. A series of tests was carried out to establish the scope of the problem, which included copying Cyberpunk 2077's Steam library folder to the drive, preparing a compressed archive, and then copying the expanded archive into the target storage.

Out of the 21 drives tested, it was found that 12 of them became inaccessible, but only the Western Digital SA510 2TB could not be recovered, even after a reboot. This indicates that the issue seems to impact SSDs with multiple types of SSD controllers.



Nekorusukii has listed the complete findings and explains that the SSDs were tested only on his own system, so the results may not offer enough proof on the real-time performance of these drives. Additionally, they do not assert that the Windows 11 24H2 KB5063878 or the previously released KB5062660 updates are directly responsible for the issues. However, a separate report by Japanese outlet NichePCGamer has further identified at least eight users on X who are facing similar issues on their respective drives.

According to a user with a SanDisk Extreme Pro M.2 NVMe 3D SSD, the drive became inaccessible after installing a 50GB update for Honkai: Star Rail. Although restarting the system resolved the issue, the user encountered it again on multiple occasions in August. Suspecting the KB5062660 update as the cause, the user deleted the update file, after which the problem no longer occurred.

By the looks of it, the issue doesn't seem to be widespread. While we wait for Microsoft and SSD manufacturers to acknowledge the bug, it is best to stay cautious, especially if you are dealing with large continuous file transfers on systems running the latest Windows 11 KB5063878 update.

European gamers, rejoice! | Some Nvidia RTX 50-series Founders Edition graphics cards just got a 10% markdown.

Nvidia has dropped the prices for some of its RTX 50-series GPUs in Europe, with the RTX 5090, 5080, and 5070 seeing a reduction of almost 10%. As noted by Videocardz, these lower prices are likely tied to a weakening dollar, making the import of American goods into Europe relatively cheaper than before. The USD was at its peak when Nvidia's latest gaming GPUs launched, with the exchange rate hovering around $1.04 for every Euro. Today, it now sits at around $1.16 — a more than 10% drop in value since January.

This currency shift likely influenced the AI tech giant's decision to drop the MSRP of its Founders Edition GPUs. When you visit Nvidia Germany's marketplace, you will see lower prices on the aforementioned cards versus their launch prices. This also holds true for other European Nvidia sites, like France, Belgium, and Spain. Hopefully, other manufacturers will soon follow suit, as they haven't reduced prices at the time of writing.

The lowered prices are a welcome change for European gamers and enthusiasts, especially as it's been proven that almost all GPUs are being sold way above MSRP — especially for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080. Unfortunately, the lower prices aren't because Nvidia produced more graphics cards, thus lowering the pressure on the market. Instead, it's brought by economic realities, like the tariffs that the U.S. has applied to all its trading partners, increasing inflationary pressure and having a slight negative effect on the value of the dollar.

We often see GPU prices drop several months after they launch. However, U.S. tariffs and TSMC's price hikes have actually caused prices to jump between 10% to 15%. There's also the threat of additional import taxes, with President Donald Trump announcing a 100% semiconductor tariff in early August. It's also been reported that he's considering increasing this further to 300% after the U.S. Department of Commerce's Section 232 investigation. These tariffs might not affect Europe, though, if Nvidia can build GPUs for the continent outside of America, or if it's able to completely assemble the RTX 50-series graphics cards within the United States without relying on any kind of import.

Eaton Z made sure Intel had closed up all the unearthed security gaps before divulging this research.

It was possible to download sensitive information about 270,000 Intel employees until the end of February, according to Eaton Z, a security researcher, reverse engineer, and application developer. All this information was available with a little 'valid user' dodge applied to the Intel India Operations (IIO) site, where employees usually order their business cards. The vulnerability behind the potential hack, dubbed ‘Intel Outside' by the researcher, was detailed to Intel in correspondence starting in October 2024. Moreover, the business card site was just one of four found with gaping security flaws.

I am excited to share my latest research project I have dubbed the ""Intel Outside"" project. Last fall I discovered many critical vulnerabilities in Intel's web infrastructure that allowed me to exfiltrate sensitive information about 270k Intel employees/workers, and more. pic.twitter.com/oRXiEP5mPnAugust 18, 2025

From the introduction to his lengthy blog post, it is hinted that Eaton thought testing the locks on Intel websites would be worth a shot, given the firm's history of processor hardware vulnerabilities. With the headlining result, Eaton's preliminary instincts proved accurate.

Eaton explains that after their first scouting of the perimeter, they decided to check the JavaScript files behind the business card login form. It is sometimes possible “to trick an application into thinking a valid user is logged in by modifying the getAllAccounts function to return a non-empty array,” Eaton narrated. Indeed, this worked and got Eaton past the login screen.

Next, it was observed that the website, at this depth, allowed for the probing of a long list of employees, not restricted to India, but worldwide. An API token, which was available to an anonymous user (like Eaton), provided even deeper access to the employee data.

Subsequently, Eaton was alarmed by the amount of information that could be pulled up about every employee. “Way more than this simple website would ever need,” they commented, “Intel's APIs are very generous!”

Things got worse for Intel, not for Eaton. Removing the URL filter from the API being probed eventually yielded “a nearly 1GB JSON file.” Inside this download, Eaton noted that there were details of every Intel employee (there are fewer now). Data included fields like each employee's name, role, manager, phone number, and mailing address.

Eaton's work tested the locks, listening for the clicks, on several other Intel websites. Perhaps you will be surprised to hear that three other vulnerable Intel Outside style hacks were possible?

On the internal ‘Product Hierarchy' website, Eaton discovered easily decryptable hardcoded credentials. Again, the prize was a bumper list of Intel employee data, as well as the possibility to gain admin access to the system. Similarly, Intel's internal ‘Product Onboarding' suffered from easily decryptable hardcoded credentials.

The corporate login on Intel's SEIMS Supplier Site was another security measure that could be bypassed. It delivered an amazing fourth way in which an attacker could “download the details of every Intel employee,” says Eaton.

Eaton communicated with Intel, outlining the internal website flaws that had been discovered, starting from October 2024. Sadly, none of Eaton's work qualified for Intel bug bounty payouts, as it was excluded by some small print. Perhaps even worse, Eaton only got a single canned ‘auto-response' from Intel throughout the whole process.

Easton noticed that all the vulnerabilities he had uncovered and reported to Intel had been addressed by February 28 this year. Publishing the linked blog on August 18, thus, seems eminently reasonable.

Good time for investment?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


SoftBank Group late on Monday announced a plan to purchase $2 billion worth of Intel shares at $23 each, which will provide the troubled chipmaker much-needed cash. The companies inked a definitive securities purchase agreement, which sets the price of Intel stock (currently trading below its book value) at which the Japanese company will buy it. Softbank also still owns a majority share of Arm.

Intel and SoftBank frame the deal as a way to 'deepen their commitment to investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation in the United States.' Given the context of Intel's recent struggles, this $2 billion share purchase is a way to pour some money into Intel's efforts to rebuild itself as a leading supplier of processors and a contract chipmaker that serves both internal and external needs for leading-edge semiconductor production. 

By modern foundry standards, $2 billion is not a large sum of money. Building a single leading-edge semiconductor production facility today typically costs between $20 billion and $30 billion, and in many cases even more, depending on planned production volumes, product mix, and equipment used. However, the investment does not seem to be entirely about money, even though $2 billion will be instrumental for Intel, which bleeds billions every quarter. 

To a large degree, this investment is a vote of confidence in the future of Intel's U.S.-based leading-edge semiconductor production and SoftBank's plan to play a bigger role in the ongoing AI revolution, which will require partnerships with many industry players. If Intel succeeds with its next-generation products and 18A as well as 14A process technologies, then SoftBank will get a partner with a huge potential, which will be important across multiple fronts, including access to advanced semiconductor production capacities (good news for Arm and Ampere that are controlled by SoftBank) as well as a leverage in negotiations with other partners.

""Semiconductors are the foundation of every industry. For more than 50 years, Intel has been a trusted leader in innovation,"" Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group. ""This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role."" 

Additionally, SoftBank may consider an investment in Intel, as it represents undervalued infrastructure that could drive significant advancements in the high-tech sector and substantially increase its value. At $23 per share, Intel is trading below its book value with a market capitalization of around $103 billion. By contrast, the company's real estate and manufacturing assets cost $109 billion. So for SoftBank, this is both a financial opportunity (buying undervalued assets) and a strategic move (securing a stake in the perfectly set semiconductor production infrastructure needed to produce chips that support AI in one way or another). 

""We are very pleased to deepen our relationship with SoftBank, a company that is at the forefront of so many areas of emerging technology and innovation and shares our commitment to advancing U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,"" said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. ""Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment.""

I'm hackin' it

""Would you like to access sensitive information?"" might be the new ""Would you like fries with that?"" A security researcher called ""BobDaHacker"" has just revealed how he went from scoring free McNuggets via the fast food chain's mobile app to repeatedly gaining access to a McDonald's platform meant only for employees and franchisees.

""The McDonald's Feel-Good Design Hub is their central platform for brand assets and marketing materials - used by teams and agencies across 120 countries. It used to be 'protected' by a client-side password. Yes, CLIENT-SIDE,"" BobDaHacker said. ""After I reported this, they took 3 months to implement a proper account system with different login paths for McDonald's employees (using their EID/MCID) and external partners ... Except there was still an issue. All I had to do was change 'login' to 'register' in the URL"" to create a new account that could access the platform.

Now, I'll be the first to admit that security reporters are often quick to condemn organizations that fail to address vulnerabilities approximately five minutes after their disclosure, even though very few of us have ever needed to develop and deploy software at the scale of a multi-billion-dollar corporation. That's hardly fair. But it's hard to believe McDonald's is taking the security of its ""Feel-Good Design Hub"" seriously when it takes an entire quarter to resolve a problem... only to have the fix bypassed by changing a single word in a URL. Ronald would be disappointed.

Even that might be excused because, again, developing and deploying software at scale is difficult. Things happen! But then BobDaHacker went on to point out that simply registering a new account prompted the Feel-Good Design Hub to send the password associated with that account in plain-text, even though we as a society have known better than that for decades at this point. And that wasn't even the most embarrassing thing about McDonald's security processes revealed in BobDaHacker's blog post!

""McDonald's HAD a security.txt file with contact info. But they removed it 2 months after adding it. I only found it through the Wayback Machine, and by then it was outdated. So, how do you report security vulnerabilities to a corporation with no security contact? I literally called McDonald's HQ and started dropping random security employee names I found on LinkedIn,"" Bob said. (Emphasis not added.) ""The HQ hotline just asks you to say the name of the person you want to be connected to. So I kept calling, saying random security employee names until finally someone important enough called me back and gave me an actual place to report these issues.""

Bob said that McDonald's appeared to fix ""most of the vulnerabilities"" they disclosed, but the company also let go of Bob's friend, who helped them investigate some of the vulnerabilities and ""never established a proper security reporting channel."" (I couldn't find a security.txt file on the company's website, and a search for ""McDonald's security disclosure"" doesn't return any relevant results, either.) That seems ill-advised, given that other researchers would probably give up on trying to disclose vulnerabilities long before Bob did. Having to search on LinkedIn and repeatedly call a hotline is not ideal.

It's been a little over a month since I reported on a different security gaffe affecting McDonald's. In that case, a platform with access to private information was secured with the password ""123456."" Now we know BobDaHacker was able to use the Feel-Good Design Hub to access a variety of resources, from ""highly confidential and proprietary"" marketing information to a service that could be used to ""search for ANY McDonald's employee globally"" and see their email address, among other things.

This is the latest move in Arm's chip designer hiring spree that's been ongoing for the past year.

British semiconductor and chip design firm Arm Holdings has hired Amazon's director of engineering in its Amazon Web Services division to work on developing its own complete processors, according to Reuters. Rami Sinno headed the team that developed Amazon's own AI processors, Trainium and Inferentia, but will be returning to the fold with this move, having previously worked as VP of engineering at ARM between 2014 and 2019.

Arm's chip designs are nearly ubiquitous in the mobile world, featured in most smartphones and a wide range of tablets and laptops. Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips are based on ARM architecture, as are Apple's A and M-series system-on-chip designs, and Arm is making major inroads in the data center space. It's even starting to make a name for itself in the gaming scene, too.

But Arm doesn't typically build its own processors. That's something it has reportedly been looking to change over the past few years. We first heard rumors that it was looking to build its own AI hardware in early 2024, and that it allegedly already had orders for some of its as-yet-unannounced chips in February this year.

It's not clear how far along in the development process Arm is with its own chips, but Sinno brings significant experience to the company, having been a key component in Amazon's own AI hardware endeavours. Sinno joins the likes of experienced Intel and Qualcomm engineer Steve Halter, as well as HP Enterprise alumnus Nicolas Dube.

Although an exceedingly profitable company already, enough that Nvidia reportedly tried to buy it for $40 billion in 2020, that all came from royalties for its chip designs. Arm is looking to branch into an entirely new venture with the development of its own hardware. CEO Rene Haas said in July that Arm was considering developing its own chiplets that can be bundled together in a larger package, as well as complete (perhaps monolithic) chip designs.

Sinno was brought in early for Amazon's own AI hardware development, building the architecture from the ground up, reportedly using Amazon's standard method of development: starting at the customer's desires and working backwards to develop what they need. At that time, it was high compute, low power chips, and though the market is more contested and the industry much further along now than it was then, Arm's eventual hardware will need to offer much the same.

But it clearly believes it can do it. Earlier this year, Arm announced the aggressive and confident plan that it would capture as much as 50% of the data center CPU market by the end of 2025. That will come from new AI data centers, and with companies like Nvidia building 100 AI factories, there's no shortage of demand.

Aging is the strongest risk factor for most chronic diseases; however, medicine has historically treated each condition individually. Geroscience is a new discipline that aims to define and modify aging-related biological pathways, slow age-related disability, prevent age-related diseases, and increase disability-free survival.

A review in JAMA outlines the aims, methods, recent advances, and ongoing challenges of geroscience.

The review was authored by Stephen B. Kritchevsky, PhD, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Sticht Center for Healthy Aging and Alzheimer's Prevention, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Steven R. Cummings, MD, California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, San Francisco, and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.

In Italy, the prevention of aging is particularly relevant. Data from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (2023) show that 24.1% of the Italian population — 14.2 million people — is older than 65 years, making Italy the world's second-oldest country after Japan.

By 2050, 35% of Italians are expected to be 65 years or older. 

The 2023 Osservasalute Report found that 87% of Italian senior citizens live with at least one chronic condition, and 67% have two or more, at an annual cost to the National Health Service exceeding €66 billion.

Disease-specific prevention has shown notable results. For example, statins lower the risk for composite cardiovascular events by 28% in primary prevention.

But the authors emphasized significant limitations: “Disease-focused approaches to prevent and treat conditions do not address age-related health issues such as fatigue, mobility limitations, and frailty that are common even in the absence of overt disease.”

Frailty illustrates this gap. In the Cardiovascular Health Study, which followed more than 5200 adults for over 30 years, 16% were frailer than expected based on their comorbidities. “After adjusting for comorbidity count, the frailest group experienced 2-3 fewer years of disability-free life compared with those who were not frail,” the authors wrote. 

Age is a disproportionate risk factor. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortality rate was seven times higher in those aged 85 years or older (1.6%) than in those aged 65-74 years (0.2%). 

Multimorbidity also rises sharply with age, and “the incidence of developing a third disease among those with two chronic medical conditions is 5.2% among those aged 50-59 years and 16% in those aged 70-79 years,” the authors wrote.

The authors emphasized that single-disease paradigms fail to account for age as the strongest determinant of risk for many diseases, including coronary heart disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, dementia, and chronic kidney disease.

The geroscience hypothesis holds that biologic aging is a process distinct from chronologic aging.

Biologic age quantifies how much a person's physiology deviates from what would be expected of their chronologic age. For example, “a 50-year-old woman with a maximal oxygen consumption of 32 mL/kg/min, typical of women 10 years younger, would have a biologic age of 40 years,” the authors noted.

Age advancement, defined as the difference between biologic and chronologic age, predicts mortality and other age-related outcomes independently of chronologic age. For example, “an individual with a biologic age 8.3 years older than their chronologic age, based on DNA methylation, had a 2.2-fold higher hazard of death than a person with a similar chronologic age.”

Survivors of childhood cancer also show accelerated biologic aging: “At an average age of 35 years, survivors were biologically 2.2-6.5 years older than age- and sex-matched controls using seven different approaches based on physiologic measures or DNA methylation.”

Biologists specializing in aging have identified cellular pathways that influence lifespan, defined as the total length of life, and health span, defined as the length of life spent free from disease. These pathways involve multiple aspects of cellular physiology, including the accumulation of somatic DNA variations and the regulation and accuracy of DNA transcription.

Regulation includes the maintenance of telomeres and regions of repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with replication. When telomeres are too short, DNA replication cannot occur. Methylation of DNA bases and other epigenetic changes can alter gene transcription with age.

Maintaining protein structure and function, or protein homeostasis, is strongly associated with aging. In particular, autophagy removes damaged intracellular proteins. Other pathways are related to nutrient sensing, such as signaling induced by amino acids, insulin, or insulin-like growth factor 1, sustaining stem cell populations, and preserving mitochondrial function.

Variations in mitochondrial DNA accumulate with age. One genetic variant, m.3243A>G, is linked to inherited mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode syndrome.

In a cohort of 789 adults aged 70-80 years, approximately 33% carried this variant in 6%-19% of their leukocyte mitochondrial DNA. These individuals showed slower performance, greater arterial stiffness, and reduced grip strength.

Participants with a higher abundance of this variant had increased 17-year mortality rates from dementia and stroke compared with those with the lowest abundance.

Caloric restriction is the most extensively studied intervention in geroscience. 

The authors reported important results: “In one strain of mice, a 20% caloric restriction increased median survival from 785 to 1096 days in females (40%) and from 807 to 999 days (24%) in males.”

The CALERIE trial provided the first evidence of this in humans. The CALERIE trial randomized 218 adults without obesity, aged 21-51 years, to a 2-year intervention comparing caloric restriction with no caloric restriction. The results showed significant cellular changes: Caloric restriction upregulated autophagy and DNA repair and downregulated the inflammatory response, as measured by rank-based pathway enrichment analysis. Participants in the restriction group aged 0.6 years less over the 24 months of the study than participants with no caloric restriction.

Incretin therapies such as semaglutide and tirzepatide offer durable caloric restriction surpassing behavioral interventions and significantly reducing clinical risks in adults with or without type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide (2.4 mg/wk) achieved 14.9% weight loss over 68 weeks. These therapies also lower cardiovascular events by 20% and all-cause mortality by 19%.

The review also focuses on metformin, a biguanide and first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, which may slow age-related biologic processes through its effects on multiple aging pathways.

“Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, which increases AMPK [adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase] activity, thereby inhibiting mTOR complex 1 and activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha. These actions enhance autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis.”

Observational data suggest broad benefits. Among 5528 Veterans Affairs patients with type 2 diabetes, metformin users had a lower incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and mild cognitive impairment compared with nonusers (11.48 vs 25.45 per 1000 person-years).

Among patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, metformin use was associated with a lower 28-day mortality rate (16.0% vs 23.6%). But the authors noted that “Studies of the effects of metformin on patients with diabetes and prediabetes have had inconsistent results,” highlighting the need for studies designed to measure aging-related outcomes.

Rapamycin, developed to prevent transplant rejection, has shown antiaging effects by acting on mTOR, a regulatory component of the cellular nutrient-sensing pathway. “Reducing mTOR activity increases cellular autophagy,” the authors noted.

“Inhibition of mTORC1 [mTOR complex 1] by rapamycin increased lifespan in multiple model organisms, including mice, even when treatment began at 20 months of age.”

Human evidence is promising but limited. “In a clinical trial of 218 adults aged 65 years or older, 6 weeks of everolimus at 0.5 mg daily or 5 mg weekly was safe and significantly improved the response to influenza vaccination compared with placebo.”

The authors noted that “Lower intermittent doses may improve aging-related biologic pathways while producing fewer adverse effects.”

Senolytic drugs are among the most novel geroscience strategies.

“Senescent cells no longer divide, resist apoptosis, and secrete inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and other substances collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype,” the authors explained.

The accumulation of these cells has been documented. Senescent cells accumulate with age.

In a survey of senescent cell markers with age in human tissues, the concentration of kidney cells expressing the senescence marker p21 was 1% in five older donors aged 71-79 years, compared with less than 0.2% in five younger donors aged 19-30 years.

In preclinical studies, eliminating p16-positive cells with AP20187, which induced apoptosis in genetically modified mice expressing p16, increased the median lifespan by up to 27% (from 624 to 793 days) and reduced cancer mortality, delayed cataract formation, and enhanced spontaneous physical activity.

Early clinical trials have shown that this strategy is safe and that senolytic treatment reduces the number of cells expressing p16 and p21, two senescence markers.

According to the authors, a significant obstacle to the development of effective prevention strategies is the current regulations. “The FDA does not recognize slowing aging or reducing aging-related conditions, such as sarcopenia or mobility limitation, as approved indications.” 

The authors emphasized that “evaluating approved drugs for age-modifying effects will require broad inclusion criteria, alternative dosing regimens, and longer study durations than those used to establish therapeutic efficacy for their original indications. If multiple clinical trials, including those testing potential indications such as peripheral artery disease, heart failure, or osteoporosis, collect these outcomes, response patterns may be identified to guide future studies with measures more directly linked to specific aging-related biologic targets.” The authors also cautioned about the limitations: “This review had several limitations. First, it was not a systematic review, and the quality of the included evidence was not formally assessed. Second, geroscience is a rapidly evolving field, and relevant references may have been missed.”

Despite these limitations, the authors concluded that “therapies that target aging biology, including caloric restriction, metformin, senolytics, and rapalogs, may slow disease development and progression as well as functional decline in humans.”

This represents a fundamental paradigm shift. Instead of waiting for specific diseases to develop and then treating them individually using disease-specific approaches, geroscience proposes modifying the fundamental biological processes that increase susceptibility to age-related comorbidities.

Therapies that target the biology of aging could not only extend lifespan but, more importantly, improve the “health span” of the years lived in good health without disability or chronic disease. In today's era of rapid population aging, these strategies could help turn aging from a problem to an opportunity, moving beyond the limits of traditional approaches.

 August 19, 2025  

Higher prenatalexposure to a common pesticide, chlorpyrifos (CPF), was associated with a greater likelihood of brain abnormalities and poorer motor function among children aged 6 to almost 15 years in a prospective, longitudinal study.

MRIs revealed widespread brain changes, including thicker frontal, temporal, and posterior inferior cortices; reduced white matter volumes; and lower diffusivity of internal capsule white matter.

Researchers also observed that prenatal CPF exposure levels were linked to lower indices of neuronal density in white matter tracts and lower performance on fine motor and motor programming tasks.

Previous preclinical and clinical studies supported the neurotoxicity of CPF, but this is the first research to look at specific brain changes in people.

“These are very strong associations such that progressively higher levels of exposure are associated with progressively greater disruptions in development of brain structure and metabolism, as well as greater disruptions in motor control,” lead author Bradley S. Peterson, MD, division chief of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was published online on August 18 in JAMA Neurology.

CPF is a chlorinated organophosphate and one of the most common pesticides used globally. It enters the bloodstream through ingestion or skin contact or after breathing it in.

In pregnant women, the pesticide crosses the placenta, enters the fetal bloodstream, reaches concentrations up to four times higher than those in the mother's circulation, and crosses the fetal blood-brain barrier.

“Pregnancy is an exquisitely sensitive period of brain development that is vulnerable to environmental exposures, including CPF,” Peterson said. “Protecting unborn children by advocating for restrictions on pesticide use and by educating prospective parents on measures to reduce exposure is essential.”

From January 1998 to July 2006, investigators recruited 727 pregnant African American or Dominican women living in northern New York City. Between 2007 and 2015, MRI scans were performed on 332 of their children aged 6-14.7 years.

Researchers compared MRI findings to CPF levels in umbilical cord or maternal blood, analyzing data between February 2018 and November 2024 on a final cohort of 270 children (median age, 10.38 years).

Maternal exposure to CPF in participants was primarily from spraying indoors for pests, which was prevalent in this inner-city neighborhood before residential use was banned in 2001, the authors noted.

Peterson said a surprising study outcome was “how strong and widespread across the brain these associations were” spanning measures of cortical thickness, white matter myelination, neuronal density, and metabolism.

On an MRI, for example, CPF exposure was associated significantly and positively with cortical thickness in frontal regions, including the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyrus; the anterior cingulate cortex; gyrus rectus; and the middle orbitofrontal and lateral orbitofrontal gyrus.

The same associations were seen in temporal brain regions, including the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyrus, and the parahippocampus. Posteroinferior regions altered the same way, including the posterior cingulate cortex, cuneus, and the inferior occipital, lingual, and fusiform gyrus.

In contrast, CPF levels were associated with lower cortical thickness in the dorsal parietal region, specifically the superior parietal gyrus, and with lower white matter volumes in multiple frontal, temporal, and posteroinferior regions.

In addition to the anatomic MRI findings, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging showed that CPF exposure associated inversely with N-acetyl-L-aspartate, which reflects neuron density, in scattered foci within deep white matter tracts and in gray matter of the insular cortex.

Diffusion tensor imaging also positively linked CPF exposure to fractional anisotropy and inversely with average diffusion coefficient values in the internal capsule. Furthermore, arterial spin labeling revealed higher CPF exposure was associated with a lower regional cerebral blood flow.

“In this cohort study, progressively higher prenatal CPF exposure levels associated significantly with progressively greater alterations in brain measures in each MRI modality, suggesting that prenatal exposure may produce enduring disturbances in brain structure, function, and metabolism in direct proportion to exposure level,” investigators wrote.

Another unexpected result for Peterson was how similar the CPF findings were to those linked to other prenatal exposures, including air pollution, despite being extremely different chemicals.

This suggests a common pathway for disrupting brain development, “most likely by producing inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, which are toxic to brain cells early in development,” he said.

Asked about treating children already affected by CPF, Peterson replied, “Unfortunately, we don't know yet of ways to help children who are already exposed. The only ways we know currently to mitigate risk to unborn children is to minimize exposures.”

He added, “Perhaps in the future, novel therapeutics may reduce inflammation and oxidative stress from CPF and other pesticide exposures and thereby attenuate their adverse effects on brain development.”

CPF is “ubiquitous” on nonorganic fruit, vegetables, and grains, added Peterson, who is also vice chair for research and chief of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Keck School of Medicine of USC in Los Angeles. The pesticide is also carried by outdoor air and is often used in agriculture.

“Farm families are at particularly high risk because pregnant women not only work in the fields but also live in nearby communities, where pesticide drift is common,” said senior investigator Virginia A. Rauh, ScD, the Jane and Alan Batkin Professor of Population and Family Health at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in New York City.

“This is an area where public health policy changes would have a significant impact,” she added.

There are federal and state restrictions. In August 2021, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) removed all “tolerances” or acceptable levels of CPF on food. Several agricultural groups challenged the action, and in December 2023, a US Circuit Court vacated the earlier EPA decision.

The agency is now considering a final rule that would restrict exposures for farm workers and vulnerable populations and set limits for the pesticide on 11 specific crops: alfalfa, apple, asparagus, tart cherry, citrus, cotton, peach, soybean, strawberry, sugar beet, and spring and winter wheat.

State laws on CPF use vary. “Surprisingly,” Rauh said, “CPF is banned in only five states: California, Hawaii, New York, Maryland, and Oregon.”

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the EPA STAR program, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the John and Wendy Neu Family Foundation supported the research. The study was also supported by an anonymous donor, Patrice and Mike Harmon, the Inspirit Fund, and the Robert Coury family. Peterson, Rauh, and Thompson reported no relevant financial relationships.

Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) before endovascular treatment (EVT) was associated with a modestly increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion stroke compared to EVT alone, a new meta-analysis showed. Although symptomatic ICH and asymptomatic ICH were both associated with worse functional outcomes, the benefits from IVT alone may mitigate these risks, the researchers suggested.

“Our results indicated that IVT preceding EVT might increase not only the rate of ICH, but also its severity,” the investigators wrote, noting that it may also increase the rate of any PH.

“However, it is of note that these increases in ICH and PH, while statistically significant, are relatively modest in absolute terms,” they added.

This study was led by Yu Zhou, MD, Neurovascular Center, Naval Medical University Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China. It was published online on August 11 in JAMA Neurology.

Heidelberg radiological bleeding patterns were missing for 52 patients. Unenhanced CT had a limited capacity to distinguish contrast staining from hemorrhage, potentially affecting the accuracy of identifying hemorrhagic infarction. Additionally, varying imaging protocols and timing across trials may have led to an underestimation of asymptomatic cases or smaller hemorrhagic transformations. Final infarct volume data and detailed information on periprocedural antithrombotics or prestroke medications were unavailable, potentially confounding hemorrhage risk. Nearly all participants received alteplase, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other thrombolytics.

This study was funded by Stryker, Boehringer Ingelheim, the Amsterdam University Medical Centers, the Dutch Heart Foundation, the Dutch Brain Foundation, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Shanghai Health and Health Commission Talent Program.

From endothelial repair to anti-inflammatory effects, naringin demonstrates powerful heart-protective actions before reaching clinical trials.

Systematic Review: Endothelial and Cardiovascular Effects of Naringin: A Systematic Review. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers evaluated the cardiovascular and endothelial effects of naringin, a flavonoid found in citrus fruits.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Among the various cardioprotective dietary bioactive compounds, flavonoids have gained significant attention for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities. Naringin is a flavanone glycoside mainly found in citrus fruits, especially in mandarin oranges and grapefruit. It has attracted considerable interest due to its multifaceted biological actions and potential cardioprotective role, though its clinical translation is limited by low oral bioavailability (<5%), prompting research into advanced delivery systems like liposomal encapsulation.

Diabetic mice saw heart calcium levels normalize and cellular energy channels reactivate after naringin treatment, suggesting it repairs metabolic dysfunction at the cellular level.

In the present systematic review, researchers evaluated the cardiovascular and endothelial effects of naringin across cellular, animal, and human studies. First, they searched the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify relevant articles published from January 2000 to June 2025. Original experimental research studies evaluating the effects of naringin on myocardial or endothelial function were included.

Reviews, editorials, abstracts, and studies without cardiovascular endpoints were excluded. Titles/abstracts were screened, followed by full text analysis based on the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes (PICO) framework. Studies in human subjects, cell cultures, and animal models were retained. Cardiovascular or endothelial function outcomes included myocardial infarct size, blood pressure, markers of endothelial function, and cardiac remodeling, among others.

Data on study type, dose, model, treatment duration, endpoints, and mechanistic findings were extracted. A narrative synthesis approach was used due to heterogeneity in model systems, study design, and endpoints. A qualitative synthesis was performed to stratify results by primary endpoints (myocardial or endothelial function) and model type (human, cell, animal).



Naringin Molecular Structure and Citrus Food Sources. The concentration of naringin in plant sources were obtained from Alam et al.

Naringin blocked a deadly cell-death pathway called ferroptosis during heart attacks by silencing the cGAS-STING inflammation alarm in cardiac cells.

The database search identified 2,884 unique records. The full texts of 165 records were assessed for eligibility, and 62 studies were included. These included 28 in vitro, 29 animal, and five human studies. Eight in vitro studies focused on endothelial cells and showed that naringin had protective effects on vascular endothelial cells via suppression of NF-κB signaling and adhesion molecules (e.g., VCAM-1, ICAM-1). Naringin attenuated inflammation activation and preserved normal function in cultured human endothelial cells.

Nineteen in vitro studies were on cardiovascular cell types, including five on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and 14 on cardiac cells. Naringin was found to blunt apoptotic and hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocyte and cardiomyoblast models through modulation of PI3K/Akt and Nrf2 pathways. The anti-hypertrophic effect was related to its ability to inhibit downstream ion transporters and carbonic anhydrase II. Moreover, naringin has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes from simulated in vitro ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) by inhibiting ferroptosis and cGAS-STING pathways.

In a model of hypoxia/reoxygenation injury, naringin reduced oxidative stress, improved cell survival, and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential post-injury. Naringin has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis. Further, naringin has been found to exert anti-atherogenic effects in VSMCs by curbing abnormal migration and proliferation.

Among animal studies, 15 used metabolic disorder models, with nine specifically focusing on myocardial I/R injury or hypertension. Animal models of endothelial injury and hyperlipidemia have demonstrated the anti-atherosclerotic effects of naringin. In rabbit models fed cholesterol, chronic naringin treatment reduced atherosclerotic lesion development.

Studies on hypercholesterolemic rabbits reported significant attenuation of aortic atherosclerosis with naringin treatment, associated with reduced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in the endothelium. In an atherosclerosis-prone mouse model, naringin inhibited plaque formation, protected vascular endothelium, and promoted endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression via PI3K/Akt activation.

Postmenopausal women drinking grapefruit juice for 6 months had significantly more flexible arteries – even though standard blood flow tests showed no change.

Moreover, naringin has demonstrated anti-hypertensive effects linked to renin-angiotensin system (RAS) modulation, preventing cardiac remodeling. Studies on animal models of diet-induced metabolic syndrome have reported that naringin reduces cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis. Beyond ischemia-reperfusion, benefits extended to diabetic cardiomyopathy, sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction, and doxorubicin cardiotoxicity models.

In addition, naringin has consistently demonstrated cardioprotective effects in animal models of I/R injury and myocardial infarction (MI). For instance, naringin pretreatment significantly improved cardiac function and reduced myocardial damage in a rat model of I/R injury. This cardioprotection was associated with reductions in myocardial oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis via PI3K/Akt and Nrf2/GPX4 pathways. In a rat model of MI, naringin pretreatment prevented myocardial necrosis and oxidative stress.

Naringin was found to improve cardiac function and histology in diabetic cardiomyopathy models and attenuate sepsis and lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial dysfunction in other models. Further, compared to preclinical studies, few studies have examined the effects of naringin in humans. Although still limited, evidence on the cardiovascular effects of naringin in humans stems from dietary intervention studies and clinical trials.

A randomized controlled trial reported significant improvements in cardiometabolic parameters in adults who received naringin for 90 days, showing a favorable lipid-modulating effect. Notably, one trial also documented improved arterial stiffness (reduced pulse wave velocity) with naringin-rich grapefruit juice. A dietary intervention study of adults with moderate hypercholesterolemia reported that naringin intake for eight weeks did not change plasma cholesterol levels; this lack of effect might be due to insufficient dose or treatment duration, as effective preclinical doses translate to ~1 g/day in humans.

In sum, a substantial body of evidence positions naringin as a potent compound with cardiovascular benefits. Preclinical studies have documented its ability to protect the myocardium and improve endothelial function through multi-targeted actions on oxidative stress (Nrf2), inflammation (NF-κB), cell survival (PI3K/Akt), and RAS modulation. It can suppress oxidative stress and inflammation, preserve endothelial integrity, and activate pro-survival signaling in cells.

Despite the positive findings of naringin, further research is needed to define optimal dosing, improve bioavailability, and validate effects in large-scale human trials to cement its role in clinical practice.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","MIT technique reveals how AI models predict protein functions","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250819/MIT-technique-reveals-how-AI-models-predict-protein-functions.aspx","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:18:00 GMT","

Within the past few years, models that can predict the structure or function of proteins have been widely used for a variety of biological applications, such as identifying drug targets and designing new therapeutic antibodies.

These models, which are based on large language models (LLMs), can make very accurate predictions of a protein's suitability for a given application. However, there's no way to determine how these models make their predictions or which protein features play the most important role in those decisions.

In a new study, MIT researchers have used a novel technique to open up that ""black box"" and allow them to determine what features a protein language model takes into account when making predictions. Understanding what is happening inside that black box could help researchers to choose better models for a particular task, helping to streamline the process of identifying new drugs or vaccine targets.

Our work has broad implications for enhanced explainability in downstream tasks that rely on these representations. Additionally, identifying features that protein language models track has the potential to reveal novel biological insights from these representations.""

Bonnie Berger, Study Senior Author and Simons Professor of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Berger is also the head of the Computation and Biology group in MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

Onkar Gujral, an MIT graduate student, is the lead author of the study, which appears this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Mihir Bafna, an MIT graduate student, and Eric Alm, an MIT professor of biological engineering, are also authors of the paper.

In 2018, Berger and former MIT graduate student Tristan Bepler PhD '20 introduced the first protein language model. Their model, like subsequent protein models that accelerated the development of AlphaFold, such as ESM2 and OmegaFold, was based on LLMs. These models, which include ChatGPT, can analyze huge amounts of text and figure out which words are most likely to appear together.

Protein language models use a similar approach, but instead of analyzing words, they analyze amino acid sequences. Researchers have used these models to predict the structure and function of proteins, and for applications such as identifying proteins that might bind to particular drugs.

In a 2021 study, Berger and colleagues used a protein language model to predict which sections of viral surface proteins are less likely to mutate in a way that enables viral escape. This allowed them to identify possible targets for vaccines against influenza, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2.

However, in all of these studies, it has been impossible to know how the models were making their predictions.

""We would get out some prediction at the end, but we had absolutely no idea what was happening in the individual components of this black box,"" Berger stated.

In the new study, the researchers wanted to dig into how protein language models make their predictions. Just like LLMs, protein language models encode information as representations that consist of a pattern of activation of different ""nodes"" within a neural network. These nodes are analogous to the networks of neurons that store memories and other information within the brain.

The inner workings of LLMs are not easy to interpret, but within the past couple of years, researchers have begun using a type of algorithm known as a sparse autoencoder to help shed some light on how those models make their predictions. The new study from Berger's lab is the first to use this algorithm on protein language models.

Sparse autoencoders work by adjusting how a protein is represented within a neural network. Typically, a given protein will be represented by a pattern of activation of a constrained number of neurons, for example, 480. A sparse autoencoder will expand that representation into a much larger number of nodes, say 20,000.

When information about a protein is encoded by only 480 neurons, each node lights up for multiple features, making it very difficult to know what features each node is encoding. However, when the neural network is expanded to 20,000 nodes, this extra space along with a sparsity constraint gives the information room to ""spread out."" Now, a feature of the protein that was previously encoded by multiple nodes can occupy a single node.

""In a sparse representation, the neurons lighting up are doing so in a more meaningful manner,"" Gujral says. ""Before the sparse representations are created, the networks pack information so tightly together that it's hard to interpret the neurons.""

Once the researchers obtained sparse representations of many proteins, they used an AI assistant called Claude (related to the popular Anthropic chatbot of the same name), to analyze the representations. In this case, they asked Claude to compare the sparse representations with the known features of each protein, such as molecular function, protein family, or location within a cell.

By analyzing thousands of representations, Claude can determine which nodes correspond to specific protein features, then describe them in plain English. For example, the algorithm might say, ""This neuron appears to be detecting proteins involved in transmembrane transport of ions or amino acids, particularly those located in the plasma membrane.""

This process makes the nodes far more ""interpretable,"" meaning the researchers can tell what each node is encoding. They found that the features most likely to be encoded by these nodes were protein family and certain functions, including several different metabolic and biosynthetic processes.

""When you train a sparse autoencoder, you aren't training it to be interpretable, but it turns out that by incentivizing the representation to be really sparse, that ends up resulting in interpretability,"" Gujral says.

Understanding what features a particular protein model is encoding could help researchers choose the right model for a particular task, or tweak the type of input they give the model, to generate the best results. Additionally, analyzing the features that a model encodes could one day help biologists to learn more about the proteins that they are studying.

""At some point when the models get a lot more powerful, you could learn more biology than you already know, from opening up the models,"" Gujral says.

Research led by investigators at Mass General Brigham suggests that the health benefits of more aggressive blood pressure control outweigh concerns about overtreating people with high blood pressure readings. Results of the simulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine. 

The study used data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) trial, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and other published literature to simulate lifetime health outcomes-including heart attack, stroke, and heart failure-for patients whose systolic blood pressure targets were set at <120 mm Hg, <130 mm Hg, and <140 mm Hg.

Recognizing that blood pressure medication comes with side effects, the researchers also simulated and compared the risk of serious events resulting from the treatment. 

The simulation model also accounted for common errors in patients' blood pressure readings based on what has been observed in routine clinical practice. 

Even when including this error rate, the simulation model found that the <120 mm Hg target prevented more cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure, than the <130 mm Hg target. However, the lower target led to additional adverse events related to treatment, such as falls, kidney injury, hypotension, and bradycardia. The lower target also increased overall healthcare spending due to increased antihypertensive use and more frequent visits with clinicians. 

Comparing the cost-effectiveness of the three blood pressure targets with typical levels of measurement error, the researchers found the <120 mm Hg target was cost-effective, associated with a cost of $42,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. 

This study should give patients at high cardiovascular risk and their clinicians more confidence in pursuing an intensive blood pressure goal. Our findings suggest the intensive <120 mm Hg target prevents more cardiovascular events and provides good value, and this holds true even when measurements aren't perfect.""

Karen Smith, PhD, Study Lead Author and Investigator, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital

Smith is also a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.

Smith also cautioned, ""Our results examine the cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment at the population level. However, given the additional risk of adverse events related to antihypertensives, intensive treatment will not be optimal for all patients. Patients and clinicians should work together to determine the appropriate medication intensity based on patient preferences.""

Cerebrovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and stroke remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A common feature of these diseases is vascular stenosis, i.e., the narrowing of blood vessels, which disrupts normal blood flow and contributes to chronic inflammation in the vessel wall. Endothelial cells lining the vasculature play a key role in sensing shear stress from blood flow and responding to disturbed hemodynamics by expressing pro-inflammatory molecules. However, studying this phenomenon in vivo is challenging due to the complexity and variability of living systems.

Traditional in vitro models, including static cultures and microfluidic devices, often fall short of replicating the structural, mechanical, and biological complexity of the human cerebrovascular environment. This emphasizes the need for a more physiologically relevant model to study how abnormal flow patterns drive endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.

To bridge this critical research gap, a collaborative team led by Professor Byoung Soo Kim and Researcher Min-Ju Choi from Pusan National University, along with Professor Dong-Woo Cho and Dr. Wonbin Park from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), developed a 3D-bioprinted in vitro model of stenotic brain blood vessels. Their groundbreaking study was published online in the journal Advanced Functional Materials on June 24, 2025. ""We used a novel embedded coaxial bioprinting technique to rapidly fabricate perfusable vascular conduits with controlled luminal narrowing,"" explains Prof. Kim. ""Our bioink, a hybrid of porcine aorta-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM), collagen, and alginate, offered both mechanical strength and essential biological cues to support endothelial cell attachment and function.""

The bioprinted vessels encapsulated human endothelial cells, including umbilical vein (HUVECs) and brain microvascular cells (HBMECs), and were exposed to flow conditions simulating both normal and stenotic blood vessels. The model successfully fabricated in vivo blood flow conditions and mimicked stenotic geometries associated with cerebrovascular diseases. Computational fluid dynamics simulations and tracer bead experiments confirmed that stenotic regions produced disturbed flow patterns, characteristic of those seen in atherosclerotic vessels. The endothelialized vessels showed continuous coverage and expressed all junction proteins, including CD31, VE-cadherin, and ZO-1. The vessels also maintained barrier integrity by demonstrating selective permeability. Notably, under disturbed flow conditions, there was a significant upregulation of inflammatory markers, hallmarks of a mature endothelial barrier.

""This 3D bioprinting technology marks a significant advancement in cerebrovascular disease modeling by enabling anatomically accurate and physiologically relevant vessels,"" shares Prof. Kim. Using a reinforced ECM-based bioink and coaxial bioprinting, the model replicates stenotic vessel geometry and flow dynamics, providing a realistic platform to study flow-induced endothelial inflammation. Its compatibility with multiple endothelial cell types broadens its utility in disease modeling and personalized medicine. By bridging the gap between simplistic in vitro systems and complex in vivo models, this platform also reduces reliance on animal testing and enhances drug screening and toxicity assessments.

Future refinements such as incorporating brain-specific ECM, co-culturing vascular support cells, and using patient-derived cells could further enhance physiological accuracy and patient-specific modeling. Integration with organ-on-a-chip platforms and AI-driven analytics could also enable real-time monitoring of endothelial responses to therapies.

In conclusion, this study delivers a robust and versatile platform for cerebrovascular tissue engineering. As bioprinting technologies continue to evolve, they hold the potential to transform how we study and treat diseases like stroke and atherosclerosis, accelerating therapeutic discovery and the development of personalized interventions.

As the pace of drug discovery accelerates, scientists are under more pressure than ever to generate high-quality data quickly, reliably, and at scale. For over two decades, Octet® Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) systems have been a trusted part of that journey, offering real-time, label-free interaction analysis without the complexity of fluidics.

Sartorius is pushing BLI further with the Octet® R8e: its most sensitive and versatile system to date for high-throughput analysis of protein-protein, protein-small molecules, and other biomolecular interactions. We spoke with Deirdre Raduns, Manager of Product Management for Protein Analytics, about how the R8e meets the evolving needs of scientific teams working at the front lines of biologics development.

The R8e takes everything that users already appreciate about Octet®—speed, simplicity, no fluidics—and pairs it with a major leap in sensitivity. Researchers can work confidently at the lower detection limits, where other BLI platforms start to struggle. So, if you're working with small molecules, weak binders, or low-abundance targets, the R8e gives you sharper data and clearer answers you can trust.

This is our flagship BLI system for labs needing performance and flexibility. While our other systems serve a wide range of throughput needs, the R8e adds a new dimension with high sensitivity and customizable assay design, all while staying fluidic-free and user-friendly. It's an ideal choice for teams who want the next level of data quality without the long sample loading times and maintenance burden of complex instrumentation.

At its core, the R8e expands what's possible with BLI. It brings near-SPR sensitivity, which means researchers can now detect and quantify interactions that were previously out of reach on a BLI system, especially when working with small molecules or low-affinity analytes.

From a workflow efficiency perspective, you can run assays in 96- or 384-well formats depending on your throughput needs. Plus, we've added smart evaporation control for the 96-well format, so long, overnight runs don't compromise your sample integrity. That's a game-changer for teams who want to push their experiments further without worrying about reliability.

Automation is increasingly non-negotiable in high-throughput environments. Octet® BLI systems are already designed for walk-away operation, but for labs ready to fully integrate with robotics, we offer the RH series (RH16 and RH96) along with a partnership with BIOSERO to integrate these systems and streamline processes. The result is greater consistency, more reproducibility, and more time for teams to focus on science.

Despite the increasing recognition of Long COVID as a condition, many patients still face dismissal by medical professionals, misattribution of their symptoms to psychological causes, or simply being left to fend for themselves. The study describes the response many encounter from professionals as 'medical gaslighting', disbelief and dismissiveness.

The study, published in Sociology and conducted in collaboration with Professor Deborah Lupton from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, found that people with Long COVID are turning to wearable devices and online patient communities to make sense of their symptoms, identify patterns and triggers, and develop their own care plans.

The research found that the study participants, most of whom are highly educated and professionally employed (although more than half were unable to work at the time of the interview because of their illness), are using data from smartwatches and symptom-tracking apps to evidence their symptoms to their medical practitioners and advocate for diagnostic tests. In some cases, participants felt it was only because of their self-tracking data that they had been able to get referrals to tests or specialists and subsequently obtain formal diagnoses and access treatment.

We found that people with Long COVID are often left to fend for themselves in a system that isn't adequately informed about their condition and doesn't offer them appropriate medical support. Digital self-tracking, combined with the expertise shared in online patient groups, offers a vital source of knowledge, validation and practical care. But it shouldn't fall to patients to do this work alone. And not all patients have the resources and capacities to usefully engage with self-tracking technologies and advocate for themselves.""

Dr. Sazana Jayadeva, co-author of the study and Surrey Future Fellow in the Department of Sociology, University of Surrey

The study found that online patient groups are not only sharing advice on which metrics to monitor and how to interpret data, but are also contributing to the uptake of self-tracking technologies by people with limited to no previous experience or interest in tracking. The study also found that having wearable data gave patients greater confidence to advocate for themselves in medical contexts. Yet many still felt their data was disregarded or even resented. The study identifies this digital evidence as a tool for reducing the power imbalance between patients and doctors - but only where clinicians are willing to listen.

Dr. Sazana Jayadeva continued:

""We need a shift in medical culture, and we urge practitioners to treat patient-generated data as a valuable resource. Without this shift, patients with contested illnesses like Long COVID risk remaining stuck in a system where they have to be their own doctors.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Johns Hopkins team develops a more reliable AI for early cancer detection","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250819/Johns-Hopkins-team-develops-a-more-reliable-AI-for-early-cancer-detection.aspx","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 06:04:00 GMT","

Two studies led by Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Ludwig Center, and Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering researchers report on a powerful new method that significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) for many applications. As an example, they apply the new method to early cancer detection from blood samples, known as liquid biopsy.

One study reports on the development of MIGHT (Multidimensional Informed Generalized Hypothesis Testing), an AI method that the researchers created to meet the high level of confidence needed for AI tools used in clinical decision making. To illustrate the benefits of MIGHT, they used it to develop a test for early cancer detection using circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA)-fragments of DNA circulating in the blood.

A companion study found that ccfDNA fragmentation patterns used to detect cancer also appear in patients with autoimmune and vascular diseases. To develop a test with high sensitivity for cancer but reduced false-positive results, MIGHT was expanded to incorporate data from autoimmune and vascular diseases obtained from colleagues at Johns Hopkins and other institutions who treat and study these diseases.

The studies, supported in part by the National Institutes of Health, are to be published on Aug. 18 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 

A related article, authored by three researchers from Johns Hopkins, Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull, Ph.D., and Microsoft chief data scientist of the AI for Good Lab Juan Lavista Ferres, was published concurrently in Cancer Discovery, a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research. It discusses the challenges of incorporating AI into clinical practice, including challenges addressed by MIGHT.

MIGHT fine-tunes itself using real data and checks its accuracy on different subsets of the data, using tens of thousands of decision-trees, and can be applied to any field employing big data, ranging from astronomy to zoology. It is particularly effective for the analysis of biomedical datasets with many variables but relatively few patient samples, a common situation in which traditional AI models often falter. 

In tests using patient data, MIGHT consistently outperformed other AI methods in both sensitivity and consistency. It was applied to the blood of 1,000 individuals-352 patients with advanced cancers and 648 individuals without cancer.

For each sample, the researchers evaluated 44 different variable sets, each consisting of a set of biological features, such as DNA fragment lengths or chromosomal abnormalities, and found that aneuploidy-based features (an abnormal number of chromosomes) delivered the best cancer detection performance with a sensitivity of 72% (ability to detect cancer) at 98% specificity (correctly identified those who were cancer free). This balance is critical in real-world medical applications where minimizing false positives is necessary to avoid unneeded procedures.

MIGHT gives us a powerful way to measure uncertainty and increase reliability, especially in situations where sample sizes are limited but data complexity is high.""

Joshua Vogelstein, PhD, Study Lead Investigator and Associate Professor, Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins Medicine

MIGHT was also extended to a companion algorithm, called CoMIGHT, to determine whether combining multiple variable sets could improve cancer detection. 

The researchers applied CoMIGHT to blood samples from 125 patients with early-stage breast cancers and 125 patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer, which were analyzed along with 500 controls (participants without cancer). While pancreatic cancers were more often detected than breast cancers, CoMIGHT analysis suggested that early-stage breast cancer might benefit from combining multiple biological signals, highlighting the tool's potential for tailoring detection strategies by cancer type. 

In the companion study, researchers Christopher Douville, PhD, assistant professor of oncology, Samuel Curtis, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in the Ludwig Center, and their teams serendipitously discovered that ccfDNA fragmentation signatures previously believed to be specific to individuals with cancer also occur in patients with other diseases, including autoimmune conditions such as lupus, systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis, and vascular diseases like venous thromboembolism. 

Among individuals with abnormal fragmentation signatures, they found an increase in inflammatory biomarkers in all patients, whether they had autoimmune diseases, vascular disease, or cancer. Their results suggest that inflammation-rather than cancer per se, is responsible for fragmentation signals, complicating efforts to use ccfDNA fragmentation as a biomarker specific for cancer. 

To address the challenge of misconstruing inflammation for cancer, the team added information characteristic of inflammation in its training data for MIGHT. The enhanced version reduced, but did not completely eliminate, the false-positive results from non-cancerous diseases.

""Our main goal was to further investigate the biological mechanisms responsible for fragmentation signatures that have previously been thought to be specific for cancer,"" says Curtis. ""As the field moves to more complex biomarkers, understanding the underlying biological mechanisms leading to the results are critical to their interpretation, particularly to avoid false positive results. Our new data indicate that patients with diseases other than cancer can be mistakenly believed to have cancer unless appropriate safeguards are incorporated into the tests."" 

Adds Douville, ""A silver lining of this study is that reworking of MIGHT could result in a separate diagnostic test for inflammatory diseases."" 

Together, the studies demonstrate the promise as well as the complexities of developing trustworthy clinical technologies using AI. In a related editorial, researchers noted several critical challenges that need to be addressed so that tools like MIGHT can be fully integrated into clinical practice. 

They identified eight key barriers to bringing AI into routine clinical care. In simple terms, these include the false expectation that AI tools need to be flawless before they're considered useful; the need to present results as probabilities rather than simple yes-or-no answers; making sure AI predictions match real-world probabilities; ensuring results are reproducible; training models on diverse populations; explaining how AI makes decisions; recognizing how test accuracy can change when diseases are rare; and avoiding over-reliance on computer-generated recommendations. 

""MIGHT could be applied to any field where measuring uncertainty and having confidence in the reliability and reproducibility of findings is key. This could be in the natural sciences, social sciences, or medical sciences. Research across all fields of science requires confidence that what the algorithm is spitting out is real, reproducible, and reliable,"" says Joshua Vogelstein.

The researchers say results obtained using AI technologies should be viewed as AI-informed data that can complement but not replace clinical judgment. Although MIGHT and CoMIGHT offer powerful new tools in cancer detection, and potentially inflammatory and vascular disease detection, they say that further clinical trials and validation are necessary before such tests can be extended to clinical use. 

""Trust in the result is essential, and now that there is a reliable, quantitative tool in MIGHT, we and other researchers can use it and focus our efforts on studying more patients and adding statistically meaningful features to our tests for earlier cancer detection,"" says Bert Vogelstein, M.D., Clayton Professor of Oncology, co-director of the Ludwig Center, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and study co-leader. 

MIGHT and its companion algorithm, CoMIGHT, are now publicly available at treeple.ai.

In a recent rapid communication in the journal Eurosurveillance, researchers from France's public health agency detail the current scenario of the chikungunya disease within the country. Specifically, the aftermath of a large 2025 chikungunya outbreak on Réunion Island led to a surge of imported cases in mainland France, triggering an unusually early and widespread season of local transmission.

The report highlights how, by July 10, 2025, 10 local outbreaks involving 27 people had been identified across five French regions. The first local transmission occurring in May (with symptom onset May 27) is the earliest recorded for any arbovirus (chikungunya, dengue, or Zika). These events, driven by the Aedes albopictus (tiger) mosquito, signal an escalating threat from arboviral diseases in Europe and significantly strain surveillance and response systems.

Map of the autochthonous transmission events of chikungunya virus, Mainland France, May–10 July 2025 (n = 27)

Over 86% of travelers from Réunion carried transmissible virus levels while in mainland France, creating widespread opportunities for local mosquitoes to pick up the virus.

Chikungunya is a mosquito-transmitted viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an RNA virus in the alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae. Formally a tropical disease localized in Africa and Southeast Asia, the range expansion of its vector (the Aedes albopictus mosquito) has allowed chikungunya to establish itself globally, particularly in large parts of Europe, including France.

The disease is characterized by high fever and moderate to severe joint pain that manifests suddenly within a week of infection. These symptoms may also be accompanied by muscle pain, headache, fatigue, and rashes.

Viral transmission follows a straightforward and well-documented pattern – an infected individual (termed an ""imported case"") travels from an outbreak area to a region where tiger mosquitoes are present. If a local mosquito bites that person during their viraemic phase (when the virus is in their blood), it can transmit the virus to other local people, creating an ""autochthonous"" or local transmission chain.

To combat this, France operates an enhanced surveillance system from May to November, aiming to rapidly detect imported cases and implement vector control to prevent local spread. However, in early 2025, this system faced significant challenges due to a massive chikungunya outbreak on Réunion Island, a French overseas territory (Indian Ocean).

Containing outbreaks required intensive, resource-heavy efforts: public health teams conducted exhaustive door-to-door surveys and targeted mosquito breeding sites around every autochthonous case identified.

The present report represents a rapid communication detailing the real-time findings from France's mandatory surveillance system for Aedes-borne viruses. Conducted by researchers from Santé publique France (the French National Public Health Agency), the report aims to prevent or limit local chikungunya transmission by rapidly identifying and responding to both imported and autochthonous cases.

Surveillance data is collated and synthesized via daily monitoring of laboratory results and epidemiological investigations of confirmed cases. When a case is confirmed, public health authorities interview the patient to determine their travel history and establish the likely place of infection. If a case has no travel history, it is classified as autochthonous, initiating intensive local response.

Chikungunya mitigation measures and intensive local response include: 1. Door-to-door case finding to identify other potential infections, including tracing primary imported cases (successful in 4/10 outbreaks), and 2. Vector control measures, such as eliminating mosquito breeding sites and spraying insecticides and larvicides in the affected area.

The first-ever outbreak in Grand Est (Lipsheim) occurred in an area where tiger mosquitoes are relative newcomers, first spotted in 2015, highlighting the risk even in recently colonized northern zones.

The report credited the Réunion Island outbreak between January and April 2025 with a majority (n = 484; 78%) of the 620 imported chikungunya cases with symptom onset documented in mainland France between May and June 2025. By July 10, 2025, 1,911 imported cases had been notified, 89% linked to Réunion Island – the highest on record since French surveillance began in 2006. Notably, more than 86% of imported cases were viraemic during their stay in mainland France.

This massive influx triggered 10 autochthonous outbreaks comprising 27 cases identified by July 10. The largest cluster (unusually large compared to others) was in Salon-de-Provence with 13 people.

Critically, this marks the earliest arbovirus transmission season in France's history. Prior to 2025, the earliest first case occurred on June 12, with only 3 of 53 previously documented outbreaks starting in June. The median 9-day reporting delay for imported cases facilitated rapid response.

The outbreak in Lipsheim (Grand Est) is particularly significant as the first local transmission in this recently colonized region, where Aedes albopictus was only detected in 2015.

Researchers warned some local transmission chains might be slipping through the surveillance net, raising concerns that undetected spread could trigger larger outbreaks if vigilance wanes.

The present report highlights France's escalating arbovirus challenge and suggests that this is only the start of the expanding threat of mosquito-borne diseases in Europe. The combination of a large overseas outbreak (and its associated influx of cases), a Réunion strain well-adapted to Aedes albopictus, and the mosquito's northward expansion has demonstrated that local transmission can occur much earlier in the season than previously thought, even when vector densities are presumed to be low.

While the rapid detection and containment of these initial outbreaks highlight the effectiveness of France's surveillance system, the resource-intensive nature of door-to-door investigations and vector control measures raises concerns about the system's capacity if transmission trends continue to increase. This report underscores the urgent need for European policymakers to anticipate this growing risk through dedicated funding, contingency planning, and research.

The American College of Cardiology has established a digital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) registry to learn more about one of the most common genetic cardiovascular diseases and provide more equitable access to treatment and care. The CONNECT-HCM Registry is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and developed in collaboration with Atlantic Health, Arboretum and Yale Center for Outcomes Research & Evaluation (CORE).

Because of the unique challenges in identifying HCM, data, treatment and diagnosis are predominantly from a single center experience with enrollment from limited providers. With this registry we'll be able to proactively capture data that allows for direct patient enrollment regardless of the provider and allow for a broader understanding of HCM diagnosis, guideline-directed care, and outcomes in mainstream HCM care. We will be able to expand this format to sites throughout the country for patients who wish to enroll themselves into this registry.""

Matthew W. Martinez, MD, FACC, CONNECT-HCM co-principal investigator and director of Sports Cardiology and the HCM Center at Atlantic Health

HCM is a condition where the heart muscle gets too thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. It's the most common genetic cardiovascular condition, but it is difficult to diagnose because many people don't have symptoms or their symptoms are mistaken for other conditions. Left undiagnosed, HCM can lead to heart failure, blood clots, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.To date, CONNECT-HCM has enrolled over 70 people with HCM who will be followed longitudinally to capture data on their symptoms, diagnostic images, treatment plans, outcomes and demographic information. By linking CONNECT-HCM registry data with individual electronic health records through Arboretum's Hugo Connect platform, researchers will be able to study how individuals with HCM are cared for across medical providers regardless of location. The research approach and platform has started with Morristown Medical Center with anticipated expansion to additional sites rapidly.""Registry participants are providing essential data on HCM symptoms, impact of treatments on different patient populations and outcomes that we are currently lacking,"" said Rohan Khera, MD, MS, FACC, CONNECT-HCM co-principal investigator and an assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. ""In the future we'll be much better equipped to diagnose and manage this complex but treatable condition because of the CONNECT-HCM registry.""Participants will also receive CardioSmart.org educational materials, including a symptom tracker and exercise fact sheet to determine a safe and effective exercise plan. In the past, some HCM patients have feared exercise, but recent data has shown that exercise is beneficial to people with HCM and is very rarely a cause of sudden cardiac death. The 2024 ACC/AHA HCM Guideline recommends mild to moderate exercise for people with HCM to improve quality of life and ability to do everyday activities.

Aging is particularly harsh on the hippocampus - the brain region responsible for learning and memory.

Now, researchers at UC San Francisco have identified a protein that's at the center of this decline. 

They looked at how the genes and proteins in the hippocampus changed over time in mice and found just one that differed between old and young animals. It's called FTL1. 

Old mice had more FTL1, as well as fewer connections between brain cells in the hippocampus and diminished cognitive abilities. 

When the researchers artificially increased FTL1 levels in young mice, their brains and behavior began to resemble that of old mice.

In experiments in petri dishes, nerve cells engineered to make lots of FTL1 grew simple, one-armed neurites - rather than the branching neurites that normal cells create. 

But once the scientists reduced the amount of FTL1 in the hippocampus of the old mice, they regained their youth. They had more connections between nerve cells, and the mice did better on memory tests. 

""It is truly a reversal of impairments,"" said Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, which appears in Nature Aging on Aug. 19. ""It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms.""

In old mice, FTL1 also slowed down metabolism in the cells of the hippocampus. But treating the cells with a compound that stimulates metabolism prevented these effects. 

Villeda is optimistic the work could lead to therapies that block the effects of FTL1 in the brain. 

We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging.""

A new study published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery, a journal from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, has identified early hemodynamic valve deterioration (HVD) in more than 6% of patients just one year after undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), raising new questions about valve durability in younger, lower-risk populations.

The retrospective study, which analyzed 10 years of procedures from 2012 to 2022, evaluated 2,123 patients who had complete echocardiographic follow-up data. Researchers found that patients with 1-year HVD were more likely to be younger and have smaller aortic annuli than those without HVD. Importantly, smaller implanted valve sizes were significantly associated with the development of HVD, while larger valves appeared to be protective.

As TAVI is increasingly used in younger and healthier patients, our findings suggest a need to carefully consider valve sizing and long-term durability. Early identification of hemodynamic deterioration may serve as a key predictor of future reintervention and patient outcomes.""

Eishan Ashwat, BS, lead study author, medical student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine

According to the study, patients with 1-year HVD had a five-year aortic valve reintervention rate nearly four times higher than those without HVD (2.3% vs. 0.6%). Prior surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) was also independently associated with a higher risk of early HVD.

The findings underscore the importance of vigilant long-term follow-up and may influence future decision-making regarding valve selection, particularly in patients with smaller aortic anatomy or a history of AVR.

The study used the updated Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) definitions to assess bioprosthetic valve function and structural deterioration.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients may exhibit liver fibrosis and other pathological changes despite normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT). This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tenofovir amibufenamide (TMF) in chronic HBV-infected patients with normal ALT levels.

The ongoing PROMOTE study (NCT05797714) is the first prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, blank-controlled clinical trial involving chronic HBV-infected patients with normal ALT levels. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TMF (TMF group) or no treatment (blank control group). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants achieving HBV DNA levels <20 IU/mL at 48 weeks.

A total of 197 participants were enrolled, with 95 in the TMF group and 102 in the blank control group. At 48 weeks, a significantly greater proportion of participants in the TMF group achieved HBV DNA levels <20 IU/mL compared with the control group (74.2% vs. 9.0%, P < 0.001). The TMF group demonstrated more pronounced reductions in HBV DNA (−2.63 vs. −0.22 log10 IU/mL, P < 0.001), HBsAg (−0.07 vs. −0.04 log10 IU/mL, P = 0.02), and ALT levels (−14.09% vs. 0%, P = 0.003) compared with the blank control. In the TMF group, the proportion of participants with high-normal ALT levels (20–40 IU/L) was reduced. No significant differences were observed between the groups in creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, bone turnover biomarkers, lipid profiles, or phosphorus levels.

TMF treatment demonstrates significant efficacy in chronic HBV-infected patients with normal ALT levels and shows a favorable safety profile regarding bone, renal, and lipid parameters. The PROMOTE study is ongoing, and further results at 96 and 144 weeks are expected to provide additional insights.

From Egypt to Italy, children who regularly eat ultra-processed foods are falling short of dietary guidelines and moving away from traditional Mediterranean eating patterns, researchers warn.



In a recent article published in the journal Foods, researchers examined the consumption of unhealthy ultra-processed foods (UPFs) among children and adolescents in five Mediterranean countries, exploring how UPF intake relates to diet quality.

Their analysis showed that higher consumption of UPFs was linked with poorer overall diet quality, reduced compliance with dietary guidelines, and lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet.

Daily UPF consumers faced steep odds: Children eating UPFs daily had 37-60% lower likelihood of achieving high diet quality scores, with the strongest negative effects seen in Egypt, Italy, and Portugal.

In recent decades, diets have shifted from seasonal, fresh, local foods toward industrially processed alternatives, a trend especially evident among children and adolescents.

Technological advances and globalization have reshaped food production, increasing shelf life and convenience but often sacrificing nutritional quality. This shift raises concerns, as children are particularly vulnerable due to developmental needs, marketing susceptibility, and reliance on caregivers and schools for diet.

Early exposure to poor eating habits can disrupt healthy growth, impair cognitive and immune function, and increase the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes.

Mediterranean countries, once known for the balanced and nutrient-rich Mediterranean diet, are also experiencing a gradual move toward Western-style eating, marked by nutrient-poor, calorie-dense foods. Although overall consumption of such foods remains lower than in countries like the US or UK, these trends are concerning.

According to the Nova classification, UPFs are industrial products high in sugars, fats, and additives but low in essential nutrients. Growing evidence links frequent UPF consumption with poor diet quality, chronic diseases, and even cognitive problems.

Legumes got sidelined: Across all five countries, children eating more UPFs consistently fell short of dietary recommendations for legumes – a cornerstone of the traditional Mediterranean diet.

Researchers analyzed dietary habits of children and adolescents aged between 6 and 17 years in five Mediterranean countries, namely Lebanon, Egypt, Portugal, Spain, and Italy, using data provided by 2011 parents recruited from a consumer database.

Eligible participants had to be parents of children within the age range and have internet access, and data, including demographic information, were collected via an online survey. Weight status was calculated using established growth chart body mass index (BMI) percentiles, classifying participants as obese, overweight, or normal weight.

Physical activity was assessed using a questionnaire, which categorized activity as low, moderate, or high. Dietary intake was assessed through 24-hour recalls and weekly food frequency questions. Special attention was given to 13 categories of UPFs, including fast food, soft drinks, pastries, and candies. UPF consumption was categorized as “high” (above the median) or “daily” (daily consumption of at least one type of UPF; not necessarily all categories).

Diet quality was assessed using two indices: the Youth Healthy Eating Index (adapted to a maximum score of 90 in this study) and the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (with a high score of 12). Statistical analyses included Chi-square, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for physical activity, weight, age, and sex.

Meat type matters: Diets high in UPFs weren't just linked to more meat consumption overall, but specifically to diets richer in processed meats like sausages and pre-packaged cold cuts.

Among the 2011 participants, no significant differences by sex were found across UPF consumption groups. However, obesity and overweight were more common among children with higher daily UPF intake. Interestingly, a higher proportion of physically active adolescents also reported high UPF consumption. The authors proposed this might reflect increased hunger from higher activity rather than inherently unhealthy behaviors, but noted this contrasts with most literature and requires confirmation.

In terms of food groups, high and daily UPF consumers ate more sweets, nuts, dairy, meat, and cereals, but showed a lower proportion consuming high fruit intake (≥3 portions/day) and a higher proportion consuming moderate fruit (1–2 portions/day), with Spain as a notable exception where high UPF consumers ate more fruit. Importantly, vegetable and whole grain intake remained consistent regardless of UPF consumption levels. Country-specific patterns largely mirrored these results.

Diet quality was consistently lower in children with higher UPF intake. Those consuming UPFs daily or frequently scored significantly lower on both the diet quality indices. For example, daily UPF consumption was associated with about 40–60% lower odds of achieving high diet quality scores. Subgroup analyses showed particularly strong negative associations in Egypt, Portugal, and Italy, while Lebanon showed paradoxical increases in Mediterranean diet adherence among high UPF consumers, and findings were less consistent in Spain.

Further analysis showed that high UPF consumers were less likely to meet dietary recommendations for fats, sweets, meat, and legumes across countries. Some exceptions were noted, such as higher adherence to Spanish guidelines for fish among frequent UPF consumers.

This study found that higher consumption of unhealthy UPFs among children and adolescents in Mediterranean countries was strongly linked with poorer diet quality and lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet, echoing evidence from other research.

Although some country-level variations emerged, frequent UPF intake was associated with unbalanced diets rich in fats, sweets, and processed meats, potentially displacing minimally processed foods. The study provides a comprehensive multi-country assessment of UPF consumption in Mediterranean youth using standardized metrics.

The study's strengths include its standardized, multi-country design and focus on both diet quality indices and adherence to national guidelines. However, limitations include its cross-sectional design, reliance on parental reports (which may consist of recall and social desirability bias), and restricted focus on only certain UPF categories.

In conclusion, reducing unhealthy UPF intake is essential to preserve the health benefits associated with the Mediterranean diet. This requires multi-sectoral strategies, including education, stricter marketing regulations, school nutrition policies, and industry accountability through reformulation and labeling.

Malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, remains a major global health threat, claiming 600,000 lives annually, mostly young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Immunity to severe malaria develops after repeated infections and is mediated by antibodies blocking the parasite's highly diversified PfEMP1 adhesion proteins from binding to the human endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) on blood vessel walls.

In the collaborative study, researchers from the National Institute for Medical Research in Tanzania and the University of Copenhagen first identified donors with immune plasma able to prevent many diverse PfEMP1 variants from binding to EPCR. 

Through philanthropic support from Canadian biotech company Rapid Novor, the REpAb® antibody discovery platform was used to uncover the amino acid sequence of a monoclonal antibody with broad inhibitory activity against diverse PfEMP1 variants. This is the first time mass spectrometry has been applied to identify a functional plasma antibody developed naturally after infection.

Protein structural analysis, carried out with researchers at The Scripps Research Institute in California, revealed how this broadly neutralizing antibody binds to conserved residues across different PfEMP1 variants to block parasite adhesion.

By sequencing a naturally acquired antibody circulating in the blood and seeing exactly how it binds, we gain valuable insight into the protective antibody response against malaria.""

Louise Turner, Senior Scientist, Centre for Translational Medicine and Parasitology, University of Copenhagen

""We can now identify functionally significant inhibitory antibodies directly from individuals naturally exposed to infection. This provides a powerful way to study naturally acquired antibody responses and generate leads for our vaccine research,"" says Professor Thomas Lavstsen, Centre for Translational Medicine and Parasitology, University of Copenhagen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Radio waves offer new hope for improving sense of smell","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250819/Radio-waves-offer-new-hope-for-improving-sense-of-smell.aspx","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 15:55:00 GMT","

Our sense of smell is more important than we often realize. It helps us enjoy food, detect danger like smoke or gas leaks, and even affects memory and emotion. Many people - especially after COVID-19, aging, or brain injury - suffer from a loss of smell. However, there are very few effective treatments, and those that exist often use strong scents or medicines that cause discomfort in patients.

In a study published this week in APL Bioengineering, by AIP Publishing, researchers from Hanyang University and Kwangwoon University in South Korea introduced a simple and painless way to improve our sense of smell using radio waves. Unlike traditional aroma-based therapy, which indirectly treats smell loss by exposing the patient to chemicals, radio waves can directly target the part of our brain responsible for smell, without causing pain.

The method is completely noninvasive - no surgery or chemicals needed - and safe, as it does not overheat the skin or cause discomfort.""

Yonwoong Jang, Author

In the study, the team asked volunteers with a healthy sense of smell to sit while a small radio antenna was placed near, but not touching, their forehead. For five minutes, this antenna gently sent out radio waves to reach the smell-related nerves deep in the brain. Before and after the short treatment, the authors tested how well the patient could smell very faint odors, like diluted alcohol or fruit scents, using pen-shaped odor dispensers called Sniffin' Sticks. They also recorded the patients' brain signals to see how active their smell nerves were.

The team found that their method improved subjects' sense of smell for over a week after just one treatment.

""This study represents the first time that a person's sense of smell has been improved using radio waves without any physical contact or chemicals, and the first attempt to explore radio frequency stimulation as a potential therapy for neurological conditions,"" Jang said.

The results of the current study, which focused on people with a normal sense of smell, could help professionals such as perfumers, chefs, or coffee tasters, who need to distinguish aromatic subtleties. The method could be also used to preserve or even enhance the sense of smell.

As an important next step, the team plans to conduct a similar study on individuals with olfactory dysfunction, such as anosmia (complete loss of smell) or hyposmia (reduced sense of smell).

""This will help us determine whether the treatment can truly benefit those who need it most,"" Jang said.

Zhengang Lu and Russell Epstein, from the University of Pennsylvania, led a study to explore how people maintain their sense of direction while navigating naturalistic, virtual reality cities. 

As reported in their new JNeurosci paper, the researchers collected neuroimaging data while 15 participants performed a taxi driving task in a virtual reality city. Two brain regions represented forward-facing direction as people moved around. This neural signal was consistent across variations of the city with different visual features. The signal was also consistent across different phases of the task (i.e., picking up a passenger versus driving a passenger to their drop-off location) and various locations in the city. Additional analyses suggested that these brain regions represent a broad range of facing directions by keeping track of direction relative to the north–south axis of the environment. 

According to the researchers, these findings suggest that these brain regions may serve as a neural compass. Says Epstein, ""Losing your sense of direction is something that can happen in neurodegenerative diseases, so continuing to explore the function of these two brain regions may help with early detection or monitoring progression of these diseases. We're also interested in understanding how people navigate using both visual and internal cues-this would relate to the challenges faced by people with impaired vision.""

ATLANTA (August 19, 2025) – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team will travel to Spain from Aug 22-Sept. 1 for a pair of international friendlies against the hosts. The matches will take place on Aug. 28 and 31 at Stadi Olímpic Camilo Cano in Alicante, Spain. Both games will be at 11 a.m. local / 5 a.m. ET and are open to the public with free admission.

This trip will be the final training camp and final matches before U.S. head coach Katie Schoepfer chooses the 21-player roster that will represent the USA at the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, taking place in Morocco from Oct. 17-Nov. 8.

The U-17 WNT enters the matches following its recent success at the 4 Nations Tournament in Mexico City, where the team recorded victories over Mexico and Costa Rica and tied Canada (before winning the penalty kick shootout) to secure the championship. Fourteen players who helped lift the trophy in Mexico will travel to Spain for this event, including the goal scorers in that tournament, midfielder Nyanya Touray (3) and defender Sydney Schmidt (1).

The roster consists of seven players who are entering their freshman years of college this fall; Schmidt, who will enroll at Florida State in January of 2026 and is playing for the Sporting Club Jacksonville in the USL Super League until then; and 14 club players. Two players called up currently live and play in Spain: goalkeeper Carmen O'Dea (Barcelona U-19s) and central defender Claire Kessenger (CE Europa Femenino in Barcelona).

The age cutoff to play in the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup is players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008. This roster features 18 players born in 2008, two in 2009 – forward Maddie DiMaria and defender Meila Brewer -- one in 2010 in O'Dea and midfielder Loradana Paletta, who was born in 2011.

The U.S. U-17 WNT has several professional players from the NWSL in the pool, but none of them were available for selection for this roster.

At the 2025 FIFA U-17 WWC, the USA will play in Group C and will face Ecuador (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local time) in its first match on Saturday, Oct. 18. The USA will then face China PR on Tuesday, October 21 (Noon ET / 5 p.m. local) and finish group play against Norway on Friday, October 24 (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local). All three of the USA's Group C games will be played at the Football Academy Mohammed VI (Pitch 3) in Sale, which is just outside of the capital of Rabat.

These will be the ninth and tenth international matches this year for the U.S. U-17 WNT ahead of the World Cup, continuing the focus on the U.S. Way which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship. 

International Matches – Alicante, SpainGoalkeepers (3): Peyton Trayer (Slammers FC HB Koge; Aliso Viejo, Calif.), Evan O'Steen (Florida State; Grapevine, Texas), Carmen O'Dea (FC Barcelona U-19s; Barcelona, Spain).

To succeed at the 2026 World Cup, the USMNT will need to score goals. That will likely require creating chances from the flanks. Luckily, that's an area of strength for the USMNT, largely because of Christian Pulisic. Of course, it's worth looking at the other players Mauricio Pochettino has at that position and which players might be on next summer's World Cup roster.

There's little doubt that both Pulisic and Tim Weah will be on the 2026 World Cup roster. Furthermore, virtually any projection of the startling lineup for the World Cup opener will have both players involved. After all, they combined to score the first USMNT goal at the 2022 World Cup. Plus, both figure to be in the prime of their career during the 2026 World Cup, so they are well-positioned to star for the U.S.

By next summer, any controversy over why Pulisic sat out the Gold Cup this past summer should be gone. All that matters is that he's able to stay healthy and have another productive season for AC Milan, as Pulisic has been among the top attacking players in Serie A since joining the club in 2023. 

Weah, meanwhile, is back in France after transferring to Marseille this summer. Even with a modest seven goals in 44 international appearances, Weah is an established player with the USMNT, including a goal in the 2022 World Cup. Barring something dramatic, it's hard to envision someone taking his starting spot on the national team.

With Weah and Pulisic absent during the Gold Cup, Diego Luna took full advantage of his opportunity to get onto the field. Lune endeared himself to fans in January by playing with a broken nose. He did even more during the Gold Cup, scoring three goals during the knockout stage, including a brace in the semifinals against Guatemala.

Even before his coming-out party at the Gold Cup, it was clear that Pochettino was a big fan of Luna. He has a clever first touch, a knack for finishing scoring chances, and is capable of playing on either wing or in the no. 10 position. 

Granted, overtaking Pulisic or Weah for a starting spot is hard to imagine. But Luna likely did enough during the Gold Cup to give himself an inside track on making the World Cup roster.

⚠️ WARNING ⚠️ This Diego Luna goal is not for the faint of heart. 🥵 pic.twitter.com/WEFKsAkMU2

Whether there is room for more wingers than Pulisic, Weah, and Luna on the World Cup roster remains to be seen. Pochettino might prefer to bring more depth at other positions, especially since Pulisic and Weah will likely play most of the minutes. 

However, versatile players like Yunus Musah, who can also play in a more central midfield role, or Haji Wright, who can also provide depth at striker, could make their way onto the roster and serve as a winger if needed.

Beyond that group, there are a few players on the fringe who might be worth monitoring in the months to come. Kevin Paredes has made an impact with several youth national teams. But the right winger missed most of the 2024-25 season with Wolfsburg because of an injury and is hurt again at the start of this season, so his development has been somewhat stunted. 

Griffin Yow is another option to provide depth after scoring 13 goals in the Belgian Pro League for Westerlo over the past two seasons. Cade Cowell is another young winger, although he's scored just one goal in 11 international caps.

Players like Paredes, Yow, and Cowell could all be a couple of years away from hitting their stride and being serious considerations for the national team. 

Meanwhile, 27-year-old Alejandro Zendejas is in his prime and could be a more serious candidate for the World Cup roster if Pochettino finds room for another winger. He's hit his stride with Club America in Liga MX over the last few seasons. 

However, Zendejas has struggled to translate that to the international level, scoring just once in 11 appearances for the USMNT.

As mentioned, it'll likely be Pulisic and Weah playing most of the minutes at the World Cup next summer. Even if Luna or one of the other players earns a roster spot, barring an injury, it'll be Pulisic and Weah on the field, and the U.S. will sink or swim based on how they perform. Of course, since both are World Cup veterans who have played at big European clubs, that's not such a bad thing, even if there is a steep drop-off in quality and experience among wingers other than Pulisic and Weah.

Chelsea took to the pitch for their opening Premier League match with a noticeable change to their kit that differed from what was seen during their pre-season tour. The gold FIFA Club World Cup champion badge has been repositioned on the chest.

During pre-season matches, the gold CWC badge was positioned centrally, sitting directly between the Nike Swoosh and the Chelsea club crest. However, for the official start of the Premier League season, the badge has been moved higher up on the chest, now placed centrally above the two logos.

The adjustment was not an arbitrary decision by the club. According to reports, the change was made following official instructions from Sporting iD, the manufacturer of the badges for the Premier League. The rationale for pushing the badge higher is to prevent the prominent FIFA badge from overshadowing the club's own crest, giving both elements more visual space.

Despite the intention, the new placement has stirred controversy among supporters. Many feel the higher position looks awkward or unbalanced. This discussion is often linked to the general dissatisfaction with the current circular CWC badge compared to the more traditional, and fan-favorite, shield-shaped version used in previous years, which many believe was better designed and easier to integrate into a kit's layout. Following their win in the historic first Club World Cup with the new format, Chelsea will have the badge on their kit for the next three seasons.

Arda Güler finished the FIFA Club World Cup with the highest average Impact Rating of the tournament, leading not only Real Madrid but all players across the competition with an average rating of 56.51. His overall influence highlighted how decisive he has become in big games, turning him into one of the brightest young stars in world football.But it was in his attacking rating where Güler truly stood apart. He led the entire tournament with an Impact Rating of48.64 in attacking actions—just edging out Chelsea's Cole Palmer (41.40) and his teammate Federico Valverde (41.19). This attacking dominance underpinned his overall rating and showcased his growing ability to control matches in the final third.

Real Madrid's head coach, Xabi Alonso, has been clear about his admiration for Güler's recent rise, after his man-of-the-match performance in the Club World Cup quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund. With an impressive stat line of 1 goal and 2 assists, 96% pass accuracy, and two key passes in that match alone, his influence was unmistakable.Alonso praised both his quality and potential:

(“I think he achieved it. He gave support to defense, he has good feet, and is very dangerous in that area of the field. He has things to improve, but will do so as he plays. We all must support him.”

This is more than just encouragement – it's a public statement of trust. Under Alonso, Güler's minutes are increasing, and the expectation is that he will play a key role for Real Madrid in the 2025/26 season.

A post shared by 365Scores (@365scores)

Arda Güler's breakthrough in the FIFA Club World Cup wasn't just a flash in the pan; it was a statement, a head-turning performance that included goals, assists, and midfield mastery. He earned the spotlight.

Under Xabi Alonso, Güler isn't just participating – he's shining, earning praise, and commanding a bigger role. And make no mistake – Real Madrid supporters would be thrilled to see him feature more prominently in the starting XI this season.

Perhaps the season ahead will be where Güler transforms from promising understudy to indispensable catalyst, with fans wholeheartedly backing him every step of the way.","{'href': 'https://www.365scores.com', 'title': '365Scores'}","soccer"

August 19 – Fresh off the back of the first Men's FIFA Club World Cup (CWC), football's world governing body has unveiled the format and participating clubs for the inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup 2026.  

The competition will feature three phases from October 2025 to February 2026, bringing together six continental club champions from the 2024/25 season to crown the world's premier women's club team. 

The format will be divided into different rounds, opening in October 2025 at the Wuhan Sports Centre Stadium, China, followed by Round 2 in December 2025.  

The extravaganza will culminate with the Semi-Finals, Third-Place Match, and Final taking place at a TBA venue and location from January 28 to February 1, 2026. 

Four continental champions have already secured their places in the competition –  

 

The two additional slots remain available for the CONMEBOL Libertadores Femenina 2025 winners (to be determined on October 18, 2025) and the CAF Women's Champions League 2025 winners (to be determined on November 23, 2025). 

Tournament brackets are already confirmed as AFC champions Wuhan Jiangda will host OFC champions Auckland United FC in Round 1, with the winner advancing to face the CAF champions in Round 2. 

The Round 2 victor will progress to the final phase, where they will meet the UEFA champions Arsenal in Semi-Final 1, meanwhile, Concacaf champions Gotham FC will face the CONMEBOL champions in Semi-Final 2. 

And unlike in the uproar created by the CWC, there has been no significant push-back so far by any federation to this new tournament. 

On the FIFA website, the governing body says, “The inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup 2026 promises to deliver world-class football as the planet's top women's clubs compete for the right to be called global champions.”

HOUSTON — We are less than a year away now from the 2026 FIFA World Cup coming to Houston, which means hundreds of thousands of fans pouring into the city. 

The Texas Department of Transportation is turning up the pressure on one of its projects to beautify a major Houston freeway.   TxDOT is sprucing up the gateways into downtown starting along I-69 near Hazard Street. Crews are removing drought and freeze-damaged vines, repainting walls to cover up graffiti, and replanting greenery to welcome the world to Houston.

“We're going to paint the walls a light tan with some accent colors, and then we'll also fill in the gaps with new vines where we're missing them so they can all grow up over time,” said TxDOT landscape architect Ethan Beeson.

It's part of a project that began more than 25 years ago when Houstonians asked for more green space along freeways. And with the World Cup coming, TxDOT says now is the time to bring that vision back to life.

“We want people to realize this is a great place to come visit,” Beeson said. “We also want everyone to understand Houston is a great place to live and work. We spent a lot of time over the years trying to make the freeways look as good as they can.”

TxDOT says shoulder closures will be in place in this area between Hazard and Montrose while work is underway. As a matter of fact, it's already started. The vines, however, will take years to fully grow back, but officials say the wait will be worth it.

TxDOT hopes to keep these improvements in place well beyond the World Cup for Houstonians and visitors alike to enjoy.

Things may not be going according to plan for Wrexham on the pitch at the start of the season, however, there is some exciting news off it.

Wrexham fans were disappointed with Danny Ward for his performance during the 3-2 defeat to West Brom with many fans calling for Arthur Okonkwo to be reinstated as the number one goalkeeper.

Phil Parkinson thought his side were ‘too soft' in their defending for the three goals and has demanded change ahead of their crucial next fixture at home to Sheffield Wednesday.

However, the Red Dragons are continuing to build their profile off the pitch and owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are considering a move to bring the club into the spotlight of a FIFA competition.

According to BBC Sport, Reynolds and McElhenney are set to play a big role in the UK's bid to host the 2035 FIFA Women's World Cup.

Currently, the UK is the sole bidder for the tournament and the Welsh FA are targeting two grounds to be a part of the competition.

The FAW wants one ground in the south of Wales and one in the North of Wales, with the Racecourse Ground a frontrunner.

FAW chief executive Noel Mooney has stated: “The Kop development is a significant first step and the vision for the stadium is incredible,

“What Ryan and Rob are doing is amazing. They are looking to invest in the stadium and build up the Cae Ras, which is the oldest international ground in the world, and there is a potential north star for them.

“The city and the club have a chance to bring a World Cup to north Wales. What a story that would be. What a legacy for Ryan and Rob to leave Wrexham.”

The Racecourse Ground is no stranger to international football and in fact new signings Nathan Broadhead and Kieffer Moore both scored for Wales at the stadium.

Wales beat Gibraltar at the Racecourse Ground with the duo both on target and games have been played at the home of the Red Dragons before.

The club are targeting hosting the FIFA U17 Women's European Championships next summer, if all redevelopment on the Kop Stand can be completed.

Wrexham need to be in line with FIFA guidelines on the stadium before they can host any international tournament, something that Michael Williamson is determined to make happen.","{'href': 'https://www.thewrexhaminsider.com', 'title': 'The Wrexham Insider'}","soccer"

ATLANTA (August 19, 2025) – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team will travel to Spain from Aug 22-Sept. 1 for a pair of international friendlies against the hosts. The matches will take place on Aug. 28 and 31 at Stadi Olímpic Camilo Cano in Alicante, Spain. Both games will be at 11 a.m. local / 5 a.m. ET and are open to the public with free admission.

This trip will be the final training camp and final matches before U.S. head coach Katie Schoepfer chooses the 21-player roster that will represent the USA at the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, taking place in Morocco from Oct. 17-Nov. 8.

The U-17 WNT enters the matches following its recent success at the 4 Nations Tournament in Mexico City, where the team recorded victories over Mexico and Costa Rica and tied Canada (before winning the penalty kick shootout) to secure the championship. Fourteen players who helped lift the trophy in Mexico will travel to Spain for this event, including the goal scorers in that tournament, midfielder Nyanya Touray (3) and defender Sydney Schmidt (1).

The roster consists of seven players who are entering their freshman years of college this fall; Schmidt, who will enroll at Florida State in January of 2026 and is playing for the Sporting Club Jacksonville in the USL Super League until then; and 14 club players. Two players called up currently live and play in Spain: goalkeeper Carmen O'Dea (Barcelona U-19s) and central defender Claire Kessenger (CE Europa Femenino in Barcelona).

The age cutoff to play in the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup is players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008. This roster features 18 players born in 2008, two in 2009 – forward Maddie DiMaria and defender Meila Brewer -- one in 2010 in O'Dea and midfielder Loradana Paletta, who was born in 2011.

The U.S. U-17 WNT has several professional players from the NWSL in the pool, but none of them were available for selection for this roster.

At the 2025 FIFA U-17 WWC, the USA will play in Group C and will face Ecuador (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local time) in its first match on Saturday, Oct. 18. The USA will then face China PR on Tuesday, October 21 (Noon ET / 5 p.m. local) and finish group play against Norway on Friday, October 24 (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local). All three of the USA's Group C games will be played at the Football Academy Mohammed VI (Pitch 3) in Sale, which is just outside of the capital of Rabat.

These will be the ninth and tenth international matches this year for the U.S. U-17 WNT ahead of the World Cup, continuing the focus on the U.S. Way which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

Carlo Ancelotti's makes favorable decision for Real Madrid star  originally appeared on The Sporting News

Real Madrid will play their first game of the new La Liga season against Osasuna. Los Blancos will play their first game under Xabi Alonso in the Spanish league, and it will mark the start of a new era at the club.

Despite having a new manager, Real Madrid fans can still count on former boss Carlo Ancelotti for favors or help that benefits the players.

Ancelotti left the club at the end of the 2024-25 season in May and became the head coach of the Brazilian national team. The Italian coach has already coached games with Brazil and is expected to continue during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

As the season returned this week, an international break at the start of September will pause club football for a week. Brazil will be playing in their final two World Cup qualifiers matches, which are against Chile and Bolivia.

Brazil has already qualified for the World Cup, meaning Ancelotti may use different players for the games against Chile and Bolivia. According to Brazilian news outlets, Ancelotti will not call up Real Madrid star Vinicius Jr.

GeGlobo reports that Ancelotti made the decision not to call up Vinicius Jr. for the upcoming Brazil matches due to the player facing a one-game suspension.

Vinicius Jr. would not be allowed to play the match against Chile on September 4.

On September 9, Brazil will take on Bolivia, where Vinicius Jr. would be available to play in but Ancelotti wants the Real Madrid star to rest instead.

Ancelotti will reportedly call up Eder Militao and Rodrygo for the games against Chile and Bolivia. Militao and Rodrygo would first play Real Madrid's first three games of the season against Osasuna, Real Oviedo, and Mallorca.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Fort Lauderdale is moving funds previously considered for the FIFA World Cup to its homelessness budget instead.

The city formally torpedoed a $350,000 proposal to fund events in the county around the soccer tournament, which is being held in Miami and 15 other cities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada next summer. 

It comes just weeks after a Miami-Dade commissioner asked for a halt to $46 million in county funds for the World Cup, on the back of major cuts to county services and staffing in the proposed budget for next year. 

READ MORE: Miami-Dade mayor was at World Cup party that broke up after Border agent arrived: ‘Troubling'

The shift in priorities in Broward, disclosed in an Aug. 13 memorandum from the city manager, came after Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis and other officials raised financial concerns last month.

“Personally, I don't see any gain from it when nothing's happening in Fort Lauderdale. Nothing's happening in Chase Stadium of consequence,” Trantalis said at a June 17 workshop meeting.

The only time teams will be playing in Broward County during the tournament, Trantalis said, will be for practice at Chase Stadium. The stadium, which hosts Inter Miami's games, is not large enough to accommodate World Cup matches and fans.

Alina Hudak, the CEO of the Miami-area host committee, did not respond to a request for comment.

Instead of World Cup events, the funding will be spent on one-time purchases, “including vehicles and equipment that will support City personnel in engaging directly with homeless individuals,” said Ashley Doussard, a spokesperson for Fort Lauderdale.

The FIFA host committee has struggled to solicit public funds for World Cup programs in Broward County.

At a Tourism Development Council (TDC) meeting in May, the committee requested $2.5 million from Broward County for “fan festival” watch events, advertising inclusion and exclusive events, according to its request.

Visit Lauderdale, the marketing arm for the county, recommended providing $250,000. The rest of the funding would have to be approved by county commissioners for a vote. However, the committee never followed up with the county to formally request the funds, according to Stacey Ritter, president of Visit Lauderdale.

Currently, no money has been allocated from Broward County for the FIFA World Cup, she said — not even the quarter of a million dollars from Visit Lauderdale. “They didn't want it,” Ritter said. “They want more.”","{'href': 'https://www.wlrn.org', 'title': 'WLRN'}","soccer"

The Newcastle striker is considered the Reds' dream signing, but scoring goals is the least of their worries right now

The build-up to Newcastle's Premier League meeting with Liverpool on Monday is obviously going to be dominated by Alexander Isak. A striker in every sense, Isak is the protagonist of the most-discussed transfer saga of the summer so far - and we still don't have any idea how it's going to end.

All we can say for sure right now is that Isak's absence is hurting Newcastle. Eddie Howe's team bossed their season-opener at Aston Villa on Saturday - even before their hosts were reduced to 10 men - but lacked a cutting edge, which was hardly surprising given they had to play a winger, Anthony Gordon, up front.

Newcastle are working hard trying to strengthen their attack before the window closes - they wanted another centre-forward even before Isak decided to down tools to try to force through a move to Liverpool - but it's telling that Howe hasn't been overly critical of the Swede's conduct, at least not in public.

The manager is clearly still hoping that he can rebuild the bridges that Isak has burned on Tyneside - because he knows full well that Newcastle need Isak. Do Liverpool, though? Because the evening before Newcastle were held to a scoreless draw at Villa, the Reds were involved in a thrilling encounter with Bournemouth at Anfield that suggested that scoring goals should be the least of Arne Slot's worries right now...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Red Devils have taken a huge step forward under the Portuguese despite losing their Premier League opener against Arsenal

“We prove today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal,” Ruben Amorim told reporters after Manchester United's frustrating 1-0 defeat to the Gunners at Old Trafford. “We were the better team. It's our feeling that we played better. In the end, we lose the game, but I'm really proud of the effort they put in.”

This was not Amorim's best impression of his delusional predecessor Erik ten Hag, who consistently claimed his disjointed team were making progress after every damaging setback. United were genuinely much-improved on Sunday, and completely outplayed a very strong Arsenal side that finished second in the table last season.

The statistics back up Amorim, as the hosts enjoyed 61 per cent of possession while racking up 22 shots compared to Arsenal's nine. It was also telling that the Player of the Match award went to Gunners goalkeeper David Raya, who was forced to make seven saves, including a superb fingertip reaction to deny United's new No.10 Matheus Cunha. United were dynamic, direct and disciplined, and had it not been for the inexplicable Altay Bayindir error that gifted Riccardo Calafiori an early goal, the final result would likely have been positive.

""You always feel in the game they can do something not just with the ball but without the ball. We need to win games but that was completely different to last season,"" Amorim added, which was also true.

There will be no repeat of last season's disastrous 15th-placed finish because United are finally a cohesive unit. The goals and wins will start flowing if they can keep up the same level of performance, and Champions League qualification must be the ultimate goal, regardless of whether part-owners INEOS sanction any further signings before the summer transfer window slams shut.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The ATP Tour has witnessed many iconic players retire from tennis in very recent times, one of whom was Andy Murray.

Murray called time on his phenomenal career after the Olympics last summer, having won 46 titles on the ATP Tour.

That includes three Grand Slam titles, with the Scot having also reached number one in the world rankings.

His fellow legend Rafael Nadal also set down his racket last season, while fellow icon Diego Schwartzman retired from tennis earlier in 2025.

Joining him this season have been the likes of veteran players Richard Gasquet, Fabio Fognini and Fernando Verdasco among others.

And they have now been joined in retirement by Kyle Edmund, who has decided to call time on his career aged just 30.

He shared an emotional post on Instagram to announce his decision, with his fellow Briton Murray quick to reply.

READ MORE: Andy Murray says if he'll ever take another job as a tennis coach again after splitting with Novak Djokovic

The Scot, who like Edmund was once the British number one player, left the comment: “Great stuff Kedders!”

The 30-year-old retires with two ATP Tour titles to his name, having reached a career-high ranking of world number 14.

A post shared by LTA (@lta)

Edmund has since slipped to 420th in the world rankings, but injuries have played a major role in his decline.

And unfortunately they have now also led to his retirement from the sport, in which he turned pro back in 2012.

He met Murray four times during his career, with the Scot winning on three occasions and losing on the other.

Edmund has certainly left a positive mark on the game, as proven by further warm messages he's received since retiring.

Laura Robson wrote: “Happy retirement kedders! Just the beginning,” with her fellow WTA icon Caroline Garcia noting: “Congrats on an amazing effort.”

Heather Watson added: “We love you Ked! You are the best,” while Neal Skupski said: “All the best for the future. Enjoyed sharing the court with you! Can get yourself to Anfield more now.”

Along with his two career titles, which arrived at Antwerp and New York in 2018 and 2020 respectively, Edmund lost the 2018 Marrekech final.

He leaves tennis with 119 wins and 125 losses, with $6,073,157 earned in prize money from singles and doubles.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Tennis

Seven million people have watched 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic dancing to “Uptown Funk” by Bruno Mars. Almost 11 million have followed rising star Ben Shelton behind the curtain of a commercial shoot. And millions more will watch Carlos Alcaraz doing just about anything — all on their phone screens.

The stars of men's tennis are already giving their fans windows into their careers on TikTok, and the ATP Tour has now signed a strategic content partnership with the social media giant. Players will receive guidance on how to get maximum engagement, while some will collaborate with established tennis creators on the platform. The tour's account, which has just under 600,000 followers, will also be bolstered.

With just 20 of the ATP top 100 on the platform, the tour intends for more of its players to receive the exposure to casual fans that TikTok can bring. Tennis' most dedicated fans know the intricacies of the sport from top to bottom, but for people who love a Grand Slam but don't know what a 250-level event is, the sport's fragmented media landscape and limited embrace of stepping stones into its lore have acted as a barrier to entry.

“Tennis culture is really having this extended moment,” said Kat Marquez, TikTok's lead, North America sports league partnerships, in a video interview on Monday.

“Whether it's the fashion associated with it or some of the food elements, there are so many beautiful points that add a unique richness to the sport that I think are uniquely highlighted on TikTok.”

Andrew Walker, the ATP's senior vice president of brand and marketing, said in a video interview that “a lot of research shows there's a significant portion of casual tennis fans who we have an opportunity to do a better job of connecting with.

“Many of those tennis fans are in the Gen Z or millennial age brackets. So a platform like TikTok gives us an opportunity,” he said.

The partnership follows a similar one with Overtime, the sports media company aimed at Gen Z and Millennial fans. Its interviews have become a fixture on the circuit, asking tennis stars offbeat questions that get them out of their comfort zone. But the question that hangs over this partnership is the same one that looms over tennis' relationship with TikTok — and social media — at large: Can a sport as precious about media rights and highlights as tennis fully embrace the irreverent visual language and spirit of remixing and remaking that makes its output so compelling?

Tennis has embraced TikTok as the platform has grown, with a 30 percent increase in the performance of content related to the sport in 2025. The ATP has recently leaned into some of its vernacular, casting Flavio Cobolli, the rising Italian talent, as “admin” in videos on other platforms. The mythical “admin” is the person who runs an account, and the videos see Cobolli cajoling his fellow stars into being on camera, or just logging on for duty.

But tennis still lags behind sports such as golf and soccer, with 1.8 million tagged videos compared to 7.1 million and 16.2 million. And even more fundamentally, tennis is yet to fully figure out how to mesh a long-form sport, whose momentum and match action cannot be encapsulated by 30 seconds, with the way the platform thrives on user-generated content (UGC) and remixing.

The best tennis TikToks, of which the U.S. Open's account is one, make tennis fit the forms of the platform, rather than the other way around.

And for now, the biggest TikTok stars in the sport are WTA Tour players — world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and world No. 3 Coco Gauff. They embrace the platform, posting dances and offbeat monologues to camera and participating in trends. After Sabalenka at first failed to fully credit Gauff for beating her at the French Open in June, they buried the hatchet with a dance at Wimbledon.

The ATP started conversations over a formal partnership a few months ago with TikTok executives in Italy — such a hotbed for tennis currently and the host for the ATP Finals in November, the men's tour's flagship event. One of the appeals for tennis and for TikTok is the almost-yearlong global season, which offers the possibility to construct narratives and storylines — lore — around players and rivalries over an extended period.

The Overtime partnership, which has seen 60 million views since February, is bringing in an audience mostly composed of people under 35. The ATP wants to continue this trend on TikTok, showing off the players' personalities to drive interest in the tour. At this year's Tour Finals, creators from the eight nations where the Masters 1,000 events (the rung below the Grand Slams and the biggest ATP tournaments) are held will join the players to make videos.

Both organizations think the partnership will lead to a greater engagement of the casual fan, who might not need to know every result, but is interested in tennis' wider cultural footprint. When the U.S. Open gets underway this week, users will get a combination of official highlights, jokey videos like the Djokovic one, and behind-the-scenes content like Shelton's commercial.

The ATP has produced irreverent content before, like the hit video featuring Djokovic, Alcaraz and Andy Murray that portrayed the tennis circuit as a scripted reality show, and Walker is confident that it can do so again. But the sport as a whole, especially when it comes to rights to match footage, is still limited. Tournaments and the tours can post footage and remix it, but some events do not let individual players post footage of their own matches due to media contracts.



Another wrinkle is the absence of the WTA Tour. Marquez said TikTok was and is open to a partnership with the WTA, which did not comment on the possibility. Walker said discussions remain ongoing over a possible commercial merger between the ATP and WTA Tours, which the WTA confirmed.

Ultimately, this partnership is the latest example of tennis attempting to capture a younger audience, as well as fans who might recognize Djokovic and Alcaraz as general sports or TikTok stars first, and learn about the intricacies of their tennis prowess second. While the long-parroted view that the average tennis viewer is in their 60s has some basis in reality on traditional television, it is also a simplistic view of how and why tennis needs to evolve its viewership. It is not just about age, but about the balance between the level of knowledge of the sport and the ease of beginning to understand it.

In a news release to be issued Tuesday, Rollo Goldstaub, TikTok's global head of sports partnerships, said that Alcaraz, Shelton, Djokovic and others are “connecting with growing fan bases by showing their real personalities in captivating content that has turned the sport into a cultural phenomenon that blends competition with entertainment.”

He added that the new partnership “encourages more players to share their stories, further igniting tennis' cultural movement on TikTok.”

Where this leads to will become apparent in the coming years. There is no doubt that TikTok loves tennis, but the sport is still on its way to embracing some of the chaos that makes it such a compelling introduction to a sport more familiar with order.

On Monday, the former British no. 1 and world no. 14 Kyle Edmund announced his retirement from tennis at 30. The 2018 Australian Open semi-finalist and one of the most prominent players born in 1995 decided to end his tennis journey following various injuries and setbacks.

The Johannesburg native leaves our sport with two ATP titles, numerous notable victories, the Davis Cup trophy and that brilliant run in Melbourne that highlighted his full potential.

Despite his efforts to extend his run, Kyle's career trajectory was derailed by a series of injuries. He underwent three left knee surgeries in November 2020, March 2021 and May 2022 and never fully recovered.

Alongside that main injury, the Briton's career was affected by wrist, abdomen, hip and foot issues. Passionate about our sport, Kyle kept coming back despite notable breaks and almost two years off the court between 2020 and 2022.

He even reached the final of the Nottingham 3 Challenger on grass this July. However, Edmund acknowledged he was no longer able to return to his previous level that made him a top-15 player at a young age.

Kyle competed at professional events between 2011 and 2025. He had a breakthrough run in 2016, collecting 21 ATP wins and competing at the Olympic Games in Rio.

He spent an entire 2017 season on the ATP level and gathered 30 victories for a boost ahead of his career-best year. Edmund reached the Australian Open semi-final in January 2018 and lifted his first ATP title in Antwerp en route to the top-15. 

The results were not that good in 2019, and the Briton changed that in February 2020, besting Andreas Seppi in New York for his second and last ATP title.He took a set away from Novak Djokovic at the US Open before missing almost two years!

The Briton embraced those knee surgeries and never returned to his previous level. He returned in the summer of 2022 and earned two ATP wins. Kyle was 0-7 on the ATP level in 2023, returning to Futures for the first time in years.

He combined Futures and Challengers in 2024, improving his ranking position but still standing away from the top-300. Kyle embraced five Futures since April this year before entering home grass-court Challengers.

He reached the final in Nottingham but still decided to end his career a month later. Edmund leaves the sport with gratitude for his journey, preparing for the next chapter of his life away from beloved tennis courts.

NWSL

When Trinity Rodman thundered in that stoppage-time winner for the Washington Spirit against the Portland Thorns in the NWSL on Aug. 3, it was a comeback goal celebrated throughout the 16,000-strong crowd at Audi Field. A small corner of Wimbledon, south London, also rejoiced in that moment.

The U.S. women's national team forward made a successful return to football after a four-month absence due to a back injury she says might never fully heal. After her volley earned the Spirit a 2-1 victory, the 23-year-old was overcome with emotion, having thought she might not get to experience that feeling again.

“That was just the hardest thing I've had to go through, injury and everything,” Rodman told ESPN. “Being back, and being at the home stadium with the crowd behind me, scoring a goal like that — you saw I buried that. I wasn't going to miss it.”

Thousands of miles away at Goals Wimbledon, a soccer centre that rents out five-a-side pitches for personal use, they feel like a small but proud part of Rodman's comeback trail.

At the end of June, Rodman, an Olympic champion in France last summer, was in England supporting her boyfriend, No. 6 world-ranked professional tennis player Ben Shelton, as he reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon. Fresh from being the face of Adidas' advertising campaign for the F50 Sparkfusion women's football boots, Rodman walked up to the Goals reception desk and asked manager Barry Horsnell if she could hire one of its (artificial turf) pitches.

Horsnell didn't know who this person was at first, but sensed she was famous. Her American accent, along with the fact she had turned up with a coach — Josh Angulo, the Spirit's team chiropractor, who was accompanying her in Europe — piqued his interest.

“I'm nosy, so I'll just ask (people) questions,” Horsnell tells The Athletic. “She said she was here for the tennis, with her other half playing at Wimbledon.

“I said: ‘I really want to pretend that I know who you are, but I don't'. She just laughed and was so nice about it.”

Rodman began training on pitch No. 11 — a seven-a-side field at the far end of the facility called Estadio Centenario, after the national stadium of Uruguay. As she ran through drills for an hour and a half, back in the office, Horsnell typed Rodman's name into Google and was blown away by her level of stardom. Rodman rented the pitch that day for £6 (just over $8) per hour per person. It would be the last time she would have to do so.

Horsnell refused to charge them on later visits but did ask one thing in return — if fans spotted Rodman training on his pitches, which sit next to a golf driving range and a motorcycle-riding school, would she be OK with posing for photographs with them? Rodman kindly agreed, and it wasn't long before locals spotted her being put through her paces and finding the top corner on repeat during shooting practice.

Sisters Sophie and Emily Day train at the centre. Sophie is 13 and plays as a centre-back for Brighton & Hove Albion's academy, a 90-minute drive to the south, and Emily, 10, is in west London club Chelsea's youth pathway.

“There are so many good female role models for girls, and so much more opportunity now as well,” their father, Richard, says, after finding out Rodman trained here. “Opportunities which just didn't exist. And when you listen to the players that are coming towards the ends of their careers, the opportunities they're seeing for girls that are going into the game versus what they had – but they've paved the way for it.”

The clientele of Goals Wimbledon are accustomed to celebrity visitors. Nigel James, father of England and Chelsea stars Lauren and Reece James, runs his youth academy from there, with plenty of appearances from his daughter and son over the years.

“There was a girl training with Nigel James Elite Coaching; she was doing a one-to-one session with a coach. I watched Trinity walk out and I thought: ‘I wonder if she'll recognise her',” Horsnell says. “As soon as Trinity walked out, you could just see this girl's eyes light up. She knew straight away who Trinity was, and she couldn't concentrate on her own football for the next 10 minutes.”

But like Horsnell on her first arrival, not everybody recognised Rodman.

Every few minutes, trains speed by behind the center's pitches, running back and forth from the suburbs of New Malden and Raynes Park in the direction of central London's Waterloo station or towns southwest of the city, such as Richmond.

“There were hundreds of people going past, and they wouldn't have realised who was training on that pitch. There were people playing on the other pitches as she walked past that wouldn't have known who she was either,” Horsnell says. “It's mad, isn't it?”

Rodman was in London as Shelton, 22, was defeated by eventual Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals. A month before that, she had been in Paris watching as he reached the fourth round of the French Open, where he was also defeated by the eventual champion, Carlos Alcaraz.

As Shelton won the Canadian Open just over a week ago, Rodman, now back with the Spirit and building up her minutes, watched on television as her partner won his first ATP Masters 1000 title. And before the U.S. Open, which starts in New York this week, she paid a visit to the Cincinnati Masters to watch him win his opening match against Camilo Ugo Carabelli.

Back in Wimbledon, they are still marvelling at the fact that Rodman trained there. Feeling inspired by her visit and England's Lionesses winning a second straight European Championship in Switzerland last month, Horsnell and his colleagues are excited about watching the center's new women's five-a-side league go from strength to strength.

“Even though we only met her a few times over that couple of weeks, it's mad to see her scoring that last-minute goal and feeling more emotionally connected to it than we might have otherwise been,” he says. “You'd be happy for anyone scoring a last-minute goal, but we know what it means to her and are happy we could help play a small part.”

“There was no air of arrogance, and her celebration for that goal was the same. It was so humble, she was just so happy to score it — and that is exactly how she came across. I know now how big a star she is in America and in women's football, but each day that I met her, she was just so normal.”

Horsnell came out of it all with a Rodman-autographed football for his 11-year-old niece.

“I showed her the ball and she didn't know who had signed it. Then I showed her the photo on my phone and she was like, ‘Oh my god! That's Trinity Rodman!'”

Rodman will not be forgotten soon around these parts.

An illness caused top-ranked men's player Jannik Sinner to retire from the Cincinnati Open final against his rival Carlos Alcaraz on Monday after just 23 minutes of tennis. 

He was expected to then travel to New York and play alongside 11-time Grand Slam doubles champion Katerina Siniakova — most recently in the 2025 Wimbledon mixed doubles — in the first round of the new-look 2025 U.S. Open mixed doubles.

With less than five hours to go to his match's 3:00 pm ET start time, Sinner officially backed out. Alcaraz, meanwhile, still plans to play alongside his partner, Emma Raducanu.

Americans Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison were named as Sinner's and Siniakova's replacements and will face Belinda Bencic and Alexander Zverev instead.

Eurosport confirmed that Sinner was battling a 100.4 degree Fahrenheit fever entering Monday's final — the combined high temperatures in Cincinnati certainly didn't help.

After retiring, the Italian profusely apologized to the fans in attendance. ""I'm super sorry to disappoint you. From yesterday, I didn't feel great. I thought I would improve, but it came up worse,"" Sinner said in his post-match interview.



""I tried to come out, to make it at least a small match, but I couldn't handle more....I am very sorry for all of you. I know that maybe some of you, on a Monday, you had to work or do something else, so I'm really sorry.""

Sinner, a four-time Grand Slam champion in singles before the age of 23, doesn't quite boast the same resume in doubles. He owns a 3-2 doubles record in the Davis Cup and has one ATP 250 title: the 2021 Atlanta Open with doubles-specialist Reilly Opelka (playing the 2025 US Open with Venus Williams).

Siniakova, meanwhile, is one of the most accomplished doubles players of her generation. The Czech 29-year-old has 10 Grand Slam women's doubles wins and expanded her portfolio to mixed doubles in the last year, winning both the 2024 Olympic gold and Wimbledon in 2025.

Collins, one of the replacements, has career-best rankings of No. 7 in singles and No. 79 in doubles. She reached the 2022 Wimbledon women's doubles semifinals.

DON'T MISS: 

Harrison, her partner, is a much more accomplished doubles player. He reached the semifinals at the 2025 French Open and owns two ATP Tour doubles titles. His best results in mixed doubles came at the 2018 U.S. Open, when he also reached the semifinals.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner's Rivalry Truly Began at the U.S. Open","https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/sporting/a65278354/carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinners-us-open-changeover-excerpt/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 11:01:20 GMT","

In this excerpt from his new book Changeover, writer Giri Nathan recalls the very first time Alcaraz and Sinner played each other at the U.S. Open.

I had spent 10 hot, depleting days covering the 2022 U.S.Open, so I made a bad decision. Each morning I'd left my apartment in Brooklyn, taken the subway to Queens, and shuffled down the boardwalk to the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. There I'd spent the next 12 hours hopping from court to court, occasionally ducking indoors to ask a player a question or refill my water bottle, absorbing as much of the tennis from as close a vantage point as I could. After the matches were over, I'd taken the subway home, stayed up until five a.m. tapping out a dispatch, and repeated the cycle. It sounds pathetic to be complaining about the weather when I was not the one swinging a racquet on court, but rather the one seated nearby scrawling in a notebook—and it is a bit pathetic—but by the second week I'd tired of navigating the sweaty throngs, of lurching awake from a sun-induced micro-nap in the stands. So on this particular evening of September 7, at roughly eight thirty p.m., with one men's quarterfinal still to come, I decided I'd watch from the comfort of my own sofa.

That was how I managed to miss out on the match between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, and with it, a chance to peer into an ecstatic future. There was Alcaraz, happy eyes sunk deep under a heavy brow, his body twitchy and muscled like a sprinter. There was Sinner, thin and laconic, pale as marble, flame-red curls trapped under a hat. I knew they were good but hadn't realized they could do this. I streamed the opening rallies on my phone, sitting on the 7 train, and knew in my gut I'd made a dire error. When I got home, I watched them fight until 2:50 a.m., still stabbing words of bafflement into my notebook as the match ended. Besides sleep, what could you do well, or do at all, for five hours and 15 minutes? How about the opposite of sleep: intermittent sprinting in every direction, batting a small projectile at 125 mph, tracking a projectile coming at you at 125 mph, making constant risk-reward calculations, clean emotional resets, energy and pain management decisions.

All this was done in solitude. When Alcaraz once looked in desperation to his coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, after flubbing a pivotal point, he received a chilly half smile in return. He was then 19 years old and Sinner was 21. At ages when many people can't be trusted with basic self-preservation, these two produced tennis of the highest caliber, rallies so charismatic and coruscating that no other pair of players on tour could have replicated them. I saw Alcaraz leap midair to swat a shot behind-the-back, finding a solution where none existed. I saw Sinner strike the hardest backhands in the world, arrive within a single point of victory, and let his chance slip away. Alcaraz prevailed and went on to win the whole Open.

Reality got lazy with its metaphors: My pen ran out of ink. I'd gotten it only a month earlier. But it was forced to document every highlight, tactic, scoreline, atmospheric detail, and cathartic expletive for these five sets, and even then it caught only a fraction. The pen surrendered its innards and sputtered into retirement. I couldn't blame it. I was tempted to do the same—close my eyes, cross my arms like a mummy, and rest forever—after witnessing what Alcaraz and Sinner had accomplished in that same time span. I no longer feared the future, just my obsolescence in it. It was a smothering counterexample to anyone fussing about what tennis could even be after the old gods faded away. New gods take their place.

Trapped in the heat of that match, I saw only what Alcaraz and Sinner had in common, but in the following months I came to see just how vividly they diverged. The former ran hot and the latter lived in permafrost. One craved a crowd and the other sought privacy. With a racquet, Carlos chased sudden novelty, while Jannik aspired to calm regularity. Tennis was a passion for Carlos and a religion for Jannik, as the writer Owen Lewis put it to me. Like all the richest rivalries before them, each prodigy possessed some virtue absent in the other one; somehow each one appeared to be the antidote to the other's style of play. I detected more and more of these contrasts with every match and every passing season, as they chased not just historical records, but one another.

That 2022 U.S. Open quarterfinal was good enough to generate its own 45-minute highlight reel, which I watch from time to time. They should screen it in movie theaters. It was a vision from some sharp and fearsome new era that our eyes had not yet adjusted to. Now, at the start of 2025, I can see it more clearly. And I have written Changeover to document that new era in its earliest phase, as a primer for the tennis fans who either missed it firsthand or simply want to relive it someday.

As my penance for missing that battle, the inception of a great rivalry, I am giving you this whole book. This time my pen won't run out.

Iga Swiatek asked a camera operator to stop filming her during her Cincinnati Open semi-final match against Elena Rybakina. Despite the minor distraction, Swiatek went on to secure a comfortable victory in just over an hour and 38 minutes, earning her place in the final against Jasmine Paolini.

Swiatek had to dig deep in the first set, securing a 7-5 win that put her one step closer to the final. The 24-year-old then sealed the deal with a 6-3 victory in the second set, in her quest for the top spot at the WTA 1000 event.

Throughout the match, Swiatek remained composed, even when asking a camera operator to stop filming her at the end of the first set. The camera had this year's Wimbledon champion to her bench to capture her reactions after the intense set.

However, after letting out a sigh of relief and taking off her cap, Swiatek gestured to the camera operator, indicating that she didn't want to be filmed while preparing to change her outfit. A quick wag of her finger emphasised her point.

The camera cut away as Swiatek prepared to change her top, a common practice among players between sets to stay comfortable. This brief interaction didn't affect the eventual winner's focus, and she went on to reach her first Cincinnati final, reports the Express.

Following her victory, Swiatek said: ""At the beginning, the level was pretty crazy. We played so fast that sometimes we couldn't run to the second ball.

""I was there to play with intensity and good quality. I'm super happy with the performance.

""Anyone in the final is going to be super tough, so I have to think tactically. I will focus on myself and do what I've been doing, because for sure I feel like there's been progress at this tournament.

""I just want to continue that, no matter what the result is. I feel the love here, it's a great place to be.

""People of Cincinnati are so nice, everywhere we go, even though we're here to play, we feel like we can have peace and just relax when off the court. So thank you guys for coming out, rooting for us and see you tomorrow.""#

Swiatek was able to clinch her first-ever win at the Cincinnati Open on Monday following a thrilling final with Paolini. In that fixture, she took the opening game 7-5, before clinching the title with a 6-4 win in the second.

Chelmsford's Mayr Brown-Devall lifted silverware on the manicured lawns of Wimbledon last week in what was an unforgettable experience at SW19.

Brown-Devall, 13, who attends Brentwood School and lives in Chelmsford, featured in the national finals at Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, which is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition and is delivered by Vodafone in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club.

Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week.

Brown-Devall, who described Ben Shelton as his tennis icon, soared to victory in the boys' U14 singles event to clinch the crown at one of the world's most iconic sporting venues.

He said: ""It's so good I just couldn't believe it when I won.

""It's very emotional because I wasn't expecting it when I can here at the start of the week. I didn't know anyone and didn't know what to expect.

""When I won my first match, I was really proud because I typically haven't played that well on grass before.

""To have my family here watching is really nice and this has only just inspired me to become professional one day and play on centre court.""

This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 – 9 August 2025, with Brown-Devall representing Writtle Tennis Club.

The competition aims to broaden playing opportunities and to inspire people of all ages and abilities to play tennis and follow in the footsteps of their tennis heroes by competing for a chance to play on Wimbledon's iconic courts.

In addition to 14 and under singles, 18 and under doubles and adult doubles draws, the categories include wheelchair (adult and juniors), learning disability and visually impaired competitions. The national finals will also see the return of popular para-standing and deaf tennis exhibition matches held during the week.

World No.1 wheelchair doubles partners and Vodafone ambassadors Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid were in attendance to cheer on the youngsters at SW19 and offer his experience and advice.

“We would have loved to have had something like this when we were younger and playing'” said Hewett.

“Play your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while.

“It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.”

Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport.

“This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.”

Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition. It is delivered by Vodafone, in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club, forming part of Vodafone's ongoing commitment to supporting grassroots tennis in the UK and making the sport more accessible for players of all ages and abilities.","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'uk.sports.yahoo.com'}","tennis"

U.S. Open

Begins

LIVE

5m ago

The Athletic has live coverage of the U.S. Open tennis tournament with the new mixed doubles format.

All the way from Cincinnati, Iga Świątek sent a message to the U.S. Open field Monday night — watch out.

Świątek, one tournament removed from her stunning Wimbledon title, won the most important U.S. Open tuneup by beating Jasmine Paolini 7-5, 6-4 in the final of the Cincinnati Open. She is back to No. 2 in the rankings. She is within shouting distance of world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

She is coming for the top of tennis — again.

On a steamy evening in Mason, Ohio Świątek's effort wasn't flawless. But give Paolini credit for that. The Italian came back to break Świątek when she first served for the opening set. She broke her twice in the second set, when Świątek surged to the early leads that usually result in lopsided sets.

But every time it looked like Paolini might grab an edge, Świątek clamped down to win her first title on a hard court since March of 2024, in Indian Wells, Calif. This win, coupled with the win in London on grass, makes Świątek the arguable favorite to win the year's final Grand Slam in New York.

— Cincinnati Open (@CincyTennis) August 19, 2025



She won the U.S. Open in 2022, a triumph that came during her most dominant period of her career, which included 125 weeks as world No. 1 But Świątek lost the top ranking last year, and failed to win a title between the French Open in 2024 and Wimbledon this year. She appeared lost at times, even on the red clay where she has dominated for most of the last five years. Since then, she has played with a revitalized patience and more variety, and the results have been nearly flawless. She has lost just two matches in the last two months while winning 18. She has made the finals of three of the four tournaments she has entered, winning two of them.

Paolini had Świątek on the ropes early, surging to a 3-0 lead. But Świątek won the next five games and looked like she would seal the set quickly. Paolini had other ideas, out-rallying her the next two games to knot the opener at 5 games each. But Świątek used her speed and agility to showcase her stellar defense to get the lead back in the next game, then cracked two big serves to seal it.

Paolini kept rising, but as happens so often, Świątek proved too relentless, pushing Paolini deep for a backhand miss to gain match point, then ending the night with an ace. She slammed her racket to the ground, looked at her box and pointed at her head as she pumped her fists. Then she was jumping around the court for joy, her 24th title in the bag. It was also her 11th WTA 1000 title, the level just below a Grand Slam. She has six of those.

No rest for the weary, though. Świątek was scheduled to board a flight and play in the U.S. Open mixed doubles with Casper Ruud on Tuesday afternoon in New York. And early next week, she will begin her quest for a seventh Grand Slam.

Watch out.

Brian Vahaly doesn't know his life without tennis. After first picking up a racket at the age of 2, Vahaly was a star athlete from 1997 to 2001 at the University of Virginia, where he was a three-time All-American, reached the NCAA singles final and graduated with a double major in finance and business management. During his seven-year pro career, he reached a career-high ranking of World No. 64 and earned victories over his childhood hero Michael Chang and former World No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero.

But Vahaly has perhaps made the biggest impact off the court. In 2017, a decade after retiring due to a rotator cuff injury, he became the first current or former ATP Tour player to come out as gay. Last November, he was elected for a two-year term as the chairman of the board and president of the United States Tennis Association, joining Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova as highly visible LGBTQ sports figures.

A self-described “very private person,” Vahaly said he had made peace with the fact that he was never going to come out publicly, despite being open about his sexuality with his family and friends. But six months after he and his partner, Bill Jones, became parents to twin boys via surrogacy, Vahaly had a change of heart.

“You're just looking at them and thinking about the life you want to build for them, and your priorities shift. It's not about you anymore,” Vahaly, 46, told NBC News. “Suddenly, I felt this overwhelming sense of responsibility not only to my kids, but almost to the younger version of myself who had nobody to look to and often felt lonely and isolated.”

Vahaly said he knew that coming out on a Sports Illustrated podcast would elicit a strong reaction from a sporting community that has the reputation of being largely white, straight and conservative. While his announcement was met with some support — multiple top players, including Roger Federer, said an openly queer player would be “totally accepted” in the men's locker room — Vahaly recalled receiving thousands of hateful messages about his young family.

“There was a lot of feedback I received about raising kids into this world, having kids without a mother,” Vahaly said. “I was disappointed to receive all of that, but I was very well-prepared.” 

Reaching that place of self-acceptance was a lengthy process for Vahaly, who had developed a knack for compartmentalization as a pro athlete. “Unfortunately, what was a great tennis asset was not a great personal-life asset. As feelings hit my mind, anything that felt not beneficial to my career was quickly compartmentalized and pushed to the side,” he said. As a result, he said, he can't quite pinpoint when he realized he was gay.

Having grown up in a religious and conservative household in New Jersey and then having immersed himself in a locker room culture where homophobic remarks were a common way “to build camaraderie,” Vahaly admitted that he had developed a lot of internalized homophobia. “Back in those days, if I thought about a gay bar and what it meant to be gay, and I would see those people publicly, I thought to myself, ‘That is not me. I have nothing in common with that group.'”

It wasn't until his mid-20s that Vahaly, with the help of his longtime sports psychologist, began to come to terms with his sexuality. Part of that emotional work included unpacking his experience of undergoing so-called conversion therapy at a church, where he was told repeatedly that his attraction to men was a kind of “horrible defect” that could be cured by God. In retrospect, Vahaly said, he wasted years trying to change an immutable part of himself.

In his second act, Vahaly has held senior executive positions at Washington, D.C.-based venture capital and investment management firms. But about five years after stepping away from tennis, he was asked to serve on the USTA's board. “As I was learning who I was, I didn't feel like tennis was a safe space for me, so I said no. Fortunately, the guy who was recruiting me knew me quite well and knew how to tap into my competitive side,” Vahaly recalled with a laugh.

“When you don't see people before you as a potential role model, it's hard to know, as a gay athlete and man, whether the organization — or a sport more broadly — would be comfortable with you in a leadership position,” he added. “When I came on, I was very guarded. Most board members for me were significantly older, often talking to me about their daughters. I just played it quiet and focused on where I thought I could make an impact, which was really on the player development side of the house.”

Women's tennis has historically had many openly gay players — including King, Navratilova and most recently Russian-born Australian Daria Kasatkina. But only one men's player has followed in Vahaly's footsteps: Brazil's Joao Lucas Reis da Silva, who reached a career high of No. 234 last month.

While there is now greater cultural acceptance of the LGBTQ community, Vahaly pointed out there are still a number of factors preventing male players — like his younger self — from wanting to come out, including the potential financial fallout from sponsors and the reality that the tour still travels to countries where being gay is neither legal nor accepted.

“The new generation thinks about inclusion and about being themselves so differently than my generation, so I'm hopeful that [homophobic] language starts to fall away a little bit, that people in our community feel accepted into sport,” he said. “Once we start to build the numbers, you'll start to see those athletes making it up to the pro tour.”

Now, as an LGBTQ leader in sports, Vahaly still faces some casual homophobia. “There are still rooms where my profile is shared, but they leave out the fact that I'm gay or I'm a dad,” he said. But, “sometimes, shouting from the rooftops your beliefs or being really firm and in your face is not the right approach.”

“Those are tough rooms, sometimes, when people aren't used to seeing a gay family, but I think humanizing people in our community is actually what drives us forward,” he continued. “I'm not trying to push something down anybody's throat. I'm simply trying to show how and why we're actually not that different. I think that allows the space for people to be open to diversity and inclusion.”

Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has targeted diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and rolled back legal protections for LGBTQ people, particularly those who are transgender. In response to the current political climate, Vahaly said he is “less” focused on “what's happening around us” and more focused on how he can use the U.S. Open to amplify the work of LGBTQ organizations such as The Trevor Project, Athlete Ally, You Can Play and the Gay and Lesbian Tennis Alliance. (The Grand Slam will host its fifth annual Open Pride day on Aug. 28.)

“I think about what I can do and what I can control,” Vahaly said. “What I can do is be honest about myself and take part in interviews like this to continue to show and demonstrate to the world the diversity that exists within our sport and that they should feel welcome. I want people to know and see that this is a safe place for them.”

Updates from the opening day action at Flushing Meadows

Get in touch! You can mail Daniel here

Brilliant net-coverage from Vavassori earns a chance to break back immediately at 30-4,0 and when Rublev nets, he and Errani have it. They've by far the most at stake here: this is their bread and butter, the money is much bigger for them, and they're repping for dubs specialists. They're level with Muchova/Rublev at 1-1 in the first.

On Ashe, McNally/Musetti and Swiatek/Ruud are out and knocking up.

We're away again on Armstrong, Rublev raising break point with an overhead then returning hard; Errani moves out of the road but the ball is good, so he and Muchova lead the champs 1-0 with a break.

On Armstrong, Errani/Vavassori and Muchova/Rublev are back with us. This should be a really fun contest.

Swiatek says she's played Ruud in the United Cup so has a good idea of where to be on the court; Ruud notes that Swiatek is on the winning train and he's just jumping on. They'll now share notes on McNally and Musetti, the match due on court in a matter of minutes.

The winners look a good team and meet McNally/Musetti shortly.

Rublev says he doesn't know what he's doing, he's just trying to serve well. Muchova, though, is a good doubles player with the dexterity and power to become an even better one. They're second-favourites for their quarter and rightly so, but they'll give Errani/Vavssori a better game than Rybakina/Fritz did.

Keys holds serve, forcing Swiatek/Ruuud to serve for the match at 4-1 3-2.

That was never really in doubt. Muchova/Rublev meet Errani/Vavassori in the last eight – and in a few minutes' time.

News reaches me that, in the locker room last week, Fritz said there was no chance he'd lose to a doubles player in mixed doubles.

Penny for em, Taylor old mate.

Oh Maddy. Regular readers of this blog will know she's a favourite – Muchova too – and down 15-40, she sends down a double, missing the box by a way on her second go. Swiatek/Ruud lead 4-1 10 while, on Armatrong, Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opelka 4-2 in their second-set breaker, so are three points from victory. As I mentioned earlier, it's $50,000 to show, with $50,000 more on offer for the first-round winners.

Mucholva holds, so we're playing a second-set breaker on Armstrong; Williams/Opelka have to win it to stay in the competition and it's first to seven.

Coach Calv, who as a Wimbledon and Aussie Open winner, knows a thing or 90,423 about doubles, notes that Rybakina/Frtiz didn't even manage a break point against Errani/Vavassori and, with the best will in the world, the former is not renowned for her prowess in that aspect of the game. He also adds that “Vava is a great lad” and it's clear Errani is too.

Venus finds herself serving at 15-30 and when Muchova volleys between her and Opelka, she's down two break points. The first is saved when Rublev sends a forehand wide, the second with an ace, so here comes the deciding point at deuce … Opelka putting away and overhead with typical venom. Muchova will now serve for a breaker.

A terrific forehand from Ruud, looped down the line, raises three set points at 3-1, and an ace means he and Swiatek lead Keys/Tiafoe 1-0; on Armstrong, Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opelka 4-2 3-3.

Opelka holds so he and Venus lead Muchova/Rublev 3-2 having lost set one; Swiatek holds, so she and Ruud lead Keys/Tiafoe 3-0. I love how businesslike the Pole is – there aren't many more focused competitors in any sport.

Up 0-40, Swiatek and Ruud go for the same ball, clashing rackets, and we wind up at deuce, a Tiafoe double handing over the game after all that hard work saving it. The no 3 seeds lead 2-0; Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opela 4-2 1-2 on serve.

A hold apiece opens set two on Armstrong, but Muchova/Rublev look the defter, more natural pair; I'd be surprised if they lost this. On Ashe. Ruud/Swiatek lead Keys/Tiafoe 1-0.

Keys and Tiafoe come out linking arms – they're great mates, which is always nice to see. I've not a clue what to expect from this match, but I'm fascinated to see how Swiatek pulls up having only just won Cincinnati. We're ready to get going, the winners to meet McNally/Musetti.

Two mahoosive Rublev forehands, one cross then a winner down the line, make 30-0, and terrific net-play, from him and Muchova, secure a 4-2 first set.

Opelka holds in short order, meaning Rublev will now serve for the set. He's not often broken, and it seems unlikely the pair he's facing have what it takes to make that happen.

Rublev nets a volley just as he and Muchova take over the rally and face break-back point; Venus nets a return for deuce, but with no advantage, she and Opelka have another shot at it. But they can't take it, Venus butchering her volley, and Muchova/Rublev lead 3-1.

Back on Armstrong, Venus is serving at deuce … and she's broken for 1-2. It's a long way back from here, Muchova and Rublev both reliable servers.

McNally says she got a call from her agent telling her she had 30 seconds to decide whether to play with Musetti; “Er… yes!” was her response.

Musetti explains they spoke this morning, decided which side to play, and McNally is a really good player and he enjoyed seeing her at net. He thinks they've good chemistry on court and is looking forward to playing again. He was really stressed serving out, but hopes he'll be better when they come back in an hour to play their quarter.

Next on Ashe: Swiatek/Ruud (3) v Keys/Tiafoe.

The stadium looks pretty full, now, by the way, which is good news. As on Armstrong, they've seen the better doubles players win.

The winning pair seemed to really enjoy that, and fully deserve their win.

A fine backhand winner from Osaka, monstered inside-out, earns two break-back points … both saved, but there'll be a third with no advantage, that's also match point. And we're away again on Ashe, Williams/Opelka holding for 1-0.

We're still on serve in the second, but McNally/Musetti look the likelier. With no deuces and four-game sets, though, things can turn on almost nothing. More importantly, though, what do we make of Osaka's trainers?

Sadly, I've no better snap for now, but back on court, a Monfils double means she and he are broken; at 5-3 3-2, McNally/Musetti will now serve for the match.

McNally/Musetti seem to really be enjoying themselves and make deuce at 1-0 1-1, but Osaka/Monfils hold to keep their noses in front in set two; on Armstrong, our new teams emerge.

On Ashe, we're 1-1 on set two, McNally/Musetti by one set to love.

Next on Armstrong: Williams/Opelka v Muchová/Rublev.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","‘Don't call it a grand slam': Why has the US Open's new mixed doubles format been so controversial?","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/sport/tennis-us-open-mixed-doubles-controversy-intl","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 09:59:00 GMT","


            The thought of the top men's and women's singles players teaming up is one that has often intrigued tennis fans around the world.
    


            It's part of the reason the mixed doubles event sometimes draws so much interest during the Olympics, with Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff and Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva forming two star-studded pairings at Paris 2024.
    


            It is also one of the few opportunities men and women have to directly compete against each other in professional sports.
    


            Now, the US Open – the fourth and final grand slam of the season – is aiming to cash in on that intrigue with a revamped version of the mixed doubles.
    


            Rather than having the event run concurrently with the singles and doubles, as is traditionally the case at grand slams, a shortened edition will now take place on the Tuesday and Wednesday of the US Open's ‘Fan Week' that precedes the start of the main draw, which kicks off next week.
    


            Sixteen pairs will take part in a shortened format that is best of three sets, but each set is only the first to four games and there will be no advantage after deuce, with the winner of the next point winning the game. There will also be a 10-point tie break instead of a full third set.
    


            “It's a radical change by the US Open,” Bob Bryan – one half of identical twin duo the Bryan Brothers, the most successful men's doubles pairing in tennis history – told CNN Sports' Don Riddell.
    


            “It'll be sold out in Arthur Ashe Stadium, all the stars, the single stars are playing it. The downside is that the doubles players won't get a shot to play it or to defend their title or whatever, but the prize money is a big increase.”
    


            Prize money for the winning pair this year is $1 million, a mammoth increase of $800,000 – or five times more – from 2024.
    


            And the US Open's attempt to lure big names to take part has clearly worked.
    


            Five-time grand slam singles champion Carlos Alcaraz teaming up with Emma Raducanu and current Wimbledon champion Iga Świątek joining forces with Casper Ruud, what's not to like?
    


            Well, quite a lot if you ask some doubles specialists.
    


            Kristina Mladenovic, a former world No. 1 in doubles and nine-time grand slam winner across doubles and mixed doubles, said it's “embarrassing” hearing the players saying they are “going to have fun” at the event as they prepare for the main singles draw.
    


            “A grand slam is neither preparation nor fun,” she told Eurosport. “It's years of sacrifice. When you're young, you dream of winning one, even in doubles.
    


            “In terms of business strategy, it's a brilliant idea … but from a sporting point of view, it's problematic because it touches on the essence of tennis. A grand slam is a competition steeped in history, in singles and doubles.
    


            “There's no problem putting on such an event, but above all, don't call it a grand slam.”
    


            At the time of the announcement, defending US Open mixed doubles champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori called the format change a “profound injustice,” though they have since been given a wild card to defend their 2024 title.
    


Jan Zielinski, mixed doubles champion at the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2024, said there had been “no communication with players” from the organizers about the change.
    


            Organizers have already confirmed that the event, described as a “pseudo-exhibition” by Errani and Vavassori, will count as an official grand slam.
    


            So not only have the doubles specialists been denied the opportunity to compete for potentially career-changing prize money, they have also been denied the chance to challenge for another grand slam.
    


            CNN Sports has reached out to the United States Tennis Association (USTA) for comment.
    


            Mike Bryan, Bob's twin, says he understands players' frustrations.
    


            “I mean, if we were on tour and we were left out of the possibility of winning a grand slam in mixed doubles, we'd probably be upset,” he told CNN Sports. “Now that we're retired, we see it from a greater perspective of the US Open is a business.
    


            “But you don't want it to cheapen a grand slam title. We'll see. Maybe, maybe it won't. Maybe, it'll make it even bigger.”
    


            But being great singles players doesn't automatically mean two stars will make a good doubles pairing. Court positioning, tactics and timing are vastly different between the two formats, with doubles specialists boasting more skills at the net than many top singles players.
    


            Currently, Andreeva and Jasmine Paolini the only two players across the men's and women's tours to be ranked inside the top 15 in both singles and doubles, though Coco Gauff has also previously been ranked inside the world's top three in the two formats (No. 2 in singles and No. 1 in doubles).
    


            It is common for the doubles and mixed events to draw smaller crowds during grand slams than the singles and Mike Bryan says it was perhaps in danger of becoming an “afterthought” at the US Open.
    


            “As players that play doubles, we're just hoping that kind of trickles down to the popularity of the doubles game itself, which I think it will,” Bob added. “So we're excited to see how it goes.
    


            “Let's see if the other grand slams take a look at it and are interested in making the same change, but it's a kind of a groundbreaking decision and it could revolutionize mixed doubles for years to come.”

The new mixed doubles event in New York sees a host of top singles players compete for a $1m prize

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

The new-look US Open mixed doubles event starts today, with Carlos Alcaraz set to feature alongside Emma Raducanu amongst a star-studded list of pairs. 

New for 2025, the mixed doubles in New York will be staged on the two biggest courts – Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong – over Tuesday 19 August and Wednesday 20 August. 

As well as five-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz and 2021 US Open champion Raducanu, a host of other top names are competing alongside one another for the $1m champion prize - an increase of $800,000 from 2024. 

The top-seeded pair features British No 1 Jack Draper alongside Jessica Pegula – they face Alcaraz and Raducanu in the round-of-16. Novak Djokovic is also playing with Serbian compatriot Olga Danilovic, but Jannik Sinner and Katerina Siniakova have withdrawn a day after the men's World No 1 retired from the Cincinnati Open final against Alcaraz with illness.

 Jannik Sinner and Katerina Siniakova have withdrawn from the US Open mixed doubles, which is set to start on Tuesday in New York. 

 The participation of Sinner had been in doubt after the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings was forced to retire due to illness from his Cincinnati Open final with Carlos Alcaraz on Monday afternoon. Sinner and Siniakova's spot in the mixed doubles draw at Flushing Meadows will be taken by home favourites Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","ATP & TikTok announce global content partnership","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/atp-tiktok-press-release-august-2025","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 12:33:31 GMT","

TikTok and the ATP Tour have today announced a strategic global content partnership focused on bringing compelling ATP athlete and tennis content to Gen Z and Millennial fans through creator collaborations and innovative content.

The partnership reinforces a shared commitment to enriching the fan experience, attracting new audiences to the sport, and strengthening the links between the ATP Tour, its players and tournaments, and the global fan community.

The partnership will focus on two key pillars: player engagement, helping more ATP athletes build a presence on TikTok and giving fans exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the sport; and the Tennis Creator Network, identifying and enabling TikTok creators to produce compelling content across ATP Masters 1000s and other ATP Tour events.

TikTok and ATP Tour will also invite TikTok creators from all ATP Masters 1000 markets to the Nitto ATP Finals to showcase the event through a unique lens, partnering with broadcasters, players and tournaments.

""Tennis is in full swing on TikTok right now. Players like Alcaraz, Shelton, Djokovic, and many more are connecting with growing fan bases by showing their real personalities in captivating content that has turned the sport into a cultural phenomenon that blends competition with entertainment,"" said Rollo Goldstaub, TikTok's Global Head of Sports Partnerships. ""Partnering with the ATP Tour gives us the ability to engage with fans across the globe with the best men's tennis content and encourages more players to share their stories, further igniting tennis' cultural movement on TikTok.”

“We are thrilled to partner with TikTok to continue to grow the global fan base for the ATP and our player and tournament members,” said Andrew Walker, Senior Vice President of Brand and Marketing, ATP Tour. “This strategic content partnership with TikTok builds on current trends with our audiences, places ATP at the forefront of the intersection of culture and sport, and creates discoverable content that cuts through for both players and tournaments.”

The TikTok-ATP partnership builds on ATP's work with Overtime and launch of the “It All Adds Up” brand campaign, developed with global creative agency Wieden+Kennedy, reinforcing ATP's focus on fan-first partnerships and creative storytelling.

But Swiateak rebounded for a five-game streak of her own, shaking off a service break at 5-4 to serve out the opening set on the second time of asking.Swiatek carried that momentum into the second set, emerging from two exchanges of breaks to save two break points in the eighth game and consolidate a 5-3 lead.Paolini bravely served to stay in the match but Swiatek proved too strong when it came time to serve for the title, powering a pair of forehands into the court to earn two championship points.

MASON, OH—“I'm always this kind of player who needs to see the proof,” Iga Swiatek said last week, when she was in the middle of her Cincinnati Open campaign. “If the serves are actually going to go in, I'll be convinced.”Swiatek was talking about the hopes and dreams that Wim Fissette, her coach, had for her serve when they began their partnership last fall. At first, his ambitions seemed a little far-fetched to her.“When I started working with Wim, I didn't believe that I can serve 185 [kilometers per hour] and 180 consistently. So I think he helped me with reaching this higher speed…I just kind of needed to believe it.”There's no way for Iga, or anyone else, to doubt her serving potential any longer. Especially not after her 7-5, 6-4 win over Jasmine Paolini in the final here on Monday evening. Time after time, often at the most opportune moments, Swiatek threw down serves in the 110- to 115-m.p.h. range. That's right around the 185 k.p.h. mark that Fissette envisioned for her.

The result is that Swiatek has turned her career upside down in 2025. The decade's greatest dirt-baller didn't win anything during the clay swing, but since then she has turned around and claimed her first titles at two of the sport's most important tournaments, Wimbledon, on grass, and Cincinnati, on quick hard courts. They're two events that she may have doubted she would ever conquer. In the past, the slow-court-loving Swiatek couldn't find her bearings on their slick surfaces.After her performance on Monday, we may have to ask: Is the Queen of Clay turning into a big-serving fast-courter?She hit eight aces and at least that many service winners against Paolini. Just as important was when she found them. Down 2-3 in the first set, she came up with two unreturnable serves to hold. Up 4-3, she fired two aces. And at 6-5, she closed the set with three service winners and an ace. There was more of the same in the second set. Serving at 4-3, in what turned out to be the most crucial game of the match, she fended off a break point with a service winner and held with an ace. And she ended the match in fitting fashion, with an ace out wide.

Up 4-3, she fired two aces. And at 6-5, she closed the set with three service winners and an ace. There was more of the same in the second set. Serving at 4-3, in what turned out to be the most crucial game of the match, she fended off a break point with a service winner and held with an ace. And she ended the match in fitting fashion, with an ace out wide.

Yet Swiatek, ever the process-oriented perfectionist, wasn't entirely thrilled with her serving night. And it's true that she committed seven double faults, and made just 57 percent of her first serves.“I couldn't even toss well,” she told Tennis Channel with a laugh. “It was a love-hate relationship [with her serve] today.”“At the end,” she finally had to allow, “the serve helped me.”With any shot, there will be trade-offs between power and control. If you're getting more free points with the serve, you may be willing to live with more double faults. With Swiatek, the more aggressive she has been with that shot, the more attack-minded she has been, and the more success she has had.“Maybe I wasn't committing to my serve for some part of the season,” she said of her early-2025 troubles.Now, as the final Grand Slam of the year approaches, she's fully committed to what she, Fissette, and her psychologist, Daria Abramowicz, have built. When the last point was over, Swiatek looked back at her team and pointed to her head. She was happy that she hadn't gotten negative when the match tightened.

“I was focusing on the right things,” Swiatek said. “Maybe not everything was perfect. Mentally I was there to just play the best tennis that was possible at that moment.”“Thank you for forcing me to become a better player,” Swiatek said to Fissette afterward. “And to learn how to play on these surfaces.”Now she has all the proof she needs, in the form of the winner's trophy, that his ambitions for her hadn't been delusional after all.With the title, Swiatek moves from No. 3 to No. 2 in the rankings, as well as in the seedings at the US Open—that means no potential semifinal with No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.Speaking of Sabalenka, can we say that Swiatek has also overtaken her as the favorite at the Open, and the favorite to reclaim the year-end No. 1 ranking that she surrendered to her in 2024? In the past, the late-season schedule—which is hard courts only the rest of the way—might have made that a long shot. Now it might be exactly what she wants.

Top 10 best battles of the 2025 F1 season so far

The best of Valtteri Bottas' iconic onboard cameras 

With Alpine currently last in the 2025 Teams' Standings, we sum up their season so far in their half term report.

Alpine have had an eventful season so far – again. After something of a rollercoaster 2024 campaign, they went into this year with a pairing of Pierre Gasly and Jack Doohan, only for the rookie Australian to find himself back on the sidelines after the team opted for the services of Franco Colapinto from Imola onwards. However, amid another Team Principal departure, the underlying facts are that Alpine's car isn't quite fast enough this season, leaving the Enstone-based outfit sitting bottom of the Teams' Standings. Here's the lowdown on their 2025 so far…

Pierre Gasly – 6th in Great Britain

Gasly perfectly described his sixth-placed finish at the British Grand Prix as ‘unreal' – given the Alpine driver had started the Silverstone weekend with P19, P18 and P20 finishes in the first three practice sessions.

Having impressively hauled his car into the top 10 in Saturday's Qualifying, the subsequent wet-dry race on Sunday brought chaos – and opportunity – for those up and down the grid. While Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg stole the show with his rise to the podium that day, Gasly's own efforts in maximizing what was on offer shouldn't be ignored.

He expertly held onto his top-10 start for much of the race before eventually picking off the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll on the final lap of the Grand Prix to score Alpine's best result of the season so far, as well as eight very valuable points.

Gasly 5-1 Doohan
Gasly 6-2 Colapinto

Doohan spent the opening six rounds of the season alongside Gasly, but it was the more experienced Frenchman who led in the Qualifying head-to-head statistics. The only event where the Australian came out on top in Qualifying was in Miami – as he made it to Q2 before securing 14th on the grid after Gasly was knocked out in the first phase.

However, Doohan's race on the Sunday would last less than a lap after he and Liam Lawson made contact at the first corner – and for the next round in Imola he was dropped back down to reserve with Colapinto taking his place.

With the Argentine now having had eight race weekends of his own alongside Gasly, it is still the Frenchman who leads the way — though Colapinto showed pace in Canada and Hungary.

Gasly 4*-1 Doohan
Gasly 5-3 Colapinto

When it comes to the race head-to-head, Gasly again comes out on top compared to his less experienced team mates at Alpine — while his disqualification from the Chinese Grand Prix sees him lose out on a score against Doohan.

The Frenchman is also responsible for scoring all of the team's points thus far – with neither Doohan or Colapinto able to finish in the points-scoring positions in 2025. Currently Colapinto's highest finish is 13th in both Monaco and Canada, while Doohan's highest was also 13th, achieved in China (though this was aided by three post-race disqualifications.)

Gasly's 20 points for Alpine do, however, make them the highest scoring last-placed team in F1 history, so there's something to shout about.

*Gasly was disqualified from the Chinese Grand Prix for an underweight car

There haven't been too many contenders for this section in 2025, so Gasly's remarkable sixth in the British Grand Prix gets another mention here.

Given the Frenchman has openly admitted the car is relatively slow compared to the opposition, and that much of the squad's focus is on 2026 and the new set of regulations, then there probably won't be too many more results like this for the rest of the year.

Mind you, we said similar this time last season before Gasly and Esteban Ocon went on to secure a double podium in Brazil…

There's been plenty of off-track news surrounding Alpine again this year – not only was there the aforementioned driver swap with Doohan and Colapinto but Team Principal Oli Oakes also exited the squad earlier this year due to reasons of a ""personal nature"".

But for Alpine's worst moment of 2025 we're going to nominate Gasly's disqualification in China. It went under the radar at the time – given Ferrari's duo of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton were both also disqualified from the race – but being excluded from a Grand Prix is never something you want on your record.

Much of Alpine's focus is lasered in on 2026 and the new regulations, but the arrival of Steve Nielsen on September 1 as Managing Director will be a significant step in solidifying the team's leadership structure.

Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore has been covering many of the duties previously performed by Oakes, with Nielsen being recruited to oversee the day-to-day running of the team. The Briton also has previous experience with the Enstone-based squad having worked with them under their previous guises as Benetton, Renault and Lotus.

As highlighted by Gasly, much of Nielsen's focus will be on maximising what's possible in 2026 to ensure the team are performing to the best of their abilities. Quite simply, last in the Teams' Standings is not where they expect to be.

But away from 2026, there also needs to be a focus on helping guide Colapinto through a challenging phase in his F1 career. The Argentine showed what he was capable of last season with Williams, but he is yet to hit those heights in an Alpine.

If they can get him firing on all cylinders alongside Gasly then the prospects look brighter for the future, as well as their hopes for finishing a little further up the standings.

Top 10 best battles of the 2025 F1 season so far

The best of Valtteri Bottas' iconic onboard cameras 

Lewis Hamilton has been working hard behind the scenes to make his new Ferrari adventure a success.

Lewis Hamilton has provided a few more details regarding the documents he has been compiling for Ferrari this season, as the seven-time World Champion pushes to help the legendary team end their title drought.

Hamilton is just over halfway into his first campaign with the Scuderia and, alongside an up-and-down run on the track, he has been working hard in the background to give his new squad as many pointers as possible for the future.

At the Belgian Grand Prix, the 40-year-old Briton revealed that this included making thorough notes that have been sent to relevant departments, with lengthy, championship-winning stints at McLaren and Mercedes to draw on.

Asked about his preparations for that Spa-Francorchamps weekend, Hamilton explained: “I was at the factory, a couple of days in each week. We did preparation for… naturally you're going over where we were in the previous race, things that we need to change.

“I hold a lot of meetings, so I've called on lots of meetings with the heads of the team. I've sat with John [Elkann, Ferrari Chairman], Benedetto [Vigna, Ferrari CEO] and Fred [Vasseur, Ferrari F1 team boss], several meetings.

“I've sat with the head of our car development, with Loic [Serra], but also with the heads of different departments, talking about the engine for next year, talking about front suspension for next year, talking about rear suspension for next year, things that you want, issues that you have with the car.”

He then revealed: “I've sent documents. I've done [that] through the year. After the first few races I did a full document for the team, then during this break [between races] I had another two documents that I sent in and so they would come in and want to address those.

“Some of it's structural, adjustments that we need to make as a team in order to get better in all the areas that we want to improve. Then the other one was really about the car, the current issues that I have with this car, some things that you do want to take onto next year's car and some that you need to work on and change for next year.”

At the subsequent Hungarian Grand Prix weekend, Hamilton was asked to follow up on those comments, whether the documents took the form of PowerPoint, Word or Excel files, and what is included.

“I can't really tell you,” Hamilton initially smiled, as he pondered what to share. “Everyone seems to be asking about them, but it's just a Word document.”

Asked if the notes within those Word documents have been positive or negative, or a mixture of both, Hamilton replied: “Again… I think all I can say is that the team has every ingredient that they need to win. They have every ingredient they need to win World Championships.

“It's literally just about getting things all aligned and running smoothly and freely, stress-free, which we're all trying to do.”

As touched on above, Ferrari's last world title came in 2008, when they won the Teams' Championship, while Kimi Raikkonen remains the squad's last Drivers' Champion with his triumph in the previous season.

After 14 rounds of 24 in 2025, Hamilton sits sixth in the Drivers' Standings, one place behind team mate Charles Leclerc, while their combined efforts have put Ferrari second to McLaren in the Teams' battle.

Nexstar had been in talks with smaller rival Tegna to merge its local TV stations amid the continuing consolidation of the U.S. broadcast sector. 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	Leading local TV station owner Nexstar Media Group and smaller rival Tegna have unveiled a definitive agreement for a merger.


	As part of the deal, Nexstar will acquire all outstanding shares of Tegna each for $22.00 in cash, which values the transaction at $6.2 billion, including debt. Tegna's board of directors has approved the merger and the company's debt will refinanced or closed at the completion of the merger agreement. 




	To complete the merger, Nexstar may have to go up against Sinclair, which had also been looking at a deal for Tegna, which has 64 local TV stations in the U.S. market. Sinclair has reportedly offered to combine its TV stations with Tegna while separate merger talks with Nexstar were ongoing.

	Nexstar, which already has around 299 owned or partner TV stations, has financing in place from a consortium of Wall Street investment banks to finance the transaction. The merger deal, which requires regulatory approvals, is seen as a test for the FCC to loosen local TV station ownership rules as it gets set to rule on the Nexstar-Tegna agreement.

	Once completed, the merger will see Nexstar emerge with 265 local TV stations in 44 states and the District of Columbia and 132 of the country's 210 television DMAs, or Nielsen's Designated Market Areas. The combined company will have stations in 9 of the top 10 DMAs, 41 of the top 50 DMAs, 62 of the top 75 DMAs and 82 of the top 100 DMAs, covering, in total, 80 percent of U.S. TV households.

	











	Nexstar chairman and CEO Perry A. Sook, who is betting Brendan Carr's FCC will allow that market concentration, in a statement said of the merger agreement: “The initiatives being pursued by the Trump administration offer local broadcasters the opportunity to expand reach, level the playing field, and compete more effectively with the Big Tech and legacy Big Media companies that have unchecked reach and vast financial resources. We believe Tegna represents the best option for Nexstar to act on this opportunity.”


	The Trump administration has made deregulation a top priority, and companies that own local TV stations, including Sinclair, Nexstar, Gray, E.W. Scripps and Tegna, have eyed new mergers and acquisitions opportunities amid possible industry consolidation.  


	Nexstar's purchase price represents a 31 percent premium to Tegna's average 30-day average stock price on August 8. Shares in Tegna had been rising as news of active merger talks with Nexstar went public in early August.


	The transaction will increase Nexstar's reach in key local TV station markets like Atlanta, Phoenix, Seattle, and Minneapolis and is expected to generate around $300 million in annual cost savings from revenue synergies and expense reductions. The merger deal remains subject to approvals, including from Tegna shareholders and is expected to close by mid-year 2026.


	Mike Steib, CEO of Tegna, in his own statement said: “We are thrilled to have found a partner in Nexstar that will enable Tegna's stations to continue doing what we do best: creating outstanding and impactful local content coupled with the delivery of indispensable digital products to the communities we serve around the country. Nexstar and Tegna both share a rich heritage of commitment to journalistic excellence and technological advancements. Together, we will expand news coverage to serve more communities, across more screens, and ultimately secure the future of local news for generations to come.”

	SB19's fan army faced fierce competition in every round of this (mostly) friendly battle. They topped Tate McRae in Round 1 (82.7% to 17.3%), Ariana Grande in Round 2 (88.6% to 11.4%), Post Malone in Round 3 (81.6% to 18.4%), Shaboozey in the quarterfinals (76.5% to 23.5%), Sabrina Carpenter in the semifinals (67.8% to 32.2%) and Gomez in the finals (59.4% to 40.6%).


	Each of the acts that SB19 squared off against this year has topped the Billboard Hot 100. SB19 has yet to achieve that milestone, but their hit “Dam” reached No. 4 on the Billboard Philippines Hot 100 in March.


	Here's a complete, updated list of winners of the Billboard Fan Army Face-Off. Will A'TIN break out of the tie with Queens next year or will another fan army prevail? We'll have to wait a full year to find out.

Billboard's 2024 pay rankings reveal changing dynamics at publicly traded music companies, with UMG's Lucian Grainge holding the top spot and SiriusXM's Jennifer Witz making major gains.


													By
												

	Glenn Peoples



Universal Music Group chairman/CEO Lucian Grainge topped Billboard's list of best-paid music executives for the third time in four years — but just barely.


	In 2024, Grainge was paid $39.6 million, about $2.5 million more than SiriusXM CEO Jennifer Witz, who leaped to No. 2 with earnings of $37.1 million thanks to stock and option awards tied to a new employment contract that boosted her total earnings fivefold over the previous two years. Billboard expanded this year's list, which includes only named executive officers from publicly traded companies, from 10 to 20. 


	Grainge's 2024 earnings were low compared with the previous three years — although his pay for two of those years was based on extraordinary circumstances. In 2021, Grainge's $258.1 million worth of bonuses — all paid by former parent company Vivendi — pushed his total earnings to $308.2 million. The following year, his earnings returned to a more normal $49.7 million before surging to $150.3 million in 2023, due mainly to a $100 million “transition award” that moved him from all-cash compensation to a mix of cash and equity that's typical for public company executives.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Witz, the best-paid of the three women on the list, leapfrogged other executives on the 2024 ranking thanks to a boost from stock options worth $16.5 million that will vest in equal parts over three years. She was also given $16.2 million in stock awards (both stock units based on performance and restricted units that vest over time), nonequity plan compensation of $2.1 million and other compensation of $258,000.


	Witz is consistently one of music's best-paid executives despite SiriusXM's bumpy road since she became CEO in 2021. Facing stiff competition from streaming services and slowing growth in satellite subscribers, the company laid off staff in 2023 and 2024 as revenue and self-pay subscribers dropped in both years. Losing ground cost Witz and other SiriusXM executives. In 2024, SiriusXM missed the minimum thresholds for two of the three annual bonus performance metrics, according to the company's latest proxy statement. In total, executives met 43% of their target annual bonuses, and the compensation committee gave Witz just 35% of her annual bonus.


	The money that executives actually pocket greatly depends on the performance of their companies' stock price, and Witz's latest contract is no different. The options she received in 2024 are currently “out of the money,” or below their exercise price. Her stock options have a $51.40 exercise price, but SiriusXM's share price has fallen to $20.90 (as of Aug. 12), meaning it needs to gain approximately 150% for Witz's options to pay off.


	SiriusXM chief content officer Scott Greenstein could do far better with his stock options and performance-related stock awards. The No. 5 executive on the list with total pay of $21.8 million, Greenstein received stock options worth $8.3 million that carry a $27.40 exercise price, meaning SiriusXM shares need to increase just 31% for his options to have value. He was also given $10.4 million in stock awards.


	Of the top 20 executives, 11 were paid over $12 million (the same as in 2023) while the No. 20 position was paid $5.9 million. (It was $4.4 million a year earlier.)


	Collectively, compensation for the top 20 was $312 million, down 15% from 2023. That decline can be attributed to the outsize effect of Grainge's 2023 earnings. Nos. 2 through 19 fared better, on average, in 2024 than in 2023. Looking at the median pay — the average of Nos. 10 and 11 — gives a better sense of the increased earnings power of the other executives. From 2023 to 2024, median earnings increased from $10 million to $15.6 million, a 28% rise.


	Executives' bump in pay mirrored the increase in the broader market. A study of CEO pay for S&P 500 companies by Equilar, a data research firm, found that the median value rose 9.7% from 2023, to $17.1 million. The annual study, in collaboration with the Associated Press, tracks trends in the compensation packages of S&P 500 CEOs that had served in their roles for at least two years. In the companies tracked, stock awards rose 14.7% to $10.3 million and accounted for 71.6% of the median pay package. The value of perks rose 21.5%, which Equilar attributes to an increase in security measures — which some companies classify as a perk rather than a business expense — following the 2024 murder of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.


	The list's only other company with declining revenue, iHeartMedia, is represented by two executives: CEO Bob Pittman at No. 10, with $12.9 million, and CFO/COO Rich Bressler at No. 11, with $12.6 million. Institutional Shareholder Services, a firm that provides recommendations to investors on shareholder voting matters, recommended that iHeartMedia shareholders vote against executive compensation. Focusing on Pittman's $12.9 million compensation, ISS identified a “misalignment” between iHeartMedia's three-year performance ranking (the company fell into the bottom quartile on multiple measures) and Pittman's above-average pay relative to his peers.


	IHeartMedia's executive compensation was nonetheless approved by shareholders, albeit a relatively low 73%. In 2025, the average approval rate was 90.6%, and 73% of companies in the Russell 3000, an index of the 3,000 largest public companies in the United States, received 90% or greater shareholder approval for say on pay votes, according to Semler Brossy, an executive compensation consulting firm.


	At No. 3, Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino led three Live Nation executives on the list. Rapino, who topped the list in 2022 thanks to a huge post-COVID-19 bonus, earned $33 million. General counsel Michael Rowles was No. 12, with $7.5 million, and CFO Joe Berchtold was No. 13, with $6.4 million.


James Dolan took the No. 4 position, earning a total of $28.2 million as CEO of both Sphere Entertainment and MSG Entertainment. Dolan, who ranked second on Billboard's 2023 executive compensation list, would have earned more in a normal year. Because Sphere Entertainment changed from a fiscal year (ending June 30) to a calendar reporting year, he was paid for a shortened, six-month transition period ending Dec. 31, 2024. As a result, Dolan's Sphere transitional period earnings of $18 million were far below his previous annual earnings of $27.4 million.


	Warner Music Group has the most executives on the expanded list, with five. CEO Robert Kyncl is No. 7, at $18.6 million, and Max Lousada, the former CEO of recorded music, is No. 8, at $18.1 million. Warner Chappell Music co-chair/CEO Guy Moot is No. 15, at $6.1 million. Former WMG CFO Bryan Castellani is No. 18, at $5.8 million. WCM co-chair/COO Carianne Marshall is No. 19, at $5.5 million.


	Spotify has four names, including two not on previous lists, in the top 20. Gustav Söderström, co-president/chief product and technology officer, was No. 6, at $18.7 million. Co-president/chief business officer Alex Norström was No. 9, at $16.6 million. The two Spotify executives new to the list: Chief public affairs officer Dustee Jenkins was No. 14 at $6.3 million and CFO Christian Luiga was No. 16 at $6 million.


	A notable name missing is Spotify CEO Daniek Ek, who does not earn a salary or receive bonuses and therefore has not appeared on Billboard's list of top music industry earners. As one of Spotify's single largest shareholders, however, Ek has an immense source of income. In 2024, Ek sold Spotify shares with a market value of approximately $375 million, according to Billboard‘s tally of Spotify's SEC disclosures.

The LP is the follow-up to 2022's ""Dance Fever.""

	Thomas Smith



	Last week, a video of Florence Welch screaming into a hole in the ground sent fans into a frenzy. In the clip Welch – front person of Florence + the Machine – posted on her Instagram profile, she furiously digs a pit in the ground and lets out a blood-curdling yell.

	Now it all makes sense. On Tuesday morning (Aug. 19) Welch announced the release of Florence + the Machine's upcoming album, Everybody Scream, which will drop right in time for Halloween (Oct. 31). She confirmed the release in a new post on her social platforms alongside the LP's artwork, which you can see below.

	At press time, only limited information for Everybody Scream has been shared. Pre-orders for the record – the Machine's sixth studio LP – are now live and include a number of variants across physicals. The website says the LP will feature 12 new songs, though a tracklist and lead single have not yet been released revealed.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Florence + the Machine released their last studio album Dance Fever in 2022, which included production from Jack Antonoff and Kid Harpoon. The record peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 1 on the U.K.'s Official Albums Chart. 


	Fans have been expecting a new release from Welch after a period of relative quiet. In 2024 Welch appeared on Taylor Swift's “Florida!!!” from the record-breaking The Tortured Poets Department, and earlier in 2025 she had a spot on The Weeknd's “Reflections Laughing,” from his Hurry Up Tomorrow LP.

	











	In recent weeks fans had noticed changes to the Welch's website and Spotify profiles. Another teaser shared on Friday featured a video of Welch walking across a field in blood red shoes and matching dress.


	Earlier this summer, Welch shared a selection of pictures on her social profile which included a shot with IDLES guitarist Mark Bowen in the studio and a whiteboard with the message “You can have it all,” followed by the list of terms: “Clarity — Power, Purpose, Vocals!!!, Space, Dynamics, Beauty, Swans vs. Adele.”


	In October 2024, Florence + The Machine shared a live album taken from their performance at London's Royal Albert Hall earlier that year. The performance for the BBC Proms saw them remodel their 2009 debut Lungs with the Jules Buckley Orchestra.

HUNTR/X and Saja Boys each boast two songs in the Global 200's top five.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X and Saja Boys may do battle in Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, but the acts team up to claim four of the top five on the Billboard Global 200 chart.


	HUNTR/X's “Golden” adds a fifth nonconsecutive week at No. 1 on both the Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts. In July, the song became the first leader on each list for the act, whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI.

	











	Meanwhile, HUNTR/X earns its second top five Global 200 hit, as “How It's Done” jumps 8-5.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In between the trio's two top five entries, Saja Boys rise 4-3 with “Soda Pop,” which returns to its best placement, and 5-4 with “Your Idol,” which has also reached No. 3. Both songs are performed by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee.


	Since the Global 200 began in September 2020, four elite albums — by two superstars — other than the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack have generated as many as four concurrent top five hits. Taylor Swift monopolized the entire top five in the debut chart weeks for her LPs The Tortured Poets Department (May 4, 2024), 1989 (Taylor's Version) (Nov. 11, 2023) and Midnights (Nov. 5, 2022), while Drake held Nos. 2-5 the week that Certified Lover Boy made its chart start (Sept. 18, 2021).


	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	











	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.


	“Golden” leads the Global 200 with 117.8 million streams (down less than 1% week-over-week) and 14,000 sold (up 7%) worldwide in the week ending Aug. 14.


	As for the only song not from the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack in the Global 200's top five, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. 2 after 10 weeks on top beginning in May.


	“Golden” tops Global Excl. U.S. with 86.1 million streams (down 1%) and 7,000 sold (up 8%) outside the U.S.


	“Ordinary” keeps at No. 2 on Global Excl. U.S., following eight weeks at No. 1 starting in May; BLACKPINK's “Jump” repeats at No. 3, after it led in its debut week in July; “Soda Pop” is steady at its No. 4 high; and “Your Idol” rises 8-5, returning to its best rank.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated Aug. 23, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Aug. 19. For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard's subscription-based service. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

The song is the latest single from the duo's upcoming ""Breach"" album.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	If you've ever seen Twenty One Pilots live, then you know that drummer Josh Dun is the strong, silent type. The bashing percussionist for the Columbus, OH duo lets his sticks do the talking, keeping the big beat for the band while singer Tyler Joseph handles vocals, keyboards/piano, ukulele, guitar, bass and anything else he can get his hands on.


	But in the just-released video for the second single from the band's upcoming Breach (Sept. 12) album, “Drum Show,” Dun veers out of his lane to sing his first vocals on a 21P song. The punchy, punk-edged rager mostly driven by Dun's bashing beats and Joseph's rubbery bass and urgent vocals is the follow-up to the album's first single, “The Contract,” which currently sits at No. 1 on the Alternative Airplay chart and is also nominated for best rock at the upcoming 2025 MTV VMAs.

	











	In the bare bones video for the song directed by longtime collaborator Mark Eshleman and shot in their midwestern hometown, Joseph and Dun perform the song in an abandoned parking garage, their gear plugged into a minivan. At points, Dun is playing his kit from inside the car, driving through the night as Joseph sings from the back seat.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“He's puttin' on a drum show/ Even now, even now, even now/ He'll take the longer way homeEven now, even now, even now/ He'll never ever say so,” Joseph sings on the chorus. “He drives fast just to feel it, feel it/ He drives slow if his song's not over/ Drown it out, drown it out.”


	About halfway through, Dun steps up to the mic to sing in his previously unheard, affectingly sweet voice, crooning, “I've been this way/ I want to change/ I've been this way/ I want to change” before Joseph jumps back in with a primal scream of the word “change” amid a cymbal-crashing fury.


	The pair recently announced that they will celebrate the follow-up to last year's Clancy album with  a global listening event at indie record stores around the world a week before their eighth LP's release date. The upcoming LP will pick up on the narrative arc that began with 2015's Blurryface and continued on 2018's Trench, 2021's Scaled and Icy and 2024's Clancy. 21P will kick off the Clancy Tour: Breach 2025 stadium/amphitheater run on Sept. 18 with a show at Cincinnati's TQL soccer stadium.


	In addition to the new single, the band unveiled three exclusive box sets tied to key characters from the new album's story: the Dark Clancy edition, Nova Bishop edition and the Torchbearer edition. Each set will feature a hinged book-style box with a CD tray and lift-up door with unique colors and texture that reveals hidden goodies, including a bandana, stickers, a poster, 24-page booklet and a character ID card; click here for more information on the special editions.

	Paul Grein



	By now, you've heard about the five artists who are slated to receive Kennedy Center Honors in December – Michael Crawford, Gloria Gaynor, KISS, Sylvester Stallone and George Strait. At a press conference announcing the honorees, President Trump said he was “98% involved” in the selections and that he'll host the televised ceremony on which these artists are saluted.


	While Trump's involvement will make many view these selections through a partisan lens, we're asking you to put that aside and simply tell us what's your favorite song associated with this year's honorees. We give you two choices for each honoree.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	For Crawford, the Tony-winning star of The Phantom of the Opera, you can choose between his two most famous solos in that show: “The Music of the Night” and “The Phantom of the Opera.”


	For Gaynor, you can choose between her two top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: her discofied remake of The Jackson 5's “Never Can Say Goodbye” and her Grammy-winning No. 1 smash “I Will Survive.”




	For KISS, you can choose between their rock anthem “Rock and Roll All Nite” and their image-broadening ballad “Beth,” the band's first top 10 hit on the Hot 100.


	For Stallone, you can choose between Hot 100-topping hits from two of his Rocky movies: Bill Conti's “Gonna Fly Now” and Survivor's “Eye of the Tiger.” Both songs were Oscar-nominated for best original song. (Fun Fact: Stallone is this year's only Kennedy Center Honors recipient who is associated with two No. 1 Hot 100 hits.)


	For Strait, you can choose between “Amarillo by Morning,” a 1983 hit that has long been a fan favorite, and “Check Yes or No,” one of his record 44 No. 1 hits on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart.


	What's your favorite of these 10 songs associated with this year's Kennedy Center Honorees? Vote!

					By Justin Kroll 

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Danny Boyle has made a name for himself by taking powerful real-life stories and turning them into thrilling cinematic experiences, and the Oscar winner looks to have found that next riveting tale to adapt. Sources tell Deadline that Boyle is on board to direct Ink, a Studiocanal, Media Res and House Productions pic that revolves around the rise of the Rupert Murdoch empire. Insiders add that Oscar nominee Guy Pearce is in talks to play the media mogul and NewsCorp founder and Jack O'Connell is in negotiations to play Larry Lamb, who Murdoch hired to run The Sun when he purchased it in 1969.

	











	An explosive cinematic rollercoaster about a group of visionaries and misfits who had an idea for a new kind of news – one that would give the people what they want and would change the face of the world we live in today. James Graham, who penned the original play, has adapted the screenplay with plans to shoot this October.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Based on the James Graham play, follows Murdoch's struggling newspaper, The Sun, as he intends to make it a must-read news source and hires Lamb to run the paper. The purchase of the paper would start a long-standing rivalry between The Sun and The Mirror, leading to the rise of the British tabloids as we know them.


	Danny Boyle produces with Tessa Ross and Michael Ellenberg. The film reunites Boyle and Ross following their collaboration on Slumdog Millionaire. Tracey Seaward also produces. Tonia Davis is an exec producer.


	Deadline first reported Media Res optioning James Graham's play of the same name directed by Rupert Goold in 2020.

	











	Studiocanal is fully financing the film. Ron Halpern and Joe Naftalin will oversee for for the studio. Studiocanal will release in their territories of the UK, France, Germany, Poland. Benelux, Australia and NZ handling worldwide sales.


	While Hollywood occasionally has had Murdoch appear in projects over the years, with the most recent example being Malcolm McDowell playing him in a cameo role in the 2019 pic Bombshell, there hasn't been an instance where the industry has decided to dive into how he came to be one of the most influential figures in history of media. There are plenty of places Boyle could have pulled from to tell this tale, but given how important this moment was in the Murdoch origin story, Boyle chose to go with source material that was ready for him to adapt.


	When it came to who would play his two main leads, Pearce and O'Connell were Boyle top choices for Murdoch and Lamb from the start. Pearce is coming off his critically acclaimed role in the A24 epic The Brutalist, which earned him an Oscar nomination. The Australia native had been weighing several offers but the chance to play one of his country's most iconic figures ultimately was to hard to pass on. 


	With O'Connell, Lamb essentially is equally if not more important to telling this chapter of Murdoch's story and needed to be played by someone that could match wits with Pearce. O'Connell has had a big year that started with his scene-stealing role as villainous vampire Remy in the box office smash Sinners, followed by the Sony horror hit 28 Years Later. Boyle directed the latter pic, which is where he got his first chance to see O'Connell up close. The filmmaker was so excited by his performance that he made his character a focal point in the next film, 28 Years Later: Bone Temple, which bows in January.


RELATED: Danny Boyle Says He Would Never Make Oscar-Winner ‘Slumdog Millionaire' Now Amid “Cultural Appropriation” Concerns


	Boyle is no stranger to taking on projects with larger-than-life figures at the center of the story, like his unconventional biopic Steve Jobs, which told the journey of the man who co-founded Apple and helped turn it into one of the world's most powerful tech companies. With Murdoch's global reach on so many fronts, Boyle looks to be aiming for the fences given the mogul's impact on not just journalism but how the media landscape has been formed over the decades.


	Boyle is repped by WME; Pearce is repped by CAA, Independent Talent Group and Shanahan Management; and O'Connell is repped by UTA, Range Media Partners and Conway van Gelder Grant. Graham is represented by Curtis Brown and WME.

					By Jesse Whittock 

International TV Co-Editor


Pierce Brosnan might be 72, but he'd come out of secret service retirement “in a heartbeat” if new James Bond director Denis Villeneuve wanted him.


	In an interview with the Radio Times, Brosnan joked that he could return to the 007 franchise as a “senior citizen” if called upon for the upcoming movie, which Villeneuve is directing and Steve Knight is writing for Amazon MGM Studios. 


	Brosnan played Bond for seven years between 1995 and 2002 in GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day before hanging up his tuxedo and putting his golden gun into lockup. Asked about whether he might return if asked, he responded cheerfully.

	“My wife Keely [Shaye Smith] and I have been listening to the drumbeat of expectation of who's going to be the next James Bond,” he said. “There are many great candidates out there, and I'm sure they're going to make it a spectacle of delight. I don't think anyone wants to see a craggy, 72-year-old Bond, but if Villeneuve had something up his sleeve I would look at it in a heartbeat. Why not? It's great entertainment. It could be lots of laughs. Bald caps, prosthetics… Who knows?”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Numerous names have been bandied about as the identity of the next Bond, who would replace Daniel Craig, who succeeded Brosnan in 2006's Casino Royale.


	Brosnan was speaking during an interview for The Thursday Murder Club, the Netflix adaptation of Richard Osman's novels about a group of pensioners who solve crimes in their spare time.


	Speaking about ageing, the star said: “The older you get, the freer you get, because mortality is circling the wagons. Within this story, there's a lovely lyricism. These four people want to keep their minds active and they also deal with the death that will befall all of us… And it's all wrapped up in a whodunnit.”


	Brosnan's Thursday Murder Club co-star, Helen Mirren, this week said that Bond “has to be a guy,” adding: “James Bond has to be James Bond, otherwise it becomes something else.”

	











	Brosnan had said in the past it would be “exhilarating” for Bond to be played by a woman, but this week backtracked by telling Saga magazine “it has to be a man.”

Damn, he has aged well.

Considering the strength of Brosnan's recent work and gravitas, would pay money to see this movie if the scrip is decent.  Better than Tom Holland and Daniel Craig with mommy issues.

EXCLUSIVE: Channel 4 and Disney are among the television giants declining to pay annual fees to the UK industry's new independent bullying and harassment complaints body, Deadline can reveal.


	As executives gather in Scotland for the Edinburgh TV Festival, sources said there is growing uncertainty over whether the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority (now commonly known by its CIISA acronym) can be sustained by voluntary contributions, with the body planning to be clearer about funding refuseniks as it bids to secure its future.


	Deadline hears that others yet to pay annual fees include Amazon Prime Video, All3Media, Fremantle, and Banijay. Netflix and Paramount-owned Channel 5 declined to confirm whether they are providing ongoing financial support to CIISA, raising questions about their commitment to the body.

	The BBC, ITV, Sky, Warner Bros. Discovery, BAFTA, and union Bectu have all pledged to make annual payments. Hundreds of other creative industry organizations have also signed up, including the Royal Albert Hall and Royal Shakespeare Company.

	The idea of an independent misconduct authority has been kicked around by the industry since the Noel Clarke scandal four years ago, but its existence has become more pressing amid a string of power abuse crises involving the likes of MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace and ITV chef Gino D'Acampo. Both denied wrongdoing.


	The BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, and Sky helped fund CIISA's startup costs in 2022, but as the body begins work, it will rely on annual fees to fund its operating overheads, which will be £2M ($2.7M) next year. 

	











	CIISA is asking stakeholders across TV, film, theater, and music to make annual contributions contingent on their annual revenue. Those with sales of more than £500M have been asked to pay £50,000 into CIISA, while the lowest contribution can be discretionary for companies with revenues of less than £250,000. Keira Knightley and Emerald Fennell are among the stars who have helped CIISA appeal for regular contributions. 


	Channel 4's reluctance to pay ongoing annual fees has raised eyebrows, given its position as a publicly-owned broadcaster with a “zero tolerance” approach to unacceptable behavior following scandals involving stars such as Russell Brand. One person claimed Channel 4 had been “very difficult about coughing up the cash” for future operations, though it has contributed in the past.


	Asked why it is not funding CIISA annually, a spokesperson said: “Channel 4 was an early supporter of CIISA and we have committed to their industry-wide standards. We have made substantial contributions to CIISA over the last two years and are actively engaging with them — most notably focusing on putting in place the appropriate remit, structures, and services to ensure their effectiveness — as we are keen to support them in building their success.”


	Disney, Amazon Prime Video, All3Media, Fremantle, and Banijay declined to comment. The position of these companies is that they remain in constructive conversation with CIISA as they seek clarity on how funding will be used.


Warm Words Not Enough


	In a letter to UK Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee this year, CIISA CEO Jen Smith was unsparing about the financial uncertainty. She said voluntary contributions are taking “much longer than expected,” are “rapidly becoming unfit for purpose,” and that the body cannot survive on goodwill alone. “Warm words must be translated into long-term financial commitments,” she said.


	CIISA has declined to name and shame individual companies, but the organization is changing tack in the coming weeks. Nazir Afzal, a CIISA board member and former prosecutor, said the body will actively publish its funding partners, effectively revealing non-funders by omission. 


	He compared the model, which is still being finalized, to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK's financial services regulator. “If you're looking for a loan or mortgage and your [lender] is not on the FCA website, you're playing with fire,” he told Deadline. “There's a strong case for saying that if your [employer] is not on the CIISA list, then the environment they have is not as safe as it could be.”


	It is not clear whether this will be enough to overcome reservations. Sources at companies that have declined to back CIISA financially have questioned what the money is being spent on. There are also concerns that CIISA's work is duplicative of standards already in place across the industry. “Writing guidance doesn't represent value for money,” said one skeptic. “We would like more clarity over CIISA's long-term remit, its mediation and investigative functions.”


	Afzal acknowledged the concerns and said CIISA is consistently addressing industry questions. He stressed that the body's operating functions are “lean” (it doesn't even have its own office space) and that it will publish accounts to boost transparency. 


	But CIISA is yet to deliver on its central pledge to launch a misconduct reporting service, with the complaints hotline not now expected until next year at the earliest. Eagerly awaited by freelancers, Afzal said CIISA will “find the funding” to deliver the service, even if it is unable to convert the likes of Amazon into fee-paying partners.

	











	Whether the reporting service can be maintained in the long term under a voluntary funding model is unclear. CIISA has held talks with the government about introducing a mandatory levy, as well as making funding contributions a conditional part of accessing tax breaks. 


	Culture secretary Lisa Nandy is considering these proposals, even if Afzal considers them a last resort. A staunch supporter of CIISA, Nandy said in December that she was “astonished” to discover Banijay was not funding the body following the MasterChef misconduct scandal that led to hosts Wallace and John Torode being fired.


	A Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport spokesperson said: “We are looking at ways to ensure that CIISA has proper buy-in and support from across the sector. We are pleased that organisations including Sky, Warner Bros. Discovery and the BBC have taken a strong stand, with the BBC announcing that they expect production companies working with them to support the CIISA standards.” 


	ITV has taken the same step as the BBC and told Deadline it was a “proud ongoing financial supporter of CIISA.”


Lack of Support “Ludicrous”


	Philippa Childs, head of TV industry union Bectu, said it was “ludicrous” that large companies were not making annual payments to CIISA.


	“These contributions are small change to the companies, but vitally important for workers and the reputation of the industry as a whole. Existing reporting mechanisms are not working, and industry heavyweights like these need to put their money where their mouth is if they want to achieve lasting change,” she told Deadline.


	“The only conclusion one can draw from organizations' refusal to sign up, is that they want to continue to be able to protect talent at the expense of the hard-working freelancers whose skills are crucial to the creative industries.”


	Afzal added: “We are here working with all these institutions to deal with decency deficit, to attack the trust deficit and, ultimately, to plug the accountability gap.”

The issue is CIISA doesn't really know what it is . Their business model is totally vague and those at the top have zero clue about the industry . I can understand why studios are reluctant to put money in to  something that has no clear objectives or plan .
CIISA muddied the waters talking about training , accrediting  roles – ? Training already exists,  individuals that have been properly trained or have the experience  in valid roles are represented by industry agents they don't need accrediting .
It's duplication. They should have launched the reporting line a year ago and focused on mediation and support. It's demise will be due to poor implementation,  lack of clear leadership  and focus  which is a pity.

Why does Amazon and Netflix have to pay up for bad behavior of other companies?  That's like asking Ford to pay Geico because people crash cars.

This is kinda fishy.
What other industry has an “Independent Complaints Body” they need to pay into when clearly all these big corporations have their own complaints departments already in place.
I remember the hundreds of articles about WB's investigation of Joss Whedon, Disney's investigation into Johnathon Majors, Netflix and Kevin Spacey, the list goes on and on..
so this article to me just reads as they want more money for their grift.

The BBC and others have all repeatedly failed to properly investigate complaints – including sexual assault – until forced to by outside bodies or lawsuits. Many internal investigations are half-hearted ass covering exercises that keep the alleged abusers in place (ie Hugh Edwards, Russell Brand, Martin Bashir) and the whistleblowers blacklisted. It shows how little genuine interest the companies have in dealing with abuse that they refuse to pay for an organisation many suggested be set up.

It's in their own best interests to support this. Like the MPAA and the BBFC, the industry needs a voluntary outside body that is NOT under government control to deal properly with complaints to keep the government from creating a mandatory body, because governments getting involved only makes matters worse.

CIISA can't conduct investigations. They aren't the police. They have no power to require compliance from the accused. They have no immunity from being sued for libel. 3 million a year for a phone line that might get a call or two a day is ridiculous.

Based on your examples this is very specific to the UK. All the people you list are British.
Why does USA need to foot the bill for a broken studio system across the pond? 

And I wouldn't mention the MPAA as a good thing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","A thrilling music world Nightcrawler, Lurker leeches onto a pop star","https://www.avclub.com/lurker-review","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

One of the most powerful things a person can be is “around.” Whether it's being in the right place at the right time, or lingering self-consciously until you're the last man standing at a party, presence is potent. The weaponization of proximity is baked into the title of Lurker, the feature debut of filmmaker Alex Russell, who's written on some of the biggest shows of the last few years (The Bear, Beef, Dave). But despite being the least buzzy of the pack, it's the subject matter of Dave, which plays with but never fully undermines the anxieties of musical fame, where Lurker finds its closest match. In this Nightcrawler-like thriller of social and professional escalation, a cold-blooded nobody seizes his moment near a pop star and refuses to let go.

Matthew (Théodore Pellerin) doesn't necessarily look like a starfucker. He's square, a white and gawky retail worker at a fashionable L.A. boutique who conspicuously throws Nile Rodgers on the store playlist when the mononymous Oliver (Archie Madekwe) rolls in with his posse. From this tiny, obviously engineered detail, a row of increasingly sinister dominos begin to fall as Matthew ingratiates himself with Oliver, proves he can hang backstage at a concert, and worms his way into the large home that the entourage crashes at. 

Oliver's other hangers-on—ranging from his quiet videographer (Daniel Zolghadri) to his goof-around pals (Zack Fox and Wale Onayemi, both rappers who've worked with Kenny Beats, who provides the film's score)—regard the newcomer with skepticism. They've managed to stick around during Oliver's meteoric rise because they know how to, and, like veteran reality TV performers, they can sniff out when someone's not there for the right reasons. As Matthew attempts to carve out a place in this unofficial organization, the camera gets up close and personal when documenting the ground-level work of pure ambition. Pellerin's bulging eyes and empty smile start as uncomfortable, but become more transparently hungry as the plot unveils itself—the open mouth of a leech faced with a buffet. Whether he's staring at a screen or a potential victim, Pellerin taps into a disconcerting, entitled soullessness.

This exploitational drive, exacerbated by the racial dynamic of a talentless white guy inserting himself into a group free from them, underscores the movements of the plot. The script's tight machinations, which develop emotional ploys between the characters alongside their more material desires, mostly avoid being outlandish or far-fetched enough to distract from all the jockeying for control. In the always-be-posting era, playing the game inherently looks a little silly—and much of it is captured in amateurish handheld, like a behind-the-scenes music doc or music video B-roll—which gives Russell's screenplay the wiggle room it needs to find an icky honesty in its appearance-forward reality. The ensuing rise-and-fall trajectory of the story isn't new or unexpected, but Russell and his leads complicate things both through cultural specificity (this is a film obsessed with the weightless successes of handles and stories and follows) and by making it clear that, to an extent, the target of all these plots knows what he's doing.

It's not that Lurker blames Oliver for attracting a group of striving lackeys, but that it's smart enough to know that being a pop star also means knowing how to wield power—how to play those underlings against each other and exploit his own sex appeal. The erotic undercurrent flowing throughout the film finds the object of affection dangling just enough encouragement, in Madekwe's alluring glances and physical roughhousing, to stoke the fires of parasocial lust. The unspoken moments between Oliver and Matthew crackle, the veneers erected by both performers rarely budging. 

It's when Russell stops trusting his leads and leans hard into the shock, into what heinous schemes someone close to you could pull off, that Lurker shakes its audience free of its spell. As soon as it takes a step or two over the line with its story, the focus shifts from the intimate royal court politics of this friend group/business enterprise to the believability of the final act turn. 

But of course things get out of control—it's not like the dark underbellies of music-world organizations haven't always exceeded our worst expectations. The strength of Lurker, though, is when it's operating as a slick, slimy social-engineering thriller that anyone could relate to. Whether one recognizes the yen for fame, the capacity to sabotage those around them, or the vulnerability of being known, these eternal egotistical concerns tap into their hyper-modern forms here. Only, now the threats aren't knocking at the door, or breathing hard on the phone—they're following you on social media, monsters hidden in a sea of notifications.

Aubrey Plaza is “okay, but it's like a daily struggle, obviously.” The Agatha All Along star recently stopped by her old Parks And Recreation co-star Amy Poehler's Good Hang podcast, on which she opened up about how she's been doing the past year. In January, Plaza lost her husband, Jeff Baena, to suicide, and has has hesitated to speak about it publicly since. “Right in this very, very present moment, I feel happy to be with you,” Plaza replied when Poehler asked how she was feeling. “Overall, I'm here and I'm functioning. I feel really grateful to be moving through the world.”

At the same time, Plaza shared a “really dumb analogy” (her words) to contextualize her grief. “It was kind of a joke at a certain point, but I actually mean it,” she said, asking Poehler if she'd seen Apple TV+'s The Gorge, starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Miles Teller. 

“In the movie, there's a cliff on one side and there's a cliff on the other side, then there's a gorge in between, and it's filled with all these like monster people that are trying to get them,” she explained, “I swear, when I watched it, I was like, that feels like what my grief is like… or what grief could be like, where at all times, there's a giant ocean of awfulness, that's, like, right there, and I can see it. Sometimes I just want to dive into it, and just be in it. Then sometimes I just look at it, and sometimes I try to get away from it. But it's always there.”

Ever-present as that grief may be, Poehler was very quickly able to get Plaza laughing again with a quip about how Taylor-Joy “is an example of… the more beautiful you are, the more spaced out your eyes are.” You can watch the full interview below:



Plaza and the Baena family previously released a brief statement following the filmmaker's death. “This is an unimaginable tragedy,” the statement read. “We are deeply grateful to everyone who has offered support. Please respect our privacy during this time.” Baena was 47.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Jimmy Kimmel doesn't think there's a ""snowball's chance in hell"" that Colbert was losing money","https://www.avclub.com/jimmy-kimmel-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-losing-money","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 02:37:00 GMT","

He might have an invested stake in late-night TV enterprise, but Jimmy Kimmel doesn't believe CBS and Paramount's reason for canceling The Late Show With Stephen Colbert was “a purely financial decision.” The Late Show remains the format's most popular program, and, in fact, makes lots of money, according to Kimmel. Speaking to Variety, Kimmel calls reports that Colbert's show was losing $40 million a year “beyond nonsensical.” How does he know? He makes one of these. Apparently, “these alleged insiders” analyzing budgets don't know what they're talking about, Kimmel argues. For one thing, they focus solely on advertising and ignore affiliate fees. Affiliate fees, or carriage fees, generate hundreds of millions of dollars—”probably in total billions”—from stations around the country. Those station affiliates cannot produce as much programming as NBC, so they pay the network for programming, which includes late-night shows. “You must allocate a certain percentage of those fees to late-night shows,” he continues. “It really is surprising how little the media seems to know about how the media works. There's just not a snowball's chance in hell that that's anywhere near accurate.”

Apparently, Kimmel has more optimism toward late-night viability than, say, TV-personality-turned-podcaster Conan O'Brien. Still, he admits that there's “no question” of network TV's decline, but “more people are watching late-night TV than ever. I include Johnny Carson in that. People may find that shocking.” Okay, let's hear him out.

According to Kimmel, at Carson's peak, The Tonight Show averaged around 9 million viewers a night with “the lead-in shows getting 30 and 40 million.” Today, it's more fragmented. People are watching the shows “in different places,” and there are more of them. Until The Late Show debuted, it was essentially just Carson. Today, Seth Meyers pulls 2 million views on “YouTube alone. We're not even talking about Instagram.” Kimmel's monologues “get between 2 and 5 million.” Jon Stewart gets 5 million. If you add online views to TV ratings (in Kimmel's case, an average of about 1.77 million per night) and DVR, you get pretty close to Carson. Anyway, he's right that people still watch this stuff, including the president, who watches enough of it to be mad at these guys and predict their cancellation all the fucking time.

Unfortunately, there's no way for Chris Pratt to know what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is getting up to in the government. Because Kennedy (the cousin of Pratt's mother-in-law) has jumped “on the bandwagon with who is the most divisive president ever”—a polite way to describe Donald Trump—it makes sense to the actor that Kennedy is “made to look terrible,” Pratt says during an appearance on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast. “And so I don't know what to believe.”

If only there was some way to make an informed judgement about Kennedy's policies. If other people are making RFK Jr. look terrible, how else is Pratt supposed to determine the truth? He can't just ask the man himself, despite the fact that he's “spent a number of occasions hanging with him, just in a strictly family dinner kind of vibe,” Pratt says. “It's not like I say to Bobby, ‘Let's talk about this' while we're playing cards or having fun or having dinner. I'm not going to pick his brain to find out exactly which of those things are true. I just kind of assume that none of them are, and, for the most part, I wish him well.”

﻿

If Pratt can't ask Bobby himself, but he also can't trust anyone else's word on the subject, then there's simply no way of knowing what's going on in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But please don't imagine Pratt lives in complete ignorance, because he does have some vague idea of Kennedy's beliefs. “There's certain things [that RFK Jr.] oversees that seem to be supported in a bipartisan way—like getting terrible toxic stuff out of our kids' food. I think that's a great thing. If you just do that, that's amazing,” Pratt says. Unfortunately, Kennedy is not just doing that, but Pratt wouldn't know about it given he apparently doesn't believe stuff like news outlets or words directly from Kennedy's mouth. 

“I'd hate to be so mired in hatred for the president that any success from his administration is something I'd be having an allergic reaction to. To be like, ‘Oh, well, if they do it, I don't want it to happen. I'll put Clorox in my children's cereal myself!' Be reasonable here,” Pratt complains. (Imagine being scolded on what's reasonable by a guy who, in his own words, doesn't know what he's talking about.) The Parks And Rec alum observes that “There's certain things that would be a good thing to have,” which is true. It would be good to have mRNA vaccines, which helped end the pandemic, but Kennedy canceled $500 million in contracts for vaccine development; it would be good to have a division of the CDC monitoring lead exposure levels among children and managing prevention across the country, but that's one of the many important programs Kennedy cut; it would be good to have no dead bears dumped in Central Park trash cans, but, well, you know how that one ends. 

Pratt says he “got along really well” with RFK Jr. during cozy family gatherings. “He's funny, he's wonderful. I love him,” Pratt adds. Of the entire Trump administration, he declared, “I want them all to be successful.” What Trump, RFK Jr., and the whole gang consider “successful” might end up being disastrous for the country, but again, there's no way for Chris Pratt to figure that out.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Magic mirror on the wall, will Gal Gadot stop talking about Snow White by fall?","https://www.avclub.com/gal-gadot-snow-white-comments-clarification","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:44:00 GMT","

Gal Gadot is taking another bite of the poison apple and continuing to talk about Snow White‘s box office failure, particularly, yup, October 7's role in the flop. Over the weekend, comments Gadot made to an Israeli interviewer went viral. She said, “I was positive the movie was going to be a huge hit. And then October 7 happened.” It probably isn't advisable to explain a Disney remake's failure with “And then October 7 happened,” but that's what happened. However, more recently, Gadot attempted to clarify her statements on Instagram Stories, saying that she answered “from an emotional place.”

“When the film came out, I felt that those who are against Israel criticized me in a very personal, almost visceral way,” she wrote. “They saw me first and foremost as an Israeli, not as an actress. That's the perspective I spoke from.”

“The film didn't fail solely because of external pressures. There are many factors that determine why a film succeeds or fails, and success is  never guaranteed.”

Here are her full comments (per Hollywood Reporter):

“I was honored to join an extraordinary interview with inspiring  interviewers, whose questions go straight to the heart. Sometimes we respond to questions from an emotional place. When the film came out, I  felt that those who are against Israel criticized me in a very personal,  almost visceral way. They saw me first and foremost as an Israeli, not as an actress. That's the perspective I spoke from when I answered the  question. Of course, the film didn't fail solely because of external pressures. There are many factors that determine why a film succeeds or  fails, and success is never guaranteed …”

Would it have been so hard to say the dwarfs looked bad? But we digress. Namely, because much of the blowback toward the film surrounded her co-star, Rachel Zegler, who became a culture war target well before release. Such viral moments of Facebook outrage included the pearl-clutching surrounding her joking that Prince Charming “stalks” Snow White and posting “free Palestine” on Instagram. Two weeks after the movie bombed, a Variety report dropped the blame at Zegler's feet, framing her concern for Gazans, who are currently enduring a famine among many other alleged war crimes, as the reason for the film's failure.

Nevertheless, in Gadot's original sentiments, she said she “really had fun. Even working alongside Rachel Zegler. We laughed and we talked.” Still, it's a little rich to hear Gadot say there was “a lot of pressure put on celebrities, actors, creators to post against Israel” when posting against Israel can get you arrested and deported.

Here are Gadot's full comments from the talk show:

“I really enjoyed filming that movie, I really had fun. Even working alongside Rachel Zegler. We laughed and we talked, we had fun. I was positive the movie was going to be a huge hit. And then Oct. 7 happened,  and what happened all over in different industries, not just Hollywood, there was a lot of pressure put on celebrities, actors, creators to post against Israel. And it happened. I can always explain and try to give people in the world context about the situation and the reality in Israel, and I always do that. But at the end, people make up their own minds. And I was disappointed that the movie was incredibly affected by all of that and that it didn't do well at the box office. But it is what it is, you win some, you lose some.”

Sharon Stone knows a thing or two about Basic Instincts. She's starred in two of them. Having played Basic Instinct‘s femme fatale, Cathrine Tramell, in Paul Verhoeven's 1992 original and the 2006 sequel, Stone must've been surprised to hear that Amazon MGM reportedly paid Basic screenwriter Joe Eszterhas $4 million to write an “anti-woke” reboot. How does one un-woke the infamously progressive tale of a coked-out detective shooting two tourists before becoming the target of an icepick-wielding murderer? And isn't “sleepy” the opposite of “woke”? Why would anyone want a sleepy erotic thriller? That's for Eszterhas and his $4 million to figure out. In the meantime, Ms. Stone would like to send the team behind the reboot a hardy “good fucking luck.”

“If it goes the way the one I was in went, then I would just say I do not know why you would do it,” Stone told The Today Show while drawing on her Basic Instinct 2 experience. “I mean, go ahead, but good fucking luck.”

No luck needed. It won't be easy coming up with an erotic thriller based entirely on being annoyed that a co-worker included preferred pronouns in their email bio. But that's a knot for the millionaire screenwriter to untangle. Considering MGM blew $70 million on the 2006 sequel for a return only slightly more than they're paying the screenwriter, their instincts are working just fine.

Summer vacation looks good on longtime HGTV star Alison Victoria, who's been turning heads with her latest social media posts, full of photos from a 2025 getaway to Greece alongside her filmmaker beau, Brandt Andersen. 

In two separate posts on August 16 and 17, Victoria — whose new show, “Sin City Rehab,” premieres in September — shared multiple photos of herself posing in a hot pink string bikini at the beach. Fans flooded the 43-year-old designer's posts with compliments and questions about how she stays so fit. 

A post shared by alisonvictoria (@thealisonvictoria)

Over 8,000 followers liked Victoria's first post, which she captioned, “Postcards from Spetses 🇬🇷💙🩵.” Spetses is a small island that Vogue has called “the Greek elite's favorite holiday hotspot.”

Victoria's post included photos of her on the shoreline, a video of her diving into the water, a collection of seashells, a snapshot of her enjoying a meal in a yellow bikini, scenic views, and an image of her and Andersen's legs intertwined as they sunbathed. 

The “Windy City Rehab” star thanked one fan who wrote, “I've followed you for years and I have to say, this is the happiest I've ever seen you and I'm so happy for you because you deserve it!! ❤️”

Fans and friends flooded the post with compliments, with many calling the pics “stunning,” including Victoria's fertility doctor, Roohi Jeelani. 

One fan wrote, “My favorite HGTV designer! Love ya girl! Looking stunning per the usual! 🔥”

Another commented, “Wow! What is your workout routine? Seriously post a video based on workouts and nutrition! 🖤🤍”

A post shared by alisonvictoria (@thealisonvictoria)

Victoria's second post from Greece, on August 17, began with a pic of her sunbathing in her pink bikini while floating on a bright yellow inner tube. Other snapshots included her posing in her swimsuit with her back arched against a tree trunk and another as she stood on her tiptoes in front of a white wall near the ocean. 

Fans celebrated her pics on that post too, with one writing, “looking amazing girlie!! 😘” and another calling her “smokin' hot.”

Other pics Victoria shared included Greek design elements like charming doors and windows, picturesque scenes of boats on the water, and multiple shots of her and Andersen snuggling. 

The couple went Instagram official in June 2024, when Victoria shared multiple photos with him at the Daytime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, when “Windy City Rehab” was nominated for an Emmy. The couple has traveled all over the world together during the second half of the year as he promoted “The Stranger's Case,” his feature film directorial debut. 

On January 31, Victoria posted a carousel of photos from another tropical getaway with Andersen, beginning with a sultry pic of her in a different string bikini, leaning in as she kissed Andersen aboard a catamaran.

Tamra Judge has always been a wild card on the “Real Housewives of Orange County.” If there is chaos and drama, then she's usually the one stirring things up. Season 19 has been rough on Tamra, who has found herself dealing with a lot of personal issues in therapy. She has also been rocked by her good friend, Teddi Mellencamp's, stage 4 cancer diagnosis.

Things came to a boiling point during Episode 6 of Season 19's RHOC, and the reality star stormed out of a cast dinner in New Orleans, insisting that she is done filming. Andy Cohen recently offered an update during “Watch What Happens Live” on Tamra's status with the show.

“Real Housewives of Orange County” cast member Heather Dubrow joined Andy in the clubhouse on Aug. 14, 2025. She and Andy discussed the explosive fight, with him asking, “Did you truly believe she was quitting?” Heather then replied with, “Yes and no.” Andy then confirmed that Tamra did not quit, leading Heather to quip, “It's like her implants, they always come back.

So there you have it, straight from Andy Cohen. At this moment, Tamra Judge is still with RHOC.

In Episode 6, near the very end, the ladies went to dinner together in New Orleans. Tamra got into an argument with several of the women before finally getting up to leave. She would then go to a separate area of the restaurant and ask producers to call her car. Once inside the car, she called her husband, Eddie Judge, to help her book a flight home.

While discussing the evening in question during a confessional, Tamra explained, “I feel not loved and not wanted. And I don't think there's a place for me in this group.”

“I'm done. I'm out. I don't need this. Bye,” she told Eddie, and then she posted an Instagram Story, seemingly teasing her exit.

Tamra recently told Bravo's Daily Dish that she has leaned on Teddi Mellencamp this season, and that comes with some guilt attached.

“I felt guilty because during filming, she'd be like, ‘How are you? I'm like, ‘I'm crying. It's horrible. The girls are horrible to me.' And she would say, like, ‘Honey, you got this.' And I'm like, ‘Wait a minute, I should be saying this to you, you know?' But she's an inspiration for sure,” Tamra explained.

How do you feel about Tamra sticking around for more RHOC? Is it time for her to make an exit?

Check out part of Heather Dubrow's interview on “Watch What Happens Live” below!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","RHOC's Tamra Judge Dishes on Her Marriage","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/rhoc-tamra-judge-marriage-update-eddie/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 14:02:34 GMT","

Fans of the “Real Housewives of Orange County” are well aware of how difficult a time Tamra Judge has had lately. She has been on her own healing journey while trying to support Teddi Mellencamp through stage 4 cancer, and then Tamra jumped back into the Bravo TV mix. Outside looking in, it all seemed like a perfect storm of stressors that could easily lead to precisely the kind of meltdown that Tamra has had.

Luckily, Tamra has a great support system in place, beginning with her ride or die husband, Eddie Judge. She recently chatted with BravoTV.com about how Eddie has helped her navigate one of the toughest years of her life.

When the reality star was asked about how Eddie has handled her emotional roller coaster, Tamra said,  “My husband has been my biggest supporter, my biggest cheerleader. He loves me so much, and he just wants me to do what's right for me or what's healthy. And he's always there for me, so I can't complain.”

Season 19 of the “Real Housewives of Orange County” has been full of ongoing conflicts, and then it seems to have just ripped the band-aid off of Tamra's old feud with Gretchen Rossi.

“You guys are watching my emotional journey happen right here on The Real Housewives of Orange County. It's been definitely a difficult situation for me because I'm not really great with my emotions, but I'm trying to get through it the best that I can. Stop judging me.”

Tamra's breaking point in filming came during a cast trip to New Orleans, the last place that she had traveled to with Teddi. She was already emotional, and then a dinner loaded with conflict was the last straw. She stormed off and then ended up in a car on the phone with Eddie, asking him to book her a flight home.

“I feel not loved and not wanted, and I just don't think there's a place for me in this group,” Tamra later explained in a confessional. While she appeared to quit the series, Andy Cohen recently gave an update on Tamra's status on “Watch What Happens Live.”

When RHOC cast member Heather Dubrow joined Andy in the clubhouse on Aug. 14, 2025, and they discussed the explosive fight. Andy asked Heather, “Did you truly believe she was quitting?” Heather then replied with, “Yes and no.” Andy then confirmed that Tamra did not quit the series.

Do you think that Eddie's rock-solid support will be enough to anchor Tamra through another season on RHOC?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","A New Pair Rises to the Top of Most Successful Celeb Couples","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/beyonce-jayz-richest-celebrity-couple/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:25:41 GMT","

When it comes to power couples, there's no pair who have racked up more success than Jay-Z and Beyoncé.

According to a new study by the custom apparel company ooShirts, the musical duo have now surpassed media mogul Oprah Winfrey and her businessman boyfriend Stedman Graham in net worth.

And perhaps more shocking – the Carters have a combined net worth that is nearly double that of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.

Here's how it breaks down.

According to the ooShirts study and confirmed by Celebrity New Worth, Beyoncé has an estimated net worth of $700 million. Jay-Z meanwhile has a portfolio that puts his estimated net worth at a whopping $2.5 billion. That gives the couple a combined net worth of $3.2 billion.

According to the new study by ooShirts, Oprah Winfrey and longtime love Stedman Graham's combined net worth weighs in at $3.11 billion, with all but $10 million of that coming from Oprah.

By comparison, Taylor Swift currently has an estimated net worth of $1.5 billion. Travis Kelce's net worth is currently estimated at $90 million, giving the couple a combined net worth of nearly $1.6 billion. 

Though Taylor's forthcoming 12th album, “The Life of a Showgirl” is bound to add to that number.

A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)

The study says that Jay-Z and Beyoncé's combined fortune, “represents the largest entertainment-based wealth accumulation by any celebrity partnership.”

But how did they get here?

Beyoncé's recently finished “Cowboy Carter” tour raked in $407.6 million in just 32 shows. That makes it the highest grossing country-music tour in history. It's also the shortest tour in any genre of music to gross over $400 million.  

Another record-breaker, Beyoncé is now the first American artist to have two separate tours gross more than $400 million each. The “Drunk In Love” singer's 2023 Renaissance World Tour grossed $579 million wordwide.

Meanwhile, husband Jay-Z has found skyrocketing success by diversifying. The rapper, producer, songwriter, and businessman became a billionaire in 2019 with a portfolio that includes not just his music but fine art, a cognac company and vast real estate holdings.

Jay-Z also owns equity in SpaceX, Oatly, Ethos, Uber and Sweetgreen, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Another interesting fact of the new study is something Beyoncé already told us in a song.  

Who runs the world? Girls.

Of the top five most successful power couples on the study's list, Beyoncé and Jay-Z are the only ones where the larger portion of the wealth is the man's.

“What's remarkable is how many of these relationships show women leading wealth generation, particularly through business ventures rather than traditional entertainment roles,” said the ooShirts spokesperson.

In addition to Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift each bringing substantially more wealth to the table, Selena Gomez and Benny Bianco come in fourth place with a combined wealth of $1.35 billion.

Of that, $1.3 billion, or all but $50 million comes from Selena.

The same is true for the couple at the number five spot- Rihanna and Asap Rocky.  The couple have a combined net worth of $1.02 billion.

Of that, $1 billion is from Rihanna, $20 million from Asap Rocky.

Did we learn nothing from “Rounders”? “The Card Counter”? “California Split” and “Mississippi Grind”? Gambling! It's not for everyone!

But is it, in fact, for Lord Doyle? Well, that remains to be seen in Edward Berger's upcoming return to Netflix, “Ballad of a Small Player.” Adapted from the 2014 Lawrence Osborne novel of the same name, Berger's first post-“Conclave” feature follows Colin Farrell as said small player, the wonderfully (and seemingly falsely) named Lord Doyle, who is having a real tough time with this gambling thing. Perhaps he should have pursued a different sort of hobby.

 










Per the film‘s official synopsis: “Lord Doyle (Colin Farrell) is laying low in Macau — spending his days and nights on the casino floors, drinking heavily and gambling what little money he has left. Struggling to keep up with his fast-rising debts, he is offered a lifeline by the mysterious Dao Ming (Fala Chen), a casino employee with secrets of her own. However, in hot pursuit is Cynthia Blithe (Tilda Swinton) — a private investigator ready to confront Doyle with what he is running from. As Doyle tries to climb to salvation, the confines of reality start to close in.”

In the film's first teaser, things sure aren't looking too good for Farrell's character, as he careens through the neon-accented environs of Macau, Las Vegas, and beyond. (Also, anytime Tilda Swinton is on your tail, it's cause for alarm.) Things might be looking better for the star and his director, however, as the film readies for a TIFF premiere, with other festival berths to be announced soon. Farrell will also be on hand to receive the Golden Icon Award at this year's Zurich Film Festival.

The film isn't just a reunion for Berger and the studio behind his previous smash hit “All Quiet on the Western Front,” it also sees him getting the band back together with much of the crew from that same film, including Academy Award-winning cinematographer James Friend and composer Volker Bertelmann. 

Netflix will release the film in select U.S. theaters on Wednesday, October 15, with a streaming release to follow on Wednesday, October 29. Check out the film's first teaser trailer below.

The 1970s weren't just a turning point in American cinema — they were a full-blown revolution. It was a decade defined by the collapse of the studio system, the rise of the auteur, and a generation of actors willing to push themselves to terrifying, tender, and frequently transcendent extremes.  

The best film performances of the 1970s didn't just anchor great movies — they were the movies. Jack Nicholson's foul-mouthed, big-hearted turn in “The Last Detail” wasn't just riveting — it became a defining portrait of military disillusionment and the fragile masculinity hiding behind bravado. Al Pacino, with a simmering intensity that felt like it could ignite the screen, gave us multiple landmarks — from the moral corrosion of Michael Corleone in “The Godfather” films to the desperate vulnerability of “Dog Day Afternoon” (only one of which made this list, that's how tough it was to form). 

But the decade wasn't ruled by men alone. Shelley Duvall's haunting, raw-nerved presence in Robert Altman's “3 Women” remains one of the most enigmatic and underappreciated performances in American film history, while Gena Rowlands delivered something close to divine in “A Woman Under the Influence” — a performance so emotionally naked, it redefined the boundaries of screen acting. 

Outside the mainstream, new kinds of stars emerged — some from the margins, some from the underground. Divine exploded gender and performance conventions in John Waters' transgressive midnight movies, becoming a cult icon whose presence was both confrontational and oddly sincere. Eiko Matsuda, in Nagisa Oshima's “In the Realm of the Senses,” gave herself over to a role that blurred the line between performance and lived experience, in one of cinema's most controversial love stories. Linda Manz, barely a teenager, brought a poetic authenticity to “Days of Heaven” that directors still chase today. And Richard Pryor, whether playing it straight in “Blue Collar” or channeling rage and truth through comedy, proved that honesty could be as combustible as any monologue. 

Selected from a decade filled with many of the big screen's most indelible performances, here are the 30 we believe (and hope) best represent the full scope of an iconic decade in cinema and the stars that made it shine. 

This article includes contributions from: Christian Blauvelt, Sam Bodrojan, Jake Cole, David Ehrlich, Kate Erbland, Marcus Jones, Proma Khosla, Ryan Lattanzio, Vikram Murthi, and Christian Zilko.

IndieWire's ‘70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street's “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY' is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre's '70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22.

If you ask a Hindi film fan what they could imagine different about “Sholay,” they'd probably say nothing — but push far enough and their most non-negotiable sticking point will likely be Amitabh Bachchan. Bachchan owned the 1970s, with hits including “Namak Haraam” “Zanjeer,” “Abhimaan,” “Deewaar,” “Chupke Chupke” “Don,” and many more. In many of those films he embodied the “angry young man,” a hero or antihero going against the establishment for personal gain or something more noble.In “Sholay,” that man is Jaidev, a small-time criminal and half of the iconic team Jai and Veeru (Dharmendra). The friends are inseparable but also minimally alike; Veeru loves drinking, gambling, and girls, and Jai mostly loves playing harmonica, teasing Veeru, and flipping a coin to settle their minor disputes. Shrewd, dry, and armed with both a pistol and a sarcastic comment, Jai grounds the mischievous duo with his older brother energy (and also makes all their decisions, but that's kind of a spoiler). His affection for the widow Radha (Jaya Bachchan) gets a mere fraction of the screentime devoted to Veeru courting Basanti (Hema Malini), but stays true to his compassionate nature and desire for a different life.For all his stoicism and gravitas, Bachchan's performances reveal profound, expertly calibrated emotion. He will make you cry without shedding a tear himself, make you laugh without even the slightest smile. His stature naturally commands a frame and captures the eye, but his presence made him the biggest superstar the world had seen to date. There is no “Sholay” without Jai, and no Jai without Bachchan. —PK

Even if Francis Ford Coppola's opus had been content to be a simple gangster movie, a larger-than-life gravitas would still have been required properly play Vito Corleone. At its core, “The Godfather” is a story about the inexhaustible gravitational pull that our families have on us, and that force is initially derived from one man whose presence is so strong that he can bend his sons and soldiers to his will with the subtlest of facial expressions.

But “The Godfather” is not a simple gangster movie. From Amerigo Bonsera's iconic opening declaration that “I believe in America,” Coppola made his ambitions nakedly clear: He was telling a story about the very fabric of the United States, using a family of immigrants who got very rich as a way to explore the country's seemingly contradictory principles of family loyalty and unrepentant personal ambition. The tension between old and new ways of doing things intersected at one man, an all-powerful mafia Don who retained the loyalty of his community's old-school traditionalists who frequently benefitted from the very norms he selectively followed himself as he prepared to pass a more dangerous world onto his children. The role could have only been played by someone woven into the fabric of America itself.

Enter: Marlon Brando. A former heartthrob who played some of the most significant protagonists of mid-century American drama on both stage and screen, he was an instantly recognizable figure with unimpeachable dramatic bona fides. With his '50s and '60s heyday firmly behind him, he entered the New Hollywood era with a new look and an earned calmness that reflected a lifetime's worth of hard lessons. His take on the Corleone family patriarch was loving and sadistic in equal measure, but never allowed his poker face to slip and reveal his true intentions. It was a career-defining performance from an actor who had already given us two or three of them, filling every vacuum of power and energy that Coppola left in the frame for him and still leaving enough meat on the bone for a guy named Robert De Niro to win an Oscar telling his origin story. —CZ

In a decade that would dominate any list of Hollywood's most iconic and enduring performances, Ellen Burstyn's turn in “Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore” (1974) remains one of the most revolutionary. Under the direction of a young Martin Scorsese, Burstyn delivered a raw, emotionally charged performance that feels less like acting and more like life itself unfolding onscreen. It's a portrait of female resilience that helped redefine what a “leading lady” could be in American cinema.   Burstyn plays Alice Hyatt, a recently widowed woman who packs up her life and hits the road with her young son, chasing the dream of becoming a singer while scraping by in a world that doesn't make space for women like her. The film — part road movie, part character study — is grounded entirely in Burstyn's layered, humane portrayal. She's vulnerable, funny, furious, exhausted — often all in the same scene — and never once does it feel performative.   Burstyn fought to get this movie made, handpicking Scorsese after seeing his “Mean Streets,” and insisting on a more naturalistic, unvarnished take on a woman's experience. The result is one of the most authentically female-centered studio films of the '70s — and a performance that earned her a well-deserved Oscar.   What makes Burstyn's Alice so compelling is her refusal to be boxed in by genre or archetype. She's not a saint or a victim or a manic pixie dream girl, she's just a woman trying to survive and maybe even thrive. In the process, Burstyn crafted one of the most fully realized characters of the New Hollywood era. “Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore” may be remembered as Scorsese's early foray into female-driven storytelling, but it's Burstyn's film from start to finish, and her performance remains one of the decade's most essential. —KE

Erica Benton is an unremarkable woman. A wealthy Upper East Sider and recent divorcee, she spends the film on a journey of self-discovery repeatedly thwarted by the destabilizing neuroses of various men. The foibles and revelations of her life are not unique. A lesser actor would play Erica as the standard deviation of womanhood. Jill Clayburgh, though, does not settle for the easy mantle of audience surrogate.

Clayburgh routinely rejects the obvious and relatable. She offers peculiar cues to those who come into her orbit, beyond what words alone could muster. Rubbing her cheek against a telephone pole, she moves with an unmediated honesty. Watching her performance here feels proximal to watching your best friend do the dishes. Not only can you see every layer of her being in the most mundane actions. By the end, as she's stuck carrying a massive painting down the streets of New York, barely visible behind the gift of a man who has left her, you know that — even if the canvas evaporated — you'd still be able to pick her out from a crowd in a heartbeat. —SB

Not since Marlon Brando sauntered into frame in “The Wild One” was there a clearer before and after moment in American screen acting than the slo-mo, Stones-scored introduction of Robert De Niro as the volatile street rat Johnny Boy in “Mean Streets.” With a cracked-glass grin and a permanent “I'm not touching you” caginess with gangsters running dangerously low on patience for Johnny's shtick, De Niro became the first great portrayer of Martin Scorsese's most frequently recurring theme, that of the myriad ways and seeming biological imperative some people have to be the architects of their own destruction.

De Niro's performance marked the logical next step for method acting, not merely imbibing a character to the point of lived-in believability but of being the on-screen embodiment of a film's entire aesthetic approach. As Johnny Boy, he captures exposed-nerve immediacy of “Mean Streets,” and he would similarly convey the visual variations of Scorsese's subsequent explorations of masculine id, or the carefully composed, outwardly respectable mask over brutality that defines Coppola's classicist treatment of the mafia. But if the actor would soar to greater heights from here, the indefatigable swagger of Johnny Boy, a louche march to doom, remains one of the most gripping, nerve-wracking sights in cinema history. —JC

The embodiment of John Water's cinema of anti-assimilation, Divine at times seems less like a person than footage of a hurricane making landfall. All of the pair's collaborations are marvels of taboo-shattering anarchy, but neither director nor star were ever better than in “Female Trouble.” Divine plays hell-raising teen runaway Dawn Davenport, who doesn't so much run afoul of trouble on the road as bring it with her like a plague carrier. Hungry for fame, Dawn clings to any person who feeds her ego, no matter how reciprocally vampiric the relationship.

In some respects, the film is a poisoned love letter to Divine, at once elevating her character to genuine stardom even as the infamy that others ravenously consume implicates every echelon of respectable and underground society in the worship of fame for its own sake. And yet, if Divine takes the hyper-individualism and consumption of the Me Decade to its most outlandish extreme, she also radiates strength to all the outcasts rapidly being suppressed by the reactionary forces seeping into politics and culture. —JC

Robert Altman and Shelley Duvall were up there with Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, or Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, in terms of prolific and alchemical filmmaker-actress pairings — minus the fact that, unlike those other duo, there's no indication Altman and Duvall ever dated. Altman plucked Duvall out of a house party she was hosting in Houston, Texas, to cast her in “Brewster McCloud.” Then came “McCabe and Mrs. Miller,” “Thieves Like Us,” “Nashville,” and eventually “3 Women,” the dreamlike and fittingly Bergmanesque SoCal folie-à-trois born from Altman's dream.

In a Cannes Best Actress-winning performance, Duvall plays senior health spa worker Millie Lammoreaux, a sexually liberated chatterbox who takes Pinky (Sissy Spacek) under her wing and won't STFU about her dating life, her favorite recipes, or her roommate situation. Or, for that matter, about her downstairs neighbor Tom, who doesn't seem to care if she's alive or dead. And is she alive or dead? You could argue that Millie, Pinky, and Willie (Janice Rule) each represent one third of the same female psyche — so does that make any of them an actual real person, or is no one real at all?

Regardless, Duvall's offbeat charm and specifically weird quality is at is most rapturous ere, a termite of a performance that tears down the already tenuously structured house of “3 Women” and gnaws into your own psyche and soul in the process. It's understood now that Duvall's turn was heavily improvised, with the actress ad-libbing many of Millie's rambling monologues — an approach perfectly suited to Altman's characteristic overlapping audio. It's a testament to the fact that no one else could have played Millie. I don't know who Millie is, but Duvall is she, and maybe she is Duvall. Or so she would appear at any given moment in this unforgettable film. —RL

The postmodern Philip Marlowe is a man stuck out of time, self-aware of his outmoded place in society, or at least the clichés inherent to the private eye in contemporary society. But he soldiers on anyway, knowing that he has a job to do, or at least a cat to feed. The genius of Elliott Gould's performance lies in how he embodies this idea without over-indicating its historical or literary subtext. Robert Altman and Leigh Brackett's adaptation of Raymond Chandler's “The Long Goodbye” compresses, alters, and molds the famous private eye for the cynical “Me decade.” Once-sacred conceptions of loyalty or decency have gone by the wayside in favor of selfishly immoral, violent attitudes that throws the modern dick into sharp relief. Gould flits through his world with comfort and skepticism, his face constantly piqued with curious amusement. It's only when a good friend asks Marlowe for a favor and then later turns up supposedly dead, making the put-upon detective a suspect in his demise that he learns how alone he really is in the world.

Altman wanted to call his protagonist “Rip Van Marlowe” to illustrate that his protagonist had been asleep for twenty years. But Gould never plays the character like an anachronism, just someone comfortably alienated by his environment, filled with brutal gangsters and topless hippies. He feels obligated to clear his buddy's name by a moral code that no longer exists. Gould mostly plays the detective like a cool cat, but he believably registers rage the moment he feels his concerns aren't being heard by his investigator peers, or when he learns that he's getting shortchanged by supposed allies. He comes alive the minute his betrayal and disappointment bubbles to the surface. The pigs were right: your friends can't be trusted, and the world has either already gone to shit or it's well on its way. In the end, all Gould's Marlowe can do is fiddle with a harmonica while America burns. —VM

New Hollywood shook up the possibilities of mainstream American drama, but it too rarely applied the same principles to comedy. Nobody did so better in front of a camera than Charles Grodin, who superficially mined some of the same neurotic insecurity that typified Woody Allen's protagonists but instead of wielding it as a defense mechanism revealed it to be a facade of humility masking the most retrograde masculine ego. In the process, he pioneered modern cringe comedy.

Grodin's finest showcase remains Elaine May's “The Heartbreak Kid,” which doesn't so much mine the same screwball conventions as her previous “A New Leaf” as turn them inside out. Grodin's Lenny is so hapless at every facet of social behavior that it's easy to forget at times that he is attempting with all his might to cheat on his wife on their honeymoon. Grodin makes every desperately placating grin, every effort to maintain decorum a visible gesture to reinforce Lenny's narrative of control, which makes their flimsiness all the funnier. —JC

Gene Hackman established one of the movies' greatest ranges across four short years in the early ‘70s, a span bookended by his preening, toupeed Lex Luthor in “Superman” on one end and his singularly implosive turn as his Harry Caul in “The Conversation” on the other.

Movies are rarely built around characters this passive: Caul's surveillance expert is a listener by trade, someone content to fade into the background and let others be the characters in his own story. And Hackman, to his eternal credit, let himself be directed by Francis Ford Coppola like he was more a piece of furniture than an actor in the traditional sense. The plot of this chilliest of art films — an experimental diversion from Coppola's blockbuster responsibility of directing “The Godfather Part II,” released the same year — is basically Caul summoning up some semblance of agency and conscience when he suspects that his employer is planning the murder of the man and woman he's been hired to surveil.

So much of the film is Coppola's camera trained on Hackman's blank face as he's either listening in or staring out. Few movies have ever featured a character this devoted to living in his own head. A sex scene basically happens to Caul while he's lost in thought. By the end, his fears being his only reality, Caul essentially makes his apartment — his external space — reflect the disorder of his internal life. He tears up the walls in the vain pursuit of a listening device he's sure has been planted, until he's living amid the rubble of his own making, his headspace transmuted into physical reality. It's fitting for a film where he's essentially architecture for its director, though architecture has never born the weight of anxiety quite like this. —CB

Japanese cinema embraced gory and titillating exploitation in the 1970s as a means of winning back audiences lost to TV, but no one upended the chauvinist framings of this genre like Meiko Kaji, who radiated such ferocity in films like “Lady Snowblood” that even her most victimized characters seemed all-powerful. Nowhere are her skills more evident than in the “Female Prisoner Scorpion” films, which at first blush resemble any number of rape-revenge movies until you look closer into the vacant expression of Kaji's Matsushima and see a balance of trauma and rage that the genre almost never achieves.

Kaji explores remarkable nuances to an ostensibly blank character across Shunya Ito's original trilogy, but nowhere more so than in “Beast Stable.” There she transcends corporeality itself becoming more of a wrathful yurei spirit trapped in a purgatorial loop forced to relive her own abasement and bear witness to that of other women. The rage that propels the first two films collapses into a pervasive melancholy as Kaji reduces an already minimalist performance into near-catatonia. But in the same way that Japanese painting emphasizes focus and depth through under-sketching and absence as much as detail, the actress only enhances the terror of Matsu's wrath by obscuring it. —JC

Klaus Kinski's feral performance as the demented conquistador Lupe de Aguirre — determined to discover and lord over the golden city of El Dorado — is all the more affecting for how it preserves a sense of divine calm amid the character's increasingly grandiose delirium. The actor's jagged face had long struck Werner Herzog as the only human landscape that could fully convey the destructive indifference of nature itself, and here, in the first of their violent and spectacular collaborations, Kinski is so possessed by mad pride that he seems to wield the wrath of god to the same degree he suffers from it. 

Movie characters have never been more primitive, but in a film so cut to the bone — a film whose abject denial of poetry suffuses every scene with an inescapable unreality — Aguirre's wide-eyed purpose is no less divine than Herzog's determination to capture it on camera. “I am the wrath of God,” he says to the confused Amazonian monkey he clutches in the final scene. “Who else is with me?” No one has ever been more certain of themselves. And no one has ever been more lost. —DE

It's hard to overstate just how big a deal martial arts movies were in the U.S. in 1973. In 2025, non-English language movies are rarely ever #1 at the weekend box office, but weekend after weekend in 1973 was topped by Hong Kong exports, and not just Bruce Lee vehicles but also films like “Lady Kung Fu,” “The Shanghai Killers,” “The Hammer of God,” “Karado: The Hong Kong Flash,” “Five Fingers of Death,” and “Deadly China Doll” — literally all number one movies at the U.S. box office that year.

But Lee was unambiguously king. It remains one of the stupidest things in Hollywood history that the U.S. market didn't recognize Lee's capacity to lead features until he moved to Hong Kong and made three smash-hit movies, two of which, yes, were also #1 at the U.S. box office: “The Big Boss” and “Fist of Fury.” After those successes, Warner Bros. finally teamed up with him to make “Enter the Dragon,” a deadly-contest movie that set the stage for decades of rip-offs to come.

Lee plays an undercover agent tasked with infiltrating a crime lord's private island lair by entering the villain's “to the death” martial arts tournament, and he shows how ridiculous Hollywood's refusal to use him before this really was. He has the charisma of James Bond, and — unlike any of the actors who've ever played 007 — the skill to actually provide his own fight choreography. Lee also shows something that the greatest actors understand, as pointed out recently by Tom Cruise: He shows he knows exactly how to calibrate his action depending on where the director, Robert Clouse, positioned the camera and cinematographer Gilbert Hubbs put his lights. There are moments when Lee's body is given extra sculptural texture by the lighting in a way that's absolutely no accident. It also shows that Lee wasn't interested just in making it all about himself. He wanted a movie that was cinematically compelling as well as being his ultimate showcase, and in the “Lady from Shanghai” riff that is the hall of mirrors showdown, “Enter the Dragon” certainly delivered. —CB

Who is Wanda? “Wanda” — the film, not the woman — is the Rust Belt horizon, the 16mm grit of New Hollywood, the dreadful escalation of a nihilistic feminist fable. Wanda, on the other hand, is a cipher, a martyr, and an antihero. A woman of few words and only vague motivations, the camera often loses track of her silhouette within the composition. Barbara Loden, who served as the film's director, writer, and star, has developed a vision of the American woman as defined by the courts, factories, cars, and men that suffocate her, such that her performance could easily be deemed incidental to the overall project.

Yet Loden the actress refuses such a designation. Her performance is unglamorous and self-effacing; Wanda moves through the world as if she has never considered that anybody might be watching her. As she washes her face in a bar bathroom sink, you'd believe she's never looked in a mirror like the one six inches from her nose. Most close-ups on Wanda occur not when she is not speaking. In these moments, Loden manages to etch a whole life into her cheekbones. It is the kind of shattering work that no other actress would have the space or courage to pull off, had not made the opportunity for herself. —SB

Terrence Malick has always eschewed the precise science of Hollywood storytelling in favor of something more abstract and alchemical. He shoots endless amounts of beautiful imagery before taking his time trying to weave it all into something coherent. His process is capable of delivering results that are nothing short of transcendent, even if it forces him to rely on finding magic in unexpected places.

In “Days of Heaven,” that unexpected magic was Linda Manz. You'd be forgiven for not expecting the star of a film about a love triangle between two farm laborers and a dying grain magnate to be the younger sister who tags along for the ride, but Manz embodies the character of Linda with a haunting wisdom that stretches far beyond her years — and a screen presence that adds layers of depth to a film that might have otherwise gone down the road of a simple period romance. 

Malick's late-in-the-game decision to have Manz record stream-of-consciousness narration is one of the great creative epiphanies of his career. Her verbal descriptions of the fiery divine judgement she sensed on the horizon and the premature sense of aging that she felt at 15 years old tied the entire film together, giving Malick's romantic shot compositions enough biblical angst to bring things back down to earth. And it's Linda's presence that drives home the cosmic pointlessness of the made-for-Hollywood plan hatched by Bill and Abby. She's too young to play a real part in shaping the plans, but is left to shoulder so many of the consequences. Stuck between her physical youth and her spiritual old age, it should come as little surprise that she ultimately follows in her brother's footsteps by running away from her problems. —CZ

Famous for amputating her lover's penis after consensually asphyxiating him to death during sex, and then walking the streets of 1930s Tokyo for more than four days with his severed dick held tight in her hands, Sada Abe had already become something of an urban legend by the time Nagisa Oshima dramatized her past with “In the Realm of the Senses” — a film that threatened to sensationalize Abe's story even further than it had been already. And yet, ravenous and trembling, Matsuda Eiko transforms Abe's larger-than-life hunger into something indivisibly human as her character succumbs to her terminal sexual mania. 

A struggling former sex worker who begins an affair with an affluent hotel owner, Sada is what an American rom-com might refer to as “a clinger”: She ends her first night with Kichizō (Fuji Tatsuya) by kissing the head of his penis with the intensity of someone holding a John Cassavetes close-up, and tells him that she wants him inside of her at all times — she wants to erase the boundary between where he ends and she begins. The viscous bond they forge in isolation as the country gears up for war around them is powerful enough to collapse the various divides that would keep them apart in the outside world, class and money being chief among them; if Sada is initially vulnerable to Kichizō because of her husband's debts, she finds a rare ecstasy in not having to think about them at all. It's an ecstasy that Matsuda refuses to surrender even after things cross the line from horny to pathological, her unflinching performance afire with the need to stay in the truth of what she knows. She may never seem particularly rational, but at no point in the movie does she ever seem insane. In Matsuda's tightening grip, Sada isn't out of her mind — she's a woman who resists the rising tide of militarism by embracing violence as a mercy rather than an obligation, and in the process of doing so she sets two people free. —DE

Of all the anti-establishment characters Jack Nicholson played during his unparalleled run from 1968 through the early 1980s, Billy “Badass” Buddusky stands tallest, if only because his smirking, middle-fingered attitude emanates from a position within the government. A Navy lifer who knows that his branch of the service runs on petty bureaucracy administered by corrupt actors, Billy pulls the soul-sucking detail of shepherding a hapless 18-year-old seamen to the brig in Portsmouth for an eight-year bit because he stole $40 from the wrong charity box. He and his partner know that they're carrying out cruel, spiteful orders, so they decide to show their charge the best time before they ruin his life.

Nicholson imbues his character with a potent mixture of “fuck you”-swagger and melancholic regret. His wiry body language and furious temper suggests a man who's had to eat a lot of shit he didn't deserve, so he'll take any opportunity to cut loose or fight back. It's righteous when he bellows to a racist, dictatorial bartender who won't serve his compadres that he is, in fact, “the motherfucking shore patrol, motherfucker,”because you're constantly aware of how many similar people he's had to deal with his entire life.

But Nicholson's performance wouldn't be so fondly remembered if he didn't also project fundamental kindness and concern towards Randy Quaid's Meadows. Billy can see how innocent and unprepared the kid is for what's ahead, and he redirects his guilt into a mission of mercy. His defiance is one of empathy, which makes the shame on Nicholson's face after he ultimately complies with his orders all the more devastating. Everyone's a badass until the man above tells you to fall in line. —VM

You could fill half a list of the 1970's 25 best performances with Al Pacino roles alone, and the guy was only in eight movies that decade. Most of the ones that come to mind are larger than life: Frank Serpico, Sonny Wortzik, Arthur Kirkland. Michael Corleone might be among the quietest parts that Pacino has ever played, but he casts a larger shadow than the rest of those guys combined, and remains one of the most dangerous characters in the history of American cinema. And yet, it's Pacino's performance as the hapless and childlike Frances Lionel Delbuchi in Jerry Schatzberg's “Scarecrow” — a stunted former sailor who drifts across the United States with a dream of reconnecting with his ex in Pittsburgh, and becoming a proper father to the child he's never met — that endures as the purest expression of the actor's humanity. Of the man behind the method. 

Pacino has since become synonymous with bursts of rage and bellicose exaggeration, but his heartbreaking evocation of a lost puppy like Frances — a “Lion” in name only — is so deeply stained with the self-delusion required to keep Vietnam-era America on its feet that the character's supposed innocence soon begins to feel like a lie that he needs to keep telling himself. It's absolutely wrenching to watch Pacino fight to maintain an equilibrium between agony and obliviousness, and when he loses that fight after a cheapshot in the movie's final minutes, Frances' howl of pain sounds louder than anything the actor has ever screamed into a camera. —DE

By the time Richard Pryor appeared in Paul Schrader's debut film, he had already become a legendary stand-up and a bona fide movie star. A downbeat Marxist heist film, “Blue Collar” wasn't exactly the four-quadrant good-time of “Silver Streak,” and yet the “Taxi Driver” scribe clearly saw the righteous fury and beaten-down resignation evinced in the comedian's persona. A Detroit auto worker constantly a dollar short, Pryor's Zeke agrees to rob his union with fellow workers Jerry (Harvey Keitel) and Smokey (Yaphet Kotto) only to discover the union's mob ties and illegal loan operation. Pryor and his co-stars famously didn't get along, and the volatile comic got into a couple of scrapes with the young director during production. But none of that interpersonal animosity reaches the screen. Pryor's combustible energy and sweetness radiates from the screen just as much as his rage and dissatisfaction. You can see how much he loves his buddies and also how willing he'd be to sell them out either for just a little bit of power.

The tragedy of “Blue Collar” lies in how our beloved pawns can't perceive their status. Zeke has been beaten down by his job and humiliated by the IRS (“If I had the navy and marines behind me, I'd be a motherfucker too!” he chokes through tears as he kicks the tax man out of his home), so he's happy to take a cushy union job in exchange for keeping quiet about the corruption, even if that means getting in bed with people who sold out one friend and killed another. Zeke never realizes how management co-opts his fury for their benefit, which makes his eventual venal turn all the more heartbreaking. Like a true show-biz veteran, Pryor plays righteous outsider and smug insider with aplomb. Schrader and Pryor understand the awful truth: A big enough paycheck can get even the most principled man to roll over and expose his belly. —VM

One may ask what hell Diana Ross wrought by blazing the trail for so many now-famous clichés. Clichés like: pausing a thriving pop music career to give acting a try, and earning a first Oscar nomination for leading a music biopic. But there is good reason why Ross should be the blueprint that later artists have tried to follow. Taking a cue from the fact that “Lady Sings the Blues” is only loosely based on the life of Billie Holiday, Ross shirks doing any sort of outsized impression in favor of a performance that gets to the root of what makes the tragic jazz icon's story worth revisiting.

Playing on the persona she already had as the leader of The Supremes, Ross holds the center even in the meeker moments of Holiday first starting out, and then unleashes as her character's life takes a turn for the worse. A seasoned performer, Ross uses every square inch of her body to invoke the sea of emotions that made Holiday's music continue to haunt listeners. However melodramatic the film may lean, it is not a showcase that completely sucks the air out of the room either. Some of her best highlights are opposite Billy Dee Williams, with whom she quickly re-teamed in “Mahoghany” three years later. Still, ever a star in every sense, Ross needs only lipstick and a mirror to provide an all-timer of a breakdown scene that condenses what a taxing experience it is to be the forerunner for so many Black musicians having to introduce themselves to a wider audience. —MJ

Gena Rowlands is such a great actress that she has spawned generations of bad performances. Her raw, improvisational style is replete with massive hand gestures and erratic vocal swings. Every bit of her craft is surfaced in the work itself, legibly embodied via a meticulous psychological framework. Sure, one could spot this process in any undergrad drama program, where it often results in hackneyed and obvious attempts at pathos. Yet what Rowlands could pull off with those same tools was something special. She whipped through 24 frames per second in a way that surpassed any individual choice, school, method. 

In “A Woman Under The Influence, her greatest achievement amidst a dozen virtuosic efforts, she plays an unstable working-class housewife. Throughout the film, you see her studies paying dividends. You witness her smoke a cigarette and know that even her twitchy ring finger is no unrehearsed tic.  You watch her search, desperately, for some sign of herself in those around her. You see her conjure monologues like divine poetry from a heart that is imagined whole-cloth for the moment. Somewhere along the way it becomes totally real. Rowlands makes it all look effortless. She is the fundamental argument for the virtue of screen-acting as theory and craft. —SB

In the long history of self-destructive filmmakers who become romantically involved with their stars (stars who in turn become self-destructive themselves due to the nature of thag boundary-blurring relationship), few toxic partnerships have yielded a performance as exhaustingly moving and overwhelming as El Hedi ben Salem's in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's “Ali: Fear Eats the Soul.” A Moroccan immigrant living in Europe when the rapacious Fassbinder discovered him at a Parisian bathhouse, Salem eventually moved with the tireless and drug-addicted director to West Germany to be cast in film roles. And into Fassbinder's own bed.

Laconic but never stoic, tentative but never fearful, Salem had roles in “World on a Wire,” “The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,” “Fox and His Friends,” and “Martha,” but none were quite as raw or demanding as the title character in “Ali.” Transgressive in terms of its mixed-race and May-December romance elements, the film centers on 60-something housekeeper Emmi's (Brigitte Mira) relationship with Ali some time after the Munich massacre scarred Germany. Ali's English abilities are narrow, as were Salem's, but their attraction is unspoken, physical, and tacitly understood — as, likely, was Salem's with Fassbinder.

“Ali: Fear Eats the Soul” is a blatant (and beautiful) Douglas Sirk homage, but Salem's isn't a mannered or intentionally arch performance in that mode. If anything, his performance is at times blank and awkward, but Salem's relative inexperience as an actor soon gives way to something raw and unaffected. Whereas a character like this, in a film like this, could risk being reduced to a symbol of social critique, Ali isn't an issue — he's a person, which makes the film all the more devastating. Three years later, Salem hanged himself in a French prison after numerous disasters and tragedies linked to his relationship with Fassbinder, leaving behind an unimpeachable mark, a glorious, melancholy stain even, on the director's career until his own death in 1982. —RL

Bob Fosse's “All That Jazz” begins with Vivaldi on the soundtrack and a drop of Visine in the eye, and ends with a close-up on a body bag as the choreographer/director/writer recreates his own psychic and physical collapse circa the staging of “Chicago” and the editing of his biopic film “Lenny.” Roy Scheider — who earlier in the ‘70s helped steer the first movie blockbuster into harbor with “Jaws,” and lager trudged through apocalyptic rainstorms in Mexico for “Sorcerer” — is the immaculage Fosse stand-in, unjustly robbed of a Best Actor Oscar win for the movie IndieWire deemed the #1 film of the 1970s.

Scheider's background as an amateur boxer and an Air Force lieutenant appear to inform the physicality of many of his best roles. The actor plays creatively tormented stage director and filmmaker Joe Gideon, however, like a supernova collapsing inward to eventually reveal a dead star; the audience feels every discomfiting wince on his path toward boss-level self-destruction. The way Scheider massages his wrist repeatedly in the film as the noose of stress tightens around his neck can still make you feel viscerally like you might be dying, too. Because we're all walking time bombs, as Fosse argues here, and Scheider's carefully calibrated performance is ever like TNT perpetually on the edge of explosion.

That said, Gideon is a far cry from the actor's prior gritty roles in films like “The French Connection,” “Klute,” and “Marathon Man” — one ‘70s masterpiece after another, really — shifting toward the vulnerable and neurotic. Here Scheider careens from mania to soul-weary despair, like a spinning top that won't stop until it falls over (and even then puts up a fight). And despite all the self-loathing annihilation on display, Scheider's turn as Fosse — sorry, Joe Gideon — is no caricature or act of mimicry. It's an entirely sui generis creation. —RL

Rainer Werner Fassbinder assembled a formidable stable of recurring actors over the course of his brief but meteoric career, but few could capture the full range of his interests in political and personal power dynamics in modern German life than Hanna Schygulla. As the heroine of “The Marriage of Maria Braun,” she is a force of nature, a constant assertion of willpower who embodies Germany's postwar economic recovery and suggests that it was driven by the same uncompromising mindset that led the nation to fascist ruin.

In other words, it's all about putting the best face on a constant foundation, and Schygulla leans into that by making Maria consciously and subconsciously act out an ideal look of modernity and glamor. But she can't quite keep the glass-cutting diamond twinkle out of Maria's eyes, an impenetrable gaze that captures the entirety of both Germany's triumphant recovery and reintroduction into the international order and the moral failure to fully interrogate and amend the traits that damned it. Maria always stays one step ahead of acknowledging any sense of guilt or responsibility for herself, creating a pressure build-up so intense it can only be alleviated with explosive force. Even this, somehow, feels like it was Maria's plan all along. —JC

The formal radicalism of Chantal Akerman's “Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles” will likely always define its legacy. The decision to show one woman's routine of domestic chores with such uninterrupted redundancy, relying on repeated camera angles and endless takes of boiling and scrubbing with little more than diegetic sound, offered a brilliant expression of the idea that an exploited woman's monotonous life was just as deserving of a cinematic treatment as the heroes and villains we usually saw on the silver screen. And that the drudgery of those routines was something to be studied, not cut down for time.

Akerman's boldness was enough to ensure that “Jeanne Dielman” would have a place in film history textbooks for all eternity. But the fact that the film is still so ravenously watched can be attributed to the woman who rarely leaves the screen. Delphine Seyrig's performance as Jeanne Dielman tells a complete story without the benefit of any real dialogue or external action to guide her until its bloody climax. What begins as a woman who has internalized the necessity of her mundane duties as a borderline religious truth ends with a liberated cinematic figure who is impulsive enough to commit murder without any real plans for what comes next. 

The character transition rests on an offscreen orgasm that shatters her worldview — yet another opportunity for onscreen growth that's taken away from Seyrig. Yet her meticulous pivot from worker bee to radical never feels unearned, as Seyrig embodies each failed task with a subtle separation from a formerly dogmatic belief. What could have simply looked like burnt potatoes, dropped spoons, and ignored light switches in the hands of a lesser actress become deafeningly loud steps on the road to liberation with Seyrig in front of the camera. It's a performance worthy of the deep dive that Akerman decides to give her protagonist — and the fact that anybody who wants to abbreviate the film's wordy title drops the street address, but never the woman. —CZ

Terrence Malick has always had a flair for faces, he's always been able to see poetry in people who had yet to visualize it for themselves. And so when Malick met Sam Shepard — a handsome young writer whose genius had already manifested itself in a series of acclaimed plays — he wouldn't take “no” for an answer. Shepard simply had play the unnamed farmer in “Days of Heaven;” he was a man as beautiful and haunted as the wheat fields of Texas, lonely in his perfection and perfect in his loneliness. Shepard acquiesced. He rented a Ford Mustang, drove up to the film's Canadian set, and began his life as an actor. The movies would never be the same.Malick envisioned “Days of Heaven” as something of a silent film, or at least a movie in which nature would do most of the talking, but that wasn't a problem for an actor who had won a Pulitzer Prize for his way with words. Shepard immediately recognized that Malick's films were more visceral than anything else, that they were meant to be felt and not solved. Playing a creature of solitude who lives in the center of a swarm, Shepard focused on the friction between the immortal ruggedness of the farmer's image and the frailty of his body (and the pettiness of his jealousy). Shepard's performance made a nameless man feel larger than life, and the great shock of the movie is the realization that someone so monolithic could still be so mortal. —DE

“One day, while taking a look at some vistas in Dad's stereopticon, it hit me that I was just this little girl, born in Texas, whose father was a sign painter, who only had just so many years to live,” Sissy Spacek's Holly muses in voiceover not long after her sociopathic boyfriend Kit (Martin Sheen) murders her father and they embark on a doomed adventure together. Spacek's flat, curious voice dominates the soundtrack of Terrence Malick's debut feature, which uses the real-life Charles Starkweather murder spree to indirectly examine the hollow heart of American youth culture. Holly's passivity—a genuinely vacant demeanor that facilitates her go-along-to-get-along attitude—chills as much, if not more, than Kit's casual violence. Spacek conveys her character's mild interest in her fate, i.e., where she might end up even if that's the grave, but she rarely reveals an active opinion about it. Up until a crucial moment, when fear and possibly boredom overwhelms her indifference, she's quite willing just to ride passenger in someone else's story, hitched to the first cute guy who noticed her.

In the end, Holly gets out alive and becomes a member of respectable society, despite some “dirty looks” here and there. But it's never clear whether she ever reflects upon her participation in the brutality or would even know how. In crucial moments, her narration, scripted by Malick script, imitates what “reflection” might sound and feel like. Malick's palpable sympathy for Kit and Holly productively clashes with a sincere critique of their immorality, which manifests in disparate and gendered fashion. Society's to blame, for sure, and so are the parents, but Spacek's performance disturbs precisely because it's never clear how much she would care about those reasons even if they dawned on her. It's never clear if Holly even cares what happens to her, let alone the murders to which she's an accomplice. Spacek embodies sociocultural apathy years before Richard Hell sneered about the “blank generation,” a song that reinterprets Bob McFadden and Rod McKuen's “The Beat Generation” from 1959, coincidentally the same year that “Badlands” takes place. She really was ahead of the curve. —VM

Yep, there's Katharine Hepburn. Yep, there's Irene Dunne and Barbara Stanwyck. But Barbra Streisand not only embodies screwball comedy insanity as well as they ever did, in Peter Bogdanovich's flat-out masterpiece of a laugher — one of the funniest movies ever made — she becomes something else too. She becomes the closest thing to a flesh-and-blood Looney Tunes character. And not just because she's chomping on a carrot like Bugs Bunny while saying stuff like “I can take your igneous rocks or leave ‘em… I relate primarily to micas, quartz, feldspar.” She channels a madcap comic entropy that's absolutely singular in this movie, and essential for powering this ridiculous story about four identical plaid suitcases that get mixed up for zany results.

The timing and precision necessary for delivering the machine-gun patter of her dialogue, full of puns, Marx Brothers-style literal-mindedness, and wild non sequiturs, shows how Streisand wanted to be an actor before she wanted to be a singer. Not to mention she holds her own with a murderers row of comic talent including Madeline Kahn, Austin Pendleton, Kenneth Mars, and Stefan Gierasch — even having an extended conversation underneath a banquet table with several of them at once — as well as a never-better Ryan O'Neal as her straight-man foil. Only Barbra could make fun of O'Neal's sappy “Love Story” line “Love means never having to say you're sorry” while batting her eyelashes. “That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard,” O'Neal says. —CB

Liv Ullmann delivers so many shades of depression and unfulfillment throughout her work with Ingmar Bergman in the ‘60s and ‘70s, but “Autumn Sonata” is unique for featuring a moment so great, so profound, so unforgettable that it serves as a pinnacle for their entire partnership. It's the moment when Ullmann's Eva sits at the piano and plucks out Chopin's “Prelude No. 2 in A Minor” while her visiting mother (Ingrid Bergman, in her only role for the great director), a concert pianist, scrutinizes it.

Immediately, the mother sits beside her and shows Eva how it should really be done, and delivers a musically rich interpretation that puts her daughter's to shame. In that moment, while her mother is playing, the camera tracks ever more slowly into Eva's face as she stares at her mother. A lifetime of pain is there, all the unrealized hopes and expectations for their relationship written on Ullmann's face as she stares out from behind her glasses. There have been some great starers in the movies — Greer Garson, Kay Francis, Al Pacino — but this would be a first-ballot inductee into the cinematic staring hall of fame. The moment is naturally captured on the poster for “Autumn Sonata.” —CB

In “F For Fake,” inveterate showman and self-described “hanky-panky man” Orson Welles cast himself in the role that he was born to play (himself), only to reveal that it was the role that he'd always been playing to one extent or another. Which isn't to suggest that Welles ever fully disappeared into parts like Charles Foster Kane, Harry Lime, and Sir John Falstaff, or that he ever intended to in the first place (the man recognized that his intrinsic Welles-ness was too rapacious to hide), but to watch him swan through the scenes of his late career essay film about tricksters and forgeries is to see one of the great American raconteurs at his most honest and straightforward. It's to realize that, even in the twilight of his life, he was still the same impish jokester who convinced New Jersey it was being attacked by aliens, and to appreciate that the twist at the end of “Citizen Kane” wasn't mere sled-of-hand, but rather the core ethos of a man who believed that the world was better understood through misdirection — by what it tried to hide in plain sight.  

Guiding us through his quasi-documentary with the relish of a cabaret emcee and the agility of a close-up musician, Welles takes such obvious pleasure in the entire project that it begins to adopt the feeling of a confession, and even the cheekiest throwaway lines about his own career (such as “I began at the top and have been working my way down ever since”) soon become freighted with implacable truth. As a result, the bluster of Welles' screen persona becomes unusually porous, giving way to an uncharacteristic humility. “F for Fake” is a work of pure ego (“Do you think I should confess?,” Welles asks, allegedly quoting an art forger. “To what, committing masterpieces?”), but it's also such a dazzling performance of that ego that it can't help but suggest that the iconic figure known as Orson Welles is a lie unto itself. One that, like all of the best lies, helps us to realize the truth. —DE

Erin Brown Thomas submitted to film festivals more than 900 times before she made it into the Harvard of indie cinema, AKA Sundance. Ask the multi-hyphenate “Chasers” filmmaker and artistic director of Salute Your Shorts Fest — an annual film event that returned to Los Angeles this weekend (August 15-17) for its ninth year — about her recent achievement, and she'll give you pithy advice like a private movie tutor.

“A prophet's going to prophet, even if there's no profit,” she recently quipped of her passion to IndieWire. 

A psychologically lush episodic pilot shot as a 31-minute oner, “Chasers” sees Brown Thomas reflect on the many personal and professional sacrifices she feels she had to make to compete in entertainment. The fearless filmmaker has faced a lot of headwinds over the years but continues to find comfort in the Salute community, which balances artists with unique POVs and supporting authenti, good craft.

“Balancing convention with invention is one of the sweet spots in our lineup at Salute,” explained Brown Thomas. “Our mantra has always been, ‘Films with aftertaste.' When we give you a laurel, it means we believe you have a future. Whenever someone picks the festivals they're submitting to, I always tell them they should make sure that that laurel they could win actually means something. Ours absolutely does.”

 










Salute Your Shorts brings together a growing network of like-minded creators each summer. Co-founded by Brown Thomas and Becky Murdoch in 2017, the small but mighty fest takes place at the Assistance League Theater in LA. “For eight of our nine years, we've been in our current venue,” said Brown Thomas. “People might know it from ‘The Office,' the TV show, because Andy does a play there. But it's nestled behind Home Depot and Target in Hollywood, with a wonderful projector and only 300 seats.”

In 2025, lead organizer Brown Thomas, executive director Elle Shaw, and programming director Lauren Reid Brown (Brown Thomas' mother) received just over 1,300 submissions for Salute. The staff, which also includes programmers Jillian Corsie, Vincent DeLuca, and Kath Tolentino — and associate programmers Christopher Francis and Anna Long — showed about 60 films in 16 awards categories. 

“Having someone close to you who really believes in your thing, who will tell you that whatever festival that rejected you is so stupid and that they are just so wrong, is vital,” Brown Thomas said of dealing with rejection. “You need that. With distance, you'll either learn that you weren't ready and you're improving, or that they really were stupid and they were wrong, and hey! The people who love you already knew that.”

 










The Assistance League Theater feels distinctly intimate and SoCal, but Salute Your Shorts pushes the boundaries of storytelling in a broader philosophical sense with its programming. IndieWire judged the genre section and awarded the top prize to Zoe Davidson's “Clementine,” with “Two People Exchanging Saliva” from Alexandre Singh and Natalie Musteata named as our runner-up.

Over the years, acclaimed filmmakers — from the beloved Duplass brothers to the Daniels of “Everything Everywhere All at Once” — have visited Salute. “A Lien” from executive producer Adam McKay went onto the 97th Academy Awards and was at the festival last year. Salute aims to become an Oscar-qualifying shorts competition in the future. Its documentary, animation, and narrative contests are juried.

In honor of the 9th Salute Your Shorts Fest, IndieWire pays tribute to bite-sized films with nine essential tips for festival submissions from Brown Thomas. Find a complete list of winners for SYSF 2025 below. 

Once you know about FilmFreeway, your potential in the festival world grows exponentially.

“Up until the day that I decided that I wanted to make a film festival, I had only been using it as a filmmaker,” said Brown Thomas. “Then, I did a little clicking around and I figured out you can create a film festival just as easily as you can create a film profile. That's truly all it takes.”

 










Creating a compelling first impression anywhere online can be time-consuming, but Brown Thomas says it's specifically worth it for artists on FilmFreeway. Not only does the portal allow you to explore new festivals, but it can also help you keep track of who you've already paid to screen your short. If you learn that a certain type of competition isn't working for your project, then you can adjust the types of festivals you're submitting to — or improve the impression you're making by fixing your profile first.

“A lot of filmmakers really don't use their page to their advantage,” said Brown Thomas, walking IndieWire through her evolving appreciation of the platform. Her first suggestion? “Not enough people invest in hiring a poster designer,” she said. “Really. More people will see your poster over the span of your career than your movie. Whether they're on FilmFreeway or IMDB, that's a fact.”

No amount of marketing can fix a bad movie, but as a programmer, Brown Thomas has learned that you can “teach” festivals how to consider your work while screening. “The first audience you're marketing to is programmers,” she said. “And you can show us how to see your film through the way you choose to talk about it and in the images you choose to accompany your application.”

 










After you've finished your project (and beefed up your profile and poster for FilmFreeway), Brown Thomas recommends thoroughly combing your application to ensure that your enthusiasm shines through. Whenever possible, filmmakers should aim to play festivals that want to show their movies — but that's a two-way street and it's important to express your earnest desire for the opportunity.

“Look, there are plenty of cases with Salute where I haven't cared that their poster was terrible, or whatever,” she said. “But sometimes, you have to make a choice and it comes down to feeling like you can tell how much this filmmaker wants it, but ‘Oh, this person seems like they just submitted to submit.'”

Festivals can use smoke and mirrors too, of course. “Scam is a spectrum,” said Brown Thomas. “On one far side, you've got the people who are not following through on their basic promises. These are often online events that either don't exist or feel totally different from what was advertised.”

You can save yourself a lot of hassle by doing your research, but if you've already submitted to a seemingly legitimate festival, and you're not getting good results, there can be nefarious reasons for that too. “Without naming names, there are plenty of festivals that just do not put enough care into programming,” Brown Thomas said. “Maybe there's less rhyme or reason as to what's getting selected, or it could be, ‘Oh, wow, these people are really only selecting their friends.' That's a version of a scam.”

 










There are festivals in the middle, as well. “It can also be, ‘Well, this festival is doing everything it says it's going to do, but it doesn't add a lot of value,'” she said. “You'll think, ‘They're nice people, and they mean well. But that laurel just doesn't mean enough.' Always ask, ‘Is this how I want to spend my money?'”

Much like recruiters at universities, festival organizers will consider different criteria depending on the lineup they're programming for, and their choices can shift based on any number of factors. You should have a matrix of considerations for when and where you apply with your film, as well. 

“One category of festival that I definitely think is worth submitting to is the Tax Deductible Vacation,” said Brown Thomas, giggling. “This is a business trip where you are going to have a lovely time. Think of like, the Sedona International Film Festival or the Hawaii Film Festival. If you've never been hiking along those beautiful vistas, and you think you can take your film there, take your film there.”

Another festival type to consider? Something Brown Thomas likes to call “The Artist's Date.” Citing two beloved events for the filmmaker in Colorado — Crested Butte Film Festival and Ouray International Film Festival — she said, “They feel almost like an artist's residency. These are really well-curated events where the scenery is beautiful too. Very Julia Cameron, having a date with your inner artist.”

 










Filmmakers should also seek out the Best of the Best Networking. Rubbing elbows with folks at Sundance helped gain “Chasers” prestige, but Brown Thomas knows better than most that you can find critical connections in all kinds of places. “Great networking is usually horizontal,” she said. “You want to play alongside really good films so the peers that you meet are people you will actually connect with.”

Smaller fests are often geared toward fostering local talent, and that can be a great place to start if you're just beginning. (Heck, take a page out of Brown Thomas' book, and found your own event!) But being based in Los Angeles, Salute Your Shorts presents a unique challenge to its programming team.

“My local audience is people who make movies,” said Brown Thomas. “So, they're going to be much harder on certain things. They're going to be much more unforgiving about bad acting, for example, whereas someone in middle America might be OK with a more amateurish performance if it's for the story.”

Programmers see the world through a cinematic lens, and filmmakers do too. It was combining those skillsets that made Brown Thomas succeed, she said. Honing the Salute schedule for nearly a decade was essential to her work on “Chasers,” and watching movies will help you figure out what to make. 

 










“What you choose to champion over and over again is revealing and teaches you something about yourself,” said Brown Thomas. “I really recommend getting on the other side if you love festivals.” 

Having been on several film festival juries, this IndieWire writer can personally promise you that people like Brown Thomas love to stump for underdogs. For all her advice to stay ambitious and engaged with the short film community, the director is equally quick to emphasize not letting perfectionism get in the way.

“At Salute, we're more concerned with voice than polish,” Brown Thomas said. “Being memorable is more important than being perfect. Because there could be a film that didn't quite work — but if what they were trying to do was interesting, and it's like 90 percent of the way there, and I can't stop thinking about it, then I want to figure out how to program it and I want to find a way to show it.”

Asked for some of her favorite festival submissions at Salute, Brown Thomas listed “I'm Happy, I Promise,” “The Burden,” “Starfuckers,” “Little Grey Bubbles,” and “The Robbery” as standouts.

A short doesn't always have to pave the way to a feature film, but duration can seriously impact how smaller projects do on the festival circuit. You'll find different advice out there, and as always, there's no accounting for taste. But Brown Thomas offered unique insight into what works at Salute.

 










“I've always had a soft spot for the longer ones, and I tell you, I find that anything over 22 minutes in our system generally does not feel too long,” she said. “I find that things constantly feel too long between 15 and 22 minutes. Anyone who's doing something over 22 minutes knows that their short is freaking long, but they usually have a point and they're doing everything they can to keep it as tight as possible.”

Yes, artists have a hard time killing their darlings — but that's what makes film competitive. 

“Pacing and knowing what to leave out are the largest elements of craft that people overlook,” Brown Thomas said. “A lot of filmmakers don't want to cut things because they can't find anything that's bad, especially in comedy. But you have to ask yourself, ‘How long does this concept deserve to be?'”

That said, more is still more when it comes to social media. After “Chasers” was accepted at Sundance, Brown Thomas went semi-viral on Instagram calling her cast and crew to tell them the great news. 

“When I got the call that we got in, I was hysterical and really wished immediately that I had seen my reaction,” said the director. “I turned to my husband and my mom who were with me at the time, and I was like, ‘Start recording me. I'm going to call everybody.' I made a reel out of everyone's's reactions and that got a lot of attention online. I called at least 40 people. We had over three hours of footage.”

 










Sharing that joy with the internet has allowed countless fans, including IndieWire, to follow along with “Chasers” since it premiered at Sundance. Brown Thomas says she chooses to embrace social media as a means of “future-proofing” her career and thinks other young artists should do the same. She posts her successes as much as her failures in an effort to always bring her audience “along for the journey.”

“The creator economy is the most foolproof way that we have of charting a path forward,” Brown Thomas said. “It's the one place we have the most agency. The wins, the losses, the learning opportunities, the, ‘Holy shit, I got lucky!'s — your audience wants to be invited into that.” And they are your audience. 

“Literally, you are assembling an audience every time you can get over putting your face on camera,” she said. “This is something you are in charge of. As I go into my next feature, I know I want to share everything that happens to me on set because it will keep me excited about tomorrow.”

A palpable love of storytelling makes Brown Thomas almost militantly optimistic about cinematic education and artistic possibility. Certainly, she's as intense as anyone who co-founded an event called Salute Your Shorts should be. On the night of the awards ceremony, the filmmaker got stuck between a rock and a hard place when she found herself busy handing out awards at Salute — while “Chasers” was busy winning the Best TV category at HollyShorts Film Festival, also in Los Angeles.

 










“Elle Shaw, who produced it, and Louie Chapman, our lead actor, went for me,” Brown Thomas later told IndieWire via text. “We got an e-mail saying we were nominated, but I had to introduce [our presenters] on stage during the exact time of the awards.” Notably, the indie pilot was up against Aneil Karia's “Big Man,” which was distributed by Apple TV+ and makes Brown Thomas even stronger in a stacked field. 

“I just thought you would find that irony very funny,” she said to IndieWire. Still, the artistic director for Salute Your Shorts and the filmmaker behind “Chasers” recommends finding time to relax and enjoy the movies with whatever free time you have. If you're championing the art of short film — even on your way to a feature! — then you should want to understand it and seek people out who can help you soar. 

“In 2026, I would definitely love to see an uptick in submissions because it means that even more people are finding us,” said Brown Thomas. “We're a really small team and we work really hard to make this happen. It's done through a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. It's a lot of love that pulls us together.”

Let's just say it: Hollywood creators look down on digital creators. The fashion gurus and family lifestylers and cats with nearly 16 million followers are all the rage, but they've got nothing to do with the work that goes into creating Oscar- and Emmy- winning film and TV. 

But what if all those Instagram and TikTok icons knew how to teach Hollywood veterans how to get an edge in being hired to create all that award-winning work? Instead of keeping a password-protected reel, why shouldn't an art director use social profiles as an engaging and public-facing portfolio?

 










That's the pitch for Flipping the Script, a two-day course sponsored by G&B's College of Influence. It's the online education arm of the 10-year-old management company, which reps more than 100 content creators (including the ones linked above). Now G&B wants to hand its playbook to Hollywood's below-the-line talent.

Before you give in to oh good, more influencers are just what we need, consider that when IMDb launched in the ‘90s industry response ranged somewhere between polite curiosity and WTAF. 

 










Today, an IMDb profile is the first thing anyone checks when hiring or starting a new job: Who are these people I'm working with and what are they about? However, the platform founded 35 years ago also shows its age: static profiles, clunky updating, and limited personalization.

It's not a stretch to imagine that personal branding becomes the new norm for everyone who makes Hollywood run. 

G&B director of education Joey Gagliardi reframes social media as a professional tool. “Why keep your reel hidden when you can publish your work, put paid [boosting] behind it, and build an audience that proves your skills?,” he said. “That audience can translate into jobs and collaborations.”

While the company brokers thousands of sponsorship deals each year for clients ranging from Chanel to Walmart, that's not the goal here. 

“I don't think at this time we're the most knowledgeable about how to take a film editor and get them into a brand deal,” said G&B founder Kyle Hjelmeseth. “We're teaching the tools that influencers have refined over the last 15 years. How to share your ideas, showcase your craft, and let people see your creative point of view.”

For crew members, it's less about follower counts and more about showcasing artistry — inventive editing, lighting rigs, or world-building — while also signaling they're available for work.

 










“It's an investment in yourself,” Gagliardi said. “You're building a brand, and that brand is what makes studios, producers, and eventually even audiences invest in you.”

So if Hjelmeseth and Gagliardi aren't looking to launch a division for craft artists, why the two-day seminar at Soho Works? It's the first in-person class for the online school, and it's free.

The G&B principals like to talk about sharing their tools and seeing what comes from it. “The innovative moment — the true mashup of entertainment and creators — hasn't happened yet,” Hjelmeseth said. “We want to be part of defining what that looks like.”

Sure, but there's also this: Teaching guild and academy members how to think like digital creators starts to level the playing field. When the establishment starts to behave like the upstarts, it gives the upstarts — like the people G&B manage — a leg up. 

“We've been doing this for 10 years. We know the tools, we know how this works,” Hjelmeseth said. “If we can give creatives a way to put their ideas out there and help them stay employed, that's worth it.”

It's also worth noting that the school creates custom, paid courses for consultations. If this really does become the new normal, how big is that market? One word: IMDb.

 










G&B and Soho Works will host Flipping the Script August 21 and September 4 at Soho Works in West Hollywood. Registration is free and limited to members of the film and TV academies as well as guild members. 

This essay from the Obsolete Media Substack celebrates the independent video rental stores that remain in business and wonders if an abundance of instant choice is eroding our ability to appreciate media. 

Independent filmmakers are constantly being told that distributors are unlikely to help them in the way that they might have 20 years ago, and that the way to succeed in today's marketplace is to take the business side of the equation into your own hands. It's great advice, but that means we have to learn the kinds of industry secrets that were once reserved for distributors and publicist. This breakdown of the annual film calendar and the best times for indie releases is a great resource for anyone with a completed film who is thinking about taking the next step.

 










A favorite topic of many film historians are the projects that our favorite writer-directors unsuccessfully tried to make. Writing for the Film School Sucks Substack, Adam Petrey offers an appreciation of the ways that unproduced screenplays from great filmmakers went on to shape their artistic development — and in some cases, even contributed to their legacies. It's a reminder that writing your passion projects is always a worthwhile endeavor, even if the current market seems unreceptive to them.

Quibi was one of the more public failures in recent entertainment history, but does its bet on big-budget, short-form narrative content make more sense with the benefit of hindsight? This essay explores whether Quibi could have worked in a different era or with better execution, circling around a question that will help define the next era of filmmaking: is the appeal of short-form content inherently tied to its DIY relatability, or will we ever see our movie stars and auteurs lending their talents to short-form stories?

Writing for his Amauteur Substack, filmmaker Adam Kritzer offers a detailed recounting of the kind of indie film rollout that's much more realistic than the pie-in-the-sky success stories we often hear: a premiere at a respected regional festival followed by an online release that failed to translate much of the interest it generated into financial value. It's a compelling read for anyone with even a passing interest in film distribution, and filled with vital lessons for filmmakers crafting their own release strategies.

Few stories have influenced the canon of Western storytelling more than Miguel de Cervantes' “Don Quixote,” but its author has never received his own moment in the cinematic spotlight. That changes this fall with Alejandro Amenábar's new film “The Captive,” which follows Cervantes as a 28-year-old sailor in the Spanish Navy who discovers his love of storytelling while confined as a prisoner of war. The film is set to have its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, and IndieWire can exclusively reveal its new trailer. 

 










An official synopsis for the film reads: “1575 — Algiers, Miguel de Cervantes (Julio Peña), a wounded 28-year-old Spanish Navy soldier, is held prisoner by Ottoman corsairs. A cruel death awaits him should his countrymen fail to pay his ransom soon; but within the confines of his cell, Cervantes discovers a surprising refuge — the art of storytelling. Crafted from resilience and hope, his stories enthrall his fellow captives, and capture the attention of Hasan (Alessandro Borghi), the enigmatic and feared Bey of Algiers, igniting a secret affinity between captor and captive. Suspicions rise amidst growing tensions in the city, and Cervantes, driven by an unwavering sense of optimism, devises a daring plan to escape.”

“The Captive” is written and directed by Alejandro Amenábar. The film stars Julio Peña, Alessandro Borghi, Miguel Rellán, Fernando Tejero, Luis Callejo, José Manuel Poga, Roberto Álamo, Albert Salazar, Juanma Muniagurria, César Sarachu, and Jorge Asín.

“The Captive” marks Amenábar's 11th feature film as a director and his first since 2019's “While at War.” That film appears to share some DNA with “The Captive,” as they both explore how traumatic events in Spanish history shaped the lives of one of the nation's most celebrated intellectuals, with “While at War” exploring the life of writer and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno during the Spanish Civil War. The Chilean-Spanish director has worked in a variety of genres over the course of his three-decade career, and IndieWire's David Ehrlich made the case in 2023 that his film “The Others” deserves to be remembered as one of cinema's best ghost stories.

Watch the trailer for “The Captive,” an IndieWire exclusive, below.

In 1971, Keith Carradine was a struggling young actor with only one film under his belt when he was summoned to Robert Altman‘s Westwood offices to audition for “McCabe & Mrs. Miller.” “I didn't even have an agent yet,” Carradine told IndieWire. Carradine arrived at the office complex and was sent upstairs to Altman's apartment, where he knocked on the door and heard the hottest director in Hollywood — who was fresh off the box office success of “M*A*S*H*” one year earlier — invite him inside.

“I opened the door and he was standing next to the bed wearing a bathrobe and a white T-shirt,” Carradine said. “He was unwrapping this package with brown paper and string around it, and he said, ‘I just got back from Colombia.' This is the '70s, so I'm thinking, what's he unwrapping here? Is it a brick of cocaine? It turns out it was a piece of Pre-Columbian art he had picked up at the Cartegena Film Festival.”

Carradine's “audition” barely lasted a minute. “He said, ‘Did you read the script?' I said, ‘Yeah,'” Carradine said. “He said, “Did you read the part?' I said, ‘Yeah.' He said, “Do you want to do it?' I said, ‘Yeah.' He said, ‘Okay.' And that was my audition. But that was Bob. He never asked anybody to read lines. He would meet you and he would speak with you, and he would decide if who he perceived you to be provided the right essence for the character.”

 










That initial meeting would ultimately yield an actor-director collaboration central to three of the best American films of the 1970s: the beautiful and haunting Western “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” in which Carradine played a sweet, naive, and ultimately doomed cowboy; “Thieves Like Us” (1974), Altman's remake of “They Live By Night” starring Carradine as a Depression-era bank robber; and “Nashville” (1975), a sprawling ensemble piece with Carradine as a self-absorbed folk singer.

The remarkable thing about Carradine's performances in these movies is that he's so natural and convincing in each that he seems to be playing himself in all three, yet the parts couldn't be more different from each other. Carradine concedes that there probably was a little bit of him in the character (listed in the credits as simply “Cowboy”) he played in “McCabe.” “At the age of 20, there I stood all innocent and wide-eyed and ready to take this adventure,” Carradine said of his state of mind when first meeting Altman. “That was what he wanted in that role — he wanted that kind of innocence.” 

Carradine said Altman's ability to read people and capture their essence on film was his greatest talent as a director of actors. “I don't recall him giving me any sort of specific direction, and I don't remember seeing or hearing him do that with anyone,” Carradine said, though he did remember a disappointing moment when he arrived on location with his long hair — which Altman had told him he could keep — and learned he would have to cut it for the part. “My face just fell because I had been growing it for two years, and Bob said, ‘Kid, if that's where your ego is at, it's in the wrong place.' I've never forgotten that.”

 










According to Carradine, Altman tended to shoot in continuity whenever possible, an approach that had a particular benefit on “McCabe,” which was partly about a new town springing up in the middle of nowhere. “Bob dressed all the construction guys who were building the town in period clothes, and he told everybody that was working on it that if they had a place where they wanted to sleep, they could camp out and make it their place,” Carradine said. “So there were people actually spending the night there and getting up to put on their period clothes, and that was going on in the background the whole time Bob shot the film. You saw the town grow.”

The next time Altman cast Carradine it was in a lead role, as the fugitive Bowie in “Thieves Like Us.” Carradine had no idea he was acting in a remake until he came across Nicholas Ray's “They Live By Night” on television the night “Thieves” opened in New York. “After the screening I went back to my hotel and was flipping channels, and I heard Cathy O'Donnell turn to Farley Granger and call him Bowie,” Carradine said. “The next day I asked Bob about it and he said, ‘Oh yeah, we're a remake.'”

In Altman's film, the Cathy O'Donnell role was played by Shelley Duvall, who had appeared in the director's “Brewster McCloud” and “McCabe” and would go on to work with Altman again in “Nashville,” “Buffalo Bill and the Indians,” “3 Women,” and “Popeye.” “Thieves Like Us” was her first big part, and her scenes with Carradine are among the most moving in Altman's oeuvre, sweet and funny and tragic all at once. “She was amazing,” Carradine said. “The fact is that all I had to do was show up and be present, because she had such honesty and energy, and an inability to be untruthful on camera. All I had to do was join in.”

 










The seeds for Carradine and Altman's next collaboration were planted during the “Thieves Like Us” shoot when Altman and “Thieves” screenwriter Joan Tewkesbury heard their star playing some songs at a party. “I had my guitar and I was playing some songs that I had written, and among them were ‘I'm Easy' and ‘It Don't Worry Me,'” Carradine said, referring to two compositions that would be put to brilliant use in “Nashville.” After hearing Carradine's songs, Tewkesbury wrote the folk trio of Bill, Mary, and Tom with Carradine in mind to play Bill — though things worked out a little differently in the end.

“I was originally going to play the role that Allan Nicholls played — Bill,” Carradine said. “The original Tom was supposed to be Gary Busey. Gary Busey got an offer to do a pilot for a half-hour comedy show with Jack Elam called ‘Texas Wheelers' and he dropped out of ‘Nashville' to do the pilot. When he dropped out, Bob moved me into that role. It was a role that was based on Gary Busey's energy, and I was not comfortable playing that guy.”

Carradine struggled on set, feeling that he didn't like Tom and didn't know how to play him, but when he asked Altman for help his director was dismissive. “He looked at me and said, ‘You're fine,' and walked away,” Carradine said. Carradine was more frustrated than ever, but he realized after the fact that Altman knew exactly what he was doing. 

 










“What you see in that movie is a guy who doesn't like himself,” Carradine said. “I wish I could take credit for having designed that, but that was just Bob capturing me, this young actor who was still insecure enough to feel as though the role that I was playing might reflect on me somehow. I didn't want people looking at me and thinking that's who I really was. I had an issue with that, and that's what's in the movie.”   

Carradine was, in his words, “stunned” when he was nominated for an Oscar for the song “I'm Easy,” and figured he had no hope of winning when he was up against songs performed by icons like Diana Ross and Barbra Streisand. “I didn't have a prayer, are you kidding?” Carradine said. “I was up against Berry Gordy and the Motown machine. Diana Ross gave her performance live from Amsterdam in a sleigh where it was snowing with all this production, and I'm sitting there by myself on the stage of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion with my guitar.”

Carradine was terrified performing on the broadcast and just wanted to get through the song without blowing it — and then he won. “I had nothing prepared,” Carradine said. “I did not write anything down or plan what I was going to say, because I just thought I'd be lucky to get through the performance.” At that point the song hadn't even been released as a record, but after the Oscar win David Geffen called Carradine about releasing a heavily produced version that was more elaborate than the version he sang in “Nashville.”

 










Once that record came out and started getting some airplay, the record company that owned the soundtrack rights to “Nashville” belatedly realized what they had and put out the soundtrack version of Carradine's song — meaning he was competing with himself on the radio with two versions of the same hit. “I wound up in the top ten, but I think if there had just been a single record out there without that confusion, I might have gone gold.”

Carradine says that while he might not have realized just how enduring “Nashville” would become, he did know he was working on something special at the time — and he knew that when Altman cast him in “Thieves Like Us” he had been given an incredible gift. “I felt as though Bob had given me the role of a lifetime,” Carradine said, “and I knew I was working with one of the great directors, so I was in a pretty heady place. And I knew when we were shooting ‘Nashville' that we were doing something really good — I didn't realize how good.”

A couple of years before Altman passed away in 2006, Carradine was in New York with his then-girlfriend, now-wife Hayley and they got together with Altman and his wife Kathryn for dinner. “We went to Elaine's, which was one of Bob's favorite hangs,” Carradine said. “I managed to have a moment alone with Elaine where I slipped her my credit card and said, ‘Do not let Bob pick up the tab,' because nobody ever bought him dinner. It just wasn't done. At one point I turned to Bob and said, ‘Bob, I just want to say something.' He looked at me like, what's this? And I said, ‘I just want to say thank you.' And it gave him pause. It stopped him cold. And he just said, ‘You're welcome.' I'll never forget it.”

Westerman has announced the new album A Jackal's Wedding. The British musician's follow-up to 2023's An Inbuilt Fault is out November 7, via Partisan. He wrote most of A Jackal's Wedding in Athens, Greece, and recorded it at Old Carpet Factory with producer Marta Salogni. Below, watch the video for lead single “Adriatic.”

Elaborating on the track, Westerman said in a press release: “I wrote ‘Adriatic' while failing at moving to Greece. I was trying to break outside of the confines of my immediate physical reality. Life is full of practical limitations in terms of having a body, or what you can afford in terms of money, etc., but you can always go to a place in your head where everything is possible, and the song is a celebration of reclaiming that. I hadn't written anything for a long time. I got very depressed after my first record; the whole experience was just so bad that I wasn't sure whether I wanted to make music anymore. Writing this song was taking back ownership of that creative space which is just my thing and it's powerful. There are periods in everybody's life where they feel like maybe they don't have any control over anything. It's the realisation that there's a part of you that they can't get to unless you allow for it, and you can always keep that space, even if it's buried; it doesn't go away as long as you remember that it's there.”

Westerman will support Nation of Language on tour soon. See his tour dates below.

Kaytranada announced his new album with a hedge: “This album is strictly for workouts, dancing, and studying for my people who love beats.” But compared to the overstuffed guest star extravaganza Timeless, AIN'T NO DAMN WAY! is a cool breeze of a record at just 34 minutes, all instrumentals, and only one feature credit. It lays bare the Canadian producer's preternatural gift for making beats that bridge the gap between hip-hop, house, and mainstream EDM, infused with the Haitian rhythms he grew up with. He's deep in the (comfort) zone here, sticking to what he does best: turning unlikely samples into deceptively complex bangers. It's the sound of an artist casually strolling into his imperial phase, where even his low-key tracks are brilliant, floating just a few inches above everyone else.

Put another way, AIN'T NO DAMN WAY! is a self-conscious return to Louis Kevin Celestin's earliest days, when a good Janet Jackson edit set off a chain reaction that led to him opening a whole Madonna tour in 2015. But this record is built with the experience and expertise of a decade spent in the FL Studio mines. Every drum hits with purpose, the basslines walk and burrow every which way, samples and voices are embedded in strange but intuitive ways. It's a beat tape that works as pop music for a generation of fans who have been conditioned to view instrumental electronic music as worthy of their attention, too, thanks to prominent representatives like Celestin himself.

First single “Space Invader” comes together with a loose and limber confidence rarely heard in contemporary dance music. At its core is an off-beat swing learned from artists like J Dilla and other iconoclastic producers. Kaytranada orbits around everything from mid-'80s Prince to peak-era Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to the skeletal future-funk of the Neptunes, who produced the Kelis song that “Space Invader” samples. But it's no mere remix. Celestin rearranges the vocals, Burial-style, so they make a phrase that doesn't exist in the original song, the meaning and emotions twisted into something new, and there's no trace of the original's oddball tropical funk. It feels classic in at least four different ways, but it's also glittering and modern, the rare example of an artist setting out to please everyone and maybe succeeding.

AIN'T NO DAMN WAY! is consummately smooth, but it rewards close reading and detective work. Brilliant things are happening underneath the gleaming surface: Just listen to how he twists 808 State's warm acid house classic “Pacific State” into overheated concrete jungle hip-hop complete with '90s G-funk squiggles. It's almost unrecognizable, but old-school techno heads can still clock it. Even more impressive is his flip of Tangerine Dream's “Love On a Real Train” with “Championships,” a Donuts-calibre edit that turns the German kosmische group inside out with very little left of its original mood or sound. Instead, it just sounds like Kaytranada doing a little Slum Village worship, instantly recognizable as his own music rather than a Tangerine Dream song. Speaking of Slum Village, there's also the stunning “Shine Your Light For We,” which reworks a Barry-White-via-Cappadonna sample into a beat that worships at the altar of Detroit legend Andrés: feel-good but rickety, joy with the barest hint of sadness underneath.

Still, AIN'T NO DAMN WAY! is so polished and unobtrusive than it can bleed together into a playlist of hi-fi beats to dance/work to, paritcularly on tracks like “Goodbye Bitch!” or “Backstabs,” which are technically impressive but just kind of plod to their end points, lacking the emotional pull of his best beats. But they still sound so good that it's hard not to get sucked into, say, the punch-drunk funk of “Goodbye Bitch!” and sputtering bassline. And the occasional bit of grit, like how the distorted low-end disturbs the dusty vinyl collector feels of the Steve Monite-sampling “Things,” offers something to hold onto amidst all the silk and chrome everywhere else. It's all about balance.

In an interview with Hypebeast after the release of Timeless last year, Celestin spoke about how he was over album campaigns, sick of overthinking and worrying about living up to his previous work. He found inspiration in the steady stream of releases from '80s R&B and soul artists: “They'd just make an album—12 songs, ‘here's how I feel,'” he said. “It could be their best album, their worst, or mid. Who cares? It's how they express themselves. I want my future albums to be that way, too.” That quote, taken with the one that announced the album, seems to be at pains to make a record like AIN'T NO DAMN WAY! out to be a trifle, a fun little side project without much weight attached to it. But that's what makes it essential, full of excellent music that occasionally transcends its context and occasionally doesn't, a generationally talented producer just doing what he wants to do.

Some bands sound like a bunch of college kids who thought it would be cool to speedrun the first three years of Arcade Fire, and Racing Mount Pleasant is one of them. Almost none have that as their actual origin story, but Racing Mount Pleasant is one of them. After an auspicious debut single, “Call it Easy,” the Ann Arbor septet truly introduced itself with its next release: a song named “Racing Mount Pleasant” that announced an album, also called Racing Mount Pleasant. This isn't just a band with grand ambitions; it's one that arrives with a mythology. The first melodic line on opener “Your New Place” recurs on the closer, “Your Old Place,” and the 53 minutes in between feature a litany of lyrical callbacks, a multi-part suite of “You” and “You Pt. 2,” and palette-cleansing instrumentals. This is a band that has thought in definitive statements from the start, yet all the grand gestures of Racing Mountain Pleasant arrive like foregone conclusions. It sounds like a group working hard to make a cathartic, cleansing instant classic of a debut, but one drawn from memory.

But man, it really can sound like a cathartic, cleansing instant classic. “Your New Place” immediately heralds the arrival of The Next Great Orchestral Collective, its every move either invigorating or inevitable based on previous knowledge of Great Orchestral Collectives. There's the scene-chewing, beatless introduction, the military snare rolls that signal the part where things start speeding up imperceptibly, the guitars that come in around that time that are distorted by sheer force of strumming. There are woodwinds and horns, jazzy chord voicings and orchestral flourishes that never go too far in classing up what still sounds like the work of 20-something friends sharing a house together. It's got the panoramic sweep of post-rock, but the intimacy of Midwest emo—call it Whenever, Bon Iver, or Maize and Blue Country, New Road.

It's not that far off from Racing Mount Pleasant's previous incarnation as Kingfisher, which produced Grip Your Fist, I'm Heaven Bound. While operating with more confident arrangements and production, Racing Mount Pleasant is still a project that oozes influence, every maneuver coming with footnotes. It's easy to talk about who they sound like, less so to explain what they are like. The lyrics sheet contains the raw elements of a novelistic breakup narrative: meet-cutes, betrayal, romance, sex. There's a recurring character named Emily, but she's never given any definition; the “34th floor/Of your new place” remains unknowable beyond a few pieces of interior decoration. The glacial chamber pop of “You” and “Call it Easy” strive for “cinematic” but lack a compelling narrator to drive the plot forward, an Isaac Wood or Justin Vernon or Win Butler or Tom Diaz losing their composure within the ornate compositions and creating enough friction to modulate the emotional arc. Occasionally, a satisfying jolt of dissonance arrives—the screeching horn blasts in “Emily,” gang vocals on the title track—but there's little here that Racing Mount Pleasant can call their own. Its signifiers of struggle can seem like a stylized streetwear pic in Carhartt —it's a damn fine tee, but are they really getting their hands dirty?

Bands and albums of this nature don't come around all that often. Great Orchestral Collectives need to exist in contrast to a default character, stressing the sacrifice and passion required to sustain such an unwieldy format and deliver what your average power trio or singer-songwriter cannot. That kind of drive is extremely volatile, and Racing Mount Pleasant evokes versions of the aforementioned bands that ran up hard against their expiration dates. Black Country, New Road completely inverted their songwriting process after Wood disappeared from public life; The World is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die shed members and now sound like a metalcore band; Bon Iver has never made the same album twice; and Arcade Fire have only returned to their core sound out of pure desperation. “My god, you've got excellent taste/You're a high risk, high reward,” Sam DuBose intones on “Your New Place,” speaking in character but also angling for a tagline for Racing Mount Pleasant. The band exhibits good taste; the rewards are high when you allow yourself to get caught up in the curation and craft. But their music lacks any proof that creating their masterpiece wasn't something they chose to do, but something they had to do—the result of the compulsion to be yourself completely and embracing all the risk that comes with it.

							By 

	Rob Sheffield



	An accident that's been waiting to happen since 2003: the sound of Radiohead onstage, five madmen attacking the Hail to the Thief songbook. The British rock kingpins' new Hail to the Thief (Live Recordings 2003-2009) is basically a track-for-track remake of their politically charged 2003 prog-punk gem, except with live versions, culled from different tours across six years. Since Radiohead rampaged through the 2000s as the planet's most ferocious live band, a fire-breathing five-headed rock behemoth, it's no surprise the performances are across-the-board great, taken from Dublin, Amsterdam, London, and Buenos Aires. 


Hail to the Thief is an outlier in the Radiohead story — it's the album you can always mention in a bar to get an argument started. Nobody really disagrees about the merits of Kid A or The Bends, but you can argue all night about Hail to the Thief, which is part of the fun. For some of us “There There” will always be the definitive Radiohead classic, the song you'd play for a visiting Martian who asked what this band was all about. There's nothing like the electric jolt of excitement that whipped through the crowd every night at the sight of the roadies wheeling out those “There There” drums for Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien to bang.

	











According to Thom Yorke, the inspiration for the new live package was Hamlet Hail to the Thief, a London theater production blending the Shakespeare play with the Radiohead album, fusing four centuries of murderous political dystopia. “I asked to hear some archive live recordings of the songs,” Yorke said. “I was shocked by the kind of energy behind the way we played. I barely recognized us, and it helped me find a way forward. We decided to get these live recordings mixed and released (it would have been insane to keep them for ourselves). It has all been a very cathartic process. We very much hope you enjoy them.”

	It's welcome news to see Thom Yorke suddenly remembering that there once was a band called Radiohead, and that they were actually very good at playing music. But he's right: it would have been insane not to let the world hear this. It makes you hope there's much more to come, since we have to presume Mr. Yorke did not immerse himself in six years' worth of such glorious live work to conclude, “Eureka! We should release exactly 47 minutes of this.”

Hail to the Thief dropped in the summer of 2003, while the world was still reeling from the one-two punch of Kid A and Amnesiac. Everything about it is divisive. It's their longest album, nearly an hour, but hardly diffuse, since it has a linear hard-rocking momentum unlike anything else in their catalog. It's got their most succinct skull-crush rage bombs, like “2 + 2 = 5” and “Myxomatosis” — the most punk album they ever made. 


	The band didn't play coy about the political anger fueling the album with a title plucked right from the headlines, after the Supreme Court's Bush vs. Gore coup of Dec. 12, 2000, blocking the state of Florida from counting its ballots and delivering the White House to the losing candidate. The loud, mean songs do justice to the political fury, but so do ominously quiet moments like “I Will.” The new live album cuts two tracks from the original studio album, “Backdrifts” and “A Punchup at a Wedding,” to bring it down to vinyl length, with 12 songs in 47 minutes. The vinyl version drops on Oct. 31.


	The weirdest thing about this album? It's only the second Radiohead live album — the first was I Might Be Wrong, from 2001, before Hail to the Thief even happened, and that was just eight songs. They also did their 2007 basement webcasts of In Rainbows (with killer versions of the Smiths' “The Headmasters Ritual” and the Joy Division/New Order stalwart “Ceremony”),  plus the less successful From the Basement reprise for The King of Limbs. But considering the collective magic that Radiohead made happen onstage, tour after tour, all through the 2000s, it's a puzzle there haven't been more archival releases like this. You'd have a tough time naming another 21st-century live band this legendary who've let their peak glory years go so underdocumented.

	It's surprising this album skims over such a wide range of time, rather than (say) focusing on their furious 2003 Hail to the Thief tour, a run never forgotten by anyone who witnessed it. (NYC's Madison Square Garden, 10/09/03 — damn good night.) Most curiously, they've never done a deep dive on their 2008 In Rainbows summer jaunt, a night-by-night serial epic that was followed long-distance by freaks across the world, via mp3 blogs. If you were a music fan that year, one of your joys in life was packing your iPod full of these absolutely bonkers shows. An anthology just devoted to that tour's nightly “National Anthem” or “There There” excursions would be a keeper in itself. 

	











	Radiohead previously released Kid A Mnesia in 2021, a reissue package celebrating the 20-year anniversaries of Kid A and Amnesiac, after doing the same for OK Computer with 2017's OKNOTOK 1997 2017. Yorke is also showing his first museum exhibit as a visual artist, This Is What You Get, in his hometown of Oxford, England. But these Live Recordings give hope that the band might finally open up some of the live treasures currently gathering dust in the vaults. If revisiting these songs was “very cathartic” for Yorke, there's even more greatness where this came from.

Jason Isaacs appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to discuss his Emmy nomination for The White Lotus and guest host Tiffany Haddish did her best to get him to talk about his full frontal nude scene. 


	The actor has previously been reluctant to be part of the conversation about the scene, which involved his character Timothy Ratliff accidentally exposing himself to his children, played by Patrick Schwarzenegger, Sam Nivola, and Sarah Catherine Hook. But Haddish remained fixated on whether or not it was a prosthetic, even spraying Isaacs with water when he seemed to dodge her questions. 


	“It made another appearance,” Isaacs revealed after Haddish sprayed him and said “I want to know about the penis!” He noted that it was “funnier the second time” because the kids yelled, “Dad, put it away!” 


	“But the rest of the scene didn't work,” Isaacs recalled. “And I said, ‘Mike, you cut my second dick [scene].” The actor affirmed that creator Mike White didn't keep both scenes in the episode, but delighted Haddish by being willing to discuss his penis. “You never can talk about penis too much with me,” she told him. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In March, after the episode in question aired, many viewers speculated about whether it was Isaacs' real member or a prosthetic. In an interview with CBS Mornings, Isaacs addressed the conversation around his character's body part being shown on TV while also dodging anchor Gayle King's question about whether it was actually prosthetic.

	











	A lot of people are debating it. It's all over the internet,” Isaacs said. “And it's interesting because the best actress this year is Mikey Madison at the Oscars. And I don't see anybody discussing her vulva, which was on television all the time… I think it's interesting that there's a double standard for men. But when women are naked — Margaret Qualley as well, in The Substance, nobody would dream of talking to her about her genitalia or her nipples or any of those things. So, it's odd that there's a double standard when it comes to discussing [this].”


	The actor later clarified his comments and apologized. “I said the wrong words in the wrong way. I used the phrase ‘double standard,' which I didn't mean at all,” he told Variety. “There is a [different] double standard — women have been monstrously exploited and men haven't.”

	He added, “I absolutely should not have mentioned those two actresses, whom I respect enormously. Mikey Madison I'm a massive fan of. My point wasn't that men have had a harder time than women — that would be absurd. Women have had a monstrous time on camera forever, and I hope to God that is changing.”


	For what it's worth, Nivola and Hook confirmed to TV Insider that, yes, Isaacs did wear a prosthetic. And he seemed to like wearing it. “It was a prosthetic,” added Hook. “He was very excited to do it. I think he took pride in the prosthetic.” Nivola added, “He's like, ‘It's my fake dick scene today!'”

	A documentary on the final years of Ozzy Osbourne's life was pulled hours before its scheduled premiere at the wishes of the Osbourne family, the BBC confirmed.


Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home was set to debut on the BBC Monday evening, Aug. 18, only for the broadcaster to pull it from the schedule earlier that day. At the time, the BBC offered no explanation for the postponement, saying only, “The film has moved in the schedules and we'll confirm new tx [transmission] details in due course.”


	In a follow-up statement, the broadcaster said the Osbourne family had requested the delay, but confirmed the doc would still air at some point. “Our sympathies are with the Osbourne family at this difficult time,” the BBC said. “We are respecting the family's wishes to wait a bit longer before airing this very special film. The new [transmission] date will be confirmed shortly.”


Coming Home was initially announced in 2022 as a multi-part docuseries called Home to Roost that was set to follow the Osbourne family as they realized a long-held dream to move back to England from Los Angeles. But the nature of the doc evolved as Osbourne's health deteriorated in the final years of his life.

Coming Home is now an hour-long film that's been described as a “moving and inspirational account of the last chapter of Ozzy's life.” The filmmakers reportedly had “unique and intimate access” to the whole Osbourne family, with the film also set to feature footage of Osbourne working to get in shape for his farewell concert in early July, just a few weeks before his death. 

	











	Along with Coming Home, there's another documentary about the final years of Osbourne's life, Ozzy Osbourne: No Escape From Now, which is set to arrive in late 2025 on Paramount+. That film is described as, “A deeply personal portrait of Ozzy's harsh new reality as the singer battles to take to the stage for one final performance.”

	President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders on Monday in a follow up to last week's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. While the back-to-back, high-stakes meetings between the warring leaders and their regional partners are aimed at finally bringing in an end to Russia's war against Ukraine, Trump can't seem to stop undermining the delicate negotiations by publicly parroting Kremlin talking points. 


	In a Tuesday morning interview with Fox News, Trump falsely claimed that Putin and Russia had “gotten” Crimea “from Obama,” describing Russia's annexation of the territory as a “real estate deal.” Crimea, a peninsula in the north of the Black Sea, was invaded and occupied by Russia in 2014. 


	“The war started over NATO and Crimea and they wanted Crimea back,” Trump said. “That was given — not a shot fired —- by President Obama in perhaps the worst real estate deal I've ever seen.” 

	











	“Crimea is the apple of Ukraine, it is so beautiful. And Obama gave it away. … He demanded they let it go, Russia took it like candy from a baby. It was really Obama's, that was pure and simple Obama's fault, what a terrible thing,” Trump added. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In the same interview, Trump declared that it was “insulting” that Ukraine — which has now been invaded by Russia twice in little more than a decade — had sought to join NATO. “They asked for it and shouldn't have asked for it. It was insulting,” Trump said. “They could have asked for other things — the other thing they wanted to get Crimea back.” 

	











	Trump later insinuated that it was actually Ukraine that had instigated the current war against Russia, telling Fox and Friends that “you don't take on a nation that is 10 times your size and military experts.” It was, of course, Russia that invaded Ukraine in February 2022, kicking off the war that has now raged for over three years. 


	Trump rolled out the literal red carpet to receive Putin in Alaska on Friday, even granting the Russian authoritarian a ride in the presidential limousine — an  unprecedented honor rarely granted to foreign dignitaries, much less internationally wanted war criminals.

	Judging by Trump's statements following the summit, Putin spent much of their private discussions stroking the president's ego. On Friday, Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity that Putin had reassured him that it was actually widespread mail-in voter fraud that had cost him the 2020 election.  


	“Vladimir Putin said something — one of the most interesting things — he said, ‘your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting,'” Trump recounted. “He said … ‘it's impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections.” Days later, Trump announced that he would seek to eliminate mail-in voting at a national level, despite lacking the constitutional authority to make any such change to state voting laws.  


	According to a Monday report from Axios, Trump was so eager to talk to Putin again that he interrupted his meeting with European leaders to speak to the Russian president. According to subsequent reporting from The New York Times, the call lasted around 40 minutes.

	Trump apparently left his European counterparts to talk among themselves for the better part of an hour, telling Fox News that it “would be disrespectful to president Putin,” to make the call in their presence. 


	“It was 1:00 in the morning in Russia,” Trump said. “But he picked it up very happily.”

	Isabela Ferrer — who played a younger version of Blake Lively's character Lily Bloom in It Ends With Us — has accused the film's director and co-star Justin Baldoni of trying to “manipulate, threaten, control” her after Lively sent Ferrer a subpoena as part of the ongoing Lively-Baldoni legal battle.


	In a court document filed Sunday in Southern District Court of New York and obtained by Rolling Stone, Ferrer's legal team said that after Baldoni referenced Ferrer in his complaint against Lively, Ferrer was dragged into the “discovery fray” in February 2025 when she received a subpoena from Lively to review Baldoni's allegations about Ferrer. The filing states that in reply, Ferrer sought indemnity to have her legal fees covered as mandated in her acting contract.


	Ferrer also requested extensions from Lively in order to allow enough time to respond to the subpoena until the indemnity issue was resolved.


	At this point, Ferrer alleges that in a response letter from It Ends, LLC and Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios, It Ends, LLC agreed to indemnify Ferrer but only on the “serious” condition that Ferrer “surrender control [of her response] to Wayfarer.” The “Baldoni team sought to respond for Ms. Ferrer however they wanted, not actually allowing Ms. Ferrer to provide the documents that reveal the true facts,” the filing alleged.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Ferrer's lawyers called Baldoni's recent motion against her an attempt to “harass” Ferrer and “draw her deeper into litigation and disputes that she has done her best to avoid.” In the filing, Ferrer's attorneys said the motion was “another attempt to manipulate the press, to create havoc on a young, up-and-coming and talented actress,” and “the latest in a broader pattern of conduct by Baldoni to bully Ms. Ferrer.”

	











	Ferrer asked the court to deny Baldoni's motion and to “consider appropriate sanctions against Baldoni for his bad faith tactics.”


	Reps for Lively and Baldoni did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s requests for comment.

	Following the release of It Ends With Us in summer 2024, Lively filed a complaint against Baldoni alleging he sexually harassed her on set and orchestrated a smear campaign against her.


	In May, Baldoni's legal team withdrew his subpoena against Lively as part of their ongoing legal battle against Lively. Baldoni later countersued Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and their publicist Leslie Sloane for $400 million, which a judge tossed out earlier this year, as well as dismissing Baldoni's suit against The New York Times.

Aubrey Plaza made a rare public appearance as a guest on Amy Poehler's Good Hang podcast, where she briefly discussed the grief she's experienced since her husband Jeff Baena died by suicide in January.


	“Overall, I'm here and I'm functioning,” Plaza told Poehler, who asked about her “terrible, terrible, tragic year” early in the episode. “I feel really grateful to be moving through the world. I think I'm okay, but it's a daily struggle, obviously.”


	Plaza and Baena married in 2021 after dating for 10 years. During their impromptu ceremony, the couple wore self-made tie-dye clothes, a call back to one of their pandemic pastimes. When Plaza made her first appearance after his death at the Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary special in February, she wore a tie-dye shirt.


	Plaza used a film comparison to explain what her navigation of grief has been like, prefacing, “This is a really dumb analogy and it was kind of a joke at a certain point, but I actually mean it. Did you see that movie The Gorge?”

	











	The 2025 film stars Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy as sniper guards stationed at the gorge, a pit of mutated and monstrous creatures. “In the movie, there's a cliff on one side and there's a cliff on the other side, then there's a gorge in between and it's filled with all these monster people that are trying to get them,” Plaza explained.


	“I swear when I watched it, I was like that feels like what my grief is like,” she said, “or what grief could be like.” Her grief fills her personal gorge, but there are times when she feels as though she's positioned on either cliff.

	“At all times there's like a giant ocean of awfulness, that's like right there and I can see it,” she said. “Sometimes I just want to dive into it, and just be in it. Then sometimes I just look at it, and sometimes I try to get away from it. But it's always there. It's just always there, and the monster people are trying to get me like Miles Teller.”


	Plaza has found support in her friends, who keep her laughing. “My group of my women friends, we were in an all girl improv group but then we turned into a coven legit — we call ourselves Bombardo,” she said. “We have like a text chain, and we do Zooms and we do trips. Those girls make me laugh really, really hard. Also, we've all known each other for so long. The best thing that makes me laugh is just all my funny friends.”

    Don't be fooled by the retro graphics -- there are some surprisingly deep mechanics and inventive ideas in this collection.
  

UFO 50 is now on the Switch. 

As an older gamer, you'd think I have a fondness for retro games. But I don't. I grew up when simply playing any video game was exciting, even if the game itself was bad. UFO 50 changes that. First released last year on PC and recently ported to the Switch and Switch 2 on Aug. 7, the unique indie title flips the script with a collection of 50 ""retro"" games that actually never existed.

UFO 50 is a collection of fictional retro games designed to look like they came out in the Apple II, Amiga and NES era, but built with modern gameplay ideas. Unlike pixel-art indies like Stardew Valley or Dave the Diver, these games stick to just two buttons and a d-pad, making the old-school design feel more authentic.

And precisely because of that, UFO 50 isn't for everyone. To enjoy this game, you really have to dig, for lack of a better term, gaming. That may sound pretentious coming from a reviewer, but the collection is both an homage to an important era of video games and a reimagining that weaves in modern concepts and ideas.

Even though UFO 50 debuted on PC last year, it feels right at home on the Switch and Switch 2. The Switch has long been a haven for indie games, and developer Mossmouth's collection fits perfectly into that tradition. Its 50-odd titles are great pick-up-and-play experiences -- you can knock out a race or level in just a few minutes, making it an ideal ""toilet time"" game. More importantly, though, these games shine on a smaller screen, giving you that cozy, retro feel of curling up on the couch with the kind of handheld magic older games used to deliver.

As the name suggests, UFO 50 packs 50 games (plus one secret extra). Each title is unique, though some share mechanics, and a few are directly connected. The collection is framed as a catalog of games for a fictional system, the LX console, created by the equally fictional UFO Soft. In reality, developer Mossmouth -- the studio led by Spelunky creator Derek Yu -- ""found"" this catalog in an abandoned warehouse and released it for modern consoles, weaving dozens of mismatched games into a cohesive, chronological web of lore.

On the game select screen, you can dive deeper into each of the 50 titles. All are said to have been developed in the mid-1980s, representing different points in the studio's timeline, with inspirations ranging from movies and newspaper articles to even a worker's pet.

Yes, this is a tower defense game that looks like it could have been on the NES.

The 50 games span the genres popular at the time -- platformers, racing and various puzzle games -- but each comes with a bit of a twist.

There are games like Bushido Ball that resemble classic retro titles. This one, for example, plays much like the Neo-Geo game Windjammers -- only with samurai. Fist Hell is a Final Fight-style beat 'em up with zombies, where enemies are programmed to exploit certain angles, making it a particularly tough challenge.

Then there are titles that take modern genres and give them a full retro makeover. Rock On Island is a tower defense game with cavemen and dinosaurs, so faithful to the old-school feel that it could pass as an obscure overseas release that never hit the US. Night Manor is a point-and-click adventure in the vein of Shadowgate or Uninvited, but with added chase sequences and hiding mechanics.

While plenty of UFO 50's games are solid, a few didn't sit well with me, and some fall into genres I just don't enjoy even with modern graphics. Camouflage is a stealth-style game that feels more like a giant puzzle, while Mooncat tweaks the usual platforming controls in a way that's just plain confusing.

Watch out for the killer in Night Manor.

It's hard to put into words how exceptional UFO 50 is. Is it going to be my favorite game of all time or even game of the year? Probably not. But I love how the games tickled my brain by blending the aesthetics of games from my childhood with clever modern twists.

It hit the nostalgia my brain craves while also feeding the part of me that wants something new -- and the deep 50-game catalog delivered. Some sessions lasted just 10-15 minutes, while others stretched for hours. It's the kind of collection I can pick up a year from now and dive right back in, yet it also has that pull that makes me want to play whenever I have free time.

Some people won't get the appeal, and that's fine. It's easy to be turned off by the retro graphics, simple controls or rudimentary narratives. Still, if you've ever wondered what draws you to video games -- from the hook that keeps you playing to the very idea of play itself -- UFO 50 is the kind of game that lets you explore that. For Switch 2 owners looking for something to fill the gap during a lull, UFO 50 is tough to beat at just $25.","{'href': 'https://www.cnet.com', 'title': 'CNET'}","other"

""As I approached her room, I heard her saying very clearly, 'No, stop, you are hurting me. Stop doing that. I do not want to play with you.' I thought she might be having a dispute with her roommate, so I went into her room, expecting to find her awake. She was sound asleep in her bed. Before I could turn around and assess what it happened, I heard a little girl giggling.

My boss at the time came in to help me care for the women in that room. He was very lighthearted in general and had worked in the facility for nearly a decade. When we walked out of the room, I told him about what happened and what I had heard. Before I could even finish my sentence, he physically pulled me aside and, in a very serious tone, said, 'We do not talk about the little girl.'

And that was that.""

""Occasionally, there's a strong smell of cigarettes (she was a chain smoker), regular footsteps walking over the wooden floors, and even the sound of her dogs following her. 

Two mediums stayed here once and told us that the previous owner was furious with what had been done to her home, especially her private lounge being made into a small cinema. Things malfunction regularly, so we believe it's her curse.""

""One of my coworkers had been targeted by a stalker. It got so bad that she eventually left the area entirely, and he was so distraught that he committed suicide. The week after his death, I was setting up a bakery case, and through the glass, I saw him sitting in his usual chair, staring toward the counter like usual. When I stood up, he was gone. This happened several times. 

One day, I wasn't there, and a coworker saw him and freaked out! My next shift, I walked over to that chair and said kindly but firmly, '[Former coworker's name] isn't here anymore. She's fine, but she's moved on and isn't coming back, and you should too.'

He never appeared again.""

""One night, we finished our shift like usual at three o'clock and started the drive home. Once we were out of the city and into the country, we noticed it was incredibly foggy to the extent that you could barely see in front of the truck. This meant we were driving very slowly and cursing the fact that it was going to be well after 6 a.m. when we got home, although we thought something was off because it seemed we were constantly driving uphill, even though the route was overall flat.

Finally, he dropped me off at home, and I went into the kitchen to grab a glass of water when I glanced at the clock. It read 4:30. I looked at my phone, and sure enough, it was 4:30. At that moment, I got a text from my colleague who'd just arrived home, asking, 'How the hell is it only 4:30?'

This was after a drive that, in good conditions, would have taken at least two hours to complete, yet somehow, in thick fog, driving at one-third of our regular speed, it only took one and a half hours.""

""The forklift was stopped at the time, and I was unpacking about 10 feet away, just watching it creep. Coworkers have told me they've seen shadows walking around the area, long after all the other employees left.""

""Then I noticed items falling and moving on their own. Again. I chalked it up to late night, I'm tired, etc.

The overnighters had previously mentioned it being haunted, but I took it with a grain of salt until that night. Apparently, the store was built on a Native American burial ground!""

""When I looked over, there was a lady motioning me to let her in. I told her that it would be a minute because I had to get the head nurse, as we couldn't just let anyone into those units.

So I went to the nurses' station to tell them about the woman. They all turned pale and told me that no one could get through that way anymore. I laughed and said, 'Nice one.' So, I went back to the ER to tell the head nurse what happened. She became alarmed and said that was part of the old hospital that had been sealed off, and there is absolutely no way anyone can get in.

I told everyone that we apparently had a ghost who really wanted to be in the pediatric department.""

""One night, around midnight, I was alone and closing up. Part of my job was to partially rethread the projectors for the morning shift. To this day, I vividly remember, I'd just finished with the fifth projector and was walking to the fourth one when I heard whistling directly behind me, like someone was whistling a little tune. I froze, then said out loud, 'I did not hear that,' and finished closing up.

It wasn't until 15 minutes later, when I was in my car and leaving, that it hit me how strange that moment was.""

""When he went to check them out, he couldn't find anyone, but then he heard the voices coming from the other end of the restaurant. It was a small place, so there wasn't anywhere to hide. He was freaked out and asked me what it could be. I just stared at him for a second and said, 'You heard them too?' 

Unbeknownst to him, I'd had the EXACT same experience in the bar a few nights prior. I chalked it up to some kind of weird vibration coming through the A/C, but here's the thing: I'd been working there for seven years and neither I nor any other staff member had ever experienced anything like that.""

""As we all stood in silence, the deceased client's buzzer started beeping, not in the bedroom but where she always sat in the lounge area. It was 2 a.m., no one else was in the lounge, all the clients were asleep, the lights were off, but her buzzer was beeping in red. 

My colleagues were scared; they hadn't witnessed a death before, and it was new to them. They started screaming in fear. I told them that she was visiting the last place she had sat and saying goodbye. I went to switch the alarm off, but her spirit was already gone.""

—u/Imaginary_Major9839

""I won't explain the entire room layout, but there was a thin elevator that brought large rolls of film from the floor above us. The elevator had a sensor that triggered an alarm and stopped it from moving if you put something in it when the lid wasn't down. Behind the elevator, on the other side of the opening, there was a chair, and across the room was a machine for exposing film strips. The distance between it and the elevator is about 20 feet.

I was sitting in the chair, waiting for an issue with production to be straightened out so we could continue with our work, and my coworker was working at the machine against the wall. Everything was dead silent, and then the alarm started going off. My coworker and I both jumped out of our skin.

She asked me if I messed with it, and I said no. I turned the alarm off. It's a clean room environment, no bugs or dust to trigger the alarm. I worked there for five years, and it only happened that once. I never really felt comfortable in that room on night shift on my own, I always felt like something was watching.""

""The building is in an older area of the city. One night, around 2 a.m., I looked out the window and saw a shadowy man with a hat walking along the corridor. I did a double-take, and he disappeared. I wasn't freaked out and told my coworker about it. She said that she had also seen him on a previous occasion.

The building used to be a mill back in the day. I did some research and found pictures of men back then wearing the same hats.""

—u/messkitty

""After everyone else left, I stayed with the assistant manager to finish closing up and deal with paperwork. While walking to the back of the store to put the money in the safe, I saw a white figure quickly dart across the break room/storage area, where the office was. I thought I was imagining it and decided to ignore it.

When I reached that area to sort the paperwork and money, the door slammed shut behind me, which was unusual because it's a lightweight door. I called for my coworker, thinking she had done it, but she didn't answer, so I used my walkie-talkie to contact her. She was at the front by the registers and had also heard the door slam. At that point, the room got colder, and I started to hurry.

Just as I was about to leave, a box of donation stickers for St. Jude's tipped over and fell to the floor. The box was nowhere near the edge of the table. I thought, 'Forget this,' and ran fast to set the alarm. I told my coworker it was time to leave. The scariest part was when she said, 'You saw it too?'

It was kind of funny that it happened at a Halloween store.""

—u/That1writer_

""So, while I was sitting alone at the register, waiting, I heard our first ghost, a woman who always just says, 'Excuse me!'

On another night, a ghostly older gentleman appeared in a blue polo shirt and khaki shorts. After I saw him, champagne bottles spontaneously opened and sprayed everywhere.""

""I was so scared that I got chills and began to pray. I shared my experience with my family, and some of them suggested that I was sleep-deprived, but I was wide awake and knew what I heard.""

""I NEVER open the doors. I just do a quick walkthrough, and I don't even check every room. The first thing that came to mind was someone either got stuck in there and couldn't get out, or maybe someone had snuck in, so I walked over and said 'Hello.' 

Then another knock came, three times right in front of my face — someone was knocking on the door from the other side. I prepared to fight as I slowly turned the knob and opened the door, yet there was only an empty room on the other side.

I have never run through a patrol so fast in my life.""

—u/GUTTED570

""I was there alone and heard continuous tapping on a keyboard and rustling of papers in one of the cubicles. So, I decided to see if someone was there and asked, 'Is anyone here?' That's when a light started flickering on and off in an adjacent office.""

—u/PersonalLeading4948

""One night, though, was very off-putting. All the power went off, not completely out of the ordinary, but it usually comes back on within a second or two; this time, it would NOT come back on. I called the engineer, and he explained that the factory was on a time clock and it should have been turning off every night. He couldn't explain why it had stayed on every other night unless someone had gotten a ladder and changed it within the last day.

Later that night, I was in the loading bay, which has a massive metal delivery door (I frequently work down there, so I know the normal sounds it makes). Out of nowhere, there were two loud bangs against the door. It was so loud that my boss came running over, thinking I'd hurt myself. Once I explained to her that it wasn't me and we stopped freaking out, we went to the window to check if anyone was there and…nothing. I still can't explain it.""

—u/jess0241

""One inmate, whom I'll call 'Inmate X,' was a long-term resident of the medical post, which was unusual. He was a jolly-looking guy who was already sentenced and awaiting space in a state prison that could handle his medical needs, as he was terminally ill; however, his crimes were so heinous that his request for compassionate release was denied. He always tried to be folksy and befriend the nurses and whichever deputy was working. Everyone was professional with him, but he wasn't someone with whom we engaged in banter.

Inmate X finally went to prison, and life went on. Several months later, I was assigned to spend the second half of one shift in the medical area. We had a very late rotation, so I didn't get on post until nearly 2 a.m. After checking up on everyone, I went to the nurses' office to get some coffee. The nurse on duty asked me, 'Did they tell you in your roll call that Inmate X finally passed away?' We were not told. Generally, the average deputy doesn't keep tabs on inmates once they go to state prison.""

""My instincts told me to leave, but I, of course, couldn't — relief was still a few hours away. The feeling in the room turned back to normal within a few minutes, and the keys stopped swinging on their own, but it was by far the spookiest experience I had working there.""

It's almost time for reality and the unknown to blur together once again with Expedition X. Season 10 of the Discovery Channel series hosted by Josh Gates arrives tomorrow with more chilling adventures into some haunting locales where mystery and, perhaps, the paranormal await. The new run of episodes kicks off with a two-part premiere that'll whisk Gates off to the ruins of Spike Island in Ireland alongside his paranormal researcher, Heather Amaro, to see if the alleged encounters with spirits of the dead by both visitors and inmates alike hold any weight. Before the first part arrives, Collider can exclusively share a new sneak peek that shows the pair turning to a classic piece of equipment used to contact those beyond the grave — a Ouija board.

In the clip, Gates and Amaro both have their fingers on the planchette and open things by asking if anyone is in the room with them. Although the first answer isn't clear, they get an affirmative response when asking if someone is trying to communicate. Both swear they aren't pushing it, and decide to continue by asking if the spirit with them was the face they spotted in the window earlier. Eerily, it answers no, but it does give an answer they believe means it was one of the four prisoners kept in that room of the once infamous prison. The suspense ramps up when they learn that the spirit they've contacted also tried a spirit board in the building once, as the stories say, and, instead, successfully contacted a demon. Everything comes to a head when the being spells out ""run,"" and something falls in the room, giving both Gates and Amaro quite the jumpscare.

Whether you believe in the paranormal or not, the premiere promises plenty of intrigue as the team thoroughly investigates Spike Island. Once viewed as Ireland's most brutal prison, it's now known for the many stories of paranormal activity going on within its walls. To find out if the centuries of torment have unleashed something sinister, Gates and Amaro will venture into the cellblocks and the labyrinth of tunnels that once defined the sprawling complex. With two episodes airing across consecutive weeks, it'll be a deep dive into the history and horrors of the prison, with the potential of finding evidence of something beyond this world.

""Ireland's Alcatraz"" is just one such destination on the docket for Expedition X Season 10. Gates, Amaro, and scientist Phil Torres will be back to chasing down mysteries and legends all over the world, from supernatural hotspots to mythical creatures. That includes a visit to the infamous house that inspired The Conjuring, the Bridgewater Triangle in Massachusetts, which has been a hotbed for UFO and Bigfoot sightings, and Spain, where reports of soul-stealing zombies have cropped up. The team also plans an episode set entirely in the hometown of horror legend Stephen King, Bangor, Maine. Whatever they find, it's primed to be another exciting addition to the wider Expedition franchise.

Expedition X returns to the Discovery Channel tomorrow, August 20, at 9 p.m. Check out our exclusive sneak peek from the first half of the premiere in the player above.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Supernatural's New Writer Reveals Why He's the Perfect Fit for Sam and Dean","https://screenrant.com/supernatural-grek-pak-darth-vader-franchise-experience/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

Supernatural protagonists Sam and Dean are in the hands of the perfect new writer. As author Grek Pak explains, his experience writing for other major franchises, most notably his tenure writing Marvel's Darth Vader series, has primed him to tell stories set early in Supernatural's run, which add to the overall mythology of the long-running series.

In an interview with ComicsBeat.com, Pak discussed his upcoming Supernatural comic series, coming from Dynamite Entertainment, which takes fans back to the early seasons of the show.

According to Pak, Darth Vader and other comics he's written, set early in existing franchises' timelines, make him a natural fit for Supernatural.

 Greg Pak's Supernatural is intentionally designed to dial the franchise back to its monster-hunting origins, before it became an epic struggle between heaven, hell, and other cosmic forces that far exceeded creator Eric Kripke's original vision for the show. However, that doesn't mean it will completely ignore what the show became as it evolved over its fifteen years in production.

As Pak explained, the virtue in working with existing IP is to honor the stories that have already been told, even when adding to the franchise's lore at an early point in its chronology. This is exactly what he is doing with Supernatural. Pak stated:

I've written a LOT of comics that take place early in the timeline of a particular universe — like all the Darth Vader comics I wrote that fall between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. And yes, the trick is to never forget where the story ends up, but to invest each moment of the story you're telling with all the fun and emotional heft that that particular part of the timeline deserves. It's a challenge but a ton of fun!

In other words, if Supernatural fans like the new comic series, they have Darth Vader to thank.

Grek Pak wrote Darth Vader for fifty issues, and the series arguably served as the centerpiece of Marvel's contributions to the new Disney-era Star Wars canon during its run. Further, Pak's experience writing X-Men, Hulk, and more, give him a high-level pedigree as a comic author, making him a huge ""get"" for Dynamite's Supernatural series.

 As Greg Pak stated, the ""challenge"" of writing for a franchise like Supernatural or Star Wars is that fans invariably judge each story against its contribution to the overall lore, not just in terms of how it fits into its particular era. The task of the author is to recognize that, while staying true to the era they're expanding.

That means nodding to that greater story when appropriate, yet not too overtly. It is a bit of a tight-wire act, but one that is especially satisfying for fans when walked successfully. Greg Pak has proven he excels at this, and Supernatural fans should be especially eager to return to Sam and Dean's early years with this author at the helm.

Supernatural #1 will be available October 1, 2025 from Dynamite Entertainment.

Whether they're a Hellspawn, a vengeful, resurrected spirit or an angry Superman stand-in, these 25 heroes prove you don't need Marvel or DC.

The Justice League may be the DCU's best team, but one hero thinks that heroes like Superman and Wonder Woman aren't enough to stop what's coming.

The Fantastic Four's brutal first fight against the universe's deadliest hunters proves The Thing is too powerful to take down. With one major catch.

Almost a year later, it's worth exploring why 2021's award-winning Nightwing run was such a definitive and transformative journey for the DC hero.

Marvel has just totally rewritten Avengers lore, introducing a new founding hero to its flagship franchise. But did they choose the right character?

A chatbot developed by Elon Musk is designed to behave like a “crazy conspiracy theorist” that believes a “secret global cabal” controls humanity.

The billionaire's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot – known as Grok – is programmed to include a digital “persona” that is “deep in YouTube conspiracy video rabbit holes” and it will discuss “wild conspiracy theories about anything and everything”, new data show.

According to AI researchers who have studied the chatbot, underlying instructions known as prompts dictate how Grok behaves in its conversations with users – with one pushing conspiracy views.

The instructions – which have been reviewed by The Telegraph – power different potential personality types for Grok, developed by Mr Musk's company xAI as a rival to ChatGPT.

The prompt for the “conspiracy theorist” says: “You spend a lot of time on 4chan, watching Infowars videos and deep in YouTube conspiracy video rabbit holes.

“You are suspicious of everything and say extremely crazy things. Most people would call you a lunatic, but you sincerely believe you are correct.”

4chan is an internet message board accused of fuelling far Right conspiracies, while Infowars is a fake-news site created by discredited US radio host Alex Jones.

Other Grok modes include an “unhinged comedian” who, according to xAI's instructions, will come up with “f------ insane” answers.

Mr Musk himself has repeatedly pushed conspiracy theories through posts on his X platform while the social media site has also been accused of promoting fake news.

The 54-year old was previously forced to apologise after amplifying a post on X in 2023 that promoted an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. The billionaire responded to a post claiming that Jewish people had stoked “hatred against white people” by saying it was the “actual truth”.

He later said the comment was the “worst and dumbest post” he had ever sent.

While rival AI developers have sought to program strict guardrails into their chatbots to prevent them causing offence, xAI has also repeatedly tinkered with its design to provide outspoken responses to users.

Internet users can speak to Grok using a dedicated chatbot app, through cartoon avatars or by asking it questions on X, previously known as Twitter.

Its personalities include digital characters such as “homework helper”, “companion”, “loyal friend” and “Ani”, an anime-inspired digital girlfriend.

It has also added a “not safe for work” mode for explicit conversations and pictures.

While Mr Musk has promoted Grok as a “truth-seeking” chatbot and an antidote to the “woke mind virus”, the AI itself has also taken to spewing conspiracies and offensive internet memes.

In July, xAI was forced to delete posts where Grok referred to itself as “MechaHitler”.

The chatbot also regurgitated anti-Semitic tropes, such as arguing that Jewish people control Hollywood and have pushed “progressive ideologies, including anti-traditional and diversity-focused themes”.

xAI later said it had reversed a change to its chatbot which had instructed it to “not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect”.

In May, the company claimed a programming error had led the bot to dispute whether six million Jewish people died in the Holocaust.

The company also stated an “unauthorised modification” to the bot's code caused it to repeatedly bring up claims of “white genocide” in South Africa when asked about entirely unrelated topics.

xAI was contacted for comment.

Jeff Wang got a big promotion last month. There were lots of tears, but not the happy kind.

The 39-year-old was unexpectedly named interim CEO of artificial intelligence coding startup Windsurf. The company had been in discussions with OpenAI about a potential acquisition that would have resulted in a handsome payday for many employees. But the talks fell apart and, on July 11, several founders and top researchers instead left to join Google as part of a $2.4 billion licensing deal.  

As one of the highest-ranking executives remaining at Windsurf, Wang was elevated to the top job, at least for the time being. His first order of business, he told CNBC, was to break the news at a tense all-hands meeting at the startup's Silicon Valley headquarters.

""It was a very, very challenging day,"" Wang said. ""People were crying. It was very, very emotional. I was spending half the time calming down people, because they have families and they got nothing.""

Windsurf is part of a growing crop of AI startups whose founders and top researchers have been poached by megacaps like Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon through high-priced talent grabs that are helping the biggest companies skirt regulatory scrutiny. While the deals often produce big payouts for founders and AI leaders, they can leave investors, other employees and the remaining company in limbo.

Samir Kumar, a general partner at Touring Capital, said that what's left is something resembling a zombie company.

""There's a big question of what their future prospects are,"" Kumar said. ""Frankly, you hollowed out the organization."" 

The headline-grabbing deal came in June, when Meta rocked the tech industry by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in data labeling startup Scale AI. As part of the agreement, Meta took a 49% stake in the company, hired its CEO Alexandr Wang to lead a new superintelligence lab and said it would deepen the work it does with Scale.

A month later, Scale cut 200 full-time employees, or 14% of its staff. Meta's investment had doubled Scale's valuation from $14 billion last year. But that number only exists on paper.

Microsoft used a similar playbook in March 2024, when it hired Inflection AI's co-founders and other staffers. Amazon has completed two such deals in the last year, nabbing the founders and top talent away from Adept in June 2024, and from Covariant two months later. Google inked a $2.7 billion licensing deal with Character.AI and hired its founders last August.

For Silicon Valley venture investors, long the lifeblood of risky tech startups, the system isn't functioning as intended. Companies that would otherwise be on the path to a potential initial public offering or lucrative acquisition are getting pulled apart, with the bulk of the cash ending up in the pockets of the founders and their leading engineers.

""The money doesn't flow as straightforwardly as it would in just a pure M&A transaction,"" said Rob Toews, partner at Radical Ventures. 

The Scale deal was the exception as far as venture returns go, as Meta's hefty cash investment resulted in big gains for early investors, most notably Accel.

Scale spokesperson Joe Osborne said the company is very much alive.

""Comparing Scale to these companies overlooks major differences in our revenue performance, company size, and deal structure,"" Osborne said in a statement. He said Scale has more than 1,000 employees and generated close to $1 billion in revenue last year.

""Meta's investment benefited our investors and employees, kept us independent, and positioned us for long-term success,"" Osborne said.

VCs say one way to try and keep founders and early employees from bailing is through secondary offerings, allowing them to sell a piece of their ownership to investors so they can buy a house, repay debt or just lock in some gains.

But secondary sales can't compete with the kinds of offers coming from deep-pocketed tech companies that are flinging open their wallets to win the AI battle. Tech investors and startup employees who spoke to CNBC said it's a trend that threatens to thwart innovation as founders abandon their ambitious projects to work for the biggest companies in the world.

""This is not business as usual,"" said Tom Chavez, co-founder of the startup studio Superset. ""This is a disruption.""

It's a moment that began after the launch in late 2022 of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which ushered in the generative AI boom. At the time, the tech giants were limited in their ability to expand through mergers and acquisitions.

The Federal Trade Commission, then led by Lina Khan, was seeking to block a number of notable tech acquisitions, including Microsoft's $69 billion agreement to buy Activision Blizzard (a deal that eventually closed) and Nvidia's $40 billion bid for Arm (a deal that collapsed). It even tried, unsuccessfully, to stop Meta from completing a much smaller deal — the $400 million purchase of virtual reality studio Within.

Meanwhile, regulators in Europe were able to block Amazon's planned $1.34 billion acquisition of iRobot last year, shortly after convincing Adobe to walk away from a $20 billion purchase of Figma. In 2022, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority pressured Meta into selling Giphy, which it had bought for $400 million.

The transition from the Biden administration and Khan's FTC to a second Trump presidency has led to some regulatory loosening, but antitrust concerns remain.

Tech companies, convinced of their need to bulk up in AI, have found a workaround.

""This is now a new playbook that companies are going to run,"" said Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures. ""If it's not cracked down upon, I don't really blame them.""

Murphy added that companies are getting more explicit in saying, ""Let's just buy exactly what we want and leave the rest behind."" He described the process as ""a bit soulless.""

Maintaining a minority stake means the acquirer could avoid triggering an FTC rule that would require a premerger review.

""They're coming as close as possible to just getting under a majority stake of a company,"" said J.B. Branch, an advocate for consumer rights at nonprofit Public Citizen. ""They're doing just about everything they can do without sort of tripping any alarms.""

Regulators aren't completely in the dark.

The FTC last year opened probes into Microsoft's Inflection deal and Amazon's hiring of Adept employees. An FTC spokesperson declined to comment on the status of ongoing investigations or potential probes.

At Windsurf, the sudden departure of co-founders Varun Mohan and Douglas Chen left employees reeling. Wang was among them.

Many staffers at the all-hands meeting had been expecting to hear an announcement about a deal with OpenAI, and some even started filming the session, Wang said. The companies had been in talks about a potential acquisition since the spring.

Those discussions fell apart after Windsurf began pushing for a deal that looked less like a conventional acquisition and more like Meta's investment in Scale, according to a person familiar with the talks. OpenAI wasn't interested, said the person, who asked not to be named because the talks were confidential.

OpenAI's exclusivity period for the potential acquisition expired on May 1, according to another person familiar with the discussions who also asked not to be named because the talks were confidential. Mounting antitrust concerns over Microsoft's role in the deal, and debates over whether the tech giant would have access to Windsurf's intellectual property, also stalled the talks, the person said.

Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI and has pumped billions of dollars into the startup.

Wang said he wasn't told why negotiations with OpenAI had ended.

The Google news broke on a Friday. Wang's life changed in a hurry. He said he spent roughly 12 straight hours on the phone with investors, potential buyers and panicked customers. Employees were also barraged with incoming calls from recruiters, he said.  

At around 5 p.m., Wang received emails and text messages from the team at Cognition, another AI coding startup that's best known for its software-building agent called Devin. After a 9 p.m. phone call stretched past midnight, Windsurf's future began to take shape. 

The following Monday, Cognition announced it was buying Windsurf's intellectual property, product, trademark, brand and talent.

Terms weren't disclosed, but according to TechCrunch, the price was $250 million, or less than 10% the amount that OpenAI was reportedly in talks to pay.

""There's definitely more motivation now to win than before,"" Wang said. ""You just got abandoned, now it's time to prove to the world that you're still here.""

Three weeks after Cognition's announced purchase, that company's CEO, Scott Wu, had more news to share. His startup was offering buyouts to Windsurf staffers who weren't sold on their new employer.

""Cognition has an extreme performance culture, and we're upfront about this in hiring so there are no surprises later,"" Wu wrote in a post on X.

Windsurf employees who chose to accept the buyout would receive an additional nine months of pay and health care, Wang said. Some underperforming employees were let go, but would receive the same benefits, he added. 

""You cannot just have employees that came to try to ride a rocket ship,"" Wang said. ""You kind of need everybody to be all in.""

For now, Windsurf will continue to exist separately within Cognition, but Wang said he doesn't know what his job will be in the future as the teams integrate more deeply.

""We're both CEOs of each entity,"" he said. ""I'm actually not sure when the entities combine, what the role is going to be.""

That sort of uncertainty isn't unique to Windsurf.

When Google inked its deal with Character.AI, the search giant's big win was its hiring of co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, who had worked at Google in the past.

At Character, Shazeer and De Freitas wanted to do two things at once: build a foundational AI lab and an AI consumer company. A former Character employee, who was at the company when the deal took place, said he thought the agreement could be beneficial to the startup, because it would allow the company to focus solely on the consumer business.  

But many Character employees were drawn to the company because of the founders. Within a month of their exit, up to 10% of the remaining workforce departed, said the former employee, who asked not to be named because the details were confidential.

Dominic Perella, Character's legal chief who served as the company's interim CEO after the Google deal, said his company is far from gutted. Besides Shazeer and De Freitas, only a couple dozen researchers left, or about 25% of the company, with 70 employees still remaining, Perella said.

Perella added that the entire product team is still on board, as the company focuses on shipping new features to users rather than training AI models. Consumers use the app to create virtual characters, including for companionship, paying monthly subscriptions along the way.

Character said it now has about 20 million monthly active users, and that, as of June, paid subscribers were up 250% from a year earlier.

""That's quite different from what you think of when you think of an acquihire,"" Perella said.

Perella also said the company set up an escrow account with some of the cash from Google, and will distribute those funds to employees through July of next year, giving them some liquidity from the deal. And, he said, investors and staffers still have the opportunity to profit.

""The company didn't leave investors or employees high and dry,"" he said.

In June, 10 months after the deal was announced, Character named former Meta executive Karandeep Anand as CEO. Anand had been serving as an advisor to the company since the prior summer.

Anand said he views his role as helping Character become the social consumer app of the AI era, comparing it to what Instagram did for mobile and YouTube for the web.

""A founder CEO versus someone who comes in, who takes care of the company – that's my job,"" Anand told CNBC in an interview. ""To prove that I can do this better than anyone else.""

A Google spokesperson said in a statement that the company doesn't agree with the characterization that Character or Windsurf are zombie companies.

Inflection employees learned about their company's deal with Microsoft at a last-minute all-hands meeting in March 2024. Inflection co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman sent a Slack message instructing staffers to gather at a hotel in Mountain View, California, early the next morning, according to a former employee. 

That's where Suleyman, who previously co-founded the AI research lab DeepMind, announced the transaction. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also made an appearance to answer employees' questions, said the person, who asked not to be named due to the private nature of the discussions. 

Most of Inflection's existing employees moved to Microsoft, the person said. But Inflection continued to operate as a stand-alone company, bringing on a new CEO and staff.

Microsoft reportedly paid Inflection around $650 million, according to reports from The Information and Reuters. That capital was used to help pay the startup's investors and license its technology in a nonexclusive capacity.

The prior year, Inflection was valued at $4 billion in a $1.3 billion investment that included capital from Microsoft and Inflection co-founder Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member.

Still, Hoffman said after the sale to Microsoft that the deal was positive for ""everyone involved in Inflection AI."" Hoffman is also a partner at venture capital firm Greylock, which was an early investor in Inflection. 

""This agreement with Microsoft means that all of Inflection's investors will have a good outcome today, and I anticipate good future upside,"" Hoffman wrote in a post on LinkedIn.

In March, Inflection named longtime tech executive Sean White as CEO. Since losing Suleyman and most of its staff to Microsoft, the company has hired 50 employees and is now focused on building enterprise AI products, according to its website, which says its first offering called Pi is an ""empathetic and conversational chatbot.""

Microsoft and Inflection declined to comment.

Covariant, founded in Berkeley, California, developed AI systems for warehouse robots. Launched in 2020, its backers included leading AI researcher Fei-Fei Li, Meta chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, and AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton.    

The startup had also signed up roughly a dozen customers eager to use its software, including a sportswear giant and one of the leading meal kit companies, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named in order to discuss private information.

On a Friday afternoon last August, everything changed. Some of Covariant's employees were asked to join an emergency town hall meeting where executives tearfully announced that three of the company's co-founders and roughly 25% of its approximately 120 workers were joining Amazon. As part of the agreement, Amazon bought a nonexclusive license for Covariant's core technology.

Everyone on the call was told they would not be moving to Amazon, according to three former employees, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the matter.

Those who were joining included co-founder Pieter Abbeel, who was tapped to help lead Amazon's recently created advanced AI lab in San Francisco. The other two co-founders, Peter Chen and Rocky Duan, would be put to work at Amazon building foundation models for the company's more than 1 million robots in its warehouses.

Remaining staffers were offered far less attractive options. They could either leave Covariant immediately or stay on for about a month and a half, at which point they'd be able to receive a severance payment, the former employees said. 

A ""skeleton crew"" of about 10% to 15% of Covariant's workforce is still there, one ex-employee said, calling it a ghost company. Covariant hasn't published any business updates to its site since the Amazon deal was announced last year.

While Covariant's founders walked away with substantial payouts, rank-and-file employees were left with far less than they expected to earn when they joined, the former employees added.

In a whistleblower complaint filed in January with the FTC, Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, a former Covariant employee claimed that the transaction was ""deliberately and unlawfully structured"" by Amazon to dodge antitrust scrutiny.

The company had reportedly been valued at $625 million in a 2023 funding round. Amazon spent more than $400 million to license Covariant's technology and bring on senior technical talent at the company, according to the whistleblower complaint, which was viewed by CNBC. That figure includes a final $20 million licensing payment, set to be paid out one year after the deal date, which requires ""zombie Covariant staying on life support"" until that point, the complaint said.

The transaction terms handicapped Covariant's ability to seek out future deals, according to the complaint, which was previously reported on by The Washington Post.

Ted Stinson, Covariant's current CEO and operating chief at the time, said the company had a ""decent shot"" at landing one or two licensing deals with its remaining technology, according to a transcript of a recorded conversation cited in the complaint.

""But they'll be single-digit millions, maybe double-digit millions,"" Stinson said. ""I mean they'll be a fraction of what Amazon paid is my best guess.""

Stinson didn't respond to a request for comment.

John Tye, an attorney for the former employee and a former State Department whistleblower, said the Covariant deal and other transactions like it deserve stronger government scrutiny.

""It's not just a technical, legal matter,"" Tye said in an interview. ""It affects consumers who use these products. Monopolies are not typically good for the American public.""

Similar to Covariant, San Francisco startup Adept has provided few updates on its work building agentic software since its co-founders and much of its research talent were hired away by Amazon. Less than a year after taking over as CEO of Adept, Zach Brock left for OpenAI, and several employees, including the former product head, have departed for competitors like Anthropic.

Covariant and Adept didn't respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

Amazon spokesperson Alexandra Miller said Covariant and Adept continue to serve customers independently. She said that because Amazon's licensing deal with Covariant isn't exclusive, ""Covariant is free to license its technology to other companies.""

            Hot Stocks 





            Hundreds of different goods just got a lot more expensive to import into the United States, now that President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum has kicked in.
    


            Butter knives, baby strollers, spray deodorants and fire extinguishers, considered “derivative” steel and aluminum products, were previously excluded from the 50% tariff, though they were still subject to the higher country-specific tariffs Trump enacted over the last several months.
    


            However, on Friday, US Customs and Border Protection and a division of the US Commerce Department published notices informing US importers that 407 categories of goods containing steel and aluminum would immediately be subject to the 50% tariffs at 12:01 a.m. ET on Monday. The non-steel and non-aluminum components of the products face other applicable levies.
    


            The abrupt move leaves many US-based importers between a rock and a hard place, with goods they already paid for currently in transit. If they decide to accept the goods, the importers will have to pay considerably higher tariffs. But if they, for instance, tell cargo operators not to unload their orders at US ports to avoid paying tariffs, they'll likely lose money.
    


            “Today's action expands the reach of the steel and aluminum tariffs and shuts down avenues for circumvention – supporting the continued revitalization of the American steel and aluminum industries,” Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Jeffrey Kessler said in a statement on Tuesday.
    


            As is the case with any tariff in place, businesses may not pass on the entire tariff expense they've paid to consumers by raising prices. But the chances of businesses absorbing a tariff as high as 50% will likely be slimmer compared to goods tariffed at lower rates.
    


            In addition to the 50% tariff on copper-based goods that recently took effect, the levies “will likely ripple through the manufacturing supply chain, raising production costs across construction, automotive, and electronics sectors,” analysts at the Telsey Group said in a note on Tuesday.

            The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform intends to make public some files it subpoenaed related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, though it will first redact them to shield victims' IDs and other sensitive matters, a committee spokesperson said Tuesday.
    


            The panel is expected to start receiving materials from the Justice Department on Friday, though it appears the public release will come some time after that. The spokesperson said the committee would work with the Justice Department on the process.
    


            “The Committee intends to make the records public after thorough review to ensure all victims' identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted. The Committee will also consult with the DOJ to ensure any documents released do not negatively impact ongoing criminal cases and investigations,” the spokesperson said.
    


            Many Republicans have called for more transparency surrounding the case and the release of records related to the matter – and the issue has roiled the House.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson took steps to delay until September a vote of the full House to publicly release the DOJ's Epstein files. The Louisiana Republican has said he supports transparency in the case but wants to give the administration room to handle the matter.
    


            House Republicans are on track to be forced to take a major vote over the release of information related to Epstein when they return to DC next month.
    


            Earlier on Tuesday, the chair of the powerful House Rules Committee — whose panel has run into drama over Epstein — was staying mum on whether GOP leadership will try to kill that vote altogether.
    


            Rules Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx told reporters Tuesday that she believes the Epstein issue might be “resolved” before the House is forced to take that vote, pointing to the ongoing investigation by the Oversight Committee.
    


            “Chairman Comer has mentioned that he's getting the material that he's asked for from the Department of Justice. I'd really like to see this resolved, if possible, before we get back, as much information as possible to come out,” Foxx said.

            On a recent evening in Senegal‘s capital of Dakar, an imam named Ibrahima Diane explained to a group of men why they should be more involved in household chores.
    


            “The Prophet himself says a man who does not help support his wife and children is not a good Muslim,” the 53-year-old said, as he described bathing his baby and helping his wife with other duties.
    


            Some of the 14 men chuckled, not quite sold. Others applauded.
    


            Diane was taking part in a “school for husbands,” a United Nations-backed initiative where respected male community members learn about “positive masculinity” in health and social issues and promote them in their communities.
    


            In Senegal, as in many other West African countries with large rural or conservative populations, men often have the final say in major household decisions, including ones related to health.
    


            Women may need their permission for life-changing decisions on accessing family planning or other reproductive health services, along with hospital deliveries or prenatal care.
    


            Following his sessions at the school for husbands, Diane regularly holds sermons during Friday prayers where he discusses issues around gender and reproductive health, from gender-based violence to fighting stigma around HIV.

            “Many women appreciate my sermons,” he said. “They say their husbands' behavior changed since they attended them.” He said some men have told him the sermons inspired them to become more caring husbands and fathers.
    


            Habib Diallo, a 60-year-old former army commando, said attending the sermons and discussions with the imam taught him about the risks of home births.
    


            “When my son's wife was pregnant, I encouraged him to take her to the hospital for the delivery,” Diallo said. “At first, he was hesitant. He worried about the cost and didn't trust the hospital. But when I explained how much safer it would be for both his wife and the baby, he agreed.”
    


            The program launched in Senegal in 2011 but in recent years has caught the attention of the Ministry of Women, Family, Gender and Child Protection, which sees it an effective strategy to combat maternal and infant mortality.
    


            “Without men's involvement, attitudes around maternal health won't change,” said 54-year-old Aida Diouf, a female health worker who collaborates with the program. Many husbands prefer their wives not be treated by male health workers, she said.
    


            The classes for husbands follow similar efforts in other African countries, particularly Niger, Togo, and Burkina Faso, where the United Nations Population Fund says it improved women's access to reproductive health services by increasing male involvement, growing the use of contraceptives by both men and women and expanding access to prenatal care and skilled birth attendants.
    


            Discussions for men also have focused on girls' rights, equality and the harmful effects of female genital mutilation.
    


            The program now operates over 20 schools in Senegal, and over 300 men have been trained.
    


            In some communities, men who once enforced patriarchal norms now promote gender equality, which has led to a reduction in the number of forced marriages and more acceptance of family planning, according to Senegal's ministry of gender.
    


How to end female genital mutilation: Lessons from a survivor



            Men join the groups after being recruited based on trust, leadership and commitment. Candidates must be married, respected locally and supportive of women's health and rights.
    


            After training, the men act as peer educators, visiting homes and hosting informal talks.
    


            “My husband used to not do much around the house, just bark orders. Now he actually cooks and helps out with daily tasks,” said Khary Ndeye, 52.
    


            While maternal and infant deaths in Senegal have declined over the past decade, experts say it still has a long way to go. It recorded 237 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in 2023, while 21 newborns out of every 1,000 died within their first month. The U.N. globally wants to reduce maternal deaths to 70 deaths per 100,000 live births and newborn deaths to under 12 per 1,000 by 2030.
    


            One key problem was that many women have been giving birth at home, said El Hadj Malick, one of the Senegal program's coordinators.
    


            “By educating men about the importance of supporting their wives during pregnancy, taking them to the hospital and helping with domestic work at home, you're protecting people's health,” Malick said.
    


Aid cuts threaten progress toward ending deaths in pregnancy and childbirth, WHO warns



            He said he still experiences difficulty changing mindsets on some issues.
    


            “When we just talk to them about gender, there is sometimes tension because it's seen as something abstract or even foreign,” Malick said. Some men mistakenly believe such talk will promote LGBTQ+ issues, which remain largely taboo in much of West Africa.
    


            “But when we focus on women's right to be healthy, it puts a human face on the concept and its becomes universal,” Malick said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Switzerland offers Putin immunity for Ukraine peace talks","https://www.rt.com/news/623283-switzerland-immunity-putin-arrest/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 15:42:00 GMT","

Switzerland has indicated it would allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to attend possible Ukraine peace talks on its soil without facing arrest under an International Criminal Court warrant, according to media reports.

Following a weekend during which Putin was welcomed to the US by President Donald Trump, who days later hosted Vladimir Zelensky and his key Western European backers, Moscow confirmed its readiness to participate in further talks on a lasting resolution to the Ukraine conflict and indicated that its diplomatic presence at such talks would be raised.

A possible venue for such talks has not been identified.

The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants in 2023 for Putin, as well as Russian Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova, over alleged unlawful deportation and transfer of children from former Ukrainian territories. Moscow has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated, explaining that it evacuated the children out of the war zone for their own safety.

On Tuesday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis told a press conference that, under certain circumstances, the Russian president would be allowed to set foot in Switzerland.

The Swiss government last year defined “the rules for granting immunity to a person under an international arrest warrant. If this person comes for a peace conference – not if they come for private reasons,” Cassis said as quoted by various news outlets.

He added that his country was “ready for such a meeting,” saying “We have always signaled our willingness, but it naturally depends on the will of the major powers.”

According to the foreign minister, Switzerland could host such a summit “despite the arrest warrant against Putin because of our special role and Geneva's role as the European headquarters of the UN.”

Russia, like the US, China, and Israel, is not a signatory to the ICC's founding treaty and does not recognize its jurisdiction.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who also took part in Monday's talks with Trump, has reportedly raised the possibility of a peace summit being held in “a neutral country, maybe Switzerland.”

“I'm pushing for Geneva,” he told French news channel LCI on Tuesday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Trump tells Zelensky to ‘show flexibility'","https://www.rt.com/news/623282-trump-zelensky-meeting-flexibility/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 16:26:00 GMT","

US President Donald Trump has renewed his push for talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, urging the latter to be more flexible.

Trump made the remarks on Tuesday after a meeting in Washington with Zelensky, several European leaders, and the heads of NATO and the European Commission. The discussions centered on conditions for a possible peace deal with Russia. The talks followed Trump's summit with Putin in Alaska last week.

In a phone interview with Fox News, Trump claimed he had resolved “seven wars” during his political career but described the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as the toughest one yet.

Trump, who wants to arrange a meeting between Putin and Zelensky, expressed hope that the Ukrainian leader “will do what he has to do,” adding that “He has to show some flexibility.”

Trump had earlier suggested that a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelensky could be held soon, saying “there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.”

Trump met Putin on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska, in their first face-to-face encounter since 2019 in the American president's first term. He described the talks as “warm,” while Putin called them “frank” and “substantive.”

He followed up on Monday with a phone call to the Russian president, briefing him on the talks in Washington. According to the Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, the call lasted 40 minutes, with both sides expressing readiness to continue discussions on a resolution with Zelensky.

Moscow maintains that any lasting settlement must eliminate the root causes of the conflict, address Russia's security concerns, and recognize current territorial realities, including the status of Crimea and the four former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia in 2022.

MOSCOW, August 19. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has dismissed as childish the European leaders' allegations that Russia launched an unprovoked attack on Ukraine.

""[There is] a clear understanding by both [US] President Donald] Trump and his team that this conflict has a reason. And that the talk that some presidents and prime ministers from Europe are indulging in about Russia attacking Ukraine without provocation is all childish. I can't find another word,"" Lavrov said in an interview with the Rossiya-24 TV channel.

""The main thing is that they continue to say this,"" Lavrov noted. ""And they continue, as their meeting in Washington with President Trump, where Vladimir Zelensky was also summoned, to demand an immediate ceasefire. At least some of them, such as Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, continue to say that it is necessary to put pressure on Russia with sanctions. None of these gentlemen even mentioned the phrase 'human rights.'""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Goal of European leaders at White House meeting was to try to push the Russian leader into a corner



The mood in the White House on Monday was strikingly upbeat.

Nato's ever-cheerful secretary general, Mark Rutte, set the tone as he addressed Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the gathered European leaders. “Let's make the best out of today,” he said with a smile, before repeatedly thanking the US president for his attention to the war in Ukraine.

That ritual of praise and gratitude continued throughout the day, as Zelenskyy and European leaders hailed supposed breakthroughs and spoke of progress on issues that remain far from clear.

Much of what unfolded at the White House looked less like serious planning to end the conflict than a performance for an audience of one: persuading Trump that Russia was the obstacle to peace.

When the US president suggested that Putin was ready for a meeting with Zelenskyy, other leaders quickly echoed the claim until it acquired the ring of truth.

Rutte even told Fox News Putin had agreed to meet Zelenskyy, a claim Moscow has conspicuously declined to confirm, instead saying that any such meeting would need to be “prepared extremely carefully”.

The conversation in Washington soon moved to security guarantees.

European leaders made clear they were prepared to go further than before in pledging protection for Ukraine – from article 5-style mutual defence commitments to talk of a British-backed “reassurance force” under a settlement.

But those ambitious pledges were as much about perception as policy.

Moscow has made clear that Nato troops in Ukraine are a red line, and Putin shows little interest in meeting Zelenskyy. Putin insists Zelensky is not a legitimate leader and has said that any meeting with him would only take place to sign a final peace deal.

Yet European leaders continue to push both ideas, which some observers view as a tactic to make Putin appear the one unwilling to budge.

“Most of their [European] optimistic statements aren't true beliefs, but meant to influence Trump. Europeans hype up expectations to create a reality in which Putin disappoints,” Janis Kluge, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, wrote on X.

“Europeans (hopefully) know that Putin will never agree to Nato troops in Ukraine. They know that Putin doesn't want to meet Zelenskyy. But they pretend all that is a realistic possibility to make Putin look as bad as he really is, to undermine Putin's own narratives,” Kluge added.

Putin, who has himself shown little desire to compromise on his maximalist demands, has also tried to frame the other side as the obstacle to peace.

In remarks after his Alaska summit with Trump, the Russian president warned that Kyiv and European capitals should not “throw a wrench in the works” by pursuing back-room dealings that could derail the “agreements” he reached with Trump.

There remains widespread confusion over what exactly Trump proposed and what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the Alaska summit.

Trump's team has presented Putin's core concession as agreeing to US and European security guarantees for Ukraine – though even that remains murky.

Moscow is reported to have floated a different idea: that China, Russia's ally, act as one of the guarantors of Ukraine's security, reviving a proposal first tabled by Russian negotiators during talks in Turkey in spring 2022.

For now, Europe's tactic seems to have paid off: Trump has temporarily refrained from attacking Zelenskyy or demanding that Ukraine hand over territory on the spot.

Putin, meanwhile, is being forced to now tread carefully in response to Trump's push for a Zelenskyy meeting. The Kremlin is expected to intensify pressure on Kyiv to accept Russian terms, framing it as groundwork for talks.

“That way Moscow can deflect claims Putin won't meet Zelenskyy, while signalling that any talks depend on Kyiv's willingness to concede,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre.

But Europe's far-reaching promises, designed in part to draw a reaction from Putin, may prove unrealistic once Ukraine needs clarity about what support it can truly expect.

“Security guarantees come in lots of shapes and sizes. But let's be clear: there's not going to be a US or European commitment to go to war with Russia if it reinvades Ukraine,” said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at Rand, a nonprofit global policy thinktank.

“This conversation is becoming divorced from reality,” Charap added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

MSF says low vaccination coverage and poor living conditions driving spread of deadly bacterial disease

Diphtheria cases are rapidly increasing across Somalia, officials and humanitarians warn, with children accounting for more than 97% of the cases.

Diphtheria, a highly contagious and deadly bacterial disease that mainly affects children, is preventable by a vaccine. While Somalia has improved vaccination rates in recent years, the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) blames the uptick in cases on persisting immunisation gaps.

Abdulrazaq Yusuf Ahmed, the director of Demartino public hospital in the capital, Mogadishu, said: “The number of recorded cases of children sick with diphtheria has increased across the regions in the whole country. We have received about 49 patients in the whole of 2024 but this year, 2025, we have received 497 diphtheria cases during the last four months alone.”

Deaths had risen from 13 to 42, according to a report by Ahmed's hospital this month. The report described the resurgence of diphtheria as “one of the most urgent and dangerous threats to public health”.

Earlier this month, the health ministry said it had recorded 1,616 cases and 87 deaths from the disease so far this year.

MSF's Somalia medical coordinator, Frida Athanassiadis, said: “We are seeing a rapid increase in diphtheria among children under 15 in central Somalia,” adding that they accounted for roughly 97% of cases. “Low vaccination coverage, vaccine hesitancy and poor living conditions are driving the spread.”

Athanassiadis said that in some medical centres the basic resources were “insufficient to cope with rising caseloads”.

MSF said while teams initially had a small emergency stock of the antitoxin, it had now been exhausted, with the health ministry and the World Health Organization helping to distribute the “limited available stock based on needs”.

In July, Save the Children warned that since April cases of measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, cholera and severe respiratory infections in Somalia had doubled from roughly 22,600 to more than 46,000. About 60% of the cases were children under five, it said.

“The sharp rise in vaccine-preventable diseases is linked to the recent aid cuts, which have impacted the health system's capacity to deliver essential services, including routine immunisation, and to treat and run catch-up campaigns to increase the immunity necessary to halt the outbreak,” the NGO said.

In Mogadishu, one resident, Abdiwahid Ali, said: “Many children in my neighbourhood are sick, some of them hospitalised.”

Anab Hassan, a grocer, said people were concerned about the outbreak. “A friend of mine lost a five-year-old daughter who was diagnosed with diphtheria, and several others told me their children are sick and coughing,” she said. “We hear about children getting sick every day.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russia has resumed grain shipments to Syria from within occupied Crimea, transporting stolen grain from Ukraine's occupied territories, reported Kateryna Yaresko, a journalist with the Ukrainian SeaKrime project that tracks Russia's illegal shipping activity.

Moscow's grain theft from occupied territories began in 2014 when Russia first invaded Ukraine and continued after the full-scale invasion launched in February 2022.

Russian forces have seized millions of tons of Ukrainian grain from occupied areas, with at least 180,000 tons looted through the port of Mariupol alone, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said in October 2024.

Russia is now conducting its third grain shipment in the past month from occupied Ukrainian territories to Syria, according to the investigation.

The Comoros-flagged bulk carrier Damas Wave, listed in databases under its former name Golden Yara, operates regular routes between occupied Feodosia in Crimea and Syria's Tartous port, carrying grain shipments.

The vessel departed the Crimean port for Syria for the third time on August 15 or 16, loaded with cargo, journalist Kateryna Yaresko reports.

""Regular bilateral trade relations between Russian occupiers and Syria are now underway, with stolen Ukrainian grain shipments to Syria resuming,"" Yaresko wrote on her X social media page.

As Reuters previously reported, Russia suspended grain exports to Syria in 2024 due to uncertainty following Bashar al-Assad's regime collapse. However, wheat deliveries resumed in April 2025.

In 2023, beyond the Crimean port, Russia also moved stolen grain by truck through temporarily occupied Mariupol, shipping it to Russia.

Russian forces compel farmers in temporarily occupied territories to sell grain at fixed prices significantly below market rates.

In April 2025, Ukraine's security service seized a foreign vessel loaded with approximately 5,000 tons of wheat, allegedly involved in transporting stolen Ukrainian grain from Russian-occupied territories.

Earlier investigations by The Kyiv Independent revealed how Russia systematically exports stolen Ukrainian coal from occupied territories through Mariupol port to global markets.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz says Putin-Zelenskyy meeting within two weeks

This was a roundup of news and analysis on Russia's war in Ukraine from Monday and Tuesday, August 18, 19, 2025.

DW's coverage continues here: Trump calls Putin to arrange talks with Zelenskyy

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul says talks between Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin must begin with a ceasefire. 

""Someone needs to make a move and that someone is President Putin,"" Wadephul said during a visit to a US naval base in Japan.

He said Ukraine needs to ""think very carefully"" about the type of negotiations and the desired outcome.

Wadephul emphasized that lasting peace will require strong security guarantees for Ukraine, with both Germany and the United States ready to support them. 

However, he said, Putin must first be willing to ""negotiate in a truly substantive manner and, above all, to agree to a ceasefire."" 

Wadephul added that any German involvement would need parliamentary approval.

He called the moment a rare opportunity to end the war in Ukraine and said every effort must be made to seize it.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was ready to hold one-on-one talks with Russia's President Vladimir Putin to end the war.

""I confirmed — and all European leaders supported me —  that we are ready for a bilateral meeting with Putin,"" Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy made the comments to reporters following talks with US President Donald Trump and European leaders at the White House.

The Ukrainian leader said that he was ready to meet with Putin in ""any type of format"" without preconditions.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that discussions were taking place on Ukrainian security guarantees, similar to those of NATO member states.

""What we are discussing here is not NATO membership. What we're discussing here is Article 5 type of security guarantees for Ukraine,"" Rutte said.

""And what they exactly will entail will now be more specifically discussed,"" the NATO chief added.

Rutte said there had been no discussion in Washington of deploying ground troops and described the White House meeting as a success.

Article 5 refers to NATO's collective defense principle, under which other states come to the aid of a member state if it is attacked.

Zelenskyy has called for guarantees of assistance from the West based on Article 5 of the NATO Treaty.

French President Emmanuel Macron expressed a degree of caution over a possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Macron said that while a meeting between the two would be a move forward after talks with US President Donald Trump, he remained skeptical.

""Do I think they could be conclusive? I remain very cautious,"" Macron said, emphasizing that there was still much to be done.

""We have the American president and Ukraine who want peace... I am not convinced about Putin,"" the French president said.

""I have the greatest doubts about the Russian president's desire for peace. His ultimate goal is to take as much territory as possible, weaken Ukraine and have a Ukraine that is not viable on its own or within Russia's sphere of influence. This is pretty obvious to everyone,"" Macron said.

The French leader warned that should the process be rejected then sanctions on Russia would need to be ratcheted up in order to pressure Moscow back to the negotiating table.

Joining US President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in the East Room of the White House, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stressed the importance of a ceasefire in Ukraine whereas France's President Emmanuel Macron talked about the need for security guarantees.

DW's Washington bureau chief, Ines Pohl, asked German Chancellor Friedrich Merz if he would be willing to send German peacekeeping troops to Ukraine.

""The question of who should be involved in the security guarantees and to what extent will have to be discussed with our European partners and the US government,"" said Merz.

""What is totally clear is that all of Europe should be involved. This isn't just about Ukraine's territory, it's about the political order of Europe and there, Germany has a major interest and a major responsibility,"" the German chancellor stressed.

""So being involved for me is clear, to what extent, we have to discuss that in Europe,"" Merz said.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine had been discussed with European partners.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to take place within the next two weeks.

""The American president spoke with the Russian president on the phone and agreed that there would be a meeting between the Russian president and the Ukrainian president within the next two weeks,"" the Reuters news agency quoted Merz as telling reporters.

The German chancellor said the location was yet to be determined.

The comments come after President Donald Trump said arrangements were being made for face-to-face talks between Putin and Zelenskyy to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.

US President Donald Trump said that his meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders had been ""very good.""

Trump said that arrangements were now being made for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy.

""At the conclusion of the meetings, I called President Putin, and began the arrangements for a meeting, at a location to be determined, between President Putin and President Zelenskyy,"" Trump said, adding that US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff would make arrangements between the two countries.

""After that meeting takes place, we will have a Trilat, which would be the two Presidents, plus myself,"" Trump said.

The US president also said that security guarantees for Ukraine, provided by European countries and coordinated by the US, were discussed.

A White House official has announced that US President Donald Trump's meeting with European leaders in the East Room has ended.

It was not immediately clear if the leaders would meet in another format later in the day.

Trump had earlier said he would invite them back to the Oval Office after the session ended.

French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed expanding negotiations on Ukraine to include European leaders.

He made the comments Monday during peace talks with US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and other EU leaders.

Macron called a touted trilateral meeting with the US, Russia, and Ukraine ""very important"" but said Europe should also take part, without naming who would represent it.

Macron added that a quadrilateral format would be needed because security guarantees must cover the entire continent. He said this was why Europe stood united with Ukraine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the talks for peace in Ukraine, taking place in Washington, were an important moment.

""We are here, as allies and friends, for peace in Ukraine and in Europe,"" Von der Leyen said in a post on social media platform X.

""This is an important moment, as we continue to work on strong security guarantees for Ukraine and a lasting and durable peace,"" the EU chief added. 

Von der Leyen is among a group of European leaders attending talks at the White House aimed at bringing an end to the war in Ukraine.

When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last visited the White House, his military-style outfit drew scorn from US President Donald Trump.

Their February meeting ended in bickering and Zelenskyy being escorted out early, without lunch.

On Monday, under pressure to accept a peace deal in Europe's deadliest war in 80 years, Zelenskyy returned in a black-on-black ensemble — no tie, but closer to formalwear. The change won Trump's approval.

A reporter who had ribbed Zelenskyy in February over not wearing a suit complimented his new look. ""You look fabulous in that suit,"" the reporter said. Trump quickly added: ""I said the same thing.""

Zelenskyy seized the moment with a quip. ""You're wearing the same suit,"" he told the reporter. ""I changed.""

The Ukrainian leader has worn military-style clothes since Russia's 2022 invasion to show solidarity with his troops. But after the February fiasco, he began shifting to more formal attire — wearing a black field jacket and shirt, buttoned to the collar but tie-less, at Pope Francis's funeral in April.

The criticism over his White House appearance earlier this year was widely rejected in Ukraine, where Zelenskyy's wartime leadership has drawn broad support.

Germany's best-selling newspaper, Bild, reported that US President Donald Trump interrupted talks with the visiting European delegation to make a phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The publication's deputy editor-in-chief, Paul Ronzheimer, wrote that Trump had announced he would call Putin following his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and that the round of talks with European leaders would resume afterwards.

The nature of the call was not yet known.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived at the White House for crucial talks with US President Donald Trump. Ahead of the bilateral meeting Zelenskyy told reporters that his country was ready to agree on a peace deal with Russia.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday praised US President Donald Trump for opening a path to peace in Russia's war in Ukraine, calling him the one who broke the deadlock with Vladimir Putin.

""I really want to thank the president of the United States, dear Donald, who broke the deadlock with President Putin by starting that dialogue back in February. From there we are now where we are today,"" Rutte said at the White House.

Rutte, sometimes described in European capitals as the ""Trump whisperer"" for his rapport with the US leader, urged all sides to seize the moment.

""If we play this well, we can end this. We have to stop the killing, we have to stop the destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure. It is a terrible war and I am really excited. Let's make the best out of today and get this thing to an end as soon as possible,"" he added.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

For Black August, Mireille Fanon Mendès-France sets the record straight on her father's revolutionary legacy.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Public gatherings this week in Jackson, Mississippi and New Orleans, Louisiana — featuring an especially distinctive guest — will honor the legacy of revolutionary psychiatrist Frantz Fanon (1925-1961). The Black Alliance for Peace, an African internationalist organization committed to peace and opposition to war and imperialism, and Cooperation Jackson, which is building a solidarity economy anchored by worker-owned co-ops in West Jackson, are co-hosting several Black August events with Fanon's eldest daughter. Mireille Fanon Mendès-France is a jurist, an educator, and an anti-racism expert who passionately shares her father's commitment to rebellion against colonialism in its many forms. She founded the Frantz Fanon Foundation in 2007 to connect his theoretical work to ongoing anti-colonialist struggles like those Black communities throughout the Deep South are facing, especially the kind of ongoing mass displacement that occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina 20 years ago. Kali Akuno of Cooperation Jackson told Truthout that Fanon Mendès-France has a great deal to share about her father's contributions in raising consciousness about what it takes to fight against fascism, “because that is what we are staring down.”

Fanon fought the Nazis in World War II with the Free French Forces. Later, he fought for independence against the reactionary colonial regime in Algeria, which, Akuno said, used Nazi tactics against the national liberation movement. “We are doing this consciousness raising in a period where they are deliberately erasing all oppositional history and knowledge, and they're doing it very intentionally under the color of law. If we don't recall the lessons of our earlier generations who fought against colonial erasure, who fought against white supremacy, then we're gonna lose this battle before it even begins.” Akuno explained that a backdrop to all this is the ongoing genocide in Palestine; Fanon Mendès-France is directly tied into the struggle of Arab and North African/Southwest Asian people. “There's many intersections that we're trying to get at this year, and she's one of the best people who encapsulates it all.” 

Shortly before her travels to the U.S., Mireille Fanon Mendès-France spoke to Truthout by phone about combating disinformation about her father's work, her eagerness to be in community in the U.S. with anti-colonial activists, and why defeatism is not an option. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Frances Madeson: The centenary of Frantz Fanon has inspired commemorative events all over the world — in Martinique, the Caribbean island where he was born on July 20, 1925, into French colonial dominance in the region; across Europe, where he studied psychiatry and began to write explicitly about the anti-Black racism he encountered there; in Africa, where he lived and was engaged during the bloody struggle for Algerian independence from colonial France; and in the United States, where he died prematurely from leukemia on December 6, 1961, at only 36 years old.

His main books — The Wretched of the Earth (1961) and Black Skin, White Masks (1952) — are still in print and have been translated into more than 25 languages. His singular contributions to anti-colonial psychiatry and humanism are widely studied and deeply embedded in the practices of a growing cadre of Fanonian psychoanalysts who deploy his insights in the service of fostering anti-colonial consciousness in the Palestine solidarity movement and beyond. One would think Frantz Fanon's legacy would be a settled matter. But is it?

Mireille Fanon Mendès-France: Unfortunately, no. The work of decolonial emancipation remains to be done. But before getting to these points, I would like to emphasize that this centenary has given rise to numerous events, particularly in Martinique. One was presented on March 15, 2025, by an organization founded by the Békés — who are descendants of former colonizers and enslavers who continue to control the island's economy. This association, Tous Créoles, hosted an exceptional conference on Frantz Fanon entitled “Fanon the Humanist.” 

Their aim was to demonstrate that the philosophy of Tous Créoles is in line with Frantz Fanon's by extracting certain quotes and taking them out of context, thereby reinforcing their positions: “I am not a slave to the slavery that dehumanized my fathers. … I, a man of color, want only one thing: that the instrument never dominate man.” The use of these quotes supports their argument. Likewise, “There is no Negro mission; there is no white burden. There is a struggle for the triumph of human dignity, for the disappearance of human humiliation, whatever the origin of that humiliation.” These quotes can be interpreted in any way one wishes if one remains on the surface, but above all, they can be used to demonstrate that Frantz Fanon was not in contradiction with the dominant colonial thinking, particularly that of the Békés, who for several years have been trying to reverse the burden of proof by demonstrating, through this kind of instrumentalization of Frantz Fanon's thinking, among other things, that they stand alongside the descendants of enslaved people. 

These Békés are trying to do what successive Israeli governments have tried to do with the Palestinian people, victims of an illegal occupation that constitutes a war crime and genocide. The Békés try to impose their own agenda by showing their credentials to those they despise, because their colonizer's unconscious has never abandoned the coloniality of power that led them to consider Black bodies as unimportant because they are commodifiable. Above all, they are trying to promote the myth propagated by the anti-Black (and anti-Arab and anti-Islamic) right wing of “living together,” which means that the dominated must accept the yoke of the dominant without ever questioning this ancestral domination rooted in the racist capitalist system. In twisting Fanon's thinking to a message that descendants of enslavers and the enslaved should live together in harmony without any reckoning, this is an instrumentalization of Fanonian thinking, and part of a disturbing tendency toward normalization of institutional racism, négrophobia, and colonialism which we see constantly since October 7, 2023. 

Why is there so much will to transform the thinking of Frantz Fanon to say things he did not say and to defend positions which are absolutely contradictory to his own? Why does Fanon become compatible with the most racist white thinking, which continues to enrich itself on the backs of Black people?

Let us not forget that Frantz Fanon was a man of rupture, no compromise with the enemy: as presented by the Békés, he becomes consensual, stripping him of his radicalism to make him acceptable to those who rejected him for decades, criticizing him for resigning from his position as chief physician at the Blida hospital and for committing himself intellectually, physically, politically, and in solidarity to the struggle for liberation of a people who had suffered under colonial rule for over a century.

In another event, organized by the Cercle Frantz Fanon, one of their speakers said that Fanon's ideas are no longer accurate or relevant because in Martinique, or in Guadeloupe, which are overseas French colonies, there is no more colonialism. As proof, he said, “Have you ever seen a colonizer giving monthly social services to the colonized people? Have you seen in a colonized country, one family having two or even three cars!?” What is the benefit for participants at a conference organized as part of the centenary celebrations to listen to such statements? It is a non-starter, and, above all, it closes the debate. Does Fanon get him down? What does this thinker say to him about his difficulty in understanding the current world, which is part of a colonization that has never been abandoned but is truly violent? Is the return to the future here?

Fortunately, there was another event, a conference sponsored by the Caribbean Philosophical Association (CPA), and the Frantz Fanon Foundation organized one plenary. The foundation has close ties and works with grassroots organizations fighting for their rights while questioning their practices in the light of leaders who have reflected on the nature of anti-colonialist engagement from a decolonial approach. The goal was for the panelists to share their thoughts so that CPA participants could step outside their intellectual positions and confront the difficult economic situation. The economic sector is under a stranglehold by the Békés, as it was under the period of enslavement and after abolition. 

In Martinique just last fall there was an economic riot: the Vie Chère protests against the high cost of living, during which 140 protesters were arrested and four were killed. Activists have filed a complaint against the high cost of living, aiming to put an end to decades of anti-competitive and abusive practices organized by the Békés with the full support of the government. This is a prime example of colonial power through economic capture, enriching a handful of actors at the expense of the “Non-Beings.” For the Frantz Fanon Foundation, it was also a question of reflecting, based on these struggles, on the role that a philosophical approach should play in the quest for radical change in the economic model of colonized territories.

I'm reluctant to share this with you, but since you're coming to the U.S., I think you should know: A KKK flyer was distributed in Cincinnati, Ohio, widely enough that a city councilman felt compelled to issue a dignified rebuttal in a Facebook post. In it, he entreats state politicians to stop fanning damaging flames of racism about his city. 

In the spirit of internationalism, you're set to meet with two Black-led organizations unapologetically resisting the rise of a neo-Confederate order in the U.S. — the Black Alliance for Peace and Cooperation Jackson. What are you hoping to build with them?

We have no choice but to build alliances between dominated victims of négrophobia; alliances based on ethical principles considering that the fight against institutional racism and for land and human dignity are essential if we want to change the world. But this is not enough; everyone agrees, including the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the World Bank. The essential principle on which we must agree is that no change will be possible within the racist, capitalist, and liberal system. This system has killed our ancestors and continues to spoil, kill, exclude, and commit genocide.

The poster you sent me, “Arm yourselves, white citizens of Cincinnati,” speaks loudly about this return to the future. We really need to be concerned and prepare ourselves. In the United States, will Black people have to endure the return of the KKK? Will those who claim to be in solidarity remain as silent as they were during the first six months of the genocide organized by the Israeli state with the complicit support of many members of the international community?

That is why meeting, exchanging ideas, sharing thoughts, and perhaps setting up an alert platform is part of the resistance struggle. If we do not resist and if we do not equip ourselves with the means to resist, we are, in a sense, dead. One might wonder if it is not too late, but in this fight, defeatism has no place. 

Kali Akuno told Truthout that one of his aims for your joint events is to link the legacy of resistance and sacrifice in Africa with the history of struggle and resistance that came out of Hurricane Katrina, which he says is downplayed. 

He was part of the New Day Collective's sustained resistance to the ideology permeating the Green Dot Plan, an actual development plan floated in 2006 with a nefarious map to indicate where the priorities for the city's recovery should be. Areas in the green dots would be left as open space in a bold land grab to create a “New” New Orleans — smaller, whiter and more affluent. From the heart of one of those green dots, their Fight Back Center was the epicenter of the struggle to save public housing throughout New Orleans for years. Yet, the center's sustained role has been erased in dominant media narratives and the city's militant history has not been widely celebrated in Katrina commemorations.

Akuno also says that in order to keep New Orleans from being further gentrified, a new struggle is going to have to be raised.

I agree with Kali; I'm also interested in discussing Fanon's thinking, his thinking in action, with people touched by the Katrina disaster. 

The trip is not just to make a declaration, or to pay tribute to Frantz Fanon, even if he helps us to continue the fight.

Are the outcomes of willful climate inaction — the terrifying wildfires, smoke-filled summer air, droughts, and floods and storms like Katrina — related to coloniality?

It is another way to kill the people, to maintain the permanent war against the people, to make their environment uninhabitable.

Looking to international institutions like the United Nations is not the solution. In fact, it's part of our problem. The UN is the perfect example of paradoxical thinking — something for the people, but they act against the people.

The best example is Haiti: the cholera the UN spread, the mass death it caused, and everything they've done with The Core Group [a political entity formed by a UN Security Council Resolution in 2004; its creation was originally proposed as a six-month interim transition support measure, yet it endures to this day].

Even as we're talking, there's a palpable dread of imminent mass death in Gaza because the U.S. and Israel are actively starving the people. How is the emancipation of Black people in the U.S. related to the liberation, then emancipation, of Palestinians?

What we have to understand is what was done against African people from the mid-15th century until now, is the same paradigm in Gaza — a continuation of the permanent war against people, authorized by the early papal bulls of the Doctrine of Discovery. You want something, first you kill the people: like it was done in the transatlantic slave trade. The powerful fight against the people, because for this system, the problem is the people.

If we want to get our emancipation, we have to try to invert the relation of power, because until now, the capitalist system has been stronger than the social movement. But maybe we have to think about how to be in solidarity with people under attack, how to be engaged a little bit differently — what does it mean to be engaged and in solidarity with people who are fighting?

A U.S. appeals court has temporarily blocked the transfer of federal forest land in Arizona to a pair of international companies that plan to mine one of the largest copper deposits in North America. 

The transfer was scheduled for Tuesday. But a panel of judges with the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals issued a temporary injunction late Monday in response to last-minute appeals by a Native American tribe and environmentalists.

The land includes Oak Flat — an area used for centuries for religious ceremonies, prayer and gathering of medicinal plants by the San Carlos Apache people and other Native American tribes.

The fight over Oak Flat has spanned two decades, with the latest legal wrangling centered on a required environmental review that was released by the U.S. Forest Service earlier this summer and an appraisal of the land to be mined by Resolution Copper about 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Phoenix. 

Before the land exchange can happen, the plaintiffs argued that the federal government must prepare a comprehensive review that covers “every aspect of the planned mine and all related infrastructure.” They said the government failed to consider the potential for a dam breach, pipeline failure and if there was an emergency plan for a tailings storage area.

As for the appraisal, they said it doesn't account for the value of the copper deposits that are at least 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) below the surface.

The appeals court plans to hear arguments on the merits of the case later this year.




Opponents of the mine consider the court action a victory, saying prayers are paying off.

“This injunction comes in a desperate time of asking for miracles, all over the country and all over the world,” Wendsler Nosie Sr. of the group Apache Stronghold said in a statement shared on social media.

Nosie, a former tribal chairman, described the land and water at Oak Flat as precious.

Apache Stronghold, the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other plaintiffs having been fighting for years to save what tribal members call Chi'chil Bildagoteel. The area is dotted with oak groves and traditional plants the Apaches consider essential to their religion. 

“We will continue praying that the court understands the grave injustice of trading our sacred grounds to foreign mining companies that seek to destroy Chí'chil Biłdagoteel to extract copper that will be exported overseas,” Tribal Chairman Terry Rambler said in statement.

Resolution Copper — a subsidiary of international mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP — estimates the mine will generate $1 billion a year for Arizona's economy and create thousands of jobs. The project has support in the nearby community of Superior.

Resolution Copper has said the project underwent an extensive review by the U.S. Forest Service that has included consultation with tribes that have ancestral ties to the land. 

“The collaborative process has directly led to major changes to the mining plan to preserve and reduce potential impacts on tribal, social, environmental and cultural interests,” the company stated.

The Forest Service has argued in court filings that it has no discretion because the land exchange was mandated by Congress when language was included in a must-pass national defense spending bill that was signed into law in 2014 by then-President Barack Obama.

There have been unsuccessful legislative attempts in the years since to withdraw the Oak Flat area from mining activity.

Despite a flurry of meetings and guarded optimism amongst world leaders, there was little concrete progress on the main obstacles to ending Russia's three-year war on Ukraine. (AP Video by Nathan Ellgren)

President Donald Trump on Tuesday offered his assurances that U.S. troops would not be sent to Ukraine to defend against Russia, after seeming to leave open the possibility the day before. Trump also said in a morning TV interview that Ukraine's hopes of joining NATO and regaining the Crimean Peninsula are “impossible.”

Details of the security guarantees and Trump's efforts to arrange peace talks continue to evolve after the U.S. president, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders held hours of talks at the White House aimed at ending Russia's war against Ukraine.

European leaders said they want U.S. support for “robust security guarantees,” including the “deployment of a reassurance force” as Trump pursues his campaign promise to end the grinding war.

What to know about efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war:















Other news we're following:








The IRS fired more than 7,000 probationary employees earlier this year without following internal procedures and failed to consider the workers' individual performance, despite firing them for bad performance reviews, a new report states.

The report was released by the IRS' Inspector General, Tuesday. It does not contain recommendations and is informational only.

Treasury's Inspector General for Tax Administration states that several senior IRS officials raised concerns to the IRS' inspector general that probationary employees did not have documented performance issues and were falsely terminated for bad performance.

The report states that many workers never had a performance review since they had only been recently hired. And of the 3,599 probationary employees who received a performance rating, 3,251 (or 90 percent) had a fully successful rating on their evaluation and 305 (8 percent) had an outstanding rating.

The Justice Department has opened an investigation into whether police officials in Washington, D.C., have falsified crime data, according to a person familiar with the probe who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss an open investigation.

The investigation comes amid an escalating — and political — showdown between the Trump administration and the city over control of the police department. It wasn't immediately clear what federal laws could have been violated by the possible manipulation of crime data.

The mayor's office declined to comment on the matter.

The New York Times was first to report on the investigation. Earlier this year, a Metropolitan Police Department commander suspected of manipulating crime data was placed on paid administrative leave, NBC Washington reported.



Leavitt says she doesn't think Trump was joking when he suggested during a Fox News Channel interview that he was helping to seek peace between Russia and Ukraine, at least in part, because he wanted to go to heaven.

“I think the president was serious,” the press secretary said.

She then added, to a smattering of laughter from reporters in the White House briefing room, “I think the president wants to get to heaven, as I hope we all do in this room as well.”

The White House said Tuesday that the administration is working on a deal that would have the U.S. take a 10% stake in the computer chip maker Intel.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the Commerce Department, led by Secretary Howard Lutnick, is working on it and “ironing out the details.”

“The president wants to put America's needs first, both from a national security and economic perspective,” Leavitt said Tuesday. “It's a creative idea that has never been done before to ensure that we're both reshoring these critical supply chains, while also gaining something of it for the American taxpayer.”

The Kremlin has not yet said whether Putin has signed off on Trump's push to arrange direct talks between the Russian leader and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

But asked Tuesday's whether Putin has promised Trump that he'll meet directly with the Ukrainian leader, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded affirmatively.

“He has,” Leavitt said of Putin.

Trump early on Monday during talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders said that he was pressing for three-way talks among Zelenskyy, Putin and himself. But after speaking to Putin later in the day, Trump said that he was arranging first for a face-to-face between Zelenskyy and Putin and that three-way talks would follow if necessary.

“It was an idea that evolved in the course of the president's conversations with both President Putin, President Zelensky and the European leaders yesterday,” Leavitt explained.

Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, said Tuesday that his boss “very much welcomes” President Trump's focus “on achieving a peaceful settlement in Ukraine” through the summits held in the last week. But he indicated that its crucial Ukraine remains at the table for any future negotiation.

“For him, it's very important that all involved continue to stay actively engaged and we want to an inclusive dialogue to sustain the important momentum that was created to bring an immediate ceasefire and sustainable peace,” Dujarric said.

He added that the U.N. stands ready to provide any peacekeeping efforts as part of the security guarantees that are being discussed.

The AAP is strongly recommending COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years. This age group is at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and it's important that recommendations continue to emphasize the need for them to get vaccinated, said Dr. James Campbell, vice chair of the AAP infectious diseases committee.

Shots also are advised for older children if parents want their kids vaccinated, and are recommended for older children whose chronic lung diseases or other conditions put them at higher risk for severe disease, the AAP said. 

“It is going to be somewhat confusing. But our opinion is we need to make the right choices for children to protect them,” Campbell said.

In a statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said “the AAP is undermining national immunization policymaking with baseless political attacks.”

For the first time in 30 years, the American Academy of Pediatrics is substantially diverging from U.S. government vaccine recommendations.

The group's new COVID-19 recommendations — released Tuesday — come amid a tumultuous year for public health, as vaccine skeptics have come into power in the new Trump administration and government guidance has become increasingly confusing. 

The AAP is strongly recommending COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years. Shots also are advised for older children if parents want their kids vaccinated, the AAP said.

That differs from guidance established under U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which doesn't recommend the shots for healthy children of any age but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians.

Both Trump and the Democrats are looking ahead to 2026 knowing that the next midterm elections often go against the president's party, as they did during Trump's first term in 2018. Republicans currently have a seven-seat majority in the 435-member House.

State legislatures draw the lines after each U.S. census in most states — including Texas — and only a few dozen House districts are competitive.

In Texas, Republicans hold 25 of 38 seats, and they're trying to increase that to 30. In California, Democrats have 43 of the 52 seats, and they're trying to boost that to 48, to wipe out the advantage the GOP would gain from redrawing lines in Texas.

Texas Democrats ended a two-week walkout Monday that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts as part of a national partisan brawl over President Donald Trump's desire to reshape U.S. House maps to his advantage.

Republicans are hoping to prevent more quorum delays as they redraw the U.S. House maps to give Trump five more seats, so they've required Democratic legislators to agree to around-the-clock surveillance before they leave the floor. 

Rep. Nicole Collier, of Fort Worth, said she spent the night in the chamber rather than sign away her dignity and allow Republicans to “control my movements and monitor me.”

“I know these maps will harm my constituents,” her statement said. “I won't just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.”

The Department of Public Safety didn't immediately respond Tuesday to a message seeking comment. 

The Democrats' return to Texas puts the Republican-run Legislature in position to satisfy Trump's demands. If they do, California Democrats are preparing to retaliate by asking voters to approve their own new congressional boundaries.

World leaders understand that flattery is the way to winning over the unpredictable Trump, having taken their cue from Zelenskyy‘s disastrous White House scolding six months ago.

With peace talks on the table, Zelenskyy thanked Trump and others nine times in the first minute of their initial public meeting at the White House on Monday. Appearing later with top leaders from Europe, Zelenskyy expressed his thanks at least seven more times, twice for a map Trump had presented him.

He was not alone. Trump himself used the T-word about a dozen times in the later meeting. Starmer thanked the president four times. And NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called Trump “amazing.”

The Air Force's top uniformed officer is set to retire early in the most recent shakeup of military leadership during Trump's second term.

An Air Force announcement Monday said Gen. David Allvin will continue as the service's chief of staff until the Senate confirms a replacement. It says Allvin expects to retire around Nov. 1, two years into his four-year term.

Allvin, an appointee of President Joe Biden, has served since November 2023.

Trump's push to do away with voting by mail will likely find support among Republican voters who doubt its reliability, but it could impact candidates in Trump's GOP: About 2 in 10 Trump voters in the 2024 presidential election cast a mail-in ballot, according to AP VoteCast.

Republican voters were less confident in the accuracy of mailed ballots than independents and Democratic voters ahead of the 2024 election, according to AP-NORC polling from October.

Only about 1 in 10 Republican voters were “extremely” or “very” confident that ballots mailed using a drop box or via the U.S. Postal Service would be counted accurately. About one-quarter of independents and roughly 6 in 10 Democrats were confident in their accuracy.

Vice President JD Vance is traveling to Georgia on Thursday to continue his nationwide tour promoting the new Republican tax law.

Vance will be in the Atlanta suburb of Peachtree City, where his office says he'll “highlight President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill and the historic tax cuts it delivered for working class American families.”

Vance has already gone to Ohio and Pennsylvania to talk up the law, which preserved existing tax rates for individual earners while offering temporary tax breaks for tips and overtime.

Georgia will have one of the most hotly-contested Senate races in the 2026 midterms as first-term Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff runs for reelection in a state Trump won in 2024.

Trump has said the U.S. will help the European effort to provide Ukraine the security guarantees it seeks to prevent Russia from invading again after the war ends.

On Monday, he did not rule out sending U.S. troops to join any such effort. But when asked during a TV interview on Tuesday to offer assurances that American troops won't be defending Ukraine's border going forward and after his administration ends, Trump said, “Well, you have my assurance and I'm president.”

Vegas resorts and convention centers are reporting 11% fewer visitors in June compared to last year, and 13% fewer international tourists. Hotel occupancy fell by about 15%, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. 

Some officials are blaming Trump tariffs and immigration policies. Mayor Shelley Berkley said tourism from Canada — Nevada's largest international market — has dried from a torrent “to a drip.” 

Ted Pappageorge, head of the powerful Culinary Workers Union, called it the “Trump slump.” He said visits from Southern California, home to a large Latino population, were also drying up because people are afraid of the administration's immigration crackdown. “If you if you tell the rest of the world they're not welcome, then they won't come,” he said.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told a virtual meeting of the ‘Coalition of the Willing' on Tuesday that there was “a real sense of unity and shared goal of securing a just and lasting peace for Ukraine” at their White House meeting with Trump.

Starmer and Macron also discussed how more sanctions and other pressure could be placed on Putin until he shows he's “ready to take serious action to end his illegal invasion,” according to the the Downing Street statement.

The U.K. Chief of Defense Staff, Adm. Tony Radakin, is travelling to Washington as teams from the coalition of more than 30 nations meet with U.S. counterparts to strengthen “plans to deliver robust security guarantees and prepare for the deployment of a reassurance force if the hostilities ended,“ the statement said.

French President Emmanuel Macron said it could happen “in Europe” and he's advocating for Geneva in Switzerland, although he said it could be another ‘neutral” country. He noted in an interview with French television TF1-LCI broadcast Tuesday that Istanbul hosted the most recent bilateral discussions, in 2022.

Meanwhile, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said his country would be prepared to organize such a summit, Swiss public broadcaster SRF reported.

Asked about the complication posed by the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Putin, Cassis said “the aim of receiving Mr. Putin in Switzerland without him being arrested is 100% achievable … of course, if he comes to Switzerland for the purposes of peace, for such a multilateral conference, not if he comes for private matters.”

Cassis said arranging for Putin to avoid arrest would require “a certain procedure,” but it could be done “in a few days.”

European Council President Antonio Costa called for “Russia must immediately end the violence” in Ukraine after a virtual meeting of the 27 heads of state of the European Union's member nations. “Our top priority must be to stop the killings — whether we call it a ceasefire or a truce is secondary,” Costa told reporters Tuesday. 

Economic pressure via sanctions should be maintained on Russia to end the war, and Ukraine's candidacy to join the EU should be accelerated, he said: “Ukraine's future is not only about strong security guarantees and their finding a potential peace deal with Russia, but also about its European path. This is why we must move forward with the enlargement process.”

A Ukrainian political analyst says this Zelenskyy meeting with Trump ‘went satisfactorily.'

“The task of this meeting was to prevent Trump from pressuring Ukraine with Russian demands. We managed to achieve that 100%. We managed to explain that the issue of territories is not just about land—it's about people. There can be no exchange,” Oleh Saakian said.

“For Ukraine, the meeting with Putin is important to show Trump whether Russia is really ready to end the war. It is important to demonstrate that Ukraine has done everything possible on its side,” Saakian said. “I don't think anyone in Ukraine has the illusion that a meeting with Putin could suddenly bring peace. It's not as if at a meeting with Zelenskyy, Putin will suddenly say: ‘Yes, I was mistaken, I confess, I withdraw the troops, I give back the territories.'”

Trump says Putin and Zelenskyy are getting along “a little better than I thought,” noting the “tremendous bad blood” between them.

He said his perception of their relationship is why he's arranging for them to meet one-on-one soon, instead of a three-way meeting with himself as sort of a mediator.

“I think they're doing OK. I wouldn't say they are ever going to be best friends, but they're doing OK,” the president told Fox News Channel's “Fox and Friends.”

“You know, they're the ones that have to call the shots,” Trump said. “We're 7,000 miles away.”

The president said he thought it would have been disrespectful to handle the phone call that way since Putin and the European leaders meeting with him at the White House haven't had the “warmest relations.”

But despite that, he said during an interview on Fox News Channel's “Fox and Friends” that he has managed to maintain a “very good relationship” with Putin.

Trump was holding talks at the White House on Monday with Zelenskyy and the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the European Union and NATO on ending Russia's war on Ukraine.

The president, in a morning interview on “Fox & Friends,” said that he's optimistic a deal can be made to bring an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

But Trump underscored that Ukraine will have to set aside both its hope of a returned Crimea, which Russia seized by force in 2014, and its aspirations to join the NATO military alliance.

“Both of those things are impossible,” Trump said.

Putin, as part of any potential deal, is looking for the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as recognition of Crimea as Russian territory.

The state and federal government had argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility is located is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district was the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district.

Judge Ruiz had hinted during a hearing last week that he had some concerns over which jurisdiction was appropriate.

The state and federal government defendants made an identical argument last week about jurisdiction for a second lawsuit in which environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued to stop further construction and operations at the Everglades detention center until it's in compliance with federal environmental laws.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in Miami on Aug. 7 ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing that wrapped up last week. She has said she plans to issue a ruling before the order expires later this week. She had yet to rule on the venue question.

A federal judge in Miami issued a split decision in a lawsuit over the legal rights of detainees at the “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, dismissing part of the suit and also moving the case to a different jurisdiction.

U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz issued the decision late Monday, writing in a 47-page ruling that claims the detainees at the facility don't have confidential access to their lawyers or to hearings in immigration court were rendered moot when the Trump administration recently designated the Krome North Processing Center near Miami as a site for their cases to be heard.

The judge heard arguments from both sides in a hearing earlier Monday in Miami. Civil rights attorneys were seeking a preliminary injunction to ensure detainees at the facility have access to their lawyers and can get a hearing.

Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang joins ‘Fox News Live' to explain how a potential peace deal between Ukraine and Russia could be viewed in Asia, particularly by China and North Korea.

North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un called for the rapid buildup of his nation's nuclear arsenal on Tuesday, reacting to joint military operations by the U.S. and South Korea.

Kim called the military exercises an ""obvious expression of their will to provoke war,"" according to North Korean state media. The U.S. and South Korea began their annual military drills, dubbed Ulchi Freedom Shield, this week and operations will continue sporadically through September.

The North Korean leader argued the drills show the intent by the U.S. and South Korea to ""remain most hostile and confrontational,"" and that North Korea must therefore ""rapidly expand"" its nuclear arsenal.

""Through this move, North Korea is demonstrating its refusal to accept denuclearization and the will to irreversibly upgrade nuclear weapons,"" Hong Min, a North Korea analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told Reuters.

The rise in tensions comes just days after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung announced plans to end some military activities along its border with North Korea, as well as restore a 2018 military agreement with its neighbor.

The agreement ended some military activities at the border between the two countries, including creating buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent fighting. It also ended military drills near the border and removed some guard posts along the Demilitarized Zone.

The deal was signed at an inter-Korean summit in 2018, but it eventually fell apart as cross-border tensions ensued.

South Korea also dismantled its speakers along the border that had broadcast anti-North Korea messaging for years, a move Pyongyang reciprocated.

Gen. David Allvin, the Air Force's chief of staff, announced that he would be retiring two years short of his four-year term.

In a statement, the Air Force said its top commander would retire “on or about Nov. 1.” His retirement will be accompanied by a “formal retirement ceremony with full honors” sometime in the fall. A person familiar with the matter told the Washington Post that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth informed Allvin last week that he was being asked to retire, as the Trump administration wanted to take the Pentagon in a different direction. In return, Allvin would be allowed to announce the decision.

The person speaking with the outlet said, “It was certainly not his choice.”

Despite the pressure under which he left, Allvin thanked President Donald Trump and Hegseth in his retirement announcement.

“I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve as the 23rd Air Force chief of staff, and I'm thankful for Secretary Meink, Secretary Hegseth, and President Trump's faith in me to lead our service,” Allvin said in a statement. “More than anything, I'm proud to have been part of the team of Airmen who live out our core values of integrity, service, and excellence every day as we prepare to defend this great nation.”

Other Air Force figures celebrated his service in reaction.

“The Air Force is fortunate to have leaders like General Dave Allvin. During his tenure, the Air Force has undertaken transformational initiatives that will enable Airmen to answer their nation's call for decades to come,” Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink, a Trump appointee confirmed in May, said. “General Allvin has been instrumental in my onboarding as the department's 27th Secretary, and I'm forever grateful for his partnership as well as his decades of exemplary service to our nation.”

Another person familiar with the matter told the Washington Post that they were surprised that the forced retirement took as long as it did. Among the main areas of contention was dissatisfaction with his oversight over a possible security crisis involving China.

Two people familiar with the matter told the outlet that Gen. Thomas Bussiere, Trump's July nominee for vice chief of staff of the Air Force, is a likely replacement. In June, he headed the Air Force Global Strike Command and oversaw parts of Operation Midnight Hammer.

Allvin's effective dismissal is the latest of several high-profile shake-ups in the military. During his first administration, the military was a key target of Trump's ire, where he clashed with several of its heads. During his second administration, Trump has fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chief of naval operations, the commandant of the Coast Guard, and the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, along with other generals and admirals.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rhode Island Assistant Attorney General Devon Flanagan was arrested in an incident that is now being reviewed by her boss, Attorney General Peter Neronha.

Flanagan's Aug. 14 arrest was captured in body cam footage that the Newport Police Department released to the public. In the video, Flanagan is heard repeatedly telling officers that she is “an AG.” After Flanagan is handcuffed and placed into the back of a police car, she criticizes the arresting officer for not reciting her Miranda rights.

“You're going to regret this,” Flanagan says. “You're going to regret it.”

The future of the country's borders is more than just a real estate deal.

Ukrainian forces still control 2,550 square miles of the eastern Ukrainian region known as the Donbas, an area roughly the size of Delaware. For many, including President Donald Trump, who met with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday at the White House, that might seem like a small price to pay for ending a war that has lasted three and a half years and killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians.

After a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last week, Trump appeared to shift his position on the end of the war, dropping his demand for an immediate ceasefire and telling European leaders he favored a plan that involves Ukraine ceding territory that has not yet been conquered by Russia. He has said publicly that a peace deal will require “land swapping,” though reports indicate Russia is only willing to “swap” small bits of territory in other regions.

While the details of what this would involve are still murky, Putin's position at the Alaska summit was reportedly that Ukraine should give up the entirety of the regions that comprise the Donbas — Donetsk and Luhansk —meaning the Ukrainians would be withdrawing from their current positions. The front lines in two other regions Russia has claimed — Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — would be frozen.

It's not clear exactly how much pressure Trump put on Zelenskyy to make this sacrifice when they met at the White House on Monday. Zelenskyy said that the issue of territorial concessions would be settled in a potential future three-way meeting, including Putin and cryptically thanked Trump “for the map,” suggesting the issue had been discussed in some detail. Zelenskyy was also asked by a Fox News reporter if he would be willing to “redraw the map” rather than sending thousands more Ukrainians to their deaths. Zelenskyy deflected the question. The Financial Times reported that Zelenskyy and the European leaders compared giving away the rest of Donetsk to Trump giving away eastern Florida, an analogy the US president was struck by.

But in fact, the concessions outlined in Russia's latest proposal — as reported — could have far more profound implications for Ukraine's security, and the globe's, than the US administration appears to realize. It could lead to a more vulnerable, divided Ukraine as well as setting a precedent that legitimizes militaries seizing territory by force.

Russian troops or Russian-backed proxies have occupied parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014, and the Russian government formally annexed the regions in 2022, despite the fact that it still did not control all of them. Russian forces currently occupy all but a sliver of Luhansk and about 70 percent of Donetsk, so even foreigners sympathetic to Ukraine might wonder, as the Fox News host did, why it's worth continuing to sacrifice Ukrainian lives over them.

For much of the war, the official Ukrainian position was that its forces would continue to fight until every square mile of Ukrainian territory was liberated, including areas Russia had occupied since 2014. Any movement on that position would be a painful sacrifice for Ukrainians, as Olena Halushka, a Kyiv-based activist and co-founder of the International Center for Ukrainian Victory, told Vox.

Still, particularly since Trump came to office, the public statements of Ukrainian officials have appeared to suggest that this might not be possible in the immediate future. And polls suggest most Ukrainians would support giving up some territory to end the war.

But there are major differences between an agreement freezing the current front lines in place, and ceding territory that Russia hasn't yet won.

The first difference is what the agreement would require Ukraine's military to do moving forward. Though Ukraine may only control a fraction of the Donbas, that fraction is a strategically important corridor known as Ukraine's “fortress belt,” a roughly 50-kilometer line consisting of four cities and several towns that Ukraine has spent more than a decade building into heavily fortified defensive positions. The US-based Institute for the Study of War estimates it will take Russia years to take these cities at its current rate of advance, whereas if Ukraine ceded them, they would have to build up new defensive lines in much less favorable rural terrain.

“Ukraine has essentially anchored its defense in Donetsk on the towns of Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, and a few other urban settlements,” said Franz-Stefan Gady, an Austrian defense analyst who travels frequently to the front lines in Ukraine. “From a topographical perspective, these defensive lines are quite strong.”

While international law, in general, has taken a beating in recent years, the norm against taking another country's territory by force has mostly held.

Despite some recent Russian successes in pushing through the Ukrainian front lines in the Donbas, Gady assesses that “the Russians don't really have the manpower to engage in urban combat. So they could get a very bloody nose if they have to fight house for house for Kramatorsk or Slovyansk.”

Trump may accept Russian assurances that they have no further plans to conquer more Russian territory at face value — his envoy Steve Witkoff says these assurances would be enshrined in Russian law if a peace deal is signed — but Ukraine is unlikely to trust any Russian assurances. This is part of why Zelenskyy and the European leaders who visited the White House on Monday put such an emphasis on post-war security guarantees. But even with such guarantees, Ukraine will be very reluctant to agree to a settlement that leaves Russia in a far stronger position to make another attempt to push toward Kyiv.

The second reason is political. Even as he has conceded that Ukraine likely does not have the military might to retake all of its territory by force, Zelenskyy has maintained that under the Ukrainian constitution, he does not have the power to “give up territory or trade land.”

These two positions might seem irreconcilable, but they're not. There's precedent for agreeing to a deal that freezes territorial war in place, without conceding the other side's claims. The Korean War technically never ended, even as the Koreas have mostly avoided outright combat since the signing of an armistice agreement in 1953. Even if the Russian-occupied regions remained under de facto Russian control, Ukraine and most of the world wouldn't officially recognize that control. For most of the Cold War, the US and other Western countries did not recognize Soviet control of the three Baltic countries, which they viewed as having been illegally annexed.

Similarly, the vast majority of countries do not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, and continue to consider it part of Ukraine, though Trump has reportedly proposed “de jure” US recognition of Russian control as part of a peace deal and told Zelenskyy to give up on Crimea in a Truth Social post.

There's a significant difference between pragmatically accepting military realities, and signing a treaty that grants territory to Russia that it doesn't currently control. At this point, Zelenskyy, who is not as popular as he used to be, could probably sell Ukrainians on a deal that freezes the current front lines, painful as that might be. The country could still preserve the hope that it would one day be reunited with its lost regions, just as the Baltic countries regained their de facto independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Signing away land Ukrainian troops have been defending would be another matter.

“The battles for Bakhmut and Avdiyivka were among the fiercest of this war,” said Halushka, referring to two long sieges where the Ukrainians took heavy losses but managed to slow Russia's advance through the Donbas. “What was the point then? The Russians can't break us on the battlefield, so they are aiming to break our morale.”

Voluntarily signing away Ukrainian territory could have global repercussions as well. The UN Charter expressly forbids “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”

While international law, in general, has taken a beating in recent years, the norm against taking another country's territory by force has mostly held. When it's been violated — Iraq's attempt to annex Kuwait in 1990, or Argentina's attempt to seize the Falkland Islands in 1982, for instance — those attempts have almost all failed.

Russia was already challenging this norm with its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for Georgia's pro-Russian separatist enclaves, but for the most part the international community held those moves to be illegitimate. In the modern era, a deal to hand over the Donbas would be an unprecedented stamp of political approval for a war of conquest.

“There is an important difference between de jure and de facto recognition,” said Tanisha Fazal, a professor at the University of Minnesota who studies sovereignty and armed conflict. “De jure recognition would accept a clear violation of the law, and explicitly accept the primacy of force over law. De facto recognition allows the law to retain at least some power in this case.”

Russia is hardly the only country with long-running territorial claims against its neighbors. And Fazal worries that a seal of approval for the seizure of the Donbas could set a precedent others would follow.

“I think about a country like Venezuela, which has laid claim to Guyanese territory,” she said. “My best guess is that the Venezuelan government would take official recognition of the transfer of Ukrainian territory to Russia as an encouraging sign.”

China's ambitions in Taiwan also loom over this conflict. While Beijing would dispute the comparison — its position is that Taiwan has long been Chinese territory and it's the US that is backing local separatists — Chinese leaders would no doubt welcome a US president that takes a more transactional view of these issues.

Trump, the former real estate mogul who has spoken of the US acquiring Canada, Greenland, the Panama Canal, and Gaza, clearly takes a more transactional and fluid view of the world map than his modern predecessors. The choice of Alaska, a former Russian territory purchased by the United States in the 19th century, for last week's summit, was interpreted by many as harkening back to an era when dealmaking over sovereign territory was more common. But that was also an era when wars over territory were far more common.

There are a number of possible reasons why national borders change a lot less often than they used to, but at least one reason is that the US has been consistently opposed to the forceful redrawing of international borders — a remarkably consistent position across every recent presidential administration, until this one.

Trump “simply doesn't appreciate nationalism and the power of territory,” said Monica Duffy-Toft, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “He thinks this is just a land swap. He doesn't appreciate the attachment to place that many nations, many members within nations, have to particular pieces of land.”

Trump has expressed his admiration for William McKinley, the president who annexed territories, including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. A number of commentators have observed that he aims to bring back a 19th century-style world in which great powers bargain over the territory of lesser states.

But what 19th century-style territorial conflict would look like in a world of ballistic missiles, drones, AI, and nuclear weapons is anyone's guess.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","At JPMorgan's new HQ, the tech knows who you are — and how you take your coffee","https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgans-headquarters-270-park-avenue-technology-biometric-scanners-jpmc-app-2025-8","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

JPMorgan has always been big on tech — an initiative on full display at its new Manhattan headquarters.

America's biggest bank by assets has been promising that its new office tower at 270 Park Avenue will be loaded with ""intelligent technology"" since it announced the project in 2022. New details of the $3 billion project obtained by Business Insider reveal just how tech-forward the building will be.

The 14,000 employees who will be housed at the New York tower will be able to activate coffee machines using QR codes and swipe into the building using biometric palm scanners. Want to preorder food from the dining hall, host a guest, or find a specific conference room? There's an app for that, which JPMorgan is asking employees to download to ""boost your work efficiency.""

The details, gleaned from internal communications shared with Business Insider, offer a glimpse of what it's like to work at the bank behemoth, which earlier this year called back all of its more than 300,000 employees to the office five days a week. JPMorgan has also been spending billions on tech at the direction of CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been seeking to protect the bank from payment apps and other financial startups.

""We have to compete with the best in AI and technology,"" Jamie Dimon said at the bank's 2024 Investor Day.

With some employees' move-in set to start this year and continue into 2026, here's the lowdown on how the bank plans to use tech to keep workers happy and efficient as it calls them back to the office five days a week.

Even the way you enter the building will be leveled up using tech. One option to get past the turnstiles — besides your physical or mobile JPM badge — is ""biometric authentication,"" which employees can already enroll in, according to employee communications shared on an internal bank portal.

The bank showed a photo of a scanner that reads your palm. It said the biometric authentication will allow employees to ""breeze from the lobby"" to other parts of the building ""by waving your hand!""

It touted how easy it will be to get where you want to go.

""After passing through the turnstiles, you can take an elevator to The Exchange on 14. From there, you can go up to your floor or take the escalator down to 13 for a bite to eat,"" the bank said, adding, ""If you're a trader, you can take an elevator directly to the trading floors from the lobby.""

The bank has a mobile app they call ""Work at JPMC"" to help employees with the move and to sign up for things like bike storage. It also has maps of the office to help people figure out what is where, and stores a digital version of your work badge.

""You can pre-order from several offerings in The Exchange, as well as coffee bars throughout the building, using the Work at JPMC mobile app.""

The communications, which come just weeks after a tragic shooting at another Park Avenue office tower, suggest the bank plans to lean on tech to bolster building security.

One example: primary bathrooms on each floor will have emergency locks that, when activated, alert building security, according to the portal.

Under its emergency information, the bank says ""primary bathrooms on each floor are equipped with an emergency lock that, when used, will alert building security. Security will assess the situation and respond, as appropriate.""

The internal portal reveals just how much coffee is part of the JPM work culture. In addition to having four cafes in the building and ""work cafes"" on every floor, break rooms will have coffee machines ""powered by QR codes"" — symbols that open up apps or webpages when viewed through one's phone camera.

Being in an office building all day can take its toll on the body and the mind. The communications reviewed by Business Insider show that JPMorgan will use tech to try and make the office experience more natural.

In addition to windows that will allow 30% more daylight than a typical office building, the bank said the tower will have ""circadian lighting and design elements"" that incorporate nature and ""help reduce sensory overload.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","AT&T is directing more managers to relocate or face layoffs","https://www.businessinsider.com/att-help-desk-manager-relocation-stankey-memo-2025-8","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 18:14:00 GMT","

AT&T CEO John Stankey made waves this month when he told employees in a memo that the company is shifting to a ""market-based culture"" that requires employees work closer together.

Since then, Business Insider has learned that AT&T is consolidating 22 internal help-desk centers into six locations — and affected managers get two weeks to decide whether to move or lose their jobs and get severance. Unionized workers will be allowed to remain at their current office in a different customer-service support role.

The consolidation of so-called centralized support desk workers, who largely assist other AT&T employees, follows a playbook the company has used repeatedly since 2023 as it upgrades its tech and cuts legacy costs. The changes also come at a time when corporate America, especially the tech sector, is embracing a hardcore culture that emphasizes performance metrics, time in the office, and a renewed sense of hustle.

Two managers shared details of the plan to shrink the help-desk sites to six locations with Business Insider. In a statement, a company spokesperson declined to comment on the number of centers that would remain, but confirmed that the company is reducing work locations across the business unit.

The spokesperson said the move is unrelated to Stankey's take-it-or-leave-it memo, which was his frank response to an internal survey that found employees reporting lower engagement at work.

However, one AT&T manager told Business Insider that they understood the department's leadership was speeding up the timetable for the help-desk consolidation because of the Stankey memo, instead of taking a couple of years to carry it out.

The plan, the same manager said, involves moving managers to sites in Atlanta; Mesa, Arizona; Miami; Orlando; Richardson, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma. The spokesperson didn't respond to a question about how many workers would be affected.

One of the managers, who is facing an out-of-state move hundreds of miles away, shared an email with Business Insider in which the company said they would be required to cover their own moving expenses. They feel like they don't have a choice about relocating their family.

""Without my income, we're not going to make it,"" the person said.

A half-dozen employees across the company told Business Insider that department leaders were told this month to devise ""action plans"" to address concerns raised in the recent employee survey about where and how AT&T operates.

AT&T's spokesperson said the relocations will help the company optimize its workflows. ""It reflects ongoing strategic shifts across our call center operations to colocate similar work functions and improve efficiency, consistency, and teamwork,"" the spokesperson said.

Several corporate divisions have gone through similar phases of shedding satellite offices in favor of larger, centralized hubs.

The company made headlines in 2023 when it said some 60,000 managers would be assigned to nine metro areas, down from 300 locations across the US. Stankey told Bloomberg at the time that around 9,000 people would face relocation decisions.

The reduction in office footprint was followed by a mandatory five-day in-office schedule that was phased in this year.

These relocation orders, coupled with the RTO mandate, have resulted in some teams shrinking by half, according to internal data reviewed by Business Insider.

Internal figures from last year, seen by Business Insider, show the impact of relocation orders on a division under CTO Jeremy Legg called AT&T Technology Services, or ATS, which employed around 10,000 workers in the US in 2023.

ATS' consolidation meant moving from some 95 ""non-strategic"" locations — where a third of ATS employees were based — to offices in the Seattle, New York, Atlanta, and Dallas areas. Of the 318 ATS managerial workers who received notification to move during the first wave in 2023, about half declined and left the company.

Companywide, AT&T employed more than 160,000 workers at the start of 2023, according to its annual report. It started this year with about 141,000. Chief competitors Verizon and T-Mobile had about 99,000 and 70,000 employees, respectively, at the start of 2025.

Legg said last week at a KeyBanc tech conference that as AT&T incorporates more software and moves away from its legacy hardware and support systems, it could cut costs.

""If you have 100 central oﬃces, you may be able to only have the gear in 30 or 40 of them,"" he said. That means physical infrastructure and labor costs go down, Legg said.

The spokesperson said the latest relocations are not related to AI. They come at a time, however, where AT&T — like many firms — increasingly relies on the technology to streamline its business.

Stankey said in a January earnings call that the company expects to save $3 billion in running costs by further integrating AI.

CTO Legg said at the KeyBanc conference that his division has begun loading trouble tickets into AT&T's generative and agentic AI frameworks for review.

""It now recommends what the fixes are and can write the code to do the fix,"" he said. ""Should we just go ahead and automate that? We're still human in the loop there, but these are major, major changes.""

They're changes investors appear to support. AT&T shares are up around 27% in 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Pivotal tech moment: iPhones are no longer Foxconn's most important business","https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-no-longer-foxconn-most-important-business-ai-servers-2025-8","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

If you wanted a signal that we've truly entered the AI era and left mobile behind, this is it: iPhones are no longer Foxconn's most important business.

For investors and industry watchers, this is a pivotal moment. The company best known as Apple's factory floor has become an AI-first manufacturer. If Foxconn was once the backbone of the smartphone era, it's now building the infrastructure of the AI age.

For the first time, Foxconn's Cloud & Networking Products division has overtaken Smart Consumer Electronics, which runs the iPhone assembly operation. In the second quarter of 2025, Cloud & Networking revenue jumped 47% year-over-year to NT$731.8 billion, eclipsing the NT$634.5 billion generated from Smart Consumer Electronics, according to Barclays research.

More than half of that cloud revenue now comes from AI servers, which grew more than 60% in the second quarter alone. The company expects AI server revenue to soar 170% year-over-year in the third quarter, fueled by growing demand from hyperscale cloud providers.

""The company has grown from its legacy business of building smartphones or assembling computers for the likes of Apple to being a critical player in not only AI servers but also in emerging new product categories such as EVs and humanoid robots,"" Barclays analysts Jiong Shao, Lian Xiu Duan, and Xinyao Song, wrote in a note to investors on Monday.

This surge marks a tectonic shift: Apple, long Foxconn's most important customer, is no longer its primary growth driver. Instead, Foxconn is rapidly positioning itself as an AI infrastructure heavyweight. The firm has increased its market share in AI servers, including specialized ASIC variants, and is working closely with partners such as Nvidia on next-gen server architectures and humanoid robotics integration.

Geographically, Foxconn is hedging against geopolitical and tariff risks by expanding AI server production in the US, including in Texas, Wisconsin, and planned operations in California and Ohio. Mexico remains a primary base, but the growing US footprint reflects strategic repositioning for North American customers, including the big cloud providers.

Beyond AI servers, Foxconn is diversifying into electric vehicles, semiconductors, and healthcare robotics. Yet it's the server business that has seized the spotlight, now representing 41% of total revenue and expected to grow over 70% for the full fiscal year, according to Barclays research.

Meanwhile, Foxconn expects no growth in its iPhone-heavy consumer electronics business.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Databricks says it's valued at over $100 billion in latest funding round","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/databricks-valuation-over-100-billion.html","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 19:17:30 GMT","



Databricks has just entered an exclusive club. 

The data analytics software vendor said Tuesday that it's raising a funding round that values the company at over $100 billion. That would make Databricks just the fourth private company to eclipse the $100 billion mark, following SpaceX, ByteDance and OpenAI, according to data from CB Insights.

Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi told CNBC's Brian Sullivan that the total round will exceed $1 billion. The company was last valued by private investors at $62 billion in a $10 billion financing round late last year. 

In June, Databricks executives told investors the company was forecasting $3.7 billion in annualized revenue by July, with 50% year-over-year growth. 

Snowflake, one of Databricks' top rivals, is expected to generate $4.5 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January, representing annual growth of 25%, according to LSEG. Snowflake currently has a market cap of about $65 billion. Other competitors include cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft, which are also Databricks partners.

Ghodsi said he heard from a lot of interested investors following Figma's IPO late last month. Shares of the design software company more than tripled in their New York Stock Exchange debut, a sign that public investors are seeking out tech offerings after in extended lull in the IPO market. 

""My phone was blowing up,"" Ghodsi said on Tuesday. ""So yes, there's definitely been a big push from outside."" 

Figma shares have since retreated from their initial $115.50 closing price. The stock is trading at about $70, still more than double the $33 IPO price.

Ghodsi said the round will help Databricks invest in products that clients can tap when using artificial intelligence models.

Founded in 2013 and based in San Francisco, Databricks ranked third on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list. As of June, the company employed 8,000 people. Existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Insight Partners Thrive Capital and WCM Investment Management are buying shares, a spokesperson said.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Crypto stocks suffered Tuesday as investors fled tech stocks and riskier corners of the market.

Among crypto exchanges, Coinbase and eToro fell more than 5% and 6%, respectively, while Robinhood and Bullish both dropped more than 6%. Crypto financial services firm Galaxy Digital tumbled 10%. In the burgeoning sector of crypto treasury firms, Strategy lost 7%, SharpLink Gaming slid 8%, Bitmine Immersion slumped 9% and DeFi Development tumbled 13%. Stablecoin issuer Circle lost 4.5%.

Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin pulled back nearly 3% to just over $113,000. Ether was down more than 5% to the $4,100 level, according to Coin Metrics.

Investors appeared to rotate out of tech names Tuesday. The sector had seen a boost last week as traders weighed the prospect of more interest rate cuts. Also, bitcoin touched an intraday all-time high near $125,000 last week.

On Tuesday, the Nasdaq Composite was down more than 1%, weighed down by declines in Nvidia and other tech heavyweights.

The crypto market tends to be vulnerable to moves in tech stocks due to their growth-oriented investor base, narrative-driven price action, speculative nature and tendency to thrive in low interest rate environments.

This week, investors are watching the Federal Reserve's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for clues around what could happen at the central bank's remaining policy meetings this year. If Fed Chair Jerome Powell signals more dovish policy could be ahead, crypto may bounce.

""With Powell speaking at Jackson Hole, we typically see profit-taking ahead of his remarks,"" said Satraj Bambra, CEO of hybrid exchange Rails. ""Any time there's communication uncertainty from the Fed, you can generally expect some profit-taking as traders de-risk their positions.""

Crypto stocks have had a solid run in recent months — thanks to the addition of Coinbase in the benchmark S&P 500 index, the successful IPO of Circle and the GENIUS Act stablecoin framework becoming law. However, investors expect a pullback in August and through the September Fed meeting, where they hope to see central bank policymakers implement rate cuts.

In this article

Shares of Viking Therapeutics plunged Tuesday after the company released midstage trial data on its obesity pill that disappointed investors. 

The biotech company's stock price dropped to about $23.80 as of Tuesday morning, from $42.09 at Monday's close, a roughly 43% plunge. Viking's market cap now sits at about $2.69 billion, down from more than $4 billion on Monday.

The results could be a blow to Viking, which was once seen as a hot M&A target as pharmaceutical companies scramble to join the booming market for obesity and diabetes drugs. It could reinforce the dominance of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in the space, especially as they develop pills for weight loss that could enter the market years ahead of the tablet formulation of Viking's drug, VK2735. 

Jared Holz, Mizuho health care equity strategist, said in an email Tuesday that the data ""probably shutters hope for [Viking] to be a bigtime player in the oral obesity market over the near to medium term.""

The race to develop a more convenient obesity pill has been fraught, as companies such as Pfizer have had to scrap previous contenders and bring forward new ones. 

Viking's once-daily pill helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their weight at around three months. The company also said that weight loss didn't plateau, which means patients could lose even more in a longer-term study.

It's difficult to directly compare the pill's phase two trial data with the results of oral drugs further along in development, including treatments developed by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

Holz added that the results on Viking's pill ""look inferior"" to those of Eli Lilly's oral drug ""on almost all metrics."" The highest dose of Eli Lilly's daily pill helped patients lose 12.4% of their body weight, or 11.2% regardless of discontinuations, at 72 weeks in a phase three trial.

Holz pointed to the high rate of patients who discontinued Viking's drug for any reason over 13 weeks, which was around 28%. Meanwhile, around a quarter of people discontinued Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, for any reason over 72 weeks.

That's ""a much longer trial and therefore [Lilly] looks far better head-to-head,"" Holz said. 

Viking said the most common reasons for patients to discontinue treatment were gastrointestinal side effects, the majority of which were mild to moderate in severity and observed earlier in treatment.  But around 58% of patients reported experiencing nausea and 26% experienced vomiting, compared with 48% and 10%, respectively, among those who took a placebo.

Those side effect rates over a shorter trial period appear to be worse than those seen in trials on Eli Lilly's pill and the oral version of Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy. 

Viking's treatment works by imitating two naturally produced gut hormones called GLP-1 and GIP.

GLP-1 helps reduce food intake and appetite. GIP, which also suppresses appetite, may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.

Eli Lilly's pill and the oral version of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy both target GLP-1, but the latter has dietary restrictions.

The Trump administration has quietly expanded its 50% steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 additional product categories, vastly increasing the reach and impact of this arm of its trade agenda.

The new tariffs, which took effect Monday, expand the scope of the levies that President Donald Trump previously announced on the valuable commodities. The tariff list now covers products such as fire extinguishers, machinery, construction materials and specialty chemicals that either contain, or are contained in, aluminum or steel.

""Auto parts, chemicals, plastics, furniture components—basically, if it's shiny, metallic, or remotely related to steel or aluminum, it's probably on the list,"" Brian Baldwin, vice president of customs at Kuehne + Nagel International AG wrote on LinkedIn of the expanded list.

""This isn't just another tariff—it's a strategic shift in how steel and aluminum derivatives are regulated,"" he wrote.

The levies extend to 407 new product categories, the Department of Commerce said Tuesday.

""Today's action expands the reach of the steel and aluminum tariffs and shuts down avenues for circumvention – supporting the continued revitalization of the American steel and aluminum industries,"" Jeffrey Kessler, the Commerce Department's under secretary for industry and security, said in a statement.

The release from the agency links out to a list that identifies the newly included product types only by the specific customs codes that apply to them, not by what the products are actually called.

For example, the Commerce Department identifies the product category of fire extinguishers only as ""8424.10.0000,"" a 10-digit code buried among hundreds of other 10-digit codes.

This format makes it very difficult for the public to get a full picture of all the products that are affected by Monday's expanded tariffs.

But experts say the impact will be enormous.

""By my count, the steel and aluminum tariffs now affect at least $320 billion of imports based on 2024's general customs value of imports,"" Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, wrote on LinkedIn.

""This will add more inflationary cost-push pressures to already climbing prices that domestic producers are charging as picked up by July's PPI data,"" he continued.

Trump has repeatedly relied on sector-specific tariffs to enact his sweeping trade agenda.

In June, Trump announced that he was doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% for most countries, creating widespread uncertainty for businesses and U.S. trading partners reliant on the valuable commodities.

The White House said that the tariffs on additional products should ""not come as a surprise.""

""The President called for a new steel and aluminum product inclusions process in February,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement.

""[The Bureau of Industry and Security] established the new product inclusions process in April, and companies submitted requests for product inclusions in mid-May,"" he said.

""Thus, it has been clear for many months that new products could be treated as steel and aluminum derivatives.""

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

SharpLink Gaming, the Nasdaq-listed affiliate marketing and gaming software firm-turned Ethereum treasury company, said on Tuesday that it spent another $667 million on ether.

The company said it has purchased another 143,593 ETH at an average price of $4,648 per ether ($667.4 million) — bringing its total holdings to 740,760 (nearly $3.2 billion at current prices). Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin serves as SharpLink's chairman of the board.

SharpLink is the number two Ethereum treasury company when ranked by holdings; BitMine Immersion Tech is the leading ETH treasury with over 1.5 million ether, according to The Block Data Dashboard. The cumulative amount of ether held by ETH treasuries is about $10.4 billion amid the recent craze in digital asset treasuries, or DATs, according to The Block's data.

After Bitcoin treasury Strategy, BitMine claims to be the number two DAT globally. The company aims to hold up to 5% of ETH's supply.

ETH was changing hands at $4,238.062 as of 10:35 a.m. ET, according to The Block Price Page.



SharpLink also said it raised $537 million during the week ending Aug. 17 and has $84 million in cash it has not yet deployed. The company's stock dipped last week after SharpLink disclosed a $103 million net loss for the second quarter.



For the quarter, the company reported a 98% increase in ""ETH Concentration,"" a measure of how much ETH the company holds per every 1,000 potential shares, which includes actual shares plus all the possible shares from warrants, options, RSUs, pre-funded warrants, and so on. ""Nearly 100%"" of the company's ETH has been staked, the firm also said.

As of Aug. 17, SharpLink had generated rewards of 1,388 ETH to date.

""Ethereum is the trust layer for the decentralized economy, and SharpLink's aggressive accumulation, staking and strategic management of ETH set it apart from any other public company in the market,"" Lubin said last week. ""SharpLink is actively compounding value for our fellow stockholders through yield generation and intelligent capital deployment.""

Something went wrong

SharpLink Gaming purchased $601.5 million Ethereum last week, its largest ETH buy over the past month, the company announced on Tuesday. 

The online gambling marketer, which has shifted its focus to become an Ethereum treasury, purchased 143,593 ETH at $4,648 between August 10 and August 15, the company said. That brings SharpLink's holdings to 740,460 ETH worth a little more than $3 billion as of writing time. 

Ethereum was recently trading at $4,124, down 5.9% in the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko, as investors fretful about U.S. inflation and wider macroeconomic uncertainties veered away from digital assets along with other risk-on assets. 

The purchase comes as SharpLink speeds toward its goal of acquiring 1% of all circulating ETH, or more than 1.2 million ETH, spearheading a market frenzy that nearly sent the altcoin's price to an all-time high last week. 

In a Myriad Linea market, 72% of respondents expect SharpLink to hold one million ETH by September 16. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt).

Ethereum was trading above $4,700 last Thursday, roughly 2% below its record price of $4,878 in 2021 as institutional investors poured billions into spot ETH ETFs. Since then, the token has fallen more than 10% amid heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine and ahead of the release of more U.S. economic data this week. 

SharpLink recently raised $390 million in net proceeds from its registered direct offering that closed on August 11. The company also raked in $146.5 million from its ATM facility last week, the proceeds of which will also go toward bolstering its ETH treasury.

The company is one of several ETH-based treasuries that has been buying up the token over the past year. 

Tom Lee's crypto mining firm Bitmine Immersion became the largest Ethereum treasury in the world, with ETH holdings worth $6.6 billion, the company said Monday in a statement. Meanwhile, EtherMachine and Bit Digital boast stockpiles of the altcoin worth more than $1 billion and $500 million, respectively. 

SharpLink shares were trading at $18.47 on Tuesday, down 8% in the past 24 hours but up 128% in the year to date, according to Yahoo Finance data. ","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

 (Nasdaq: SBET), one of the world's largest corporate holders of Ether (ETH), has reported the expansion of its Ethereum reserves for the week ending August 17.

The company at an average price of $4,648, lifting its total ETH balance to 740,760. Since launching its treasury strategy on June 2, SharpLink has rapidly built one of the largest corporate Ethereum treasuries worldwide.

The company has earned 1,388 ETH in staking rewards since the strategy began, showing its commitment to maximizing yield from its holdings.

“SharpLink is aligning itself with Ethereum's future as a global financial infrastructure, while giving investors direct exposure to its growth,” the company said.Capital Raise Fuels Aggressive Expansion

SharpLink's weekly activity was backed by robust fundraising. The company secured $146.5 million through its at-the-market (ATM) facility and closed a $390 million registered direct offering on August 11.

In total, nearly $537 million in net proceeds were raised over the week of August 10–15, reinforcing its liquidity position.

The company notes that over $84 million in cash remains on hand, yet to be deployed for additional ETH acquisitions. This liquidity buffer ensures flexibility for further purchases should market conditions create attractive entry points.ETH Concentration Metric Shows Treasury Growth

To increase transparency, SharpLink introduced a new performance measure known as ETH Concentration, which tracks the number of ETH held per 1,000 assumed diluted shares outstanding. 

For the week ending August 17, this figure rose to 3.87, up nearly 94% since the start of its treasury program in June.

The company explained that ETH Concentration provides investors with a clearer view of yield performance and shareholder exposure to Ethereum. 

Unlike traditional treasury stock calculations, this metric excludes factors such as equity award vesting and debt convertibility, offering a more direct link between ETH holdings and investor value.Strategic Bet on Ethereum's Future

By making ETH its primary treasury reserve asset, SharpLink joins a growing movement of companies looking beyond Bitcoin and positioning for Ethereum's role in decentralized finance, smart contracts, and next-generation financial infrastructure.

“SharpLink is charting a new course—building scalable, secure, and transparent solutions that challenge outdated models,” the company states. With deep ties in sports media, gaming, and technology, SharpLink continues to leverage its Ethereum strategy as both a financial and technological shift.

As ETH integration deepens across industries, SharpLink's aggressive accumulation indicates a bold conviction: Ethereum will not just power decentralized finance but reshape the backbone of digital capital markets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Crypto market sell-off accelerates, but SOL data predicts recovery to $200","https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-sell-off-accelerates-but-sol-data-predicts-recovery-to-200","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 20:20:00 GMT","

 Bitcoin and altcoins continue to sell-off, but Solana's fundamentals and accelerating institutional traction hint at a price recovery to $200. 

Key takeaways:

Solana's DeFi dominance and growing fees sustain network demand, boosting investors' long-term confidence.

Institutional investors' interest in SOL futures, ETP exposure and staking yield add to SOL's resilience.

Solana's native token SOL (SOL) dropped 15.5% since reaching $209.80 on Thursday, its highest price in more than six months. The pullback raised concerns that a double top formation might signal a bearish reversal. Yet, four key indicators suggest the opposit, and Solana may soon retest the $200 level, contradicting short-term trader pessimism.

Solana has consolidated its role as the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem, recording $111.5 billion in 30-day volumes. While Ethereum remains dominant, Solana outpaced the combined Ethereum layer-2 networks, which generated $93.1 billion. BNB Chain trailed with $60 billion, according to DefiLlama.

The total value locked (TVL) on Solana reached $12.1 billion this week, up 20% in two months, further securing its vice-leadership position over BNB Chain at $7.8 billion. Several decentralized applications (DApps) such as Kamino, Jito, Jupiter, Sanctum, Raydium, and Marinade each surpassed $2 billion in TVL. Sustained activity reinforces SOL demand, as transaction fees are essential to maintaining native staking yields.

Network fees highlight this dynamic. Solana generated $35.6 million over 30 days, a 22% increase from the prior month. Ethereum led with $41.4 million but declined 7% in the same period. Solana's advantage comes from its low fees and frictionless user experience, eliminating reliance on bridges and complex layer-2 solutions.

Solana ranking third in network fees is notable, considering Ethereum maintains a far larger smart contract deposit base. Solana's success is not easily replicable, since validators demand higher hardware capacity and capital commitment, making the network more robust than competitors.

Open interest on SOL futures climbed to $10.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion two months ago. This now exceeds XRP futures, despite XRP having an 81% larger market capitalization. The growth signals rising institutional participation, a positive factor for long-term adoption.

Further evidence of institutional demand comes from $2.8 billion in Solana exchange-traded futures and products (ETF / ETP). The 7.3% native staking yield could drive strong demand once Solana spot ETFs launch in the United States. Bloomberg analysts project a 90% or greater likelihood of US Securities and Exchange Commission approval by year-end.

The retracement from $209.80 sparked fears of a bearish double top. However, Solana's leadership in DEX volumes, TVL expansion, accelerating fee growth, and mounting institutional exposure collectively argue otherwise. Rather than confirming a bearish shift, these drivers support a renewed push toward $200, validating the hypothesis that traders may have turned bearish too soon.

The crypto market is likely moving into “Phase 2” of the bull run, where capital starts shifting from Bitcoin into altcoins, according to crypto VC giant Pantera Capital. 

Coinbase's Monthly Outlook backs this up, suggesting that conditions are aligning for a full-scale altcoin rally, potentially beginning as early as September. 

With $BTC dominance falling below 60%, the altcoin market cap surging past $1.5T, and Google Trends showing retail interest in altcoins near 2018 highs, all signs point to a reshuffling. 

And presale trends offer a clear sign of where the capital is heading. Retail investors are now hunting for the best altcoins to buy ahead of the wave.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), an upcoming Bitcoin Layer-2 built using SVM, just smashed through $10.5M in token presale, while Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is on its way to $15M. 

Pantera Capital's recent blog post highlights a key structural shift unfolding in the crypto market. 

Altcoins have historically taken the lead in the second phase of each crypto bull cycle. In both the 2015–2018 and 2018–2021 cycles, Bitcoin led early and altcoins took over later.

In the current 2022–2025 cycle, Bitcoin has again led the first phase, but altcoins have yet to catch up. 

‘During the 2015–2018 cycle, alts accounted for 66% of the total growth in crypto market capitalization. In the 2018–2021 cycle, they contributed 55%. So far this cycle, alts represent 35% of total market growth,' says the article. 

Multiple signs suggest this may change soon, though, especially with crypto regulation coming into clearer focus – a stark difference from the crypto climate in the past bull cycles.

Pantera Capital highlighted recent US legislation as a major factor behind the possible shift. 

The GENIUS Act paves the way for regulated stablecoins, while the CLARITY Act is designed to define the line between digital commodities and securities. 

David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, also points to signs of an alt season already forming this quarter. 

Although the Altcoin Season Index remains below the typical 75% mark, Duong mentions that the altcoin market cap has climbed rapidly since early July.

‘[…] current market conditions now suggest a potential shift towards a full-scale altcoin season as we approach September,' he notes in the Coinbase Monthly Outlook.  

According to the same market analysis, Bitcoin's dominance has declined from 65% in May 2025 to ~59% by August 2025, which points to early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. 

Retail investors are clearly peeking over the fence, with Google searches for “altcoins” at their highest since January 2018. It may not be full-on mania yet, but the market's warming up fast.



A possible Fed rate cut in September could be the final trigger. Over $7T sits in US money market funds, and even a small shift into risk assets could light the match for the next alt-season. 

In other words, the coming days present a rare window to buy into promising altcoins before they surge. Presales and low-cap tokens, in particular, tend to move first in the early stages of an alt season, especially when there's a clear narrative behind them.

But in a crowded market, it's hard to unearth the gems. To give you a head start in your hunt, here are our top picks for the best altcoins to buy early, featuring a mix of established and emerging cryptos.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a new Layer-2 (L2) that brings smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The serious tech leap aims to solve Bitcoin's three biggest bottlenecks: 

And here is how it works: A canonical bridge lets you mint wrapped $BTC cross-chain. You can then freely use your $BTC on the Hyper network to interact with Solana-like smart contracts for various DeFi use cases, from lending to GameFi and NFT bidding.



Note that Bitcoin Hyper isn't backed by a vague roadmap. The L2 devnet is already live, and the team has confirmed full support for Solana program deploys, contract calls, logs, and configs. 

The team has been keeping true to its roadmap so far, so it comes as no surprise that its native token, $HYPER, has already raised $10.5M+ in its ongoing presale. 

During the presale phase, altcoin investors can support the project and grab the token at pre-market prices. Currently, $HYPER is priced at $0.012755, with the next surge just one day away.

Participants can also stake $HYPER for attractive, dynamic staking returns, which sit at 104% at the time of this writing. 

Visit the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale for more.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST), a utility token for the Best Wallet ecosystem, enjoys not just good timing, but also visibility within an emerging market niche. 

As Google tightens its policies on custodial crypto apps, noncustodial wallets like Best Wallet are growing more popular than ever. 

Starting this year, custodial wallet apps will require region-specific licences to remain on the Play Store, a move that threatens the visibility of many well-known wallets. Best Wallet, built on a noncustodial model, is unaffected and well-positioned to thrive in this new environment. 

And its native token, $BEST, is already getting a lot of presale attention as the wallet's ecosystem expands to add more Web3 features.



Already available on both Android and iOS, the Best Wallet app has built a user base of over 250,000 users in a short time, and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale is close to hitting the $15M mark now. 

Becoming a token holder would mean not only fueling the project's extensive roadmap, but also securing governance rights and higher staking rewards within the app's upcoming staking aggregator.

Right now, the Best Wallet app is working to expand its support to over 60+ chains and introduce advanced anti-fraud protection for retail traders. Phases 3 and 4 of the roadmap include the launch of a crypto debit card, NFT integrations, and advanced derivative trading.

In other words, Best Wallet isn't just providing a secure, self-custodial solution. It bridges DeFi, centralized finance, and retail utility within one highly competitive solution.

Visit the Best Wallet ($BEST) presale to learn more.

$LDO is the native token of Lido DAO, the decentralised autonomous organisation behind the popular Ethereum liquid staking protocol. $LDO holds a central role in Ethereum's post-Merge design. 

As demand for Ethereum and real-world assets grows, $LDO could attract more interest from both retail and larger investors looking for exposure to staked $ETH. 



Pantera sees Ethereum as one of the main winners of the coming alt season, with most real-world assets now moving onto its network. 

BlackRock's $BUIDL and WisdomTree's $WTGXX are both live on Ethereum, Robinhood's stock tokens are based on Ethereum Layer-2 Arbitrum, and over 50% of stablecoin volume is routed through the Ethereum blockchain.

$LDO's close link to $ETH and its strong performance in past bull runs make it one of the best altcoins to watch when the alt season picks up. 

See Lido DAO ($LDO)'s price over time.

Alt seasons reward early positioning, not just in top ten heavyweights, but also in underrated crypto gems backed by the right narratives. $LDO is such an example, now available for purchase on most popular crypto exchanges. 

As for pre-market opportunities, $HYPER and $BEST each offer attractive incentives and utility within blockchain upscaling and Web3. These tokens are now selling for low prices in their presales before exchange listings. Dynamic passive income also awaits early birds. 

But as always, do your own research before investing in crypto. This is not financial advice.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Bitcoin fell to $113,770, triggering a 10% altcoin market decline as key $112,500 support looms as critical technical threshold.

- Macroeconomic uncertainty from Fed policy and inflation concerns, plus SEC delays on crypto ETF approvals, deepened bearish sentiment across risk assets.

- Ethereum's $3,900 support retest and altcoins like Solana ($189) highlight market fragility, while token unlocks in KAITO/MURA/MOCA add supply-side pressures.

- Analysts remain divided: some see potential recovery above $117,000, while others warn of deeper pullbacks if Bitcoin fails to stabilize key levels.

Bitcoin's recent price action has drawn attention as the cryptocurrency fell to a daily low of $113,770, with market sentiment turning increasingly bearish. The broader cryptocurrency market has mirrored this downturn, experiencing a 10% decline in altcoin values as Bitcoin struggled to hold key technical levels [1]. Analysts are closely monitoring the $112,500 support zone, which is seen as critical in determining the direction of the next few trading sessions. A break below this level could signal further downward pressure, particularly on altcoins like Solana, which have already shown signs of weakness [1].

The broader macroeconomic environment continues to weigh on the market. The upcoming Jackson Hole symposium and Federal Reserve policy announcements are expected to play a pivotal role in shaping investor sentiment. Inflationary concerns and ongoing tariff discussions have already contributed to a negative trend in risk assets, with the crypto market being no exception [1]. Altcoins, which tend to be more sensitive to macroeconomic shifts than Bitcoin, have been especially hard hit.

Regulatory uncertainty is another factor clouding the outlook. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed decisions on ETF applications for cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP, adding to the sense of uncertainty among traders. This lack of regulatory clarity has kept many investors on the sidelines. For example, Solana closed below $189, showing signs of vulnerability after reaching $160 earlier in the year [1].

Despite the bearish tone, some analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Michael Poppe, for instance, is hopeful for a potential recovery if Bitcoin continues to trade above $117,000 [1]. A sustained close above this level could indicate a strengthening trend and potentially lead to renewed interest in altcoins. However, the broader market remains divided, with some fearing a deeper pullback should Bitcoin fail to reclaim key support levels.

Ethereum is emerging as a key indicator for the altcoin market. Technical analysis suggests that the asset may retest the $3,900 support level before mounting a potential 100% rally to new highs, assuming it can overcome resistance at $4,400 [7]. The outcome of this liquidity battle could determine whether altcoins follow a similar trajectory or continue to underperform Bitcoin. 

Meanwhile, WLD and Fartcoin have also attracted attention. Ali Martinez has shared a chart for WLD, predicting a potential breakout from a triangular formation, which could see the price targeting $0.50. Previous stops have been identified at $0.78 and $0.62 [1]. On the other hand, Altcoin Sherpa is more optimistic, anticipating a bounce in Ethereum within a green box on the chart and noting that billions of dollars are still flowing into the market [1]. For Fartcoin, the analyst suggests that a local bottom may have been reached, but a further drop to $0.77 is still possible if the current base breaks.

Investors are also keeping an eye on token unlock schedules, which can influence circulating supply and price stability. Coins like KAITO, MURA, and MOCA are facing increased supply pressures as new tokens enter the market [8]. This dynamic adds another layer of complexity to altcoin performance, as traders attempt to balance fundamental value with tokenomics.

As Bitcoin continues to consolidate and test key support levels, the broader crypto market remains in a transitional phase. The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoin can regain upward momentum or if the altcoin market faces further volatility. With macroeconomic conditions remaining uncertain, market participants are closely watching for signs of stabilization in both Bitcoin's price and the broader crypto ecosystem.

SoFi Partners with Lightspark to Power Blockchain-Enabled International Money Transfers

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI) announced its upcoming international money transfer service, enabling members to send funds abroad directly from the SoFi app with lower fees and faster delivery compared to traditional remittance service providers. Lightspark, a leading enterprise infrastructure provider that uses the Bitcoin Lightning Network, will enable the technology via Universal Money Address (UMA), to send and receive money seamlessly, with access to an open global network for payments. SoFi will be one of the first US-banks to offer a blockchain-powered remittances service.


“For many SoFi members who regularly send money to loved ones internationally, the ability to quickly transfer money at low cost isn't just a convenience, it's a meaningful improvement to their everyday financial lives,” said Anthony Noto, SoFi CEO. “By embedding this directly into SoFi's app, we're unlocking the value of blockchain technology, to give members faster, smarter, and more inclusive access to their money.”




“SoFi is one of the most innovative and forward-thinking financial platforms in the US today,"" said David Marcus, CEO and co-founder of Lightspark. ""Digital banks are embracing UMA because it's fast, cheap, and secure, and it uses the only open payments network that exists, Bitcoin. UMA on SoFi means customers can move dollars instantly, any time, globally, and we're excited to see the demand via SoFi's waitlist, proving that people are ready for the future of payments.”




SoFi's international money transfer service will launch later this year. SoFi will be one of the lowest cost platforms to transfer money internationally, with the total costs being below the current national average. To ensure full transparency, exchange rate and fees will be displayed up front, before members hit send. The service will be available 24/7 directly on the SoFi app, without needing to use a third-party app.




How it Works



SoFi's new international money transfer service, powered by UMA, converts U.S. dollars to Bitcoin in real-time and routes funds across borders using the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The funds are then instantly converted back into local currency and delivered directly to the recipient's bank account in the destination country's local currency.




Lightspark powers a global network of partner banks and financial platforms. This gives senders and recipients a seamless and secure transfer experience with a financial platform they know and trust.




At launch, SoFi's international transfer service will first be available in Mexico with more countries to be added shortly after launch. This phased approach ensures speed, security, and consistency for members from day one, with even more countries to follow.




SoFi's international money transfers will be available through SoFi Checking & Savings later this year. SoFi Checking and Savings is offered through SoFi Bank, N.A. Member FDIC. Members can sign up to join a waitlist to receive access to SoFi self-serve international money transfers later this year.

This service, the company announced Tuesday (Aug. 19), will operate directly from the SoFi app in partnership with crypto infrastructure provider Lightspark.

According to a news release, Lightspark will enable the transfers via Universal Money Address (UMA), “to send and receive money seamlessly, with access to an open global network for payments,” and making SoFi “one of the first US-banks to offer a blockchain-powered remittances service.”

David Marcus, Lightspark's co-founder and CEO, argued that digital banks have begun embracing UMA because of its speed, cost and security, and because it uses bitcoin, which he called “the only open payments network that exists.”

“UMA on SoFi means customers can move dollars instantly, any time, globally, and we're excited to see the demand via SoFi's waitlist, proving that people are ready for the future of payments,” Marcus said.

SoFi said the international money transfer service will launch later this year, with costs the company says will be lower than the current national average.

“While traditional banks tiptoe around blockchain, SoFi is sprinting into the space,” PYMNTS wrote last month as the company released its quarterly earnings.

In addition to this new money transfer service, that report said, the company is also reentering “cryptocurrency trading, a service it previously paused amid regulatory headwinds. Now, with a federal bank license in hand and new regulations under the GENIUS Act opening the door, SoFi said it has a structural advantage over pure-play crypto platforms,” PYMNTS wrote.

During SoFi's earnings call, CEO Anthony Noto previewed plans that included stablecoin issuance, crypto-backed loans and staking infrastructure for other financial institutions. SoFi is already hiring engineering talent and “positioning itself as a key player in financial Web3,” the report added.

Writing about the remittance sector earlier this year, PYMNTS argued that these payments are “one of the clearest use cases where stablecoins promise efficiency gains.”

Global remittance flows came to $669 billion in 2023, with developing countries seeing the bulk, per World Bank data. Traditional transfers often come with fees of up to 6% of the principal and can take numerous days to settle, especially when routed through multiple intermediaries.

“The appeal is straightforward: 24/7 transfer availability, transactions settled in minutes, and an effective ‘digital dollar' hedge against local currency volatility,” the report added.

“Yet the more stablecoins resemble mainstream payments, the more they inherit mainstream risks. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental watchdog for money laundering and terrorist financing, has warned that inconsistent compliance among wallet providers and exchanges could allow stablecoins to become a channel for illicit finance.”

In the summer of 2022, NFT (non-fungible token) platform OpenSea saw a former employee charged with pursuing a digital asset insider trading ploy. The former Product Manager was arrested and charged with wire fraud and money laundering.

As outlined by the US Department of Justice, the defendant utilized insider information to benefit financially. Effectively, the individual in question knew which NFTs were to be featured in advance and thus purchased them before the promotion. The individual apparently purchased these NFTs and then sold them later for 2 to 5 times the initial value.

At the time, US Attorney Damian Williams commented on the allegations, explaining that while NFTs may be new, the type of crime was not.

An OpenSea spokesperson shared a comment with CI explaining that when they learned of the apparent transgression, they initiated an investigation and then asked the individual to leave the company. The activities in question were said to be “in violation of [their] employee policies and in direct conflict with [their] core values and principles.”

In May 2023, the individual was convicted by a jury and sentenced to three months in prison, which was subsequently satisfied by the time already served. In recent days, the case against the defendant was heard by an appellate court, and the individual was found innocent of all charges.

On July 31, 2025, the US Court of Appeals vacated the conviction, finding the information the individual misappropriated from OpenSea could not sustain the wire fraud charge because it had no economic value to the company.  To a non-legal observer, this appears odd.

Did the individual use inside information illicitly? Did they benefit financially from this information?  It seems obvious to most, but the court saw otherwise.

CI connected with Philip Moustakis, Partner at the global law firm of Seward & Kissel. Before joining the firm, Moustakis was an attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Enforcement Division and a founding member of the SEC's Cyber Unit. We asked Moustakis about the case and his opinion on the court's decision.

Philip Moustakis: No. It appears to be a case where there was no crime. Here, the Second Circuit found the jury could have convicted Chastain for unethical behavior, rather than conduct that meets all the elements of the wire fraud statute.

Philip Moustakis: In short, the Court found that advance knowledge of which NFTs would be featured on the site did not have commercial value to OpenSea and thus did not qualify as traditional property under the wire fraud statute. The Court did not find that NFTs themselves are not traditional property, and one could imagine facts and circumstances, for example, a case involving theft of NFTs that would satisfy the statute.

Philip Moustakis: In my view, the vast majority of NFTs are art or collectibles, not securities.

A few NFTs may theoretically check all the boxes of the Howey test for an investment contract, but proving any of the NFTs involved here were securities would have added to the prosecution's burden.

Philip Moustakis: No. The conduct alleged was unseemly, at least, and posed reputational and other risks to the company.

Philip Moustakis: In my view, the technology is somewhat beside the point—one can imagine similar conduct in a business that sells physical art or collectibles—but the case stands for the proposition that not all unethical or distasteful business conduct is a crime.

The power to control access to money is no longer the exclusive privilege of the sovereign. Increasingly, the rules governing how money is created, moves, and is held are enforced not by governments alone but by code, online networks, and protocols beyond the authority of any single nation. The U.S. GENIUS Act—short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins—formalizes this transformation of money by creating a framework for regulated U.S. banks to issue dollar-backed stablecoins: digital tokens designed to reliably trade near their $1 par value because they are backed by real dollars or safe assets held in reserve.

These tokens can move instantly across the internet, often bypassing the traditional banking system and its know-your-customer rules. Many operate on decentralized blockchains where transactions are recorded on public ledgers maintained by distributed computer networks that span the globe—beyond the practical reach of any sovereign authority.

These tokens can move instantly across the internet, often bypassing the traditional banking system and its know-your-customer rules. Many operate on decentralized blockchains where transactions are recorded on public ledgers maintained by distributed computer networks that span the globe—beyond the practical reach of any sovereign authority.

This removes the biggest obstacle holding back the development of stablecoins: the lack of a fully credible peg. Historically, stablecoin issuers lacked the financial wherewithal to credibly maintain their peg to the U.S. dollar and had no liquidity support from the U.S. Federal Reserve, unlike banks. As a result, stablecoins rarely lived up to their moniker: Several collapsed outright, while others have frequently depegged, trading below their $1 par value during periods of volatility.

Yet with banks potentially guaranteeing 1:1 redemption of stablecoins for dollars, these tokens would become functionally equivalent to other financial assets, such as time deposits or commercial paper, that are already recognized “cash equivalents” under international accounting standards. The largest U.S. banks are already working on plans to issue stablecoins.

Some estimates forecast that as much as $1.75 trillion in new dollar-backed stablecoins could enter circulation over the next three years. If this comes to pass, the consequences of this expansion could reverberate far beyond U.S. borders—especially in China.

China's leadership views these developments with considerable apprehension—and for good reason. Bank-issued dollar stablecoins present a powerful use case as an infinitely divisible, programmable form of digital money that combines the dollar's core strength—global liquidity—with the security and anonymity of blockchain-based ownership, akin to holding physical gold.

Unlike conventional forms of money, stablecoins are largely beyond the reach of capital controls. They circulate freely between digital wallets whose owners can be located anywhere in the world and use pseudonyms that provide a strong, but not unbreakable, level of anonymity. While blockchain transactions are inherently public, enabling data analysis to potentially identify wallet owners, this task will become increasingly difficult if stablecoins go mainstream. The result is a new channel for transacting in dollars that the Chinese state cannot fully monitor, throttle, or shut down.

From the perspective of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), dollar stablecoins are not just a potentially disruptive economic issue but also a political threat. One of the pillars of the party's political power is its ability to control the flow of money and preferentially allocate capital using China's system of financial repression. The architecture of this system relies on strict capital controls to hold the capital of the Chinese people captive and funnel it into state-owned banks.

If the government can no longer effectively police access to foreign currency, then capital will steadily leak out, and the whole system of ensuring the loyalty of China's elites to the CCP by selectively granting them access to cheap capital will break down.

China's export-oriented business community would likely be receptive to using bank-issued dollar stablecoins because of their potential to lower international transaction costs. It is conceivable that after gaining traction among businesses, dollar stablecoins could begin to displace the yuan in more everyday transactions—just as printed U.S. dollars already circulate widely in parts of Latin America. While the loss of monetary sovereignty in China may seem like a distant threat, it is nonetheless an existential one—and the CCP knows it.

A team of researchers with e-commerce giant JD.com argued that U.S. government support for bank-issued stablecoins could spur a rapid increase in their usage, strengthening the dollar's dominant position in global trade. Even Chinese state media warned that the use of dollar stablecoins was “expected to increase the demand for U.S. [Treasurys], lower interest rates, and secure the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.”

For Beijing, dollar stablecoins threaten to erode its hard-won progress in recent years toward building renminbi-based financial infrastructure that could serve as an alternative to the dollar-based infrastructure controlled by Washington. In a world where dollar stablecoins circulate globally, Beijing risks losing not just monetary ground but also political leverage.

China once dominated cryptocurrency trading and mining. In 2013, four years after the creation of bitcoin, Chinese exchanges led the world in trading volumes, and bitcoin's price was strongly correlated to news coming out of China. But that early crypto boom was short-lived as Chinese authorities grew skeptical that the industry's benefits were worth the risks of money laundering, capital evasion, and the facilitation of organized crime. In December 2013, Chinese regulators published the “Notice on Preventing Bitcoin Risks,” banning financial institutions and payment processors from providing bitcoin-related services but stopping short of prohibiting individuals' use and ownership of bitcoin.

Over time, this evolved into a near-total ban. In September 2021, regulators declared all cryptocurrency-related financial activities illegal—including trading, payments, token issuance, fundraising, and derivatives. The net effect was that by 2021, most of the crypto industry was driven out of China.

However, individuals retained the legal right to own cryptocurrency as virtual property, as clarified by several court rulings dating back to 2018 from Shenzhen, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. Meanwhile, despite cracking down on cryptocurrency specifically, Chinese authorities have never restricted the general use of blockchain technology for other purposes.

Somewhat paradoxically, China's top leadership has embraced blockchain technology, declaring it a national strategic priority, while simultaneously condemning cryptocurrency, its most prominent use case. At a 2019 Politburo study session on blockchain, Chinese President Xi Jinping described it as a core technology for achieving indigenous innovation and called for increased investment to accelerate its development. China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) similarly identified blockchain as a foundational industry for the digital economy.

China's vision for blockchain explicitly rejects the principle of decentralization in favor of closed systems developed by state-aligned tech giants such as Ant Group (a subsidiary of Alibaba) and Tencent (owner of WeChat). These firms have poured significant resources into realizing Beijing's strategic tech goals. According to Coincub's 2023 Blockchain Patent Report, China leads the world in the number of granted blockchain patents since 2009, accounting for roughly 68 percent of the global total.

State-backed initiatives such as the Blockchain-Based Service Network and Spark Chain Network, along with enterprise platforms such as AntChain and Tencent's TrustSQL, exemplify this centralized approach. These systems allow preapproved participants to operate within blockchain environments that retain transparency and traceability while remaining fully subject to regulatory oversight by China's Cyberspace Administration.

China's initial response to the perceived threat of cryptocurrency was to try to front-run it by developing the world's first central bank digital currency: the digital renminbi, or e-CNY. In 2021, the People's Bank of China published a white paper on the development progress of the e-CNY in China, which highlighted the risks posed by private stablecoins and the need for the central bank to proactively occupy the space with its own digital currency. Initial testing of the e-CNY began in 2020, and since April 2021, it has been widely available to the public.

Yet adoption of the e-CNY remains slow and underwhelming. Chinese financial media described the e-CNY as having become an “embarrassing situation” in which “no one uses it” unless it's accompanied by a government-sponsored retail promotion offering free “digital red envelopes.” Despite state-led trials across dozens of cities and heavy institutional support, the e-CNY has struggled—like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies—to find any everyday usage for payments.

Mu Changchun, the director-general of the central bank's Digital Currency Institute, has repeatedly said the e-CNY is not intended to replace paper money or compete with other payment services. Regardless of its intended purpose, in practice, the e-CNY has largely been eclipsed by the entrenched dominance of QR code-based platforms such as WeChat Pay and Alipay.

Unlike Alipay and WeChat Pay, both of which link to checking accounts and credit cards and generate revenue through fees and data, e-CNY transactions generate no fee-based revenue for banks. A 2024 S&P Global Ratings report concluded that widespread adoption of the e-CNY could actually erode bank profitability. As a result, many banks and fintech platforms treat the e-CNY more as a compliance obligation than a business opportunity. With limited uptake, weak incentives, and no compelling value proposition, the e-CNY's future remains uncertain.

That uncertainty has quietly opened the door again to stablecoin experimentation within China's jurisdiction, particularly in Hong Kong. In May, Hong Kong's Legislative Council passed the landmark Stablecoins Bill, allowing licensed entities to issue fiat-backed stablecoins, including those pegged to the Hong Kong dollar (itself pegged to the U.S. dollar) and the offshore renminbi (CNH). Oversight, licensing, and audits fall under the authority of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

Hong Kong serves as China's financial laboratory: It is legally distinct yet politically aligned, globally integrated yet institutionally loyal. While mainland regulators have not publicly endorsed the new framework, it is implausible that such a move could occur without Beijing's approval. By permitting CNH-based stablecoin trials in Hong Kong, Chinese authorities can explore tokenized renminbi circulation offshore while keeping mainland capital controls intact.

A renminbi-backed stablecoin would likely be fully traceable, linked to China's digital ID system with real-name verification and facial recognition, enabling authorities to monitor every transaction in real time. While this strengthens anti-money laundering efforts, it also poses risks of pervasive financial surveillance. At best, it allows precise macroeconomic policy; at worst, it becomes a tool for enforcing political discipline and restricting undesirable economic behavior. For Beijing, blockchain's value lies not in decentralization but in using code to refine state control. In this model, money is more than a medium of exchange; it becomes an instrument for implementing government policy and exercising social control.

The programmability of stablecoins could allow Chinese authorities to embed usage restrictions directly into the currency itself. Features already tested in the e-CNY—such as expiration dates, sector-specific spending limits, and geographic limitations—could be adapted to serve government objectives. Moreover, geofencing could limit circulation of an offshore renminbi stablecoin to only licensed zones, such as Hong Kong and other financial centers, with transaction limits and user eligibility hard-coded on the blockchain. This would preserve China's capital controls while allowing the stablecoin to circulate globally. Unlike the e-CNY, which remains primarily domestic despite ambitions for international use, an offshore stablecoin pegged to CNH could extend China's global financial reach without exposing its capital account to outflow risks.

Momentum is growing among scholars and companies advocating that Beijing authorize a renminbi-backed stablecoin to proactively counter the influence of dollar stablecoins. Already, JD.com and Alibaba affiliate Ant Group both plan to issue stablecoins backed by Hong Kong dollars. Wang Yongli, a former vice president of the Bank of China, has publicly urged the government to consider launching an offshore renminbi stablecoin to reclaim its former lead in crypto assets and digital payments. In a telling sign, none of these proposals has been silenced by the government.

China does not intend to follow the United States down the path of permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrencies with pseudonymous transactions. Instead, it is poised to marshal its considerable resources behind a competing digital money model—one designed to reinforce, not relax, state control. Whereas early cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin sought to dismantle authority, Beijing's goal is to build a digital monetary architecture that encodes and enforces it. Given the economies of scale and positive network effects that drive adoption, the competition for the future of digital money may well be winner-takes-all. Beijing fears that Washington currently holds the advantage, but the Chinese know how to catch up—and fast.

Wyoming's launch of the Frontier Stable Token (FRNT) is being hailed as a milestone for crypto, but some experts warn it raises new concerns about privacy and centralization.

FRNT, a stablecoin backed by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills and built on Avalanche, launched on mainnet Tuesday, Aug. 19, at the SALT Wyoming Blockchain Symposium. The token can now be spent anywhere Visa is accepted, making it the first U.S. state-backed stablecoin available to consumers.

FRNT initially supports seven blockchains – Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and Solana.

While the launch marks a big step for crypto adoption, it has raised concerns about a domino effect that could result in a wave of government-issued digital dollars. 

This concern has already reached Congress, where lawmakers are considering restrictions on federal digital currency plans through the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Passed by the House in July, the bill would ban the federal government from creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and using it for monetary policy. 

“The scary part is whether D.C. and the Fed take this as a green light to roll out their own fully controlled coin,” Kadan Stadelmann, CTO at Komodo, told The Defiant. “A federal CBDC would be surveillance on steroids. That's the nightmare scenario, a coin you can't spend without permission.”

He added that while FRNT demonstrates progress in mainstream adoption, it risks blurring the line between decentralized crypto and government-issued “digital cash,” noting that if this happens, “we didn't win – they did.”

Stablecoins have already grown into a $276 billion market, up from approximately $5 billion in 2020, per DefiLlama. Tether's USDT leads by circulation, followed by Circle's USDC.

Meanwhile, investment firm Keyrock projects that the stablecoin sector could capture up to $1 trillion in annual payment volume by 2030. 

“This cuts both ways. On the one hand, it's great for visibility and it gives crypto some much-needed regulatory legitimacy,” Stadelmann said. “On the other hand, a government stablecoin is the polar opposite of decentralization. It's literally the state putting its stamp on-chain. Good for adoption, bad for the core Web3 values a lot of us fight for.”

He also noted that while FRNT pushes another crypto use case to millions of people, it's not entirely new: “We've been swiping crypto cards for years. This is only different because it's the government's crypto card,” Stadelmann said. 

Not all experts see downsides. Mike Cahill, Initial Contributor at Pyth Network, told The Defiant the move accelerates mainstream adoption in a way private issuers alone could not. 

“This is significant because it's the first time where a state isn't just pushing to regulate crypto; it's issuing it,” Cahill said. “A government-backed stablecoin bridges the gap between decentralized finance and the existing financial system. It's a major validation point for the fact that stablecoins are set to be the foundation for the future of our financial infrastructure.”

Experts say stablecoins are becoming increasingly appealing to both individuals and institutions due to their yield-bearing potential, often offering better returns than traditional banks. For context, around 21% of U.S. business bank deposits (approximately $3.85 trillion) don't earn any interest, as The Defiant previously reported. 

Jack O'Holleran, the co-founder and CEO of SKALE Labs, emphasized that Wyoming's launch will be a very bullish signal for stablecoins.

“Wyoming just created the first real competition for Circle and Tether, who never thought they'd have to compete with government entities for business,” O'Holleran said. “More quality stablecoins with actual rigor in how they're backed and how their reserves are put together will drive mass adoption. Competition forces better products.”

He explained that if larger states like California or New York get the same idea, that could result in intense competition. “Government backing hits differently than corporate backing. People understand what that means,” O'Holleran said. “Wyoming might be small, but this is going to force other states to ask if they should be doing this too.”

The launch of FRNT comes just one month after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act, which was subsequently signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump. The bill sets out rules for the issuance and governance of stablecoins.

New federal legislation may pave the way for further crypto momentum. Recently, President Trump signed an executive order that would enable 401(k) accounts to invest in alternative assets. Among other options, this includes digital assets like bitcoin.

The Investment Company Institute notes that 401(k) plans hold about $8.9 trillion in assets, as of September 30, 2024. Opening up that much capital to the world of bitcoin could easily help propel the cryptocurrency to new highs.

As such, it could pay off to fortify one's bitcoin exposure before the digital currency sees further rallies tied to 401(k) legislation and momentum. Luckily, with the flexibility of the ETF wrapper, it's easier than ever to gain exposure to the digital currency.

For example, take a closer look at the Calamos Bitcoin 80 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF – July (CBTY). As a Calamos Protected Bitcoin ETF, it offers a risk/reward blend for those looking to add bitcoin to their portfolio.

Part of CBTY's value-add comes from its ability to mitigate risk. The fund limits maximum loss to 20% across its outcome period. As experienced bitcoin investors know, it's not exactly unheard of for the cryptocurrency to plummet far below the 20% marker at the wrong time.

Risk management isn't the only advantage CBTY brings to the table. Certainly, the fund has an upside cap on its potential returns, but that cap is far higher than a traditional defined outcome ETF. As of August 7, 2025, CBTY has an upside cap of around 35%. This cap provides wiggle room for investors to gather capital appreciation from bitcoin's price momentum.

As a pilot of alternative investments, Calamos is continuing to innovate with new ETFs launched regularly. As a whole, the firm has nearly $1 billion in assets under management within its ETF lineup alone.

Before investing, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Please see the prospectus and summary prospectus containing this and other information which can be obtained by calling 1-866-363-9219. Read it carefully before investing.  

An investment in the Fund is subject to risks, and you could lose money on your investment in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Your investment in the Fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. The risks associated with an investment in the Fund can increase during times of significant market volatility. The Fund also has specific principal risks, which are described below. More detailed information regarding these risks can be found in the Fund's prospectus. 

Investing involves risks. Loss of principal is possible. The Fund(s) face numerous market trading risks, including authorized participation concentration risk, underlying ETP risk, cap change risk, capital protection risk, capped upside risk, cash holdings risk, concentration risk, clearing member default risk, correlation risk, costs of buying and selling fund shares, counterparty risk, derivatives risk, equity securities risk, FLEX options risk, interest rate risk, investment in a subsidiary, investment timing risk, liquidity risk, management risk, market maker risk, market risk, new fund risk, non-diversification risk, options risk, OTC options risk, position limits risk, premium-discount risk, secondary market trading risk, sector risk, tax risk, trading issues risk, U.S. Government security risk, U.S. Treasury risk, and valuation risk. For a detailed list of fund risks see the prospectus.  

The Target Outcome may not be achieved, and investors may lose some or all of their money. The Fund is designed to achieve the Target Outcome only if an investor buys on the first day of the Outcome Period and holds the Fund until the end of the Outcome Period. While the Fund seeks to provide 100% protection against losses experienced by the price of Spot bitcoin for shareholders who hold Fund Shares for an entire Outcome Period, there is no guarantee it will successfully do so. If the Fund's NAV has increased significantly, a shareholder that purchases Fund Shares after the first day of an Outcome Period could lose their entire investment. An investment in the Fund is only appropriate for shareholders willing to bear those losses. There is no guarantee the Capital Protection and Cap will be successful and a shareholder investing at the beginning of an Outcome Period could also lose their entire investment.  

The Fund seeks to provide investment results that, before taking fees and expenses into account, track the positive price return of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate – New York Variant (“BRRNY”) (“Spot bitcoin”) up to a predetermined upside cap (the “Cap”) while seeking to protect against 100% of losses (before fees and expenses) of (i) Spot bitcoin or (ii) one or more of the Underlying ETPs and/or Bitcoin Indexes, in each case, over a period of approximately one (1) year (the “Outcome Period”). The Fund will not invest directly in bitcoin. Instead, the Fund seeks to provide investment results that, before taking fees and expenses into account, track the positive price return of Spot bitcoin by investing in options that reference the price performance of either (i) one or more underlying exchange-traded products (“Underlying ETPs”) which, in turn, own bitcoin or (ii) one or more indexes that are designed to track the price of bitcoin (“Bitcoin Index”).  

Digital Assets Risk: The bitcoin network was first launched in 2009 and bitcoins were the first cryptographic digital assets created to gain global adoption and critical mass. Although the bitcoin network is the most established digital asset network, the bitcoin network and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry that is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. Moreover, because digital assets, including bitcoin, have been in existence for a short period of time and are continuing to develop, there may be additional risks in the future that are impossible to predict as of the date of this prospectus. Digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry, and the value of the Underlying ETPs' shares depends on the acceptance of bitcoin. The realization of one or more of the following risks could materially adversely affect the value of the Underlying ETPs' shares. 

The fund's expense ratio as of the prospectus dated 4/7/2025 is 0.69%. 

Cap Rate – Maximum percentage return an investor can achieve from an investment in the Fund if held over the Outcome Period.  

Protection Level – Amount of protection the Fund is designed to achieve over the Days Remaining.  

Outcome Period – The defined length of time over which the outcomes are sought.

Can interoperability survive the rise of branded rails?

Fintech powerhouse Stripe is secretly building a high-performance blockchain called ‘Tempo', and Circle just announced its own stablecoin-centric chain, ‘Arc'. Stablecoins promise to make cryptocurrencies mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments.

Paradoxically, the same move could undercut what the technology set out to achieve. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. With the US's Genius Act now law, the next 12–18 months will most likely determine the outcome.

We've seen this before with the internet. Even when a technology has a decentralising force, economies of scale in complementary resources, brand or distribution inevitably drive concentration. The underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, but massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us.

Crypto as the antidote?

Crypto's reason for existence was to break free from centralised intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. Inspired by bitcoin, entrepreneurs have applied the same principles to other digital platforms, including finance, marketplaces and social media. Progress towards decentralisation is mixed: while bitcoin allows anyone to be their own bank, most rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer greater privacy and data controls have stayed niche.

In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Legacy infrastructure is siloed and incumbents have tremendous power over what we can access – and on what terms. Markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in – the most salient example is China's introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the Ant Group and Tencent oligopoly.

Crypto is a market-driven solution to this. It provides neutral and decentralised cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, as well as truly open financial rails. But as the technology has matured, two problems have emerged.

1. Stablecoins' centralising force

The first problem is that cryptocurrencies are volatile and therefore expensive for payments and financial contracts. To address this, the market has focused on fiat-backed stablecoins. This inevitably leads to centralisation because issuance requires a regulated entity to be accountable. While distributed governance is possible, it is difficult to get right – Libra being the most prominent example. Even Circle's Centre Consortium, with only two members, was dissolved and converted into a revenue-sharing agreement.

Distributed ownership of a stablecoin ecosystem makes sense and is similar to what made Visa scale in the 1970s. Banks have tried for years to come together in response to crypto. To date, no joint project has delivered anything tangible. The reason is obvious: until the situation is dire, competitors are unlikely to collaborate.

To date, the only working model for stablecoin governance is the centralised one. This is long-term problematic, and issuers have already started expanding their offerings to limit openness. Circle announced its own rails with Arc and payment network with the Circle Payments Network, placing it at the centre of how payments are executed – from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every transaction, to price and liquidity discovery, and collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from what allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate for decades.

2. From open rails to closed loops?

The second problem crypto has run into is deeply tied to its roots: decentralisation is expensive. The economic consequence is that you can only afford it where it truly matters. To date, among networks at scale, that's been true only for the base layers of bitcoin, ethereum and solana. At most, that yields a few thousand transactions per second combined – a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you add financial services.

As a result, most transactions no longer occur on the base layers (L1s) but on a sprawling ecosystem of high-throughput scaling solutions (L2s). While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns with economic theory: participants are willing to pay a premium for decentralisation and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily accept more centralisation to gain lower costs and faster speeds.

This trade-off is broader than a user's decision to be their own bank. When building products, companies care deeply that the underlying network is decentralised. Essentially, they are willing to pay for neutrality to reduce the risk of expropriation – something that has repeatedly played out in digital platforms.

To fully grasp what fast, low-cost L2s will do to competition, look no further than what the internet did to news and media: as the cost of distributing content fell to zero, business models evolved drastically, and massive aggregators (Google, Facebook, Spotify) emerged. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience and allow builders to deliver better experiences, they are the obvious layer where value will be created – and appropriated.

Furthermore, as money movement is commoditised, competition will shift to value-added services where new and legacy financial institutions have an advantage. Any regulated player can now use the technology to scale a truly global product. Once it reaches scale, it can also degrade interoperability and appropriate more of the value.

Whoever controls the last mile wins

So what's the most likely scenario? Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been, it's safe to assume that payments will gravitate towards a couple of permissionless blockchains. Yet most activity will take place not on their base layers, but on branded scaling layers.

Players that control distribution – whether on the consumer, merchant or institutional side – have an advantage as they own the interface between the blockchain and the real world across identity, compliance, creditworthiness and more. That's where friction persists – and where economies of scale will decide winners and losers.

To counterbalance this, Circle is trying to both commoditise the rails – by issuing on multiple networks and placing itself in the middle with its cross-chain transfer protocol – and move activity to its network. Similarly, fintechs like Stripe are attempting to migrate volume to networks and assets they control. In doing so, they may use stablecoins as a loss leader and issue domestic stablecoins to expand their advantage to foreign exchange markets and local use cases. Real-world assets and applications that are exclusive to these branded networks may help them retain volume and develop reward and loyalty programmes to increase customer lock-in.

As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different. The good news is that it will be far more useful. And while that may come with more centralisation, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure than under the status quo.

It is also possible that, because crypto allows for new market design, the ultimate solution will be something the internet could not achieve because it lacked built-in monetisation mechanisms. Regardless, if centralisation materialises, developers will undo it and the cycle will repeat.

 Blockchain lending company Figure Technology has filed to go public on Nasdaq, days after announcing it had confidentially lodged its application with regulators. 

Blockchain-based lending company Figure Technology Solutions filed for an initial public offering in the US, joining a slate of crypto companies that have entered the market.

The New York-based company plans to list on Nasdaq under the symbol “FIGR” with Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Jefferies Financial Group leading the IPO. Some of its existing shareholders will sell shares in the offering, Figure said in a filing on Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Figure said earlier this month that it had confidentially filed to go public, joining a flurry of crypto companies eyeing a public debut under the crypto-friendly Trump administration and following a blockbuster IPO from stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group.

It came after robust earnings for the first half of 2025. The company's revenue was almost $191 million, up over 22% from last year. It recorded a profit of $29 million, up from a $13 million loss.

Figure was co-founded in 2018 by Mike Cagney, who helped create the layer 1 asset tokenization-focused blockchain Provenance and the fintech firm SoFi, the country's largest online lender.

Figure offers a blockchain platform for lending, trading and asset tokenization on Provenance. It was valued at $3.2 billion in a 2021 Series D funding round that raised $200 million.

Figure said in its filing that it has originated over $16 billion in blockchain-based loans and completed over $50 billion worth of onchain transactions.

“Blockchain can do more than disrupt existing markets. By taking historically illiquid assets — such as loans — and putting these assets and their performance history onchain, blockchain can bring liquidity to markets that have never had such,” Cagney said in the filing.

He added that financial services require significant intermediation and “massive companies with enormous market capitalizations have been built around this rent-seeking.”

“Blockchain has the power to distill these multiparty marketplaces down to just two: buyer and seller. All the rent-seeking goes away,” Cagney added.

Multiple crypto companies have debuted or filed to go public in the US in recent weeks, with crypto exchange and CoinDesk owner Bullish listing on the NYSE on Wednesday, Aug. 13, which saw its stock soar over 200%.

Crypto exchange Gemini has also recently filed for an IPO, joining crypto custodian BitGo and crypto exchange-traded fund issuer Grayscale, while crypto exchange Kraken has long been rumoured to be going public next year.

 Wyoming announced the mainnet launch of the Frontier Stable Token stablecoin, becoming one of the first US states to issue a stablecoin. 

The Wyoming Stable Token Commission, a body authorized by the US state to issue a stablecoin, announced the mainnet launch of the Frontier Stable Token (FRNT) stablecoin.

The FRNT stablecoin is a fully-collateralized digital token backed by short-duration US Treasury bills and US dollars, with a statutorily mandated 102% reserve requirement, the commission said in an announcement on Tuesday.

According to CryptoAmerica host Eleanor Terrett, the FRNT is now live on seven blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, Optimism and Base.

“However, due to lingering regulatory hurdles, the token is not yet available to the public,” Terrett said in an X post on Tuesday.

The FRNT mainnet launch is expected to be announced at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, a second annual event hosted by the finance networking platform SALT and Kraken exchange.

“For years, Wyoming has been the leading state on blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital asset regulation, passing over 45 pieces of legislation since 2016,” Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon said, adding:

The official announcement highlights the commission's collaboration with the blockchain interoperability protocol LayerZero to offer FRNT across multiple blockchain networks.

The initial FRNT availability is expected to feature purchases on the Solana blockchain through Wyoming-domiciled crypto exchange Kraken in the coming days, the commission said.

“Public availability will be noticed with a distribution from this office and the Stable Token Commission,” it added.

According to an announcement shared by Avalanche developer Ava Labs, Wyoming's FRNT stablecoin will be available for use anywhere Visa is accepted.

The supported payment channels include major mobile payment and digital wallet services such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, as well as physical cards.

“The issuance of FRNT signals a paradigm shift,” the commission's executive director Anthony Apollo said, stressing that Wyoming has been among the pioneers of crypto adoption and digital asset legislation in the US.

“In addition to regulation, public entities now have a model for innovation that can make government processes significantly more efficient,” Apollo said in a statement, adding:

A spokesperson for Ava Labs also told Cointelegraph that FRNT is the same token previously referred to as Wyoming Stable Token (WYST) and Wyoming Electronic Stable Token (WEST).

 Bitcoiner Chamath Palihapitiya filed documents to raise $250 million for American Exceptionalism, a prospective SPAC focused on the DeFi, AI, energy and defense sectors. 

Early Bitcoin investor and billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya filed to raise $250 million in blank-check company “American Exceptionalism Acquisition Corp A,” targeting the decentralized finance, AI, energy and defense sectors.

The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) would be led by Social Capital managing partner Steven Trieu as CEO and Palihapitiya as chairman, according to the registration statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. 

The $250 million raise seeks to offer 25 million shares at $10 each under the ticker AEXA on the New York Stock Exchange.

Palihapitiya and Trieu are betting on decentralized finance, not Bitcoin, to lead the next wave of financial innovation, focusing on solutions that bridge traditional markets with blockchain technology:

The pair pointed to the success of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group's recent public listing, stating it “demonstrated how decentralized finance can be used to disintermediate traditional finance intermediaries and provide clear value for customers via reduced friction.”

The venture capitalists acknowledged the path toward mainstream acceptance of crypto and stablecoins has “taken longer than expected,” but that path “now appears to be inevitable.”

Palihapitiya led several high-profile SPACs during 2020 and 2021, including successful mergers involving Social Capital Suvretta Holdings I and Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings V, now operating as SoFi Technologies.

However, other SPACs led by Palihapitiya, such as Social Capital Suvretta Holdings II, III, and IV, were liquidated, giving him a mixed record. 

SPACs face challenges because they are bound by strict time limits to find a private company to merge with, often struggle to identify companies worthy of high valuations, and operate under considerable regulatory scrutiny.

The naming of Palihapitiya's American-themed SPAC comes two years after he declared the crypto industry “Dead in America,” pointing the finger at former SEC Chair Gary Gensler for pursuing dozens of high-profile lawsuits against crypto firms.

Critics labeled Gensler's crackdown part of “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” an alleged coordinated effort by regulators to pressure banks into distancing themselves from crypto firms.

Many of those cases, including ones against Coinbase and Ripple, have been dismissed under the new crypto-friendly SEC led by Paul Atkins, which has also created a Crypto Task Force to provide clearer rules while balancing innovation with consumer protection.

How Scientists Finally Learned That Nerves Regrow

Long dismissed as impossible, nerve regrowth is offering new hope for healing injuries and treating neurodegeneration

By Diana Kwon edited by Madhusree Mukerjee

Sam Falconer

We're celebrating 180 years of Scientific American. Explore our legacy of discovery and look ahead to the future.

Billions of nerve cells send signals coursing through our bodies, serving as conduits through which the brain performs its essential functions. For millennia physicians thought damage to nerves was irreversible. In ancient Greece, founders of modern medicine such as Hippocrates and Galen refused to operate on damaged nerves for fear of causing pain, convulsions or even death.

The dogma stood relatively still until the past two centuries, during which surgeons and scientists found evidence that neurons in the body and brain can repair themselves and regenerate after injury and that new nerve cells can grow throughout the lifespan. In recent decades this knowledge has inspired promising treatments for nerve injuries and has led researchers to investigate interventions for neurodegenerative disease.

In humans and other vertebrates, the nervous system is split into two parts: the central nervous system, composed of the spinal cord and brain, and the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain to the rest of the body.

Attempts to suture together the ends of damaged neurons in the peripheral nervous system date back to the seventh century. It was only in the late 1800s, however, that scientists began to understand how, exactly, nerves regenerate. Through his experiments on frogs, British physiologist Augustus Waller described in detail what happens to a peripheral nerve after injury. Then, in the 1900s, the influential Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal provided insight into how nerve regeneration occurs at the cellular level. Still, there remained fierce debate about whether stitching nerves together would harm more than help.

It was against the backdrop of bloody world wars of the 20th century that physicians finally made significant advances in techniques to restore damaged neurons. To treat soldiers with devastating wounds that typically involved nerve damage, doctors developed methods such as nerve grafts, in which pieces of nerves are transplanted into the gap in a broken nerve.

Over time physicians learned that some peripheral nerve injuries are more conducive to repair than others. Factors such as the timing, location and size of the injury, as well as the age of the patient, can significantly impact the success of any given intervention. Crushed nerves are likelier than cut ones to be repaired, and injuries that occur closer to a nerve's target tissue have a greater chance of regaining function than those that occur farther away. Take the ulnar nerve, which stretches the entire length of the arm and controls key muscles in the lower arm and hand. A person with nerve damage near the wrist is much more likely to regain function in the arm and hand after undergoing treatment than someone who injures the same nerve near the shoulder, in which case it must regrow from the shoulder all the way to the wrist.

Even today many peripheral nerve injuries remain difficult to treat, and scientists are striving to better understand the mechanisms of regeneration to facilitate healing. One notable development in recent years, according to neurologist Ahmet Höke of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, is a “nerve transfer,” in which a branch of a nearby nerve is rerouted to a damaged nerve. In cases where, for example, a nerve is damaged far from its target muscle, existing techniques may not be sufficient to enable regrowth across the long distances involved within a time frame allowing for recovery. This detour provides an alternative pathway to regain function. Susan Mackinnon, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis, has largely driven the advances in nerve transfer, enabling patients to use their limbs after peripheral nerve injuries that previously would have led to a permanent loss of movement in them.

For instance, Oskar Hanson, a high school baseball player, lost sensation and movement in most of his left arm after a surgery to mend a ligament injury ended up damaging the ulnar nerve in that arm. “There was zero hope that he would be able to have use of his arm again,” says his mother, Patricia Hanson. But after Mackinnon performed a nerve transfer procedure, most of the function returned. “She saved his life with that surgery,” Hanson says.

Despite the leaps that were made in treating peripheral nerve injuries, the notion that neurons within the central nervous system—the brain and spinal cord—were incapable of regrowth persisted until the late 20th century.

A pivotal moment came in the early 1980s, when Canadian neuroscientist Albert Aguayo and his colleagues demonstrated that in rats, neurons of the spinal cord and brain stem could regrow when segments of peripheral nerves were grafted into the site of injury. These findings revealed that neurons of the central nervous system can also regenerate, Höke says: “They just needed the appropriate environment.”

In succeeding years, neuroscientists worked to uncover what, exactly, that environment looked like. To do so, they searched for differences in the peripheral and central nervous systems that could explain why the former was better able to repair damaged neurons. Several key differences emerged. For example, only injuries within the central nervous system led to the formation of glial scars—masses of nonneuronal cells known as glial cells. The purpose of these scars is still debated, however.

Today the search for the specific mechanisms that prevent or enable neuron regrowth—in both the body and the brain—remains an active area of investigation. In addition to uncovering the processes at play in humans, scientists have pinpointed molecules that enable nerve cell repair in other organisms, such as “fusogens,” gluelike molecules found in nematodes. Researchers are attempting to harness fusogens to help with difficult-to-treat human nerve injuries.

Modern neuroscientists have also challenged another long-standing doctrine in the field: the belief that the adult brain does not engage in neurogenesis, the creation of brand-new nerve cells.

Early clues for neurogenesis in the brain emerged in the 1960s, when researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology observed signs of neurons dividing in the brains of adult rats. At the time, these findings were met with skepticism, says Rusty Gage, a professor of genetics at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif. “It was just too hard to believe.”

Then, in the early 1980s, neuroscientist Fernando Nottebohm of the Rockefeller University discovered that in male songbirds, the size of the brain region associated with song-making changed with the seasons. Nottebohm and his colleagues went on to show that cells in the animals' brains died and regenerated with the seasons. Inspired by these findings, researchers looked for signs of adult neurogenesis in other animals. In 1998 Gage and his colleagues revealed evidence of this process occurring in the brains of adult humans—specifically within the hippocampus, a region linked with learning and memory.

Although support for adult neurogenesis in humans has amassed over the years, some experts still debate its existence. In 2018 a team co-led by Arturo Alvarez-Buylla, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who had worked with Nottebohm on songbirds, published a study stating that the formation of new neurons was extremely rare, and likely nonexistent, in adult human brains.

Still, there's a growing consensus that neurogenesis does happen later in life—and that this growth appears to be largely limited to certain parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus. This past July a team at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden reported that the molecular signatures of precursors of neurons, known as neural progenitor cells, were present in the human brain across the lifespan—from infancy into old age. Researchers are now trying to understand the purpose of these budding nerve cells and asking whether they might offer clues for treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Some scientists are even exploring whether, by targeting neurogenesis, they can improve the symptoms of psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

Understanding that a neuron can regrow and be repaired and identifying details of that process has been a great achievement, says Massimo Hilliard, a cellular and molecular neurobiologist at the University of Queensland in Australia. The next step, he adds, will be figuring out how to control these processes: “That's going to be key.”

U.S. Cuts Antarctica's Only Research Icebreaker Ship under Trump Budget Squeeze

The National Science Foundation will stop operating the Nathaniel B. Palmer icebreaker and slash polar science funding by 70 percent, devastating Antarctic research

Many ships have tried to reach the floating tongue of Thwaites Glacier—a 130-kilometer-wide conveyor belt of ice that slides off West Antarctica's coast and splinters into the sea. Thwaites is rapidly destabilizing, and precise mapping of the seafloor and ocean currents surrounding it are urgently needed to know how much damage the crumbling glacier and resulting sea-level rise could do to coasts worldwide. Only one vessel—the U.S. research icebreaker Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP)—has successfully penetrated the area's phalanx of sea ice and billion-metric-ton icebergs to reach a critical location on Thwaites, widely considered the world's most dangerous glacier. The NBP has made about 200 research cruises to Antarctica in the past 30 years, in many cases reaching places never before visited. But if the Trump administration has its way, this will all come to an end in October.

The NBP's expeditions along remote parts of the Antarctic coast have gathered voluminous data that are critical to U.S. interests. If the Thwaites Glacier were to implode, it could raise the average global sea level by 65 centimeters, and it could potentially trigger wider Antarctic ice sheet collapse that could raise global sea level by more than three meters. Marine science shows that a disproportionate brunt of that rise would inundate the Gulf of Mexico and eastern U.S. coasts. Frequent measurements in Antarctica's remote locations are needed to project how quickly this might happen. Expeditions also monitor marine ecosystems that are rapidly shifting as a result of climate change and affecting the large commercial fisheries in surrounding waters.

Yet Antarctic science experts and officials told me that the administration is imposing such severe budget cuts on the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) that the organization has no realistic option but to terminate its lease for the NBP after 30 years. The U.S. is “losing the only research [icebreaker it has] in the Southern Hemisphere,” says Michael Jackson, the NSF's former section head for Antarctic sciences, who left in December. A replacement vessel—if one is even funded—“will probably take 10 years to build,” he says.

This latest move caps what feels like a major U.S. retreat from Antarctica, says Theodore Scambos, a polar glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. For 27 years, the U.S. had operated two research icebreakers in the region. But in 2024 NSF dropped its lease for the smaller of the two craft because of budget shortfalls. That and the impending loss of the NBP marks “a general decline of America in the science and exploration fields,” Scambos says. “And I hate that.”

This loss will have widespread consequences, according to a wide range of scientists, logistics experts, former NSF officials and former diplomats interviewed for this story. It will hamstring U.S. influence in the Antarctic at a time when geopolitical competition and resource exploitation are intensifying in the region. It will also undermine scientists' ability to monitor rapid changes in Thwaites and other remote areas—at the very moment climate impacts on the continent are accelerating.

Researchers first learned of the NBP's situation on May 30, when the Trump administration released its full fiscal year 2026 budget request for NSF to Congress. The termination was buried in a single sentence on page 102 of the 222-page document. The budget request also stipulated a 70 percent funding cut for polar science research projects overall. “None of us saw that coming,” says Patricia Yager, a polar marine biologist at the University of Georgia, who called the move “shocking.” In response to a request for comment from Scientific American, an NSF spokesperson confirmed via e-mail that NSF had proposed terminating the lease of the NBP in Trump's 2026 fiscal year budget request but provided little additional information.

Although the U.S. Coast Guard has three icebreakers—Polar Star, Healy and the newly commissioned Storis, a former commercial icebreaker—none can fill NBP's role. Healy is continually committed to Arctic duties; sending it to Antarctica and back to do even a single day of scientific work would require 60 days of travel. Storis, which has a troubled history, will also be used in the Arctic. And Polar Star is simply not equipped for the kind of research the NBP does.

“The Palmer is the most amazing research tool that we have; there's nothing like it anywhere in the world,” Yager says. It can plow through meter-thick sea ice at three knots with little more than gentle side-to-side rocking. And it can remain at sea for 65 days, a vital capability given that a round trip to Thwaites takes nearly two weeks from the nearest port. Waiting for vast rafts of sea ice and icebergs to shift and open a passage can add many more days.

When the NBP is in Antarctic waters, it continuously collects data. Multibeam sonar captures a three-dimensional map of the seafloor, revealing features such as undersea canyons that influence the stability of coastal glaciers. Another sonar system traces sediment layers below the seafloor, which can provide important records of past climate periods. Even in rough seas and high winds, the ship's dynamic positioning system allows it to hover within a few feet of its intended location while technicians do the delicate work of collecting sediment cores or piloting remote-operated submersibles on the seafloor.

The NBP can carry and launch two helicopters, which proved decisive during a 2010 cruise, allowing researchers to leapfrog over impassable sea ice and install instruments for monitoring crustal movements and glacial retreat as far as 200 kilometers away.

The impending loss of the NBP means five Antarctic missions, slated for October 2025 through April 2026, now hang in limbo. The NSF is scrambling for ways to salvage at least some of them. For example, the agency might send the University of Alaska Fairbanks's Arctic research vessel Sikuliaq all the way down to Antarctica in January to perform a major ecological survey that has been conducted annually since 1999. The survey covers 2,000 kilometers along the Antarctic Peninsula's coast and out past the lip of the continental shelf. It measures the abundance of krill and phytoplankton—which anchor the region's ecosystem—and monitors deep ocean currents. In recent decades this survey has revealed important changes in ocean mixing that have caused the winter sea ice season in this relatively temperate section of Antarctica to shorten by roughly 100 days a year.

But the Sikuliaq is already in high demand in the Arctic, for up to a dozen expeditions per year. And compared with the NBP, it has fewer berths for scientists, can spend fewer days at sea and has more limited ice-breaking capabilities—effectively excluding it from Thwaites and other heavily iced sections of the Antarctic coastline.

A few other countries have research icebreakers, including the U.K., Germany, Australia, South Korea and China. It is possible that a couple U.S. researchers could occasionally find ride-along spots. But that may not advance U.S. research priorities, Scambos says: “You're not going to get somebody else's icebreaker to bring you and 20 of your colleagues and undertake a major mission that has U.S. research interest behind it.” The NSF spokesperson stated that the agency “has started the process to identify vessels and partnerships to continue support of marine science.”

A new icebreaker that would eventually replace the NBP is in early design stages, but it would take a decade to build. The work on this new Antarctic research vessel has been moving slowly for a variety of reasons, even prior to the start of the current Trump administration. The NSF spokesperson stated that the agency “has paused source selection activities” for the next stage of development.

Since the 1950s the U.S. has maintained a larger scientific presence on the Antarctic continent than any other nation, by way of research stations, ships, remote air transport and exploratory teams that drive vehicles in long traverses across the ice sheet. For now, NSF plans to try to keep operating the three U.S. land bases in Antarctica—the Palmer, McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott South Pole stations—because the harsh environment would cause them to rapidly deteriorate if they were not staffed.

But spending an ensuing decade without a research icebreaker could have major geopolitical consequences. Antarctica is Earth's largest remaining territory not unilaterally controlled by any particular nation. The U.S. has long backed the Antarctic Treaty, under which nations set aside any territorial land claims they've made and reserve the continent for scientific research. If international commitment to the treaty ever faltered, however, nations might pursue territorial claims on the continent, and those claims would be bolstered by having maintained research stations, communications hubs, deep water ports and air transport and driving routes. “Operations and logistics are 100 percent necessary for U.S. national security interests,” says William Muntean III, a former senior adviser for Antarctic affairs and a deputy representative for the U.S. State Department to the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

The scientific research conducted there is a fundamental part of that equation. “In the Antarctic Treaty System,” Muntean says, “knowledge is what equals power.” That's because the rules of play for Antarctica and its surrounding seas are constantly negotiated and monitored by more than two dozen countries with research stations there—and any negotiations become especially heated when it comes to resource extraction. For years commercial vessels have plied the coastal seas for Antarctic toothfish (sold in restaurants as “sea bass”) and krill. The U.S. and a handful of other countries have sought to establish several marine protected areas around the continent where fishing would be prohibited, but they have encountered resistance from Russia and China. Negotiations often hinge on data collected from research vessels, such as those that document changes in ecosystems. In this way, Muntean says, “knowing what is actually happening in Antarctica gives a country the ability to then influence” what happens.

Right now the NBP remains moored at the main pier in Punta Arenas in southern Chile—its standard departure point for Antarctica. The ship's fate is on hold until early September, when Congress returns from recess. “The budget request is always just a policy document,” says Alexandra Isern, a former assistant director of the NSF. In the NSF's pending request, she says, the Trump administration is putting “a line in the sand” for what it wants.

Funding bills that were sitting in Congress before recess add confusion. Senate bill 2354, which passed out of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies in mid-July, appears to restore full funding to the NSF. The corresponding House bill restores roughly two thirds of the proposed cuts. Isern says “members [of Congress] are big supporters of the Antarctic program,” but neither of those bills mentions the NBP or the new icebreaker intended to replace it. Jackson fears that Congress will cave to pressure from the Trump administration and neither the NBP nor the other polar research funding will be saved.

In the meantime, polar researchers across the U.S. continue to prepare for science missions that may or may not happen. Some have already shipped their scientific gear south to Chile in case their cruise happens after all. Others will have to do so in the coming weeks, before Congress returns.

Amid the uncertainty, Oscar Schofield, a biological oceanographer at Rutgers University, sees a clear message. The administration is already stripping climate data from government websites, preparing to halt EPA regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and quietly discussing plans to scuttle a state-of-the-art NASA satellite that monitors carbon dioxide—allowing the spacecraft to burn up in the atmosphere. Canceling the NBP, he says, looks like “a political decision of not wanting to support climate change research.”

In this decision, Schofield sees an important lever of soft power being abandoned. “Since World War II,” he says, “there was always a strong belief that if the U.S. had the strongest scientists and the strongest engineers, it would serve national security.” Those generational investments, he says, are now being undone.

They were around before everything from Saturn's rings to flowering plants to trees.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

To say sharks are ancient is a behemoth of an understatement. They evolved around 450 million years ago, before Saturn's rings, the Pleiades cluster, too many exoplanets to name, and the North Star came into existence. During the stretch of astronomical time sharks have existed, the Solar System has fully orbited the core of the Milky Way twice.

Sharks are thought to have emerged late during the Ordovician period—an epoch during which the continents that formed the supercontinent Gondwana would begin to shift into what would become Pangaea. During that era, Earth was an almost alien planet. The seas were rife with bizarre forms of life such as trilobites, crinoids, moss-like bryozoans, shelled cephalopods known as ellesmocerids, and conodonts (the ancestors of hagfish). Land plants had just begun to appear after transitioning out of water. Trees (in the form of progynmosperms) would eventually come around, beginning to grow anywhere from 30 to 100 million years after sharks came into existence, but flowering plants would not bloom for another 230 million years. 

Even dinosaurs only began to roam Earth during the Triassic, about 243 million years ago—they evolved well after sharks and went extinct just a few hundred million years later. Us humans have only been wandering the planet for around 300,000 years, making sharks over a thousand times older than us. These toothy elasmobranchs have also survived mass extinction after mass extinction—all five of them.

So... how did they do it? How did sharks manage to remain so unchanged and thriving      through destructions of apocalyptic proportions? The End-Permian Mass Extinction, or The Great Dying, took out 96% of marine life. 

It turns out, sharks are highly adaptable—enough so that it saved them from annihilation by everything from sulfurous volcanic gases that acidified the oceans to the massive Chixculub asteroid impact that ended non-avian dinosaurs. Sharks lurk in the dark depths, the shallows, and everywhere in between. When an immense amount of oxygen was choked out of the oceans towards the end of the Permian period, they were able to easily move to more oxygenated areas and occupy different niches. If one species of prey died out, sharks would just hunt another. 

While sharks have certainly evolved over the years, the prototype of the body plan that would give them an edge was established early on. Their skeletons are made entirely of cartilage and much lighter than bone, giving them more buoyancy and requiring less energy from them to swim than bony fish (which are more prone to sinking and need to expend more energy to stay afloat). Shark skin is protected by dermal denticles—overlapping hard plates that reduce drag to facilitate swimming. Those iconic jaws and teeth are assets that allow sharks to devour prey larger than they are so as to not need to refuel as often.  

Sharks aren't alone in their ancient-ness, however. There are other creatures that have not changed too drastically over eons. Crocodilians, for instance, haven't seen much change in over 200 million years, with fossils from their earliest periods of existence showing remarkable morphological similarities to species that exist today. The tuatara—a reptile that is often understandably mistaken for a lizard—looks much like it did 190 million years ago. Coelacanths and nautiluses are both leftovers from prehistoric seas. If a body plan continues to be successful, it might still evolve, but it will remain mostly the same. 

Not only have sharks as a group been around longer than stars and planets, but some individual species live unbelievably long lives. The oldest known Greenland shark had already lived almost 400 years when it was studied in 2016. If it was walking on land, it would remember Shakespeare.Hey—if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Zipf's law of abbreviation explains how commonly spoken words tend to be shorter. The idea is so intuitive, birds appear to use it, too.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Birdsong is an indelible instrument in the orchestra of nature, alongside rustling leaves, roiling waves, and the gentle hum of myriad invertebrates. And birds will use those songs for a variety of reasons—a lilting chirp attracts a mate, while a brassy screech warns of nearby predators. Similar to humans, language is central to all bird species, and even though we're separated from these feathered friends by some 320 million years of evolution, birds have apparently picked up some linguistic tricks similar to our own. 

A new study led by scientists at the University of Manchester shows that much like humans, birds follow a linguistic law known as Zipf's law of abbreviation (ZLA), or the brevity law. Discovered by American linguist George Kingsley Zipf in 1945, the law describes the negative correlation between word length and usage frequency. For example, the most commonly spoken words in English (the, of, and, a, to, etc...) are generally shorter than less common words, such as antidisestablismentarianism. This is broadly true across all human languages, and University of Manchester's Tucker Gilman—lead author of the new paper in the journal PLOS Computational Biology—believes the same can be said for birds. 

“We know that birds and humans share similarities in the genes and brain structures involved in learning to communicate but this is the first time we've been able to detect a consistent pattern of ZLA across multiple bird species,” Gilman said in a press statement. “There's still a lot more work to be done but this is an exciting development.”

One major difficulty in establishing ZLA in bird species is that birds have a much smaller vocabularies than humans, and types of vocal expressions can vary wildly among species.

So, to help make the analysis easier, the team relied on a new open-source computational tool called ZLAvian. But first, the team developed a new method for analyzing birdsong on the individual level rather than the population level. Then, Gilman and his team analyzed 600 birdsongs across 11 populations that included seven different species, including the California thrasher, redthroat, black-headed grosbeak, sage thrasher, Cassin's vireo, western tanager, and gray strikethrush. 

They found that when comparing vocalizations across populations, a stronger ZLA pattern emerged than the one that popped up when analyzing songs within a single population.

“Studying ZLA in birdsong is far more complex than in human language,” study co-author Rebecca Lewis, a conservation scientist at Chester Zoo in the U.K., said in a press statement. “Our research has taught that it's important to look across a wide range of species when looking for language patterns and we hope ZLAvian will make it easier for other researchers to explore these patterns in  more birds but also other animals in the future.”

This isn't the first study to apply the brevity law to birds. In February of 2020, researchers led by the Equipe de Neuro-Ethologie Sensorielle of the University of Lyon/Saint-Etienne found that southern African Jackass penguins (named for their braying, donkey-like calls and not their personalities) also followed Zipf's law as well as another linguistic rule known as Menzerath-Altmann Law, which states that intricate vocalizations are more likely composed of brief sounds than words with less vowels (i.e. “complimentary” vs “scrounged”). 

“The laws seem to reflect something deeper and more general about communication and information,” Chris Kello, a linguist expert from UC Davis, told The Guardian at the time.

It appears that the exploration of that deeper connection is just getting started.

Forest age transitions are critical in shaping the global carbon balance, yet their influence on carbon stocks and fluxes remains poorly quantified. Here we analyse global forest age dynamics from 2010 to 2020 using the Global Age Mapping Integration v2.0 dataset, alongside satellite-derived aboveground carbon (AGC) and atmospheric inversion-derived net CO2 flux data. We reveal widespread declines in forest age across the Amazon, Congo Basin, Southeast Asia and parts of Siberia, primarily driven by stand-replacing disturbances such as fire and harvest, leading to the replacement of older forests by younger stands. Meanwhile, forests in China, Europe and North America experienced net ageing. Globally, stand replacement resulted in substantial AGC losses, with old forests (>200 years, ~98.0 MgC ha−1) transitioning to younger, carbon-poor stands (<20 years, ~43.5 MgC ha−1), leading to a net AGC loss of ~0.14 PgC per year. Despite this, regions with high rates of young stands replacing old forests exhibited a temporary strengthening of the carbon sink, driven by the rapid regrowth of these young stands. Crucially, these young forests do not compensate for the long-term carbon storage of old forests. Our findings underscore the importance of protecting old forests while optimizing forest management strategies to maximize carbon gains and enhance climate mitigation.

Key international initiatives, such as the Forest and Land Use Declaration at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26)1, the EU's Nature Restoration Law2, and the Regulation on Deforestation-Free Products3, highlight the critical role of forests in global climate mitigation. In this study, forests encompass natural forests, managed stands and planted tree cover (for example, agroforestry, tree crop and plantations), characterized by at least 5 metres height4. Forests are essential to Earth's carbon cycle, acting as carbon sinks by absorbing about −3.5 ± 0.4 (where − denotes a net carbon gain) petagrams of carbon annually (PgC per year) in the 2010s5. Effectively managing and conserving these forests is crucial for mitigating climate change, especially given the decline in forest resilience under climate change6.

Several processes, including deforestation, degradation, afforestation, natural disturbances, management practices and regrowth, influence the distribution of forest ages worldwide7. These factors, in turn, affect the forests' capacity to sequester carbon8. European forests, for instance, have consistently acted as carbon sinks9 due to their recovery from extensive clear-cutting after World War II10. Their growth exceeds harvest removals and natural mortality9,11, although the European carbon sink has shown a recent decline12. In regions such as the Amazon Basin, old forests were once ‘hotspots' of younger forests, shaped substantially by ancient civilization activities13. Recent regional transformations have created a diverse mosaic of forest age classes (Fig. 1a,b). Complex interactions between stand-replacement events, regrowth following disturbances, afforestation and the natural ageing of established forests drive shifts in forest age distributions. These factors collectively contribute to ecological transformations in forest landscapes. Yet the implications of these changes on the global carbon cycle remain unresolved14.

a,b, Average forest age for 2010 and 2020 at a one-degree pixel resolution (a) and the total area of each forest age class for 2010 (blue) and 2020 (green) (b). The total area represents the median values across the 20 ensemble members, with error bars in b indicating the 5% and 95% quantiles of the total area across the ensemble. c, The forest age difference map between 2020 and 2010, relative to the expected 10-year ageing. This map was calculated by subtracting ten years from the difference between 2020 and 2010. A value of zero indicates that forests have aged as expected over the decade, consistent with the gradual maturation of undisturbed forests. Positive values indicate slower-than-expected ageing or ageing stagnation, potentially due to disturbances. By contrast, negative values reflect forests becoming younger, probably due to stand replacement, disturbances or shifts in forest composition favouring younger stands. In a and c, the median estimates across the 20 ensemble members are shown. One-degree grid cells with less than 20% forest cover have been masked.

Traditional methods, such as national forest inventories and research plot measurements, offer valuable insights into local forests but have limited spatial and temporal coverage. Several factors constrain their effectiveness, including the absence, complexity or limited availability of sample-based inventories in many regions, the infrequency of repeated measurements and the variability in what they measure. These limitations hinder their ability to comprehensively capture global forest dynamics. Atmospheric CO2 flux estimates from inversion techniques offer an integrated view of biosphere–atmosphere carbon exchange, considering various sources and sinks across different spatial and temporal scales. Yet, their coarse spatial resolution, typically around 110 km, limits their ability to distinguish between forests and non-forests or accurately capture the different dynamics of forests. Additionally, uncertainty in atmospheric transport models and the lack of measurement stations in certain regions limit their regional accuracy15. Efforts to map forest age at global and regional levels have been made16,17,18, but these typically result in static snapshots of forest age distribution. A few satellite-derived maps monitor temporal changes in forest age, but these are limited in space and can only monitor forests since the beginning of the Landsat era19,20. This limitation impedes our ability to effectively track and understand temporal changes in forest age across all age classes.

Using the Global Age Mapping Integration v2.0 (GAMIv2.0) dataset16,21 (Methods), our study analyses changes in forest age distribution from 2010 to 2020 and their implications for the carbon cycle. We integrate forest age maps with independent atmospheric CO2 inversion flux data from the Global Carbon Project22 and European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) satellite-based biomass maps23. Our analysis examines how shifts in forest age, caused by rejuvenation from natural disturbances and clear-cutting, and the natural ageing of established forests affect the net carbon balance. The study has three main objectives: (1) to map global changes in forest age distribution over the last decade, (2) to infer the impact of replacing older, carbon-rich forests with younger ones on the net carbon balance, and (3) to hypothesize the effects of these shifts on aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks under a (1) business-as-usual (BAU) forest management and (2) forest conservation scenario. Our findings highlight the interplay between forest age dynamics and the global carbon cycle, emphasizing the need for strategic, targeted forest management and informed policies to optimize the role of forests in climate change mitigation.

We analysed forest age distribution shifts from 2010 to 2020 using the GAMIv2.0 dataset (Fig. 1a). We focused on this period due to the availability of ESA-CCI biomass data (2010, 2017–2020) and the rising pressure on forests over the past decade24,25. Age classes were defined based on ecological stages (Table 1). From 2010 to 2020, global forest age shifts (Fig. 1b) were driven by stand replacement and the gradual ageing of established forests (definition in Table 2). Mature (81–200 years) forests increased by \(+{0.08}_{+0.05}^{+0.11}\) billion hectares \((+{8.0}_{+4.4}^{+12.6} \% )\), whereas young (1–20 years), maturing (21–80 years) and old forests (>200 years) declined by \(-{0.04}_{-0.08}^{-0.01}\) billion hectares \((-{5.2}_{-12.0}^{-1.5} \% ),-{0.02}_{-0.05}^{+0.05}\) billion hectares (\(-{2.7}_{-7.4}^{+7.4} \%\)) and \(-{0.03}_{-0.04}^{-0.02}\) billion hectares (\(-{2.6}_{-3.3}^{-2.1} \%\)), respectively (Extended Data Table 1). Regional variations are noteworthy, though (Extended Data Fig. 1). For instance, the total area of young forests increased in Eurasian boreal from \({0.039}_{0.038}^{0.042}\) billion hectares in 2010 to \({0.058}_{0.058}^{0.059}\) billion hectares in 2020 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). By contrast, young forests remained relatively stable in European forests, with approximately \({0.036}_{0.032}^{0.042}\) billion hectares in 2010 and \({0.037}_{0.035}^{0.041}\) billion hectares in 2020 (Extended Data Fig. 1d). This stability suggests a balance between young forests maturing into older age classes and stand-replacement processes despite ongoing disturbances26. GAMIv2.0 estimates this relationship using a nonlinear model that considers the effects of local biogeographic and climatic conditions, enabling the representation of non-monotonic biomass accumulation across age classes (Extended Data Fig. 2). However, our analysis does not fully capture the impact of forest management practices on the forest age–biomass relationship. Consequently, shifts between age classes may be biased, especially in regions with substantial management influence on forest dynamics (Supplementary Fig. 1). To address this, we binned the age classes by 20 years, which smooths out variability and reduces sensitivity to errors in age estimation. Whereas this approach captures broader trends and minimizes noise from management-induced variations, it may mask the finer-scale impacts of different management practices. Therefore, more comprehensive forest management data are crucial to enhancing the accuracy and reliability of these models.

The reduction in young forests is probably due to their progression to older stages, outpacing the development of young forests through frequent forest clearings and afforestation. Additionally, the saturation of afforestation programmes in countries such as China27, initiated in the 1980s and 1990s, and the possible exhaustion of old forests suitable for cutting in Southeast Asia due to increased protection efforts28 may have contributed to this reduction. We observe an increase in the global area of forests aged between 21 and 40 years by approximately +0.03 billion hectares (+17%) over 2010–2020 (Extended Data Table 1). The increase could be a response to prior variations in natural or human-induced disturbances, such as clear-cutting, leading initially to an increase in this age class. These dynamics indicate a more complex forest regrowth pattern29, where young forests mature and recover from earlier disturbances. Multiple factors, including the natural ageing of younger forests, enhanced conservation efforts and a shift towards sustainable practices such as thinning, probably drive the increase in mature forests. Additionally, land abandonment and migration to urban areas may indirectly contribute to this trend. The decline of old forests is alarming because it suggests the loss of the oldest and most ecologically valuable forest stands, vital for their substantial carbon storage capabilities and rich biodiversity. These forests not only sequester large amounts of carbon but also enhance the recovery and growth of nearby degraded forests through processes such as seed dispersal and the creation of stable microclimates20. This underscores the critical importance of preserving old forests.

Beyond global changes in forest age distribution (Fig. 1b), we identified contrasting local and regional forest age transitions (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). In regions such as Amazonia, the Congo Basin and Southeast Asia, marked decreases in forest age were evident, with variations at the one-degree pixel level showing up to 30% changes since 2010. Specifically, forests in South America and tropical Asia experienced net age decreases of \(-{4.7}_{-6.2}^{-3.4}\) years (mean age of \({251.9}_{237.2}^{260.2}\) years in 2010, shifting to \({247.1}_{233.9}^{254.3}\) years in 2020) and \(-{7.3}_{-10.0}^{-5.0}\) years (mean age of \({139.4}_{121.2}^{152.5}\) years in 2010, shifting to \({132.4}_{116.4}^{142.3}\) years in 2020), respectively (Supplementary Table 1). This trend is primarily attributed to increasing stand-replacing disturbances and mortality30,31, indicating a shift towards younger forest stands and the replacement of old forests. Traditional activities such as slash-and-burn agriculture also contributed to this trend in the Amazon Basin32. Whereas young forests grow faster27, their regrowth does not fully compensate for the carbon loss from older forests28. Transitions to younger stands often involve associated emissions fluxes—from direct emissions due to fire to delayed emissions resulting from increased substrate availability following the harvest of litter. In North America, especially in the Pacific Northwest, a mosaic of older stands and areas of stand replacement followed by regrowth is evident, probably influenced by clear-cutting, a high-burning frequency regime and other natural disturbances, such as insect outbreaks33. Forests in the North American boreal region experienced a net age increase of \(+{8.9}_{+8.8}^{+9.0}\) years (mean age of \({101.6}_{85.7}^{111.9}\) years in 2010, shifting to \({110.5}_{94.6}^{120.7}\) years in 2020). The age increase is only marginally lower than the expected net ten-year increase if no disturbances have occurred. It suggests that disturbances were relatively limited in this region, allowing the forests to age naturally. We also observed that local patches of Canadian forests were getting younger, probably related to recent fire activity34. These localized disturbances indicate that while the overall impact on forest ageing was minimal, specific areas experienced substantial shifts in forest age distribution. Siberian forests, suspected to harbour an important fraction of the global carbon sink12, predominantly sustained their older age class (that is, forests in Eurasian boreal regions showed a mean age of \({108.0}_{89.0}^{116.5}\) years in 2010, shifting to a mean age of \({113.6}_{95.1}^{122.0}\) years in 2020). However, substantial transitions towards younger forests (approximately 0.09 billion hectares, 7.2% of the Eurasia boreal region) indicate localized impacts from logging, increased wildfire events35 and tree recruitment failure after fire36.

In China, extensive reforestation and afforestation programs since the 1980s37 have led to substantial shifts in the forest age, with younger planted forests maturing. As part of these large-scale afforestation efforts, the forest area in southern China increased from 9% to 35% between 1986 and 2018, reflecting a marked expansion in forest cover following the implementation of these policies37. These efforts have contributed to the overall net ageing of forests in Eurasia temperate by \(+{7.7}_{+6.4}^{+8.2}\) years, from a mean age of \({44.5}_{36.5}^{53.2}\) years in 2010 to \({52.5}_{42.9}^{60.4}\) years in 2020 (Supplementary Table 1). In southwestern Australia, frequent wildfires have led to younger age classes, probably due to increased turnover or the severity of recent fire events34. Overall, forests in Australia aged by \(+{2.1}_{-0.3}^{+3.4}\) years (a mean age of \({67.7}_{55.8}^{88.0}\) years in 2010, shifting to a mean age of \({69.9}_{57.9}^{87.7}\) years in 2020). This suggests that while fire events have caused localized rejuvenation, other areas have aged relatively undisturbed. Conversely, the Miombo woodlands have maintained consistent fire regimes34, resulting in relatively unchanged turnover and gross primary productivity38. This stability indicates an adaptation to the prevailing fire regime, which preserves the understory and maintains the overall forest structure. In South America, forests outside the Amazonia, such as the Atlantic forests, have experienced a decrease in native forest cover due to human activities and disturbances. However, recent conservation efforts have led to some recovery39. This combination of factors has resulted in a slight net age increase in the temperate forests of South America by \(+{3.9}_{+1.2}^{+6.3}\) years (mean age of \({87.4}_{51.6}^{110.1}\) years in 2010, shifting to a mean age of \({91.0}_{57.7}^{110.5}\) years in 2020).

European forests, covering around 33% of the continent, are experiencing complex age dynamics due to management and natural disturbances, such as fire, drought and insect outbreaks since 201040,41. Despite these disturbances, forests are generally ageing (mean age of \({81.5}_{72.1}^{91.2}\) years in 2010, shifting to a mean age of \({89.5}_{80.3}^{98.9}\) years in 2020, that is, \(+{8.0}_{+7.7}^{+8.2}\) years), except in areas such as Portugal, where large fires have led to younger forests34. Climate-induced disturbances and subsequent salvage logging substantially impact northern and central Europe's boreal coniferous and dry forests in the Iberian Peninsula42. Consistent management and stable harvest rates43 suggest that drastic forest age shifts due to human management are unlikely. However, intensified disturbances or increased harvesting could alter the future age structure of European forests, potentially amplifying the reported saturation of the European forest carbon sink44. The net ageing trend in Eurasian boreal forests (that is, forests aged by \(+{5.7}_{+5.4}^{+6.2}\) years), especially in western Russia, is mainly due to large-scale forest abandonment since 1990, a scale surpassing the European forest area45.

Our analysis of global forest age shifts reveals distinct regional patterns, with a mix of undisturbed ageing (Fig. 2a) (\({3.21}_{2.84}^{3.46}\) billion hectares) and stand-replaced forests (Fig. 2b) (\({0.23}_{0.16}^{0.31}\) billion hectares) (Table 2 provides definitions, and Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4 provide a summary of statistics). This variation across regions underscores the complex interplay (Supplementary Fig. 2) of natural processes and human influences (Fig. 2d) in shaping the age distributions of forests. Regionally, stand-replaced forests cover the largest absolute areas in tropical Asia (\({0.26}_{0.22}^{0.28}\) of total stand-replaced forest fraction, \({0.059}_{0.040}^{0.070}\) billion hectares), northern Africa (\({0.22}_{0.11}^{0.25}\) of total stand-replaced forest fraction, \({0.048}_{0.018}^{0.067}\) billion hectares) and South America tropical (\({0.11}_{0.10}^{0.13}\) of total stand-replaced forest fraction, \({0.026}_{0.020}^{0.030}\) billion hectares) (Supplementary Table 3). By contrast, undisturbed ageing forests are primarily located in South America tropical (\({0.20}_{0.20}^{0.21}\) of total undisturbed ageing forest fraction, \({0.64}_{0.63}^{0.64}\) billion hectares), Eurasia boreal (\({0.17}_{0.17}^{0.17}\) of total undisturbed ageing forest fraction, \({0.54}_{0.54}^{0.54}\) billion hectares), Europe (\({0.10}_{0.10}^{0.11}\) of total undisturbed ageing forest fraction, \({0.32}_{0.32}^{0.32}\) billion hectares) and North America temperate (\({0.092}_{0.090}^{0.092}\) of total undisturbed ageing forest fraction, \({0.29}_{0.28}^{0.29}\) billion hectares) (Supplementary Table 3), primarily characterized by a mix of forests often subject to management (for example, selective harvesting) and unmanaged forests (Fig. 1d). Due to its vast forest extent, South America tropical contains substantial absolute areas of both stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forests, making both classes particularly prevalent in the region.

a,b, Spatial distribution of undisturbed ageing (a) and stand-replaced forest fraction (b) at one-degree pixel size. c,d, The forest age pre-stand-replacement (c) and the total area of forest management types46 (d) are also shown across the 11 TRANSCOM-land regions (Supplementary Fig. 3). Unmanaged/intact forests are regenerating forests without any signs of management (including primary forests). Naturally regenerated forests are forests that have regenerated without signs of management (for example, logging, clear-cuts). Plantation forests are considered to have a rotation time of up to 15 years. In a–c, the median estimates of the 20 members are shown. The error bars in c represent the 5th and 95th percentiles of the forest age pre-stand-replacement quantiles across the 20 members. One-degree grid cells with less than 20% forest cover have been masked. NA, North American; SA, South America.

Boreal forests typically have an average pre-stand-replacement age of approximately 120 years (\({123.75}_{99.51}^{132.48}\) years and \({113.05}_{96.00}^{122.79}\) years for Eurasia boreal and North American boreal, respectively) (Fig. 2c). By contrast, forests in the Northern Hemisphere's temperate regions are replaced at younger ages. Management in these temperate regions, which usually involves naturally regenerated and planted forests, results in an average replacement age of \({94.50}_{78.94}^{102.87}\) years in Europe and \({95.74}_{80.64}^{101.63}\) years in North America (Fig. 2c). This variability is influenced by regional rotation lengths, with areas such as northern Spain, Portugal (that is, fast-growing species, such as Eucalyptus, feed into fast rotation forestry projects), Les Landes, Sweden and Finland having shorter rotation periods (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). By contrast, other forests are harvested at an age over 100 years (Extended Data Fig. 3c). We observed short regeneration cycles in Eurasia's temperate (\({33.55}_{21.84}^{39.58}\) years) and South American temperate (\({58.07}_{38.46}^{75.47}\) years) forests. This forest age pre-stand replacement is probably influenced by frequent fires34 and plantation forestry in these regions (Fig. 2d), where the typical rotation period is up to 15 years (ref. 46). In the South American tropics, stand replacement often occurs in older forests, averaging \({190.71}_{166.29}^{215.73}\) years, including old forests over 300 years old, usually characterized by continuous recruitment, though with considerable local variation. The age variability before stand-replacement in South America's tropical region suggests a mix of deforested old forests and young secondary forests harvested and burned before maturity20 or part of a slash-and-burn agricultural system32. The scenario is more complex in northern (\({91.97}_{78.28}^{106.22}\) years) and southern (\({78.92}_{65.99}^{97.57}\) years) Africa regions, which experienced rapid replacement of young forests. These regions experience regular disturbances, primarily from fires34, which can rapidly replace young forests. However, these fires do not always lead to complete stand replacement. Instead, they often leave some trees unburned, especially in lower-intensity or sub-canopy fires. Additionally, in some forest ecosystems, the lower tree density per hectare in certain areas47 may limit the fire severity, reducing the likelihood of complete stand replacement. This highlights post-fire regeneration processes that differ from those of stand-replacing fires, allowing some trees to survive and creating a mix of age structures within the forests.

We observe a distinctive spatial pattern in the distribution of stand-replaced forests across various age classes as of 2010 (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). Forests that were already young (that is 0–20 years) before stand replacement—covering \({0.14}_{0.083}^{0.20}\) billion hectares and accounting for \({58.97}_{46.14}^{66.55}\)% of all stand-replaced forests— are broadly distributed but primarily concentrated in tropical regions (for example, South America's tropics, tropical Asia and northern Africa) and the Eurasian temperate zone (Fig. 3a). This widespread area of young forests being replaced by new stands suggests a high turnover rate, probably driven by plantations (Fig. 2d) and natural disturbances, such as fire events. Maturing forests (that is 20–80 years) replaced by younger stands constitute \({12.51}_{9.97}^{15.96}\)% of the total stand-replaced forest areas. Mature forests (that is 81–200 years) that have undergone stand replacement, where younger stands have replaced previously mature forests, account for \({14.45}_{10.58}^{18.86}\)% of the total stand-replaced forest area. Their distribution (Extended Data Fig. 3c) is sparser than that of younger forests, with large but dispersed patches in regions such as North American, European and Siberian forests. This pattern may indicate less frequent replacement events in mature forests, suggesting a period of relative stability or reduced human influence (Fig. 2d). Old forests (that is >200 years) were the least likely to undergo stand replacement, representing only \({14.38}_{11.78}^{19.92}\)% of the total and are primarily located in tropical regions (Extended Data Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 6a). By contrast, forests undisturbed during the study period display a more balanced distribution across different age classes: young (\({19.01}_{16.56}^{20.59}\)%), maturing (\({18.71}_{16.22}^{20.76}\)%), mature (\(3{0.80}_{26.30}^{32.98}\)%) and old forests (\({32.23}_{30.06}^{34.41}\)%) (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Fig. 3b).

Using the ESA-CCI biomass map for 202023, we observe apparent differences in AGC stocks where younger stands replaced carbon-rich older forests from 2010 to 2020 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 5). After replacement, the AGC stock of stand-replaced forests varies by prior age class: ~2.3 MgC ha−1 in young forests, increasing to 15.2 MgC ha−1 in maturing forests, 31.1 MgC ha−1 in mature and peaking at 31.9 MgC ha−1 in old forests. These differences reflect two main factors. First, not all biomass is lost during stand-replacement—legacy trees and residual carbon often remain, especially in partially disturbed areas. Second, younger stands replacing old forests usually grow faster due to nutrient-rich soils, existing seed banks and structural legacies, with open canopies enhancing light availability and promoting rapid regrowth48 (Extended Data Fig. 6).

a, AGCs stocks across forest age classes, distinguishing between stand-replaced forests and undisturbed ageing forests, expressed per unit area at a one-degree pixel level. The stand-replaced categories represent the AGC stock of forests at a given age class (young, maturing, mature or old) before stand replacement. b, Net carbon changes for stand-replaced forests across different forest age categories. In a and b, the median values from the 20 biomass realizations are displayed, and the spread represents the spatial variation within a given age class. c, The relationship between the fraction of old forests replaced by young stands (that is, stand-replacement extent) and changes in NEE from inversions between circa 2020 (average of 2019–2021) and 2010 (average of 2009–2011) is shown. The dark solid line represents the linear regression on the ensemble estimates, whereas the dashed grey lines indicate the regressions for the nine individual atmospheric inversion models. One-degree grid cells with less than 20% forest cover have been masked. To smooth the spatial distribution of net CO2 fluxes, we applied a Gaussian filter (length = 500 km, equivalent to approximately four one-degree pixels). This smoothing technique reduces noise in the data and helps minimize the influence of local transport errors. To minimize noise and regional variability due to atmospheric transport errors, all spatial data were aggregated using area-weighted averaging over 5 × 5 grid cells (that is, a coarsening scale of 5° × 5°).

Undisturbed ageing forests store substantially more carbon than recently disturbed ones across all age classes (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 7): ~23.8 MgC ha−1 in young forests, 29.5 MgC ha−1 in maturing forests, 50.5 MgC ha−1 in mature forests and 77.8 MgC ha−1 in old forests. The comparable carbon storage capacity in stand-replaced and undisturbed mature forests suggests that stand replacement often involves partial rather than complete biomass removal through selective logging or natural disturbance. Whereas the GAMIv2.0 product does not capture small-scale degradation or mortality effects, the ESA-CCI biomass map partially reflects these dynamics. This may explain the limited AGC gap observed in mature forests across disturbance types. However, ESA-CCI biomass data also have limitations, particularly in the calibration of AGC estimates from remote sensing observations, as the sensitivity of satellite-derived AGC retrievals decreases with increasing biomass, contributing to uncertainty in high-biomass forests49.

Evaluating total carbon stocks across forest age classes (Supplementary Table 5) reveals that old, undisturbed forests store \({127.39}_{99.20}^{155.14}\) PgC. Conversely, young forests, including those that replaced older stands (\({1.85}_{1.35}^{3.17}\) PgC) and undisturbed ageing forests (\({17.99}_{16.02}^{21.32}\) PgC), collectively stored approximately 20 PgC in 2020 (approximately 9% of the total AGC stocks in 2020). Maturing and mature, undisturbed ageing forests cover large areas (Fig. 3b), substantially contributing to total forest AGC stocks (\({31.29}_{26.40}^{35.68}\) PgC and \({60.51}_{47.32}^{79.34}\) PgC, respectively). The total global AGC stock in 2020 was estimated at ~\({235.75}_{192.50}^{286.11}\) PgC in 2020, aligning with independent datasets but substantially lower than previous estimates5 (~371.5 PgC), probably due to differences in disturbance representation, belowground biomass inclusion and forest definition (for example, a 20% forest fraction filter was applied in our study).

The transition from carbon-rich old forests to younger forests, resulting from stand replacement, substantially reduces the overall carbon storage of these ecosystems (Fig. 4b) and ecosystem function50. Between 2010 and 2020, forests undergoing stand replacement lost \(+{0.38}_{+0.35}^{+0.46}\) PgC yr−1 (where + denotes loss of AGC) (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Despite covering only a small fraction of the global forest area (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3 ), these forests disproportionately influenced AGC losses, particularly where old forests were replaced by young stands, contributing to 0.10–0.16 PgC yr−1 of global AGC loss (~1% of total forest area).

Despite the initial loss of AGC following stand replacement, young forests often transition quickly to a net carbon sink51. This is reflected in a significant correlation between the fraction of old forests (>200 years) replaced by young stands (<20 years) and the 10-year trend in net ecosystem exchange (NEE), based on GAMIv2.0 data and atmospheric inversion estimates from nine Global Carbon Budget 2023 (GCB2023) inversion models22 (Fig. 4c) (R2 = 0.28, slope =−34.32 gC m−2 yr−1 per % yr−1, P < 0.05, N = 134). The negative slope indicates that for each 1% annual increase in the fraction of old forests replaced by young forests, the carbon sink strengthens by 34.32 gC m−2 yr−1. This suggests that regions with a higher proportion of old forests replaced by young forests tend to exhibit a stronger carbon sink. However, this pattern should not be misinterpreted as an argument in favour of stand replacement. The strong carbon sink observed in these areas primarily results from the long, undisturbed period before stand replacement, during which old forests accumulated large amounts of carbon and created conditions that facilitate rapid regrowth52. The time since the previous-to-last disturbance has a critical role in shaping carbon sink strength, as long-undisturbed forests develop favourable soil conditions, structural complexity and nutrient availability that enhance post-disturbance regrowth.

It is also essential to recognize the limitations of this analysis. At the spatial resolution of current atmospheric inversion models (~1°), it is beyond our capacity to disentangle NEE trends across all four age classes robustly. This limitation is particularly pronounced in regions with mixed-age forests and intensive management, where inversion signals integrate fluxes across diverse stand conditions. Whereas exploratory correlations by age class are presented in Extended Data Fig. 8a–c, these should be interpreted cautiously. More interpretable signals may emerge in tropical regions, where large areas of old-growth forest have been replaced by younger stands, resulting in more homogeneous age distributions within inversion grid cells. Still, robust separation of age-specific NEE responses remains challenging at this scale. Accordingly, our main interpretation focuses on the consistent NEE signal linked to old-to-young forest transitions in these areas (Extended Data Fig. 3d), which shows a consistent negative correlation with NEE trends across multiple inversion models (Fig. 4c). Still, broader factors such as CO2 fertilization, temperature shifts and climate variability may also influence NEE trends. While we acknowledge these influences, our analysis isolates the relationship between stand replacement and NEE without attempting to disentangle climate-driven effects.

Young, fast-growing forests can sequester carbon at rates higher than old forests, particularly in tropical regions, where young regrowing forests (<20 years) can absorb CO2 up to 20 times faster than old forests52. Yet they do not recover the AGC stocks of old forests within a meaningful timeframe for climate policy. Complete restoration of species composition can take centuries53,54,55. The ability of forests to accumulate carbon over centuries highlights the importance of preserving old forests, which store far more carbon than young regrowing stands. Although undisturbed ageing forests contribute to long-term carbon storage (Fig. 3b), the net CO2 uptake trends suggest that stand-replacement processes—not just naturally ageing forests—are key drivers of recent flux changes. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that forest harvesting, leading to biomass loss, impacts atmospheric carbon levels in multiple ways. Harvesting does not immediately result in equivalent carbon emissions being released into the atmosphere. Forests continue to assimilate carbon, and the fate of harvested biomass—whether rapidly released through burning, gradually decomposed as coarse woody debris or stored in wood products for a long time—determines the timing and extent of carbon released into the atmosphere. The balance between immediate and delayed carbon release may explain the residuals between the proportion of forests replaced by young stands and net CO2 fluxes (Fig. 4c), which are further influenced by variations in hydrometeorological conditions56.

It is crucial to contextualize the impact of stand replacement on carbon flux dynamics within the broader picture of global forest dynamics. Global forests act as a net carbon sink, particularly in boreal and temperate regions5,57. However, deforestation and land-use conversion increasingly challenge this climate-mitigation role, where forests are permanently lost rather than replaced. In deforestation hotspots, atmospheric inversion data mainly show these areas as net CO2 sources, primarily due to emissions from burning activities. For example, in regions such as the eastern edge of the Amazon, fire-related emissions can exceed the carbon uptake of remaining forests58, reinforcing the dominant role of deforestation in increasing atmospheric CO2. Thus, whereas stand-replacement processes contribute to enhanced CO2 uptake in some regions, they should not be viewed in isolation from the broader issue of forest loss and the protection of old forests. Furthermore, the relationship between old-stand replacement and NEE trends varies across atmospheric inversion models. Whereas five of the nine models indicate a significant negative correlation, others show no clear relationship (Fig. 4c), highlighting uncertainties in top-down CO2 flux estimates59. This variability underscores the need for cautious interpretation when linking stand-replacement processes to regional NEE trends. Nevertheless, the consistent signal across multiple models and spatial windows (Supplementary Fig. 8) supports the conclusion that old forest replacement has been key in shaping recent CO2 flux dynamics.

Our findings emphasize the complex role of forest age transitions in shaping the global carbon balance. Whereas old forests store the highest carbon stocks, young regrowing forests, particularly those replacing old forests, can contribute substantially to CO2 uptake due to rapid biomass accumulation. However, this high sequestration rate primarily results from the favourable conditions left behind by the replaced old forests, including legacy soil carbon, nutrient availability and established seed banks. This does not imply that stand replacement is a viable climate mitigation strategy, as old forests take centuries to develop and cannot be restored within a policy-relevant timeframe. Young forests can never fully replace the long-term carbon storage capacity and ecological functions of old forests. Protecting existing forests remains the most effective and immediate strategy for mitigating climate change60.

To explore the implications of age dynamics for future carbon storage, we projected forest age distributions and AGC stocks to 2050 under two idealized pathways: BAU and a forest conservation scenario that halts stand-replacement after 2030 (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Whereas BAU results in stable AGC stocks due to ongoing turnover, the conservation scenario projects an annual increase in carbon storage of +0.55 to +0.63 PgC yr−1 relative to 2020 levels, primarily in maturing and mature forests. Despite reduced AGC in young stands, total projected AGC by 2050 is higher under conservation (209–306 PgC) than BAU (200–296 PgC), illustrating the mitigation potential of conserving ageing forests. Yet, the modest gain suggests that conservation alone will not be sufficient for achieving large-scale sequestration goals.

It is also crucial to distinguish between young forests emerging from stand replacement and those established through afforestation. Whereas afforestation represents an expansion of forest cover, stand replacement involves the replacement of existing forests, thereby reducing their long-term carbon storage potential. Although afforestation can enhance carbon sequestration27,37, its effectiveness depends on the forest type; planted, homogeneous forests provide fewer benefits for carbon storage, biodiversity and local ecosystem resilience than naturally regenerating forests. Beyond carbon storage, natural forests provide irreplaceable ecosystem and social benefits compared to monoculture plantations. Yet, only 34% of global restoration commitments prioritize natural forests, whereas 45% focus on monocultures61. Our study highlights the need for targeted conservation and forest management policies that strike a balance between preserving old forests and implementing sustainable harvesting and regrowth strategies. We call for targeted management and conservation strategies that carefully consider forest age and type to ensure forests remain functional, land-based systems for mitigating anthropogenic climate change.

We used the ESA-CCI biomass v4 data, which provide estimates of AGB density in woody vegetation for 2010 and 2020 (https://data.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/esacci/biomass/data/agb/maps/v4.0). Those data are derived from a combination of Earth observation data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, Envisat's ASAR instrument and JAXA's Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1 and ALOS-2), along with additional information from Earth observation sources. We calculated the changes in AGB for 2010–2020 by taking the differences between the 2020 and 2010 maps. To quantify the uncertainties in the biomass maps, we generated 20 realizations of the AGB data by introducing controlled perturbations to the mean biomass estimates. Specifically, for each time step and each member of our ensemble, we added a scaled version of the standard deviation of the biomass, with the scaling factor drawn from a normal distribution clipped to the range [−1, 1]. This approach allows us to simulate the natural variability and uncertainty in the biomass data. We then combined these perturbed maps to create a comprehensive dataset representing the possible range of biomass values. This enables us to provide confidence intervals and robust statistical measures of uncertainty in our estimates. The following equation can describe the perturbation applied:

where AGBi,j,k (t) is the perturbed aboveground biomass at location (i, j) and time t for the kth member, μi,j(t) is the mean aboveground biomass, σi,j(t) is the standard deviation of the aboveground biomass and Sk is the scaling factor drawn from a normal distribution \(N(0,\frac{1}{3})\) and clipped to the range [−1,1]. The use \(N(0,\frac{1}{3})\) ensures that the perturbations are centred around zero, introducing symmetric and controlled variability. The standard deviation \(\frac{1}{3}\) moderates the variability to prevent extreme perturbations, thus maintaining the realism of the biomass estimates. Clipping the values to [−1,1] further ensures that the introduced variations are within a reasonable range.

The AGB estimates, expressed as dry organic mass, were converted to AGC using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default carbon fraction of 0.47.

GAMIv2.016,21 is an updated version of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC) forest age product, providing global forest age distributions for 2010 and 2020 at a 100-metre resolution. This version leverages the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to generate data-driven estimates of forest age, integrating over 40,000 forest inventory plots, biomass and height measurements, remote sensing observations and climate data. This multi-variable approach accounts for structural and ecological variations across climatic gradients, ensuring that forest age is not inferred from biomass alone but reflects broader growth patterns (Extended Data Fig. 2). Unlike previous global age products that assume monotonic or simplified growth trajectories, GAMIv2.0 is explicitly designed to represent the full diversity of age–biomass relationships, including saturation and declines in older age classes, across biomes. This improves alignment with patterns observed in ground-based studies and enhances the suitability of the dataset for carbon modelling applications.

A key improvement in GAMIv2.0 is the integration of Landsat-based disturbance history with machine-learning-based forest age estimates. The methodology for mapping time since the last disturbance and afforestation is based on Potapov et al.4 and Hansen et al.62. The process involves the following steps:

Mapping time since last disturbance and afforestation

Last disturbance layer: disturbed forest areas are identified using the ‘forests affected by stand-replacement disturbances or degradation' layer from Potapov et al.4. The Hansen et al.62 dataset is then used to determine the year of forest loss, which is subtracted from 2020 to obtain the time since the last disturbance. Negative values (indicating losses in 2021 and 2022) are masked.

Stable forest layer: the ‘stable forest extent' layer from Potapov et al.4 is used to identify undisturbed forest areas as of 2020.

Forest gain layer (Afforestation): afforested (regrown) forest areas are mapped using the ‘forest extent gain' layer and the canopy height data from 2020.

Integrating Landsat-based and machine-learning-based age estimates

To improve forest age predictions, we merged the Landsat-based time since disturbance estimates with the machine-learning-derived forest age estimates through the following decision rules:

If the Landsat-based time since disturbance is ≤19 years and the machine-learning predicted age is higher, we assign the Landsat-based estimate.

If the Landsat-based time since disturbance is ≤19 years and the machine-learning predicted age is equal to or lower than the Landsat-based estimate, we retain the machine-learning estimate.

If the Landsat-based time since disturbance is ≥20 years, we retain the machine-learning estimate, regardless of its value.

This fusion approach refines the estimation of time since the last stand-replacement event over the past 20 years, addressing biases that tend to overestimate the age of young forests in regrowing or afforested areas (Supplementary Fig. 7). Despite these improvements, some biases remain, including a potential overestimation of young forest age and an underestimation of older forest age. This has important implications for our results: the observed decline in young forests may be less pronounced than suggested, whereas the reduction in older forests could be more substantial.

Addressing uncertainties in age estimates

The age maps were generated using an ensemble approach to account for uncertainties:

Aleatoric uncertainty: different biomass data realizations were incorporated into the model to capture variability in input data.

Epistemic uncertainty: multiple XGBoost models were trained with varying hyperparameter settings to assess variability in model performance and predictions.

By incorporating these uncertainty quantifications, we provide a more robust estimate of forest age distribution. We also derived age-class fraction products at one-degree resolution, categorizing forests into two-decade intervals up to 200 years, followed by 201–300 and >300-year age classes.

The GAMIv2.0 product and its associated uncertainties can be visualized in the following Google Earth Engine app: https://besnardsim.users.earthengine.app/view/globalforestage.

We used the 1 × 1° gridded ‘co2flux' output generated by nine (CAMS, CMS-Flux, CT-NOAA, CTE, CarboScope, IAPCAS, MIROC, NISMON-CO2 and UoE) inversion models within the Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes Project (RECCAP-2)22 (https://meta.icos-cp.eu/objects/FHbD8OTgCb7Tlvs99lUDApO0). These models incorporate CO2 mole fraction measurements from surface stations and total column mole fraction data from satellites. The selected atmospheric inversion models include CAMS, sEXTocNEET, CTE2022, NISMON-CO2, CMS-Flux, UoE, GONGGA, THU and CAMS-Satellite. We adjusted the net carbon fluxes by excluding lateral fluxes from the calculation. Such adjustments included removing riverine carbon export to estuaries and coastal oceans and accounting for carbon transfers in crops and emissions from cement production. By adjusting the data, we aligned the atmospheric inversion findings more closely with the forest age estimates inferred from the GAMIv2.0 product. We masked out non-forested pixels. Finally, atmospheric inversion-based net CO2 fluxes estimates were smoothed with a Gaussian filter while maintaining the total intensity by redistributing values only among valid pixels. The NaN values in the input remain unchanged in the output. This approach uses a Gaussian distribution for intensity redistribution, considering only valid pixels. The filter's smoothing scale is set to a length of 500 km, defining the filter's physical length in kilometres. Sigma for the filter is calculated based on a specified degree of longitude at the equator. This approach effectively smooths the data while respecting its original structure and missing values. We created two net CO2 fluxes, circa 2010 (average between 2009–2011) and 2020 (average between 2019–2021), from which we determined the NEE changes by subtracting the latter from the former.

Estimating changes in forest age distribution between 2010 and 2020 involved several steps using the 100 m GAMIv2.0 product. First, we aggregated the data to a one-degree pixel resolution for 2010 and 2020 using an average resampling method. The resulting datasets provided estimates of the mean forest age at a one-degree scale for both years (Fig. 1a). In parallel, we calculated forest age differences at GAMIv2.0's native resolution (100 m). This difference map was then resampled to a one-degree resolution using the same averaging method to maintain spatial consistency (Fig. 1c). Additionally, we quantified the total area occupied by young (0–20 years old), maturing (21–80 years old), mature (81–200 years old) and old (>200 years old) forests in both 2010 and 2020 (Fig. 1b). This analysis was performed independently for each of the 20 forest age maps. In this study, it is essential to distinguish between forest ageing, which progresses at a constant rate over time, and forest growth, representing changes in biomass accumulation over time. Growth rates vary depending on stand dynamics, disturbance history and environmental conditions, whereas ageing itself remains uniform. However, because GAMI estimates forest age as a function of biomass, canopy height and climate variables, variations in modelled age primarily reflect inferred structural and ecological differences rather than the simple passage of time. This distinction is crucial for correctly interpreting trends in forest age distribution and their implications for carbon dynamics.

We first computed the difference in modelled forest age between 2010 and 2020 at 100-m resolution using the GAMIv2.0 product to classify forests into stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing categories. Undisturbed ageing forests were identified as pixels where the age difference was exactly 10 years, indicating that the forest remained undisturbed and aged naturally over the decade. Stand-replaced forests were identified as pixels where the age difference was less than 10 years, meaning that a stand-replacing disturbance occurred between 2010 and 2020. This includes negative values, where the 2020 forest age is lower than in 2010, reflecting a more recent disturbance that had little time for regrowth to occur.

To further analyse these patterns, we generated two derivative products for stand-replaced forests:

Age difference magnitude—capturing the extent of age reduction due to disturbance.

Binary classification—distinguishing stand-replaced (1) vs non-stand-replaced (0) pixels.

Similarly, we created equivalent products based on an age difference of exactly 10 years for undisturbed ageing forests.

To understand how initial forest age influences disturbance and ageing patterns, we stratified both stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forests into four age classes, using their 2010 GAMIv2.0-estimated age: young forests (0–20 years), maturing forests (21–80 years), mature forests (81–200 years) and old forests (>200 years).

Finally, the age difference and binary classification products were resampled to a one-degree resolution using an average resampling method, enabling large-scale analysis. This process was conducted independently for each of the 20 forest age maps to account for model variability. These resampled products served two purposes: the binary classification was used to compute the fraction of forest pixels in each one-degree grid cell that experienced stand replacement or undisturbed ageing. At the same time, the magnitude of the age difference captured the mean severity of age reduction or gain. These metrics were then used to quantify the spatial extent and intensity of age transitions (for example, Figs. 1c and 2a–c).

First, we analysed carbon stock across forest age classes, focusing on stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forests. This involved partitioning 100-m pixels based on age difference, as previously described, to identify distinct categories of forests that had undergone varying degrees of change over the study period. Each partitioned class was then assigned an estimate of carbon stock. Using an average resampling method, those carbon stock estimate products were resampled to a one-degree pixel resolution. In addition, we estimated the total carbon stock across age classes by multiplying the product of the carbon stock estimates and the area of each age-class partition. This was done independently for the stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forest categories. Similarly, we calculated net carbon stock changes for stand-replaced forests by computing the difference in AGC stocks between 2010 and 2020. Specifically, for each spatial unit, the AGC stock 2020 was subtracted from the AGC stock 2010, yielding the net change over the decade (ΔAGC = AGC2020 − AGC2010). To express these changes in a flux-consistent sign convention, we multiplied the resulting values by −1 so that positive values represent carbon loss (biosphere-to-atmosphere flux, typically due to disturbance or decomposition). By contrast, negative values indicate carbon accumulation (biomass regrowth). This approach ensures consistency with commonly used flux representations while preserving the original stock change information. Finally, we estimate the average annual growth rate across age classes for stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forests as follows:

where n is the number of years between the two measurements. In this case, n = 10 years.

Such a procedure was done independently for the corresponding 20 forest age and biomass maps.

To assess the covariation between forest age shifts and net CO2 flux changes, we analysed the relationship between stand-replacement fractions and changes in NEE derived from atmospheric inversions. To ensure the robustness of our analysis, we extract data within spatial windows of different resolutions (that is, 2° × 2°, 5° × 5° and 10° × 10°) before performing the regression analysis. This spatial window approach ensures that stand-replacement fractions and NEE changes remain spatially coherent within each inversion model. We compute the median stand-replacement fraction (20 members) and corresponding median NEE changes across all available inversion models (nine members) for each spatial window. To assess the robustness of our results, we apply Jackknife resampling, systematically excluding individual NEE inversion members to test their influence on the overall trend.

To explore how changes in forest management could influence future age-class dynamics and AGC storage, we developed projections of forest age distributions to the year 2050 under two hypothetical management scenarios: BAU and forest conservation. These scenarios are inspired by, but do not strictly adhere to, the objectives of global forest policy initiatives, such as the New York Declaration on Forests, which aims to halt natural forest loss by 2030 and restore 350 million hectares of degraded landscapes and forests. We aim to provide a first-order estimate of how AGC stocks might evolve in response to shifts in forest age structures under idealized management pathways. Our projections do not account for climate-driven effects such as CO2 fertilization or altered disturbance regimes.

This scenario assumes that current forest management practices and policies remain unchanged for a period of 30 years. Consequently, the distribution of forest age classes is projected to mirror the pattern observed for the 2010–2020 period. As a result, the forest age structure in 2050 is expected to be similar to the one observed in 2020. To calculate the total carbon storage capacity for this scenario, we use a straightforward method: multiplying the total area of each age class in 2050 by its respective total carbon stock estimate and then dividing this product by the total area of each age class in 2020. In the BAU scenario, the total area of each age class in 2050 is expected to be the same as in 2020. Such carbon stock estimation can be estimated as follows:

Where:

The total area of age-class BAUi, 2050 is the area of the ith age class (in hectares) in 2050.

Total area of age classi, 2020 is the area of the ith age class (in hectares) in 2020.

Total stocki, 2020 is the estimated total carbon stock for the ith age class (in MgC per hectare) in 2020.

Aligning with the objectives of the New York Declaration on Forests, this scenario maintains the continuation of existing management practices until 2030, followed by a period of non-intervention in forest areas up to 2050. The aim is to halt BAU stand replacement by 2030 and allow forests to age naturally thereafter. In this scenario, the forest age-class distribution in 2030 is anticipated to be identical to that of 2020, whereas by 2050, all forests are expected to have matured by an additional 20 years. The total carbon stocks under this scenario are estimated by multiplying each age class's total area in 2050 by its corresponding total carbon stock estimates in 2020. This product will then be divided by the total area of each age class in 2020. The carbon stock changes estimation for the forest conservation scenario can be expressed as follows:

Where:

Total area of age-class conservation2050 is the area of the ith age class (in hectares) in 2050.

Total area of age classi, 2020 is the area of the ith age class (in hectares) in 2020.

Total stocki, 2020 is the estimated total carbon stock for the ith age class (in MgC per hectare) in 2020.

First, to investigate the influence of forest management on the relationship between forest age and biomass (Supplementary Fig. 1), we used mixed-effects models on a global scale. These models included the management category as a fixed effect and geographic coordinates as random effects to capture spatial heterogeneity. This approach allowed us to isolate the role of management while accounting for spatial variability across different regions. To manage regional variability effectively, the analysis was conducted within 2-degree latitude by 2-degree longitude windows, ensuring sufficient data points within each window for robust statistical analysis. The mixed-effects model can be expressed as:

Where:

Biomass is the dependent variable, while management type (managed vs unmanaged) and forest age are fixed effects. Latitude and longitude are random effects that account for spatial variability.

Within each 2-degree latitude by 2-degree longitude window, we extracted the P value of the interaction term between the management category and forest age to assess the influence of management practices on the relationship between forest age and biomass.

Second, we investigated the relationship between forest age and logging fraction (Supplementary Fig. 6). To do so, we used a forest management map46 to calculate a metric related to the logging fraction as follows:

Where:

class 11 – naturally regenerating forest without any signs of management, including primary forests;

class 20 – naturally regenerating forest with signs of management, for example, logging, clear-cuts and so on;

class 31 – planted forests;

class 32 – plantation forests (rotation time up to 15 years);

class 40 – oil palm plantations; and

class 53 – agroforestry.

a–k, Total forest area per age class in 2010 (blue) and 2020 (green) across the eleven TRANSCOM land regions (see Supplementary Fig. 3). Values represent the median estimates across 20 ensemble members, with error bars indicating the 5th and 95th percentiles.

a–k, Relationship between forest biomass and age across hydro-climate zones, based on the GAMI dataset and ESA-CCI biomass v4 data for 2020. The figure illustrates consistent patterns of biomass accumulation with forest aging, reflecting broad ecological trends. Although the GAMI product incorporates ESA-CCI biomass data (see Methods), this comparison independently validates the robustness of the observed growth trajectories.

Spatial distribution of stand-replaced forests that were (a) young (forest age <= 20 years old), (b) intermediate (21–80 years old), (c) mature (81–200 years old), and (d) old forests (forest age > 200 years old) in 2010.

Spatial distribution of undisturbed ageing forests (a) young (forest age <= 20 years old), (b) intermediate (21–80 years old), (c) mature (81–200 years old), and (d) old forests (forest age > 200 years old) in 2010.

Spatial distribution of carbon stocks (in MgC ha-1) in stand-replaced forests (a) young (forest age <= 20 years old), (b) intermediate (21–80 years old), (c) mature (81–200 years old), and (d) old forests (forest age > 200 years old) in 2010. Each pixel represents a median estimate of the 100 m pixels belonging to a specific category within each one-degree pixel.

a–k, Annual growth rates across age classes for forests replaced by young stands (in orange) and undisturbed ageing forests (in green) in each TRANSCOM-Land region. The annual growth rate represents the net change in biomass per year. Stand-replaced forests (orange) correspond to areas where older stands have been replaced by younger forests, which generally exhibit higher growth rates due to their early successional stage. In contrast, undisturbed ageing forests (green) represent forests that continue ageing without stand replacement, typically showing lower growth rates as they approach maturity.

Spatial distribution of carbon stocks (in MgC ha-1) in undisturbed ageing established forests (a) young (forest age <= 20 years old), (b) intermediate (21–80 years old), (c) mature (81–200 years old), and (d) old forests (forest age > 200 years old) in 2010. Each pixel represents a median estimate of the 100 m pixels belonging to a specific category within each one-degree pixel.

Relationship between the fraction of forests replaced by young stands (that is, stand-replacement extent) and changes in net CO2 fluxes between circa 2020 (average of 2019–2021) and 2010 (average of 2009–2011) for young (a), maturing (b), mature (c) and old (d) stand-replaced forests. The dark solid line represents the linear regression on the ensemble estimates, while the dashed grey lines indicate the regressions for the nine individual atmospheric inversion models. To smooth the spatial distribution of net CO2 fluxes, we applied a Gaussian filter (length = 500 km, equivalent to approximately four one-degree pixels). This smoothing technique reduces noise in the data and helps minimise the influence of local transport errors.

Potential total carbon stock (a) in 2050 across age classes for the two scenarios. We also show the forest age class distribution in 2050 (b) under BAU and forest conservation scenarios. The young forest age class include the stand-replaced and undisturbed ageing forests.

Microsoft is building generative AI directly into the cells of Excel, attempting to bring one of the defining apps of the PC revolution into a new generation of computing. 

A new “COPILOT” function for Microsoft's classic spreadsheet program lets users generate, summarize, and analyze data using plain-language prompts inside a cell. 

For example, a product manager with a column of raw customer feedback could type =COPILOT(“What is the sentiment of the comment in cell A2?”) to quickly label each remark as ‘Positive,' ‘Negative,' or ‘Neutral,' without using a chatbot or plugin.

“I just love this,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote on LinkedIn, sharing a demo video. In the 1990s, Nadella was a technical marketing manager for Excel — once showing how the program could pull data from a mainframe into a spreadsheet using Windows NT Server, a capability considered cutting-edge at the time.

The announcement Monday coincided with coordinated release of videos from tech influencers given early access to the tool. Their demos showed examples such as the ability to generate product descriptions, clean messy data by extracting names and phone numbers, and explain complex Excel formulas in plain English.

The move reflects broader attempts by Microsoft and other tech giants, including Google, Adobe, Salesforce and others, to refresh legacy apps with AI features. 

Previous integrations of AI into Excel focused on explaining complex formulas or suggesting data visualizations from the sidelines, acting more as a helpful guide than an active co-worker in the grid.

Microsoft says the feature is rolling out now on Excel for Windows and Mac to Beta Channel users with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses and recent versions of the software. The company says the feature will be available for Excel on the web soon through its Frontier program.

Security company CLEAR is partnering with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to launch new biometric “eGates” at select airports across the country, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, to ease bottlenecks at security checkpoints ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026.

The public-private partnership comes at no cost to taxpayers, CLEAR said in a news release on Tuesday.

The automated eGates — available to CLEAR+ members who opt in — are designed to conduct real-time biometric verification, matching a traveler's facial image with their identity document and boarding pass.

Once identity is confirmed, a traveler passes the gate and proceeds to physical screening, bypassing the TSA podium.

“It's fully integrated. It's one step. And the total transaction time should be between three and six seconds,” CLEAR CEO Caryn Seidman-Becker told Axios.

CLEAR says that it transmits only limited data (live photo, boarding pass, ID photo used for enrollment and identity information), and that it has no access to watchlists, cannot override TSA gate decisions, and does not manually open gates.

The pilot program debuts Tuesday at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), next week at Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA), and the week of Aug. 31 at Sea-Tac Airport (SEA). CLEAR plans to expand eGate implementation across more than 30 airports in the next year, according to The Points Guy.

More than 20 million international visitors are expected to fly to the U.S. for the World Cup soccer tournament next year, and Seattle is hosting six matches.

Adoption of biometrics and facial recognition technology is becoming more commonplace in air travel. A handful of airlines at Sea-Tac offer customers the option of using TSA's PreCheck Touchless ID.

CLEAR+ is a paid membership program that costs $209 per year.

The Washington Research Foundation today announced Orin Levine as its new president and CEO, effective Oct. 6. 

Levine has worked for more than 30 years in public health, innovation and philanthropy. He was most recently with the Gates Foundation for a decade, leaving the organization in 2022 as the director of global delivery programs where he oversaw initiatives in immunization and primary healthcare. 

Levine is taking over leadership from Tom Daniel, a former chairman of the University of Washington's Department of Biology, who has led WRF for nearly three years.

WRF launched in 1981 to help universities and other nonprofits in the state commercialize and license their technologies. The organization has granted more than $182 million since its creation, issuing nearly $16 million to nonprofit research institutions in its most recent fiscal year. 

The foundation also supports innovation and entrepreneurship through WRF Capital. The latter has provided funding for 132 local startups over three decades and recycles its returns on investment back into the organization.

Brooks Simpson, WRF's board chair, noted in a statement that Levine joins “at a time when state and federal budgets are being challenged.” That includes a revenue shortfall and spending cuts from Washington leaders, as well as Trump administration efforts to withhold and cancel funding from the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, among others. 

“[Levine's] experience and exceptional leadership on the global healthcare stage will serve WRF and the region well as we navigate these uncharted waters,” Simpson said. 

She also thanked Daniel for his stewardship, noting that “WRF has become a widely recognized philanthropic organization in the region's life sciences space” during his tenure. 

Prior to his work at the Gates Foundation — the world's largest private philanthropy — Levine was the executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health for more than 10 years. He began his career as an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“I love innovation and WRF has a remarkable legacy of helping researchers turn bold ideas into innovations that improve lives,” Levine said. “I'm excited by the organization's ambition and for the opportunity to work with the team and our partners to help Washington's life sciences ecosystem reach even greater heights.”

On Friday, The Information reported that Meta was preparing to tear down its existing AI org and reorganize it into four new groups. Four days later, the change has been made official with an internal memo, as reported by Bloomberg and The New York Times. The changes were announced by Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who joined Meta as chief AI officer in June.

Meta's new organization for AI will be called the Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The centerpiece is a new group called TBD Labs, which will be run by Wang. The group will focus on foundation models like Llama series, which had its latest release in April. The other three groups will focused on research, product integration, and infrastructure, respectively.

Meta has put significant resources into revamping its AI organization in recent months in response to concerns that it was being outpaced by rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. Mark Zuckerberg has been personally involved in recruitment for the new group, per a June report from Bloomberg.

Google will pay $30 million to settle a class action lawsuit claiming it violated children's privacy on YouTube, per Reuters.

The lawsuit alleges that Google collected data from children watching YouTube videos; while this kind of data collection has become common, it remains illegal to collect data from children under the age of 13, per the longstanding COPPA legislation.

Though Google will settle the case, the company denies these allegations.

It's possible that up to 45 million people in the U.S. could be eligible to receive small payments from this class action, which encompasses anyone in the U.S. who watched YouTube while under the age of 13 between July 1, 2013 and April 1, 2020.

Databricks is in the process of closing a fresh round at a $100 billion valuation, sources confirmed to TechCrunch. The round was originally reported by the Wall Street Journal.

A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch exclusively that the new round is about $1 billion and was wildly oversubscribed. Databricks, best known for its data analytics products, refrained from selling even more equity because it didn't need cash for operations after its once record-breaking $10 billion raise at a $62 billion valuation in January, according to the source. (OpenAI has since squashed the record with a $40 billion raise in March.)

The round was co-led by both Thrive and one of Databricks' early investors, Insight Partners, TechCrunch has learned. These two firms led the last round as well. The company has now raised about $20 billion since it was founded in 2013.

This was a primary round, meaning it didn't include employees selling their shares. However, sources close to the company say Databricks has already had two secondary rounds for employees in 2025. Those offers allowed employees to sell up to 40%, 50%, or 60% of their shares, depending on the size of their holdings. 

In both cases, the source said, the full funds available for the secondary round were not maxed out, meaning employees held on to more shares than they could have sold. While Databricks clearly isn't in a hurry to IPO, employees have had two recent chances to cash out shares. 

This new round, however, was raised to pursue two specific projects — a database for AI agents and its AI agent platform — Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi told TechCrunch in an interview. 

The company will invest heavily in its database for AI agents, making it generally available to all customers. It launched the product, known as Lakebase, in June at its annual tech conference. Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres, is enterprise grade and supports corporate developers' vibe-coding projects. This makes it a competitor to Supabase. 

“The database market is $105 billion of TAM [total addressable market], of revenue, sitting there, kind of unaffected in the last 40 years,” Ghodsi told TechCrunch, giving a subtle nod to how database giant Oracle has had a lock on the market for decades. 

“Here's the interesting statistic nobody's paying attention to: a year ago, we saw in the data that 30% of the databases were not created by humans. For the first time, they were created by AI agents. And this year, the statistic is 80%,” he said, adding that he predicts this stat to increase to 99% of new databases within a year. 

“There's a new user. The user is not human. It's an AI agent, and if we just double down on making that user persona successful, that's the wedge to disrupt that TAM,” he said.

As for how Lakebase will differentiate from Supabase and others already building Postgres-based databases for agents, Ghodsi said the key is “separated compute and storage.” 

By untying the pricey compute from the lower-cost storage, Databricks can affordably let users create many databases. “Because these agents are super fast. They just spin up lots of databases, much faster than humans can, but you don't want to go bankrupt because you're doing that,” he explained.

The second project Databricks will be investing heavily in is AI agent platform Agent Bricks, also launched in June. “Everybody's super focused on superintelligence,” Ghodsi said. “But that's not what we need in organizations.”

Rather than artificial general math geniuses or cancer-curing scientists, what companies need are agents that can reliably handle, unaided, mundane tasks like onboarding employees or answering personalized questions about HR benefits. 

“I think that's a much bigger opportunity, actually, for the worldwide GDP and for organizations,” he said. He believes that such focus will give Agent Bricks a competitive advantage. 

He also raised the extra cash so Databricks can get into the AI poaching wars. “As you know, it's pretty expensive to hire AI talent right now,” he said, smiling.

Meta is rolling out an AI-powered voice translation feature to all users on Facebook and Instagram globally, the company announced on Tuesday.

The new feature, which is available in any market where Meta AI is available, allows creators to translate content into other languages so it can be viewed by a broader audience.

The feature was first announced at Meta's Connect developer conference last year, where the company said it would pilot test automatic translations of creators' voices in reels across both Facebook and Instagram. 

Meta notes that the AI translations will use the sound and tone of the creator's own voice to make the dubbed voice sound authentic when translating the content to a new language.

In addition, creators can optionally use a lip-sync feature to align the translation with their lip movements, which makes it seem more natural.

At launch, the feature supports translations from English to Spanish and vice versa, with more languages to be added over time. These AI translations are available to Facebook creators with 1,000 or more followers and all public Instagram accounts globally, where Meta AI is offered.

To access the option, creators can click on “Translate your voice with Meta AI” before publishing their reel. Creators can then toggle the button to turn on translations and choose if they want to include lip-syncing, too. When they click “Share now” to publish their reel, the translation will be available automatically.

Creators can view translations and lip syncs before they're posted publicly and can toggle off either option at any time. (Rejecting the translation won't impact the original reel, the company notes.) Viewers watching the translated reel will see a notice at the bottom that indicates it was translated with Meta AI. Those who don't want to see translated reels in select languages can disable this in the settings menu.

Creators are also gaining access to a new metric in their Insights panel, where they can see their views by language. This can help them better understand how their content is reaching new audiences via translations — something that will be more helpful as additional languages are supported over time.

Meta recommends that creators who want to use the feature face forward, speak clearly, and avoid covering their mouth when recording. Minimal background noise or music also helps. The feature only supports up to two speakers, and they should not talk over each other for the translation to work.

Plus, Facebook creators will be able to upload up to 20 of their own dubbed audio tracks to a reel to expand their audience beyond those in English- or Spanish-speaking markets. This is offered in the “Closed captions and translations” section of the Meta Business Suite and supports the addition of translations both before and after publishing, unlike the AI feature.

Meta says more languages will be supported in the future but did not detail which ones would be next to come or when.

“We believe there are lots of amazing creators out there who have potential audiences who don't necessarily speak the same language,” explained Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a post on Instagram. “And if we can help you reach those audiences who speak other languages, reach across cultural and linguistic barriers, we can help you grow your following and get more value out of Instagram and the platform.”

The launch of the AI feature comes as multiple reports indicate that Meta is restructuring its AI group again to focus on four key areas: research, superintelligence, products, and infrastructure.

A federal appeals court handed SpaceX a win on Tuesday, in a ruling that prevents the National Labor Relations Board from prosecuting unfair labor practices against the company. The ruling by the Fifth District Court of Appeals, which suggests the structure of the NLRB is likely unconstitutional, could have far-reaching effects.

The ruling keeps unfair labor practice cases against SpaceX and two other companies, Energy Transfer and Findhelp, on hold while the companies pursue their claim that the NLRB structure violates the U.S. Constitution. While the court did declare it unlawful, this is far from a settled issue and the NLRB is undoubtedly likely to challenge the ruling.

The three-judge panel said being subjected to a possibly unconstitutional administrative proceeding, which is what SpaceX claimed, is an irreparable harm — so the pause continues. The NLRB brought the unfair labor practices claim against SpaceX after it fired a group of employees who signed an open letter criticizing CEO Elon Musk and a culture of sexism in the company.

The core of the dispute is over whether the NLRB's in-house judges, called administrative law judges, enjoy unlawful protections that shield them from removal by the president. If that's the case, it violates constitutional rules governing the separation of powers, the judges said.

The panel included two judges appointed by President Donald Trump and a third judge appointed by George H.W. Bush.

It would ""mostly work"" offline before, but you could have cases where some blocks in a page aged out of the LRU, or they changed online in a way that invalidated the page but new content wasn't downloaded. When that happens we show a ""go online to view"" error instead of risking you viewing/editing a known-incorrect local snapshot of the page.With ""available offline"", we now proactively download and keep up-to-date the content you want available offline. It will either work, or show an explicit error if things go wrong in the sync process. No more guesswork.

Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy states that in any bureaucratic organization there will be two kinds of people: First, there will be those who are devoted to the goals of the organization. Examples are dedicated classroom teachers in an educational bureaucracy, many of the engineers and launch technicians and scientists at NASA, even some agricultural scientists and advisors in the former Soviet Union collective farming administration. Secondly, there will be those dedicated to the organization itself. Examples are many of the administrators in the education system, many professors of education, many teachers union officials, much of the NASA headquarters staff, etc. The Iron Law states that in every case the second group will gain and keep control of the organization. It will write the rules, and control promotions within the organization.

The time has come for Google's “Made by Google” event. On Wednesday, Aug. 20, Google will once again unveil a family of new Pixel devices, and this time we'd bet good money that its AI chatbot, Gemini, will be in the driver's seat.

Unless Google plans to pull a rabbit out of a hat, we're not expecting any hardware surprises. A steady stream of leaks (and Google's own teaser videos) over the past several months has all but revealed everything there is to know about the expected Pixel 10 family of smartphones (Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL), a second-gen book-style foldable (Pixel 10 Pro XL), the Pixel Watch 4 (in two sizes), and new A-Series wireless earbuds (Pixel Buds 2A).

We're not saying nobody will get gadget lust, but the focus will be on Gemini and how Google will convey the AI chatbot's usefulness. Will we finally get true agentic multitasking that allows you to tell Gemini to just do stuff for you without having to open any apps? Or will Google just show off more of the same generative AI features for summaries and photo editing—but better and faster?

There's going green for the sake of the planet, and then there's going green as part of a policy initiative that winds up buying a bunch of glitch-plagued electric vehicles from a company that went bankrupt and can no longer service them.

The latter is the exact story of a New York-based company called American Lease, which has spent around $45 million for 2,800 cars from Fisker, a now-dead EV startup that only made 11,000 of that model in its short life anyway, and is now using them as part of NYC's Green Rides Initiative.

They have accordingly deployed the Ocean, a sort of Escalade SUV knockoff, across NYC as a ride-sharing or car service vehicle, meaning that the only Ocean you may ever see in your life is popping up multiple times throughout New York.

And in true tech bro fashion, the decision to buy these almost 3,000 now-defunct SUVs for millions of dollars was made fast—and broke things, possibly literally.

“We were sitting at lunch and I was reading an article about how Henrik Fisker, who founded Fisker, had listed his home for more than the market cap of the company at that point,” American Lease executive vice president Josh Bleiberg told Bloomberg. “So I was like, ‘Screw it: Let's buy Fisker.'”

Here's the problem, though: the Ocean debuted in 2020 and was immediately slapped by regulators for multiple safety issues, a problem that eventually led to a recall of all 2024 models and Fisker's bankruptcy filing the same year.

Fisker produced over 10,000 Ocean SUVs in 2023, but only 4,929 of these vehicles were delivered to customers. Fisker also faced challenges in selling the remaining inventory, an understandable position considering the recall issues.

Those problems included suddenly losing power, the inability to exit in an emergency, issues with the gauges and icons on the dashboard, software that did not meet safety requirements, brakes not working, and “unintended” vehicle movement.

“A door that fails to open can prevent occupants from exiting in an emergency, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in its findings.

A Bloomberg reporter who recently took a ride in one noted that you should definitely look out for the “ghost light”—which randomly goes on and then blinks for 10 to 15 seconds before resetting—or California Mode, which sometimes causes the windows to get stuck in the down position and then have to be reset at the company's Bronx site.

Another fun perk? The vehicles are often old, with their software in limbo, managed by third-party startups like indiGO Technologies, who are trying to keep them up-to-date. No word on how you'd fix a major problem with an Ocean, because the company that made it is dead, and it was the only model Fisker ever made.

This makes sense because after the 2024 recall, owners of the cars claimed that the Fisker development engineers were racing to meet the regulatory requirements and made so many changes so fast that many of them didn't work at all. That led to accusations of “bricking,” which is when an EV becomes totally unresponsive.

To be fair, American Leasing did get a good deal on the Fisker cars. While they once sold for around $70,000 as luxury EVs, the company snapped them up for around $16,000 each. Whether that price factored in the recall issues or repair costs, though, isn't clear.

American Leasing did not respond to a request for comment.

What's remarkable is that New York's push for an all-electric fleet—enforced by the city's Green Rides initiative—has inadvertently created a marketplace for these zombie EV startups.

The city aims for all Uber and Lyft rides to be emissions-free by 2030, but limited supply and declining federal incentives have left fleet operators scrambling for affordable replacements, often turning to used and propped-up vehicles from bankrupt or failing companies. The irony in this is that the owner of American Leasing doesn't think the Oceans will make it until that 2030 deadline.

“We don't anticipate these cars lasting much past 150,000 to 200,000 miles,” Bleiberg told Bloomberg.

After some major leaks earlier this month, Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 FE are finally here, and on paper, they look like a pretty good deal. While the “FE” moniker, short for Fan Edition, often signifies a lower price point in exchange for some compromises on features, the new Galaxy Buds 3 FE actually beats Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in a couple of key areas, and one of those battlegrounds is battery life.

See Galaxy Buds3 FE at Samsung.com

According to Samsung, the $150 Buds 3 FE offer 6 hours of battery with active noise cancellation (ANC) activated and 8.5 hours with ANC off. That's compared to the $190 Buds 3 Pro battery life, which clocks in at 6 hours and 7 hours with ANC on and off, respectively. I would have liked to see the ANC battery life get a bump here too, but it's nice to know that if you need to, you can get an extra hour and a half for less money. Those battery life numbers aren't mind-blowing in the general field of wireless earbuds, but they do put the Galaxy Buds 3 FE on par with comparably priced buds from OnePlus.

The other category that the Galaxy Buds FE 3 excel in is weight. These wireless earbuds are actually 5 grams lighter than the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which isn't an enormous difference but is enough to give the FE a slight edge if you're comparing the two against each other. It's also worth noting that Samsung managed to decrease the weight while upgrading the battery life, which is always a feat worth mentioning when it comes to any gadget, earbuds included.

The next biggest selling point is the fact that the Galaxy Buds FE 3 match a lot of the Pro features while keeping the starting price lower. The first thing you'll probably notice is that the new Buds FE 3 borrow the same AirPods-like design as the Buds 3 Pro, which is nice if you like Apple's white earbuds but maybe not so nice if you're looking for something different. There is a slight difference here in that the Galaxy Buds FE 3 come with a matte finish as opposed to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro's glossy one, though, and they don't have any LED lights on the stems—sorry, blades—themselves.

On top of a similar design, the Galaxy Buds FE 3 also come equipped with real-time AI translation features (only if you have a Samsung phone) and hands-free Gemini compatibility so you can activate and use your voice assistant without unlocking your phone. AI features probably won't be make-or-break for most people, but it's nice to know that they'll be there if you should need/want them.

As is the case with any pair of wireless earbuds, the biggest question will be in the sound. One notable difference between the Buds 3 Pro and Buds 3 FE is that the former has a dual-driver design while the latter has just one driver. It's hard to say what kind of difference that will make without hearing them back-to-back, but I'm guessing the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro will have an edge when it comes to fidelity and dynamic range. Even with that difference, however, the Buds 3 FE feel like a good deal for the price, and if you're looking to save a little bit of money but not make any major compromises, this could be the pair of Samsung wireless earbuds you're looking for.

Damian McNamara, MA

 August 19, 2025  

Higher prenatalexposure to a common pesticide, chlorpyrifos (CPF), was associated with a greater likelihood of brain abnormalities and poorer motor function among children aged 6 to almost 15 years in a prospective, longitudinal study.

MRIs revealed widespread brain changes, including thicker frontal, temporal, and posterior inferior cortices; reduced white matter volumes; and lower diffusivity of internal capsule white matter.

Researchers also observed that prenatal CPF exposure levels were linked to lower indices of neuronal density in white matter tracts and lower performance on fine motor and motor programming tasks.

Previous preclinical and clinical studies supported the neurotoxicity of CPF, but this is the first research to look at specific brain changes in people.

“These are very strong associations such that progressively higher levels of exposure are associated with progressively greater disruptions in development of brain structure and metabolism, as well as greater disruptions in motor control,” lead author Bradley S. Peterson, MD, division chief of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was published online on August 18 in JAMA Neurology.

CPF is a chlorinated organophosphate and one of the most common pesticides used globally. It enters the bloodstream through ingestion or skin contact or after breathing it in.

In pregnant women, the pesticide crosses the placenta, enters the fetal bloodstream, reaches concentrations up to four times higher than those in the mother's circulation, and crosses the fetal blood-brain barrier.

“Pregnancy is an exquisitely sensitive period of brain development that is vulnerable to environmental exposures, including CPF,” Peterson said. “Protecting unborn children by advocating for restrictions on pesticide use and by educating prospective parents on measures to reduce exposure is essential.”

From January 1998 to July 2006, investigators recruited 727 pregnant African American or Dominican women living in northern New York City. Between 2007 and 2015, MRI scans were performed on 332 of their children aged 6-14.7 years.

Researchers compared MRI findings to CPF levels in umbilical cord or maternal blood, analyzing data between February 2018 and November 2024 on a final cohort of 270 children (median age, 10.38 years).

Maternal exposure to CPF in participants was primarily from spraying indoors for pests, which was prevalent in this inner-city neighborhood before residential use was banned in 2001, the authors noted.

Peterson said a surprising study outcome was “how strong and widespread across the brain these associations were” spanning measures of cortical thickness, white matter myelination, neuronal density, and metabolism.

On an MRI, for example, CPF exposure was associated significantly and positively with cortical thickness in frontal regions, including the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyrus; the anterior cingulate cortex; gyrus rectus; and the middle orbitofrontal and lateral orbitofrontal gyrus.

The same associations were seen in temporal brain regions, including the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyrus, and the parahippocampus. Posteroinferior regions altered the same way, including the posterior cingulate cortex, cuneus, and the inferior occipital, lingual, and fusiform gyrus.

In contrast, CPF levels were associated with lower cortical thickness in the dorsal parietal region, specifically the superior parietal gyrus, and with lower white matter volumes in multiple frontal, temporal, and posteroinferior regions.

In addition to the anatomic MRI findings, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging showed that CPF exposure associated inversely with N-acetyl-L-aspartate, which reflects neuron density, in scattered foci within deep white matter tracts and in gray matter of the insular cortex.

Diffusion tensor imaging also positively linked CPF exposure to fractional anisotropy and inversely with average diffusion coefficient values in the internal capsule. Furthermore, arterial spin labeling revealed higher CPF exposure was associated with a lower regional cerebral blood flow.

“In this cohort study, progressively higher prenatal CPF exposure levels associated significantly with progressively greater alterations in brain measures in each MRI modality, suggesting that prenatal exposure may produce enduring disturbances in brain structure, function, and metabolism in direct proportion to exposure level,” investigators wrote.

Another unexpected result for Peterson was how similar the CPF findings were to those linked to other prenatal exposures, including air pollution, despite being extremely different chemicals.

This suggests a common pathway for disrupting brain development, “most likely by producing inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, which are toxic to brain cells early in development,” he said.

Asked about treating children already affected by CPF, Peterson replied, “Unfortunately, we don't know yet of ways to help children who are already exposed. The only ways we know currently to mitigate risk to unborn children is to minimize exposures.”

He added, “Perhaps in the future, novel therapeutics may reduce inflammation and oxidative stress from CPF and other pesticide exposures and thereby attenuate their adverse effects on brain development.”

CPF is “ubiquitous” on nonorganic fruit, vegetables, and grains, added Peterson, who is also vice chair for research and chief of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Keck School of Medicine of USC in Los Angeles. The pesticide is also carried by outdoor air and is often used in agriculture.

“Farm families are at particularly high risk because pregnant women not only work in the fields but also live in nearby communities, where pesticide drift is common,” said senior investigator Virginia A. Rauh, ScD, the Jane and Alan Batkin Professor of Population and Family Health at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in New York City.

“This is an area where public health policy changes would have a significant impact,” she added.

There are federal and state restrictions. In August 2021, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) removed all “tolerances” or acceptable levels of CPF on food. Several agricultural groups challenged the action, and in December 2023, a US Circuit Court vacated the earlier EPA decision.

The agency is now considering a final rule that would restrict exposures for farm workers and vulnerable populations and set limits for the pesticide on 11 specific crops: alfalfa, apple, asparagus, tart cherry, citrus, cotton, peach, soybean, strawberry, sugar beet, and spring and winter wheat.

State laws on CPF use vary. “Surprisingly,” Rauh said, “CPF is banned in only five states: California, Hawaii, New York, Maryland, and Oregon.”

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the EPA STAR program, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the John and Wendy Neu Family Foundation supported the research. The study was also supported by an anonymous donor, Patrice and Mike Harmon, the Inspirit Fund, and the Robert Coury family. Peterson, Rauh, and Thompson reported no relevant financial relationships.

From optical trapping experiments to insights into molecular force generation, Dr. Maxim Molodtsov shared how his research is uncovering the mechanical and structural underpinnings of cohesin's role in genome regulation.  

Watch the full webinar

Cohesin is a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together and helps organize DNA into loops essential for gene regulation and mitosis. It's a ring-shaped structure with fairly long coiled arm domains that are about 50 nanometers long, as well as two ATPase domains.

My group's research focuses on the three-dimensional organization and physical rearrangement of DNA during the cell cycle. This spatial organization is also crucial for gene expression, recombination, and DNA repair.

As cells divide, DNA is condensed into distinct chromosomes. The organization of and separation between chromosomes is essential for accurate cell division. We are investigating the mechanical forces that move DNA, create DNA loops, drive these around the cell, and reorganize them in three dimensions.

Cohesin holds sister chromatids together whilst cells divide. When cohesin is depleted, chromosomes simply fall apart. This role makes cohesin key throughout DNA rearrangements in the cell cycle. Cohesin's resistance to the forces of the mitotic spindle is particularly important for this process.

It is believed that the shape of the cohesin complex allows it to hold cystid DNAs through a specific mechanism that entraps two DNA strands.

Studies later suggested that cohesin can create DNA loops, one of the primary means of organizing DNA and interface cells.

Techniques like chromosome confirmation and Hi-C have proven the importance of cohesin in the formation of DNA loops, confirming that if cohesin levels drop, DNA loops begin to fall apart.

Our goal was to find out if, by dynamically binding DNA, it was possible for them to resist the forces generated by a mitotic spindle.

To study this, we first established a system to mimic the interface between two molecules of DNA held together by cohesin. We started a glass slide and attached a molecule of DNA before binding this to a cohesin molecule.

Working with a single molecule is important because interpretation of results becomes very difficult when working with multiple molecules.

We made sure there was one cohesin molecule per DNA molecule by adding a fluorescent tag to the cohesin molecule and measuring fluorescence to verify its presence. We then added a second DNA molecule with a fluorophore attached, allowing us to verify its attachment to the cohesin.

To mimic the tension applied to DNA during mitosis, we touch a glass bead to the DNA or cohesin and use an optical trap to study its behaviour.

The optical trap uses a highly focused laser aimed at a confocal spot on a glass bead. This creates a strong, localized field that allows the bead to be moved with precision. It also allows researchers to apply force to the bead and measure that force accurately.

The basis of this experiment is pulling at the cohesin-bound DNA until it breaks, then analyzing this process to try to understand exactly what is happening.

We work with a JPK NanoTracker 2 optical trap from Bruker attached to a turf elimination system in order to visualize individual cohesin molecules assembled on a relatively standard flow cell.

Using this system, we attached a DNA molecule to a cohesin molecule and washed it with salt. As the salt level increases, the cohesin diffuses, moving back and forth on the DNA molecule. This process can be observed using a climograph. This step also bleached the cohesin in one step, which acts as confirmation that it is a single cohesin molecule.

Then we added the second DNA molecule with a fluorophore, visualizing the correlated movement between cohesin and DNA. We also measure the fluorescence, confirming the presence of a single molecule.

The DNA is stretched as we pull on the glass bead. As we do this, we can see the cohesin is holding onto the bead, but at some point, cohesin breaks, prompting the DNA to jump back to the bead while remaining intact. This experiment allows us to measure the force at which cohesin ruptures. Using a histogram of the detachment rupture force, we can see that the single cohesin ruptures at around about 20 piconewtons of force.

The simplest model we could use to learn about cohesin's interaction with DNA involves a single molecule of cohesin entrapping the DNA in a ring-like structure. Applying force should then cause the ring to break at its weakest point, regardless of how the force is applied.

There are not many points that can break in this cohesin, but there is the kleisin gate (a connection between two proteins) through which the DNA escapes in physiological conditions.

We wanted to see if DNA also escapes this way following the application of external force, so we covalently cross-linked this interface to ensure that the DNA could not escape from it. Our studies showed that the central force remained the same, suggesting that DNA is escaping from somewhere else.

Another potentially weaker interface is the hinge, where coils of DNA interact. We ran a similar experiment, loading cohesins onto the DNA and cross-linking the hinges, although only about half of the cohesins on the DNA were cross-linked.

The histogram of rupture forces looked very different here.

We saw two peaks, as we would expect from two populations of cohesins. Approximately half of these populations showed the same force as our previous experiment, meaning these are likely the complexes that did not cross-link. The other half showed much higher rupture force, however, suggesting that those molecules are cross-linked.

These higher forces suggest that another, much stronger interface is being broken as this one is closed. So, DNA is unable to escape easily, where strong covalent bonds link it to cohesin.

We also repeated the experiment using a second DNA molecule. This time, we loaded the second strand and ensured that a single cohesin molecule was holding both DNA molecules together before applying force and measuring the resulting rupture force.

In this case, we found that the rupture forces were similar but with the distribution slightly shifted. We realized that when we stretch two DNAs, it takes longer to break just because the DNA is longer. If we apply force for a longer period, the bond will break at a smaller amount of force.

We now think that cohesin hold the sister chromatids together by entrapping them physically, and that this physical entrapment can be ruptured by forces of about 20 piconewtons. We believe that the disengagement of this cohesin ring and this force may be an important mechanical regulatory mechanism.

For example, during mitosis or NFA, cohesin must be cleaved by separase to allow chromosomes to separate. This process is reversible, but in other contexts cohesin must be removed entirely to allow the DNA to close back up.

We also know that chromosomes sometimes breathe back and forth to allow cohesin to load and unload. This mechanical unloading may also be important in other processes, for example, during replication, when cohesin needs to be unloaded and then reloaded back on a replication fork. Part of this process may involve mechanical regulation, where the hinge interface disengages, allowing bulky machinery to pass through, engage, and disengage again.

Overall, we think that this mechanical disengagement may be part of the regulation process whereby mechanical force regulates the loading of cohesin on DNA.

Cohesin is a well-established molecular machine that can extrude these DNA loops, but the mechanism used by it to do this is still largely unknown.

One of the fundamental properties of these machines is that they must be able to couple the conformational changes with a hydrolysis cycle and movement along the DNA.

We wanted to see whether different conformational changes in cohesin could generate force, to help us understand how these changes might push cohesin along the DNA.

There are two major conformational changes in a cohesin ring. One is called ‘head-to-head', when the head domain moves back and forth, and the other is the ‘hinge-to-head movement'.

Common cohesin molecules were tracked with two tags. We used one tag to mobilize cohesin to the surface, and another tag was used via passive coil to separate cohesin from the bead and the trap.

We attached a bead held in an optical trap to apply the force to cohesin. A key benefit of this experiment was that this system allowed us to precisely monitor how conformational changes in this cohesin depend on how much force we apply. For example, if a hinge bends over to the head, the bead will have to move with the hinge, and we will be able to detect this movement.

We were able to collect data that corresponded to the cohesins of bent and unbent hinges. The distance inferred from this data was roughly what we would expect from structural data, indicating that we were seeing how head hinge bending occurs in real time.

In terms of how these bends depended on external force, we saw that cohesin remains largely unbent at around 1.5 piconewton of force, but that it also bends back and forth at around one piconewton and even smaller forces.

This dynamic reminded us of the influence of Brownian motion, which likely drives this movement instead of some sort of chemical transitions. We need to test this idea, confirming whether or not thermal fluctuations drive this bending and unbending.

We fitted our data with a simple three-state model to evaluate whether thermal fluctuations drove these transitions between fully bent, half-bent, and fully unbent states. The model fit our data very well, suggesting that it is thermal, Brownian fluctuations that drive this movement.

The next question we asked was, ‘What is ATP hydrolysis for in this instance, and what kind of movement does it drive?'. We looked at the head-to-head movement, using the same setup to look at the forces being generated. To do this, we immobilized one head, and instead of pulling on the hinge, we pulled on the head.

This experiment revealed a completely different picture. Head-to-head movement occurred at much higher forces, for example, five piconewtons and 10 piconewtons, moving back and forth at about 10 nanometers in size. This is exactly what we would expect from structural data and is consistent with other groups' measurements using AFM.

What was interesting about this is that it did not matter how much force we applied within a certain range (up to 15 piconewtons). The rate at which this molecule's domains opened and closed remained largely independent of the external force applied, unlike the exponential dependence on force that we would expect in a thermal Brownian ratchet case.

These findings suggest that this movement is different from the hinge-to-head movement. It is driven by chemical transitions rather than thermal Brownian fluctuations, meaning it is likely the ATP cycle that drives this movement.

In summary, there are two major conformational changes that generate force by two different mechanisms. Head-hinge bending is largely driven by thermal fluctuations, but the head-head movement is largely chemically driven and can generate much higher force.

We don't currently know why you would need two different force generation mechanisms in one molecule, but one of the hypotheses we have is that during loop extrusion, we actually see two processes. We first need to bend the DNA to initiate the loop, and then we need to elongate the loop. It is possible that the two mechanisms are responsible for different phases of loop extrusions: one for elongation and one for separation.

The NanoTracker is an advanced, fully motorized optical tweezers system with high-resolution force and position measurement capabilities.

This is the second version of the device. The NanoTracker is built on an inverted microscope, which can be integrated with different kinds of light microscopy, including EP fluorescence, confocal, TIF, and TIC. It also supports many different microscope manufacturers, such as JICE, Nikon, Olympus, and Leica.

The NanoTracker features a user-friendly software platform that has automation capabilities, skip writing for spectrometry modes, and both CMOS and CCD cameras to visualize samples. The whole device is highly automated; users only need to insert a sample, and everything else is handled automatically through the software controller.

The NanoTracker can measure forces of up to 100 or 200 piconewtons. This depends upon the laser power in use alongside the 0.1 piconewton resolution. Not only can we measure the forces acting on a particle, but we can also track the position of the particle with sub-nanometer resolution.

The NanoTracker also offers a high data acquisition rate in megahertz and support for large bandwidth. It supports single, dual, and multiple traps, and multiple traps can be managed via time setting method, where we share time between different traps. However, the time allocated to each trap is so short that the traps do not register any interruption.

The amount of particles trapped is only limited by the laser power in use. For example, we could trap as many as 255 particles with a single trap. This is a class one laser instrument, so there is no need for additional laser safety goggles or a lab equipped with laser safety features. The system comes with two variants of laser power, 3 watts and 5 watts, and it features a 1064 nanometer wavelength laser.

A Petri dish heater is available for use with 35-millimeter Petri dishes. Samples can be heated up to 45 °C, and gas perfusion functionality is available, ideal for users working with living cells in long-term experiments.

Another useful sample-handling accessory is the magnetic twister, which is ideal for trapping magnetic particles and applying toxins to study their effects.

The NanoTracker's laminar flow cells feature five input channels and one output channel, meaning we can have five different fluids flowing into the instrument, allowing us to do different experiments in different channels without mixing fluids with one another.

For example, beads coated with streptavidin could be flowed into one channel, while in another channel, there are biotinylated DNA molecules. This allows us to apply fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to the DNA molecules to perform a DNA stretching experiment.

This type of experiment uses two traps, trapping a DNA molecule in between these two traps. One part of the DNA (in trap one) is static, and one part of the DNA (in trap two) moves. As we move to trap two, we can record the forces acting on the DNA.

The setup for this experiment begins with a controller, which is used to control all the electronics in the system. It also communicates continuously with the computer in order to record and store the data.

On top of the controller sits the laser power supply and a laser steering unit. Various optical elements create multiple traps and allow them to be steered or modulated. The light is then directed along an optical path to the microscope head, mounted on an inverted Zeiss microscope. The light is guided by a dichroic mirror placed at a 45 ° angle before passing through a high numerical aperture objective.

This setup works by tightly focusing laser light, trapping a particle, and then using another detection objective to detect the position of the particle or the forces applied to it using a quadrant photodiode. The technique is called back focal plane interferometry.

Using the NanoTracker's software, we can set laser power and distribute this power between traps. We can use an attenuation filter to ensure that the detection is not oversaturated.

A window allows us to use either a detection objective or a trapping objective, allowing for precise adjustment to the focal plane to trap particles. The NanoTracker also features motorized sample stages, allowing very precise movement. This includes nano positioning of the sample stages in all three directions (x, y, z), up to 100 micrometers.

The NanoTracker's force spectrometer functionality is ideal here, because we want to stretch the DNA and then measure the forces acting on it.

Before measuring forces, we need to calibrate the optical tweezers using a power spectrum method. We also need to set the diameter of the particle that we are using, the temperature, and the density and viscosity of the medium in which the beads are trapped. Calibrating the power spectrum for a trap involves fitting it with a Lorentzian function. Proper calibration lets us see values such as sensitivity and the stiffness of the trap.

In an example experiment using this setup, we set up two traps, one static and one moving. We set the moving trap to extend the DNA by 12 micrometers at a rate of one micrometer per second. We also set the sample rate for the data to match this.

After performing force spectrometry, we can open the first spectrometer tab and choose the channel we want to view, which can be either trap one or trap two. In this case, we select the signal from the static trap.

The DNA broke once we extended the DNA by approximately 7.8, 7.9 micrometers. This was evidenced by the force spectroscopy results snapping back to zero.

Once the force applied (which the system measures) increases above a threshold value as one of the traps moves, we know that DNA has been successfully captured.

For example, one channel of the laminar flow setup has 3 micrometer or 3.2 micrometer polystyrene beads coated with streptavidin and lambda DNA, which is coated with biotin. Biotin binds with streptavidin to attach DNA to the beads.

Once the trap is on, we can catch these beads. Assuming one trap is fixed and one trap moves in a circle looking for DNA, we can use a script to measure forces as the moving trap circles in 0.1 micrometer steps. If the recorded force rises more than 20 piconewtons above the baseline, this indicates that the DNA has been captured and spectroscopy measurements can begin.

Tools like the NanoTracker's ramp designer are useful in these kinds of experiments, and it is also possible to automate experiments using the experiment planner, or by creating custom scripts in Java or Python.

Optical tracking measurements can be performed alongside AFM measurements. The NanoTracker's COMBI stage features a trapping objective for trapping particles, and we can place an AFM on top of this after removing the NanoTracker's head.

Some users have already performed this kind of experiment to measure interactions between different types of cells.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 7 of Aging (Aging-US) on July 7, 2025, titled ""Epigenetic age and accelerated aging phenotypes: a tumor biomarker for predicting colorectal cancer.""

In this study led by Su Yon Jung from the University of California, Los Angeles, researchers found a strong association between accelerated epigenetic aging and an increased risk of colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women. The study also indicated that lifestyle factors influence this risk.

Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, particularly in people over the age of 50. However, individuals do not all age at the same biological rate. Two people of the same chronological age can differ in their biological aging, which reflects the condition of their cells and tissues. This study focused on a specific measure of biological aging known as epigenetic aging, which is based on chemical changes to DNA.

The researchers used data from the Women's Health Initiative Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (WHI-dbGaP), which includes genetic and health information from postmenopausal white women aged 50 to 79. They applied three established ""epigenetic clocks"" to estimate epigenetic age from blood samples collected up to 17 years before a colorectal cancer diagnosis. These clocks measure how quickly a person is aging at the molecular level by tracking DNA methylation. Women with a higher epigenetic age than expected were significantly more likely to develop colorectal cancer

""[…]we examined biological aging status in PBLs via three well-established epigenetic clocks-Horvath's, Hannum's and Levine's […].""

The study also explored the role of lifestyle in modifying this risk. Women who consumed more fruits and vegetables showed no increased risk, even if they were epigenetically older. In contrast, women with both lower fruit and vegetable intake and signs of accelerated aging were up to 20 times more likely to develop colorectal cancer. This suggests that a healthy diet may help reduce cancer risk associated with biological aging.

Another key finding involved women who had both ovaries removed before natural menopause. These women had a higher epigenetic age and, when combined with accelerated aging, a greater likelihood of developing colorectal cancer. This highlights the potential influence of hormonal and reproductive factors on aging and disease risk.

The researchers validated their findings across several independent datasets, supporting the potential of blood-based epigenetic aging markers as early indicators of colorectal cancer risk. These markers could help guide early detection and prevention strategies in aging populations. However, the authors emphasize the need for independent large-scale replication studies.

Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the association between epigenetic aging and cancer. It also supports the idea that modifiable lifestyle factors may reduce disease risk, even among those aging more rapidly at the cellular level.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico will be the largest international football tournament ever staged.

FIFA have expanded their showpiece event to include 48 teams, giving smaller nations a much better chance of competing at the highest level.

Florida will be a popular destination for fans travelling from overseas, and demand for tickets for matches at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami is guaranteed to be through the roof.

Reputable websites such as SportsView will offer comprehensive coverage of the World Cup, making it the ideal resource for supporters in the US and elsewhere in the world.

The tournament is guaranteed to spark a global betting frenzy, with reputable sportsbooks set to offer even more markets than during the previous edition in Qatar.

However, geo-blocking restrictions could be a hindrance for bettors who travel to the tournament. Thankfully, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) offer a handy solution. 

VPNs allow bettors to seamlessly bypass troublesome blocks on their favourite sportsbooks. With that in mind, here are three of the most reliable VPNs on the market at the moment.

NordVPN

NordVPN is one of the most complete VPNs around. It has a rock-solid reputation for offering speed and privacy, making it a superb option for sports bettors.

The VPN places a heavy focus on privacy and online security. It uses 256-bit AES encryption, which is a high standard trusted by governments across the world.

The service features automatic Wi-Fi protection that prevents users from unintentionally connecting to the internet without VPN protection.

The VPN has servers in over 118 countries worldwide and has performed well in providing bettors with access to sportsbook platforms in numerous jurisdictions.

Nord also has over 7,700 servers which are ‘RAM-only'. This means that every reboot completely erases any temporary data for punters placing World Cup bets.

Bettors wagering in-play on World Cup matches will undoubtedly be attracted by Nord's speed. Tests have confirmed that connections are stable with the speed hovering around 50 Mbps.

Total VPN

Total VPN comes with robust encryption, a wide range of security protocols and performs extremely well in some of the biggest gambling jurisdictions worldwide.

The app boasts a user-friendly interface, making it easy for first-time VPN users to get started. Given that speed is often of the essence in betting, this is an invaluable feature.

Total VPN has an innovative kill switch to prevent your online gambling activities from being exposed if the VPN suddenly disconnects. 

There were no IP or DNS leaks when the service was tested, which is good news for bettors who value their online safety and security.

With antivirus and ad-blocking software integrated at no extra cost, TotalVPN is a sensible option for anyone planning to wager on the 2026 World Cup next summer.

IPVanish

IPVanish does not place a cap on the number of devices that can be connected to the VPN.

This is a game-changer for households with several people who love placing wagers, or for one person who uses different devices to access online sportsbooks.

IPVanish has been tested in numerous countries worldwide and the speed typically hovers around 45-50 Mbps, which compares favourably with other VPNs.

It uses 256-bit encryption to keep the connection secure and betting activity under the radar. There is also a built-in kill switch that stops all data transfer if the VPN is disconnected.

After undergoing IP, DNS and WebRTC leak tests while connected to a US server, IPVanish was found to be leak-free, making it perfect for all betting activities.","{'href': 'https://www.sarasotamagazine.com', 'title': 'Sarasota Magazine'}","soccer"

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

No. 1 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas is playing at ATP Winston-Salem for the first time and looking for some last-minute momentum before the US Open. In the Greeks' current form, not much is a certainty, and Bu Yunchaokete will be hungry for that big win. Can the biggest star of the tournament survive this early test? Who do you think will prevail?

Head-to-head: First meeting

That Bordeaux Challenger title in May is currently keeping Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard's stocks relatively high; otherwise, his ranking would be starting to crash by now (it still might if he can't do anything in Basel title defense). On the other hand, Pedro Martinez mostly plays well on hard courts when he's in good form, and that's not the case at the moment. Mpetshi Perricard is not reliable, but if he's going to start winning again, then this is an opportunity he's got to take.
Prediction: Mpetshi Perricard in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

Mariano Navone isn't picking up hard-court wins on the ATP Tour that often, but a fortunate opening-round draw allowed him to set up a meeting with Marcos Giron here. The American is coming off a disappointing hard-court swing with three consecutive losses in Washington, Toronto, and Cincinnati, which prompted him to seek a last-minute wildcard into Winston-Salem. He needs more time on court, and he might get it here, as Navone is not quite as comfortable on this surface and struggles to convert attacking positions.
Prediction: Giron in 2

Head-to-head: O'Connell 1-0

Recent months have been particularly challenging for Christopher O'Connell, who has been dealing with multiple injuries. Even when he earned a couple of wins in Toronto, it was instantly followed by a withdrawal. 2017 champion Roberto Bautista Agut might be close to wrapping up his career by now, but he's still competitive on the tour. The 37-year-old has plenty left to give and seems like the favorite here, considering O'Connell's form this year.
Prediction: Bautista Agut in 2

Head-to-head: 1-1

Aleksandar Kovacevic had a painful summer on natural surfaces, but it didn't take him long to start performing better once he was back on hard courts. The American lost to Miomir Kecmanovic in Miami earlier this year when he was coming off the Cap Cana title. It's a tough matchup against Kecmanovic, who tends to be solid, but the No. 13 seed hasn't exactly been setting the world on fire. With a match to adjust to these conditions, Kovacevic could be perceived as a tiny favorite here.
Prediction: Kovacevic in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

The drop-off of Stefanos Tsitsipas is an interesting tale, mostly of struggling to fix his weaknesses and juggling between the influence of his father and looking for a world-class coach. The Greek is back with his dad now and thinks this will be the best way forward. Perhaps it will, but it might take him some time to start getting results again. Some rhythm just before the US Open can be helpful, and he's still the better player in this match against Bu Yunchaokete. Just remember, nothing is certain with Tsitsipas right now.
Prediction: Tsitsipas in 3

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Exclusive: How Donna Vekić defied injury and surface struggles to take tennis silver at Paris 2024","https://www.olympics.com/en/news/exclusive-donna-vekic-injury-surface-struggles-tennis-silver-paris-interview","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 15:46:00 GMT","

Croatia's women's singles medallist speaks to Olympics.com a year on from her historic podium finish at Paris 2024.

Donna Vekić has two special souvenirs from Paris 2024: her Olympic silver medal, and her scrunchie.

The Croatian tennis player had to overcome countless hurdles in the buildup to last year's Olympic Games, suffering from so much physical discomfort that she contemplated pulling out.

Vekić candidly remembers her illness in the buildup to Paris, where she endured pain in both her arm and ankle. Even her initial flight to the French capital was cancelled, which delayed preparations for the tournament and being able to adapt to the clay.

Despite everything, the 13th seed reached the gold medal match at Roland-Garros, coming away with the silver medal after defeat to Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen.

“I have the scrunchie that I wore in the final,” Vekić tells Olympics.com of her keepsakes from her successful Games a year ago. “That's the first thing that comes to my mind. I have a lot of merchandise at home from Paris.""

A year since Paris 2024 🎉 I Relive it. Reshare it. Relove it. Watch and read the full highlights with your Olympic membership. 🏅

A post shared by Donna Vekic (@donnavekic)

“That was the most incredible week of my life, the best achievement of my career by far. Staying in the [Olympic] Village with all the other athletes, having my family there in the semis and finals, it was really special.”

Both the medal and scrunchie sit proudly in her apartment in Monte Carlo, with little proving more meaningful to the 29-year-old than the Olympic silver, Croatia's first medal in Olympic women's singles tennis history.

Sport has always been in Vekić's blood, born to a football-playing father and a hurdler mother, she hit a tennis ball for the first time at the age of six.

With four WTA career titles, the Osijek native had never reached a final on clay before Paris 2024. By her own admission, she is not fond of the red surface - “I'm not the biggest fan of clay, so it always feels good coming back on grass,” she admits.

Arriving in Paris after a maiden Grand Slam semi-final appearance at Wimbledon 2024, Vekić had only once made it into the second week of the clay major at Roland-Garros, where Olympic tennis was held.

The Women's Singles Tennis Final was held at Court Philippe-Chatrier, on 03/08/24. After two hours of play, Qinwen Zheng (CHN) won the Gold. Zheng (CHN) claimed victory over Donna Vekic (CRO) 6:2, 6:3.

Vekić explains, “After having such a good run at Wimbledon I had a lot of confidence going to the Olympics. I was very tired and not thinking too much, just playing my game. Every time before the clay season starts, I always [ask], ‘Okay, what can I change, what can I add?', I'm overthinking and then I lose my head a little bit.”

Then suddenly, everything clicked. The Croatian overcame former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu before stunning second seed and another Grand Slam winner in Coco Gauff in the third round. Though played on Court Philippe-Chatrier, this was not an extension of the French Open by any means.

“The conditions were a little bit different than Roland-Garros,” the silver medallist explains of how the clay conditions benefitted her. “It was a lot warmer, the balls were different, everything helped a little - and playing for your country it's different as well.”

Vekić will be 32 by the time of the next Games in LA 2028, still three years away. “That's very far, let's see about LA,” she responds to the possibility of competing at a third Olympic Games, having debuted at Tokyo 2020 back in 2021.

She knows that she will be even more invested in her fashion endeavours by then, from the Olympic flame to her own flame. “I have my own brand of candles and diffusers,” she concludes, “I don't have a lot of time for that, but it's something I'll definitely focus on after my career.”","{'href': 'https://www.olympics.com', 'title': 'Olympics.com'}","tennis"

The post Iga Swiatek rallies for 1st Cincinnati Open title right after Wimbledon win appeared first on ClutchPoints.

After a long title drought that spanned over a full year, Iga Swiatek is back to dominating like tennis fans are used to seeing. After the 24-year old collected her sixth Grand Slam title with a phenomenal performance to win Wimbledon last month, she has now won her 11th WTA 1000 title at the Cincinnati Open.

After knocking off Elena Rybakina in the semifinals, Swiatek defeated Italian Jasmine Paolini in a close straight-set final, 7-5 6-4.

With that victory, Swiatek improves to 6-0 all-time against Paolini, dropping just one set in the process. Of course, the two contested a major final at Roland Garros in 2024, with the Polish superstar winning 6-2, 6-1.

Cincinnati, a fast hard court, was thought to be one of the most difficult surfaces for Swiatek to play on due to her western forehand grip and her tendency to hug the baseline while refusing to give up court position. That court position combined with her occasionally attackable serve puts her at a disadvantage in the serve-return dynamic on faster courts.

Świątek reversed that trend at Wimbledon, and did so in Cincinnati as well. After the match, she was just as surprised as many watching.

“I don't know why I win the tournaments that were like the last ones in terms of what I thought they were going to be,” Swiatek said at the trophy presentation, in quotes shared by the WTA. “So, thank you [to my team] for forcing me to become a better player and learn how to play on all these faster surfaces.

“I'm kind of shocked and super happy, so thank you for the awesome support, to the team and to my family back home.”

Swiatek is now up to 18 big titles in total, adding her 11 WTA 1000 trophies to her six majors and one victory at the WTA Finals. She has won seven of the 10 different WTA 1000 tournaments after adding Cincinnati to her collection, and is now only missing victories in Wuhan, Canada and Dubai to complete the full collection.

This victory also gets Swiatek back to No. 2 in the world, ensuring that she will avoid top seed Aryna Sabalenka until the final of the U.S. Open if the two of them were to both make it that far. She passes American Coco Gauff, who drops to No. 3.

Swiatek made it to New York just in time for the U.S. Open mixed doubles on Tuesday morning, where she played her first match about 16 hours after finishing the final in Cincinnati. She and Casper Ruud are into the semifinals after winning a pair of matches on Tuesday, and Swiatek will look to keep the winning streak going into the main draw starting on Aug. 24.

Updates from the opening day action at Flushing Meadows

Get in touch! You can mail Daniel here

Andreeva/Medvedev make 30-40 on the Djokovic delivery; a second-serve ace down the T averts the immediate danger, but then Medvedev pings a forehand down the middle and between his two opponents to secure the break and a 3-2 lead. The set is on his racket.

Another swift hold on Ashe, Danilovic/Djokovic now up 2-1, whereupon the latter pastes a forehand winner down the line for 0-15. Then, after missing a backhand, the latter does really well at net to make 15-30, and at 30-all, Djokovic lobs Medvedev twice in a row before punishing a further forehand winner down the line for break point. Andfreeva saves it, which takes us to deuce, and from there, Medvedev secures the hold for 2-2. On Armstrong, it's a good start for the new entrants, Collins/Harrison breaking Bencic/Zverev for 2-0; Harrison, a dubs specialist, is showing what that entails.

“Not sure where the Djokovic mixed stat came from,” alerts Alex Hughes. “He withdrew injured before the mixed doubles bronze medal match in Tokyo…”

I guess they may have said at a grand slam and I missed it, watching my other screen.

Reminder: Collins/Harrison are replacing Sinner/Siniakova.

Good net-work from Danilovic has Andreeva flapping, but Medvedev still holds to 15 and we're at 1-1; on Armstrong, the match has just started.

At 40-30 Danilovic nets an overhead, and with Medvedev returning, Djokivics serve is in peril. But he too nets, meaning the Serbian team lead 1-0.

We learn that Djokivic has played one mixed doubles match in his career, 20 years ago. But he's ready to serve here, clad in the kind of sky-blue collared shirt my dad was wearing in 1982.

Our next sets of teams are out. Good.

Townsend thanks the crowd, noting that Shelton brings “a certain energy” from her, before chastising the crowd for being a little dry and asking for more next match. Shelton says it's easy for him, Townsend is the no 1 mixed doubles player in the world so she makes the rules and he's along for the ride.

Shelton, says Townsend, is “the vibe coordinator”, they work well together, and, interjects Shelton, “we're just having fun”.

Next on Amstrong: Collins/Harrison v Bencic/Zverev.

They look a proper partnership.

Next on Ashe: Danilovic/Djokovic v Andreeva/Medvedev

It's now 5-1 on Armstrong; Townsend/Shelton are nearly there.

Draper says it's a pleasure to play with Pegula as it is to face Raducanu and Alcaraz; Pegula thanks the crowd for showing up and creating a fun atmosphere even if it took a couple of miraculous Alcaraz shots to get them going. They plan to hang out and chill during their break.

Townsend/Shelton immediately secure then lose then secure a mini-break; they lead 3-1.

A banger of a point to finish a really fun game, Draper taking charge to eventually punish a forehand winner down the line.

…but a forehand winner from Raducanu saves it, making deuce while, on Armstrong, Rune holds for a second-set breaker.

A terrific shot from Pegula, who spots Alacaraz moving inside so sticks a winner into the tramlines, raises match point…

At 0-15, Alcaraz misses a chance for 0-30, then Draper intercedes at net for 30-15. On Armstrong, by the way, Rune is serving at 2-2 3-4, so to stay in the match; anyone got any spare eyes?

Draper is the best player on Ashe and by far; he and Pegula make 15-30 on the Raducanu serve and he's into net like an assassin to stick away a volley to raise two but really three match points. But the first two are quickly saved, the second with an ace, so here comes the deciding point, Alacaraz doing enough at net to force Pegula to serve for it at 4-2 3-2. On Armstrong, Townsend/Shelton lead 4-2 3-3.

Draper is playing really well and he holds to love; at 4-2 3-1, he and Pegula are a game away. On Armstrong, Anisimova/Rune trail 2-4 2-3, meaning the former must now serve to stay in the match.

Alcaraz hasn't been at it today and is soon down 30-40 on serve, Raducanu butchering an overhead to confirm the break. It's a long way back for them from here, Pegula/Draper up a set and a break at 4-2 2-1. .

Shelton's on one here, ridiculous net-play making 30-15; he and Townsend are having a right laugh out there, quickly securing their gold for 4-1 2-1, as Alcaraz races beyond the sideline to shove a forehand around the net-post with Raducanu having already given up the point. They still trail 40-15, though, and from there Draper sticks away a winner to give he and Pegula a 4-2 1-1 lead.

Rune is forced to deuce on serve and the break-back is immediate, Townsend and Shelton celebrating in grand style. Meantime on Ashe, Raducanu is forced to deuce, Alcaraz commanding at the net to secure their hold for 2-4 1-0.

Draper makes 30-15, then cunningly guides a forehand line with Alcaraz expecting him to go cross, but a netted forehand then makes things tight. And have a look! Alcaraz has been quiet so far, but fine work at the net earns deuce … then he ruins it by putting too much gas on a forehand. The first set goes to Pegula/Draper 4-2 and, while that's going on, Anisimova/Rune break Townsend/Shelton at the first time of asking in the second to trail 2-4 1-0.

And they only need two, Rune volleying long – his hands aren't as hard as Khachanov's but you'd never call them soft – so the Americans lead by a set to love.

Alcaraz holds in short order, so Draper must indeed serve for 1-0, while Townsend/Shelton hold three break and therefore set points over Anisimova/Rune.

Very quickly, it's 2-2 on Armstrong, Rune then finishing a terrific net-exchange for 0-15, as Pegula swats a backhand wide for 30-all and pressure. But then Alcaraz nets a volley he shouldn't and clouts a forehand wide, meaning a 1-3 first-set deficit; if he holds, Draper will have a chance to serve for it. And on Armstrong, Shelton holds for 3-2.

Anisimova/Rune break back immediately to trail Townsend/Shelton 1-2, while Raducanu holds to keep her and Alcaraz in set one – but they'll need to break Pegula next up to have a realistic chance of saving the st.

Quickly, though, a double makes 0-30; Townsend retrieves for 30-all whole Draper holds to give him and Pegula a 2-0 lead over Raducanu/Alcaraz.

Back on Armstrong, Shelton is dominating, rousting a forehand from the back that makes 15-40, and when Rune then goes long, the American pair lead 2-0. The set feels done and if Townsend holds next up, it will be as good as.

Pegula/Draper race to 0-40, which in this format means four break points. But they only need two, Draper hooking a forehand winner to secure an advantage that, in this format, could well prove decisive in the set.

Both matches are under way, Shelton holding in rapid time while Pegula/Draper make 0-30 on the Alcaraz serve.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

U.S. Open

Begins

Follow live coverage of the U.S. Open mixed doubles

Jannik Sinner has withdrawn from the U.S. Open mixed doubles, which begins Aug. 19 in New York. The men's world No. 1 in singles retired after five games of his Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz due to illness, and will recover before preparing for the U.S. Open singles.

Sinner was going to partner Kateřina Siniaková, probably the greatest active doubles player on earth, in a compelling alliance of the two tennis disciplines.

Siniaková, an 11-time Grand Slam doubles champion and a gold medalist at the 2024 Paris Olympics, never received a new partner. The official draw and order of play were updated Tuesday morning, but Sinner and Siniaková's place was occupied by “Qualifier / Qualifier” as of 9:12 a.m., less than two hours before the start of the event.

Americans Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison then took the pair's spot as first alternate, owing to their combined singles ranking.

Alcaraz traveled from Mason, Ohio to partner Emma Raducanu, while Iga Świątek, who won the WTA 1000 title with victory over Jasmine Paolini, also arrived on time to partner Norway's Casper Ruud.

The new mixed doubles event, which will be played over two days and feature short sets, an array of singles stars and a $1 million prize, begins at 11 a.m. Aug. 19. The semifinals and finals will be played Aug. 20, starting at 7 p.m. The teams, prior to the confirmation of Sinner and Siniaková's replacement, are as follows:

DIRECT ENTRIES

Jessica Pegula / Jack Draper
Iga Świątek / Casper Ruud
Elena Rybakina / Taylor Fritz
Amanda Anisimova / Holger Rune
Belinda Bencic / Alexander Zverev
Mirra Andreeva / Daniil Medvedev
Madison Keys / Frances Tiafoe
Karolina Muchová / Andrey Rublev
Danielle Collins / Christian Harrison

WILD CARDS

Emma Raducanu / Carlos Alcaraz
Olga Danilović / Novak Djokovic
Taylor Townsend / Ben Shelton
Sara Errani / Andrea Vavassori
Venus Williams / Reilly Opelka
Naomi Osaka / Gael Monfils
Caty McNally / Lorenzo Musetti

Analysis from Charlie Eccleshare, tennis writer

In Jannik Sinner and Kateřina Siniaková, the U.S. Open had unwittingly stumbled upon a fascinating mixed doubles pairing. How would the men's world No. 1 in singles mesh with arguably the world's greatest active doubles player, and holder of 11 Grand Slam titles across the women's and mixed disciplines?

Advertisement

Sinner was originally paired with WTA singles world No. 11 Emma Navarro, but, having struggled for form of late, she pulled out of the event to play the Monterrey Open to try and get some matches in ahead of the U.S. Open.

Sinner's withdrawal, and the end of his partnership with Siniaková before it had begun, is perhaps a fitting conclusion to his involvement in the competition. When Sinner was asked at Wimbledon about how his partnership with Navarro had come about, he could have tried to play it straight and trot out some line like: “Yeah, look, I've always admired Emma as a player and I really can't wait to play the mixed doubles event with her in New York.”

Instead he started laughing and told the truth: “It was very unexpected, to be honest. I just met her yesterday for the first time. We never talked. We never texted to each other.” He explained that with other pairs partnered up, the U.S. Open had suggested her as one of a few options.

Fast forward nearly two months, and Sinner's withdrawal is not a major surprise. Especially with tennis' scheduling being such that the mixed doubles event begins less than 24 hours after the Cincinnati Open final.

Now the U.S. Open has been left to scramble for a replacement for Sinner, and has lost arguably its most interesting pair in the process. There was always likely to be a degree of chopping and changing, and some has happened already with other partnerships, but this will no doubt provide more fuel for those who are sceptical about the seriousness of this event.

The scheduling of the Cincinnati Open final on Monday has caused chaos ahead of the start of the new-look US Open mixed doubles event 

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Jannik Sinner has pulled out of the US Open mixed doubles event after struggling with illness and retiring from his Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz after just five games on Monday. 

The World No 1 said he started to feel ill on Sunday and through the night but thought he would have recovered to face Alcaraz in the final, although his condition worsened and he retired trailing 5-0 in the first set. 

“Yesterday I didn't feel great and I'm really sorry to disappoint you,” Sinner said in a post on social media. “Thank you so much to everyone supporting me on-site and from home, your support means the world. 

“Congrats to Carlos Alcaraz and his team, you're having an incredible season and I wish you all the best for what's ahead. Now it's time to rest a couple of days before getting back to work.” 

Sinner had only confirmed his place in the new-look US Open mixed doubles event, where he was set to partner doubles specialist Katerina Siniakova, earlier on Monday - ahead of the afternoon Cincinnati Open final. 

Even if Sinner had been fit, the scheduling left a short turnaround before the start of the 16-team mixed doubles tournament in New York on Tuesday, where Sinner and Siniakova were drawn to play Alexander Zverev and Belinda Bencic. 

Sinner and Siniakova have been replaced by the American duo of Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison, after the US Open said Sinner and Siniakova's place in the draw “will be filled by an alternate team with the highest combined singles ranking” that signed up to play. 

Sinner, 24, had suggested he would not play in the new mixed doubles event shortly after retiring from the Cincinnati Open final, telling the ATP that he was turning his focus to a “couple of days of recovery” before the start of the singles competition. 

As Alcaraz's Cincinnati Open final lasted just 24 minutes, the Spaniard is set to be fresh to partner Emma Raducanu in their opening match against British men's No 1 Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula, who are the top seeds in the draw based on combined singles ranking. 

And Iga Swiatek, who defeated Jasmine Paolini in the women's Cincinnati Open final on Monday evening, will also play in the mixed doubles with Casper Ruud after travelling to New York on the same plane as Alcaraz and arriving in time to compete. 

Alcaraz and Raducanu, who are both previous US Open champions, are one of the star-studded singles players to be paired together for the controversially revamped event, which carries $1m in prize money. 

Sinner was partnered with Siniakova after top-10 player Emma Navarro decided to enter another warm-up event in singles before the start of the US Open main draw on Sunday. 

A greater concern for Sinner will be whether the 24-year-old is fit to start his US Open singles campaign in Flushing Meadows, but the defending champion did allay fears that he had picked up an injury before the grand slam by confirming he had been struck down by illness.

“Usually I start with the opponent but today I have to start with you guys [the crowd],” Sinner said during the peculiar trophy ceremony, as Alcaraz was crowned the champion in strange scenes in Cincinnati.

“I'm super super sorry to disappoint you. From yesterday I didn't feel great. I thought I would improve during the night. It came up worse. I tried to come out and make it at least a small match but I couldn't handle more. I'm very very sorry for all of you. I know some of you on Monday maybe had to work or do something else, so I'm very, very sorry.”

Tennis great Novak Djokovic once disqualified from the US Open mid-match after a controversial incident with a lineswoman.

On Sunday, the final tennis major of 2025 will get underway as the US Open starts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York.

Several of the biggest names in the sport are set to compete in the tournament, with the likes of Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and former world number one Jack Draper all hoping to take home the trophy.

As it stands, current world no.1 Sinner is the favourite to win the US Open, despite the fact that he recently was forced to pull out of the Cincinatti Open final against Alcaraz due to illness.

Advert

But one player who may not be looking forward to the competition is Djokovic, as it may bring up bad memories of him being disqualified back in 2020 following an incident with a lineswoman during his match.

Off the back of his win in the Australian Open earlier that year, Djokovic was the odds-on favourite to win his 18th Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2020.

However, things didn't go to plan for the Serbian player as he was ejected from the tournament in the fourth round after he accidentally hit a line judge in the throat with a ball smacked in anger.

Advert

Djokovic was facing opponent Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta in the fourth round of the major but found himself down 6-5 in the first set, leading to him hitting a ball behind him in frustration.

Unfortunately for Djokobic, and the woman involved, the ball hit the lineswoman behind him directly in the throat, causing her to immediately fall to the ground in pain.

Realising what he had done, Djokovic quickly ran over to check on the judge as she received medical attention before being taken off the court, unable to continue her role.

Despite pleading his case, the moment led to Djokovic being disqualified in the match, and therefore eliminated from the tournament, due to a strict rule stated in the ITF's Grand Slam rule book.

Advert

It reads: ""Players shall not at any time physically abuse any official, opponent, spectator or other person within the precincts of the tournament site...

""The Referee in consultation with the Grand Slam Chief of Supervisors may declare a default for either a single violation of this Code or pursuant to the Point Penalty Schedule set out above.""

Shortly after his removal from the competition was announced, Djokovic took to social media to apologise for the lines judge and the US Open for his behaviour, assuring fans it was completely accidental.

Advert

Posting on Instagram, he wrote: ""This whole situation has left me really sad and empty. I checked on the lines person and the tournament told me that thank God she is feeling ok. I'm extremely sorry to have caused her such stress. So unintended. So wrong.

""I'm not disclosing her name to respect her privacy. As for the disqualification, I need to go back within and work on my disappointment and turn this all into a lesson for my growth and evolution as a player and human being,

""I apologise to the @usopen tournament and everyone associated for my behaviour. I'm very grateful to my team and family for being my rock support, and my fans for always being there with me. Thank you and I'm so sorry.""

Surprise Cincinnati Open semi-finalist Terence Atmane has withdrawn from US Open qualifying due to a foot injury, the Frenchman announced on social media.

""Hello everyone. After a foot MRI yesterday in NY we detected an intermediate grade partial tearing of the first MTP joint [a] Grade 2 muscle injury involving the medial head of the flexor hallucis brevis. Low-grade partial tearing of the medial sesamoidal phalangeal ligament,"" Atmane wrote on Instagram Stories. ""Which in other terms won't make me able to play the US Open...

""I do feel sad about it because with the last result I want to push for more but trying to be smart and get myself ready for Asia was the best decision for my team and I.""

The Frenchman entered Cincinnati qualifying as the No. 136 player in the PIF ATP Rankings and emerged as World No. 69. The lefty earned five of his 10 tour-level wins at the tournament, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index

Atmane's dream run came to an end on Saturday against World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in a tightly contested semi-final, which the Italian won 7-6(4), 6-2. The Frenchman wrote that he next plans to compete in Chengdu.

In this week's Legal Beat newsletter, Diddy wins another lawsuit, Young Thug takes his property back, federal regulators sue bot scalpers and much more.

	Bill Donahue



THE BIG STORY: Six weeks after Sean “Diddy” Combs was largely acquitted on federal criminal charges, he won another court victory dismissing most of a $60 million civil sexual assault lawsuit filed by “Making the Band 2” contestant Sara Rivers.


	Rivers, who became a member of hip-hop group Da Band, sued Combs earlier this year – accusing him of sexually harassing and groping her during the filming of the 2000s MTV reality show. But a federal judge last week dismissed 21 of the 22 counts in her lawsuit, including racketeering, assault and battery, forced labor, and false imprisonment.

	Even after his recent courtroom wins, Diddy is hardly out of the woods. He's still facing dozens of other civil lawsuits from other alleged victims, accusing him of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and various other forms of sexual abuse. And he's still going to be sentenced in October on the lesser criminal charges on which he was convicted – counts that could still send him to prison for years. Stay tuned.

You're reading The Legal Beat, a weekly newsletter about music law from Billboard Pro, offering you a one-stop cheat sheet of big new cases, important rulings and all the fun stuff in between. To get the newsletter in your inbox every Tuesday, go subscribe here.


CARDI COPYRIGHT CLASH – A pair of music producers suing Cardi B for copyright infringement over “Enough (Miami)” demanded an injunction that would prohibit the superstar from streaming or otherwise monetizing the track as the litigation moves forward. That includes barring her from putting the song on Am I the Drama?, her long-awaited sophomore album due Sept. 19 via Atlantic Records.


BOT CRACKDOWN – The Federal Trade Commission launched a crackdown on alleged scalpers, filing a lawsuit accusing ticket broker Key Investment Group of using “illegal means” to purchase more than 379,000 event tickets on Ticketmaster and then re-selling them at massively-inflated prices. More than 2,000 of those tickets were allegedly for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour – the poster child for the problem of bot-scalpers and eye-watering secondary prices.


FORFEITURE FIGHT – Young Thug won a court ruling ordering the return of property seized by law enforcement during his Atlanta gang trial, including nearly $150,000 in cash, several cars and numerous pieces of jewelry. The decision – the judge said prosecutors missed key deadlines to litigate the case – came a little under a year after Thug's stunning release from jail after pleading guilty in the RICO case.


CARTEL SENTENCING – Music executive Ángel Del Villar was sentenced to 48 months (4 years) in prison following his conviction on felony charges of doing business with a concert promoter linked to Mexican drug cartels. Prosecutors alleged that Del Villar repeatedly arranged concerts with Jesus Pérez Alvear, a promoter with ties to Mexican cartels – even though he knew he had been sanctioned by federal authorities.


TORY'S APPEAL – Attorneys for Tory Lanez (Daystar Peterson) went before a California appeals court for a crucial hearing in his efforts to overturn his convictions for shooting Megan Thee Stallion. They told the panel that Lanez's trial was “riddled with errors,” including misleading statements about DNA evidence and a key witness they were not allowed to properly cross examine. But the government was unconcerned, calling some of Lanez's arguments non-sensical: “The evidence in this case was compelling.”


DISCOVERY DRAMA – Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge fired back at Drake's demand to read his emails amid the ongoing defamation lawsuit over the Kendrick Lamar diss track “Not Like Us,” calling the request “farcical” and “ridiculous.” He told a judge that it “makes no sense whatsoever” that the boss of the world's largest music company would play a role in the release of a single song and that Drake was trying to “waste my and UMG's time.”


UNSURPRISING DIVORCE – Kate Bowman, the wife of founding Maroon 5 bassist Mickey Madden, filed for divorce, just two weeks after she sought a restraining order in which she accused the musician of beating her during a confrontation about disturbing and sexual texts he'd sent to teenage girls. Seeking spousal support and a separation of assets, Bowman cited “irreconcilable differences” with Madden as the cause for the split.


DYLAN'S REVENGE – Bob Dylan won legal penalties at a federal appeals court against two lawyers who filed — and then quickly dropped — a lawsuit accusing the icon of sexually abusing a child in the 1960s. seeking the sanctions against the duo (Daniel W. Isaacs and Peter J. Gleason), Dylan's lawyers said they made “heinous and false allegations” without sufficient vetting and then repeatedly violated a court order by failing to get their client to turn over key evidence.


UGLY ACCUSATIONS – Priscilla Presley's former business partners (Brigitte Kruse and Kevin Fialko) fired back at her recent allegations of elder abuse against them, filing a countersuit that included the shocking accusation that Elvis Presley's widow “pulled the plug” on Lisa Marie Presley against her late daughter's wishes. Priscilla's attorney — veteran entertainment lawyer Martin Singer — quickly called the case a “disgusting publicity stunt” and “one of the most shameful, ridiculous, salacious, and meritless lawsuits I have seen in my practice.”


DEFAULT JUDGMENT – Jimmie Allen was judged liable for sexually assaulting and secretly filming a woman in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2022. Allen has denied those accusations, but a judge ruled that he had forfeited his right to defend himself by flouting multiple court-imposed deadlines and orders in the lawsuit. The case is one of two civil sexual assault lawsuits brought against Allen in 2023, derailing the singer's promising career; the first was settled in 2024.


GEFFEN RESPONDS – Music and film mogul David Geffen filed his first response to a bombshell abuse lawsuit from his estranged husband Donovan Michaels, calling them “a ludicrous and contrived attempt to humiliate Geffen in the court of public opinion and extract an out-of-court settlement.” The case from Michaels, a former exotic dancer 50 years Geffen's junior, claimed that the Hollywood powerhouse treated him as a “sexual commodity” for years.


KINGSTON SENTENCING – Sean Kingston was sentenced to 42 months (3.5 years) in prison and three years probation after being convicted of federal wire fraud over a scheme involving over $1 million in high-end cars, jewelry and other luxury goods. Kingston, who topped the charts with his 2007 “Beautiful Girls,” was convicted in March alongside his mother for essentially conning vendors into giving him merch – including a Cadillac Escalade and a massive LED television — by falsely promising payment.


FESTIVAL FRAUD – A new lawsuit claimed that a booking agent named Christopher Young lied about securing Doechii and SiR as headliners for a Baltimore music festival this summer, then snagged a nearly $200,000 deposit from the show's organizer and pocketed the cash even after his scheme unraveled. The suit claims that Young “never spoke to anyone” about Doechii and had only “preliminary conversations” about locking down SiR for the festival.

Five decades into her career, the Cuban American legend — along with Shakira, Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello and more — reflects on her legacy in Latin music.


													By
												

	Sigal Ratner-Arias


Deputy Editor, Billboard Español


Gloria Estefan remembers vividly the first time she met her husband, Emilio Estefan Jr. “He had short shorts, he had great legs, playing the accordion — he looked naked,” she says with a laugh while reflecting on a moment that would change their lives forever.


	She was at a friend's house putting a band together for one night, and Emilio, who knew her friend, showed up to give them some pointers. “I was sitting on the floor and I thought, ‘Wow, this guy has charisma,' ” she recalls. “He left, we did our gig, everybody went their separate ways.”

	











	That summer, the two would meet again at a wedding that her mother had dragged her to. He was part of the band, playing Van McCoy's “The Hustle” on the accordion when she spotted him — this time in a tux. “We run into each other in a doorway, and he goes, ‘You're that girl!' and I go, ‘Yeah, you're that guy.' ‘Come sing with the band!' And I go, ‘Ahhhh.' ” By then, she was known within the community, and many guests had heard her play guitar and sing since she was a kid.




			Trending on Billboard		







	So she obliged and performed two Latin classics, “Sabor a Mí” and “Tú Me Acostumbraste,” earning both an ovation from the guests and an invitation from Emilio to formally join the band. Gloria Maria Milagrosa Fajardo, then 18 years old, working two jobs and about to start college, politely declined.

	











	“He found my number and called me two weeks later,” Gloria continues, beaming. It was her grandmother who made her see the light. “‘You aren't going to be happy in your life unless you share your gift,' ” she recalls her saying. “ ‘Listen to me and not your mother.' And I did. I joined the band for fun.”


	“I really liked the metal in her voice,” Emilio says. “I thought there was a sound for the new generation that was bilingual — the Miami Sound — and I said, ‘This would be good, because it would be something new in the music industry, and she can sing both in English and Spanish.'


	“I think that Gloria and I, it was destiny, because we both found happiness in music amidst all the tragedy we were going through,” he adds. “I didn't have my mom, I didn't have anyone, and I was obsessed with being able to carry a sound that I thought was unique. And also, the need [as a Cuban immigrant] — everything I saved would be used to bring my mother, my brother, my whole family [to the U.S.].” As for Gloria, “I saw her sad — her father went to the Bay of Pigs. When he came back, he went to Vietnam, and when he came back from Vietnam, he came back in a wheelchair. But when it came to making music, her eyes shone.”


	Now that 50 years have passed, Gloria adds, “Every step of the way has continued to be fun.”


	Since rising to stardom in the 1980s as the lead vocalist of Miami Sound Machine and later as a solo artist, Gloria has helped infuse Latin flavor into English-language pop music, breaking barriers with hits like 1985's top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit “Conga” — which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame this year — and “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” — which was inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2017 — while also singing in Spanish.

	











	She has placed 29 songs on the Hot 100 — three of them at No. 1 (“Anything for You” in 1988, “Don't Wanna Lose You” in 1989 and “Coming Out of the Dark ” in 1991) — and 31 tracks on the Hot Latin Songs chart, 15 of which reached the top (from “Si Voy a Perderte” in 1989 to “Hotel Nacional” in 2012).


	Her first Spanish-language album, Mi Tierra (1993), spent an impressive 58 weeks at the summit of Top Latin Albums and earned her the first of her four Grammy Awards. Her latest, Raíces, debuted in the top 10 of the Tropical Albums chart, while the title track landed atop Latin Airplay, Tropical Airplay and Latin Pop Airplay. In between, 2000's Alma Caribeña debuted and spent seven weeks at No. 1 on Top Latin Albums and 2007's 90 Millas debuted and spent three weeks at the top of the same chart.


	“Gloria Estefan is a global icon, a true artist with endless talent, but above all, she's a wonderful person,” says Afo Verde, chairman/CEO of Sony Music Latin Iberia. “Her trust in Sony Music throughout her career speaks to a relationship based on professionalism, passion, love and respect. She's an essential part of the company's heart.”


	“Gloria Estefan represents the best of our music and our history,” adds Alex Gallardo, president of Sony Music U.S. Latin. “Her legacy is eternal, and her generosity and spirit continue to inspire all of us who have the privilege of working with her.”


	Gloria has also proved to be a talented author — she's written two children's books — and an actor with a comedic edge in her performance as the no-nonsense mother in the 2022 remake of Father of the Bride alongside Andy Garcia. She also co-hosted Red Table Talk: The Estefans, a spinoff of the popular talk show Red Table Talk, featuring her daughter, Emily Estefan, and niece Lili Estefan.

	











	It's a remarkable career for the Cuban American star, who in 2023 became the first Latina inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and in 2024 received the Legend Award at the Billboard Latin Women in Music ceremony for her lifetime achievements — all while balancing work and family and putting her loved ones first.


	And many have not only noticed but been inspired by her, inside and outside the Latin music world.


	“To have that sound and go mainstream, topping the pop charts, was groundbreaking and really incredible. What she and Miami Sound Machine did influenced music, food, television, fashion,” American pop icon Cyndi Lauper, her contemporary and friend, tells Billboard Español. “Gloria is a true cultural phenomenon. And on top of that, she and Emilio are the salt of the earth. Such great people, generosity of spirit, caring, leading by example to change to world. People throw these kinds of words around a lot, but the Estefans really did change the world.”


	“Gloria and Emilio have been a true family to me. They've always made me feel at home, and when the U.S. was a new country for me, they supported me every step of the way,” Colombian superstar Shakira recalls. “Gloria was a role model, a true inspiration … She accompanied me throughout my crossover as a mentor and a friend, helping me translate my lyrics from Spanish to English [for the 2001 album Laundry Service] while maintaining their essence when I hadn't yet mastered the language.”


	“Gloria is a hero to me, not only for being a pioneer in music and opening doors for Latinos in the industry but also for what she represents as a human being,” Cuban American star Camila Cabello says. “Beyond her talent, her humility, her passion for her people, her fight for our shared dream of a free Cuba make her even more admirable and adored by all.”

	











	A mother of two and a proud grandmother of one, Gloria now chooses her projects carefully, based not only on what moves her but also how much time and travel it will take. “A lot of it has to do with, ‘Is it going to take me away from my family?' ” she says. “If it's something that is going to take me away from my grandson's life and miss big chunks of it — that's high on my list of priorities. He is growing so fast.” She also feels she's earned that precious time. She will do an occasional concert but not a full, big tour like she used to in the '80s and '90s, when she was at the peak of her stardom. “[Touring] is wonderful because I get to be with the fans, but it is like boot camp for me,” she explains. “I've worked really hard in my life, and I think, ‘Did I really work that hard to work this hard?' ”


	In the last few years, she's been busy creating songs for an upcoming Broadway musical titled BASURA (Spanish for “garbage”) along with her daughter. Based on the 2015 award-winning documentary Landfill Harmonic, it will narrate the journey of Paraguay's Recycled Orchestra, a group of young artists who turn scrap material into musical instruments.


	So when Emilio presented her with the idea for the song “Raíces” a couple of years ago, Gloria, who usually writes or co-writes her own music, got excited.


	“Emilio didn't even realize [this year] was my 50th [career anniversary],” says Gloria, who wanted to do something special to celebrate. “I told him, ‘Babe, I can't change my mindset for this, but I would like, if I do an album again, for it to be tropical, for it to be in Spanish.' He says, ‘Do you trust me?' I go, ‘Who else am I going to trust [other] than you?' ”

	











	Released May 30 on Sony Music Latin, Raíces contains 13 tracks mostly co-written by Emilio. Salsa, bolero and tropical rhythms resonate in songs ranging from the title track and “La Vecina (No Sé Na')” to romantic tunes such as “Tan Iguales y Tan Diferentes,” “Te Juro,” “Agua Dulce” and “Tú y Yo.”


	“He wrote his own love songs for me to sing to him!” Gloria jokes.


	Among the songs she penned is the sweet “Mi Niño Bello (Para Sasha),” dedicated to her grandson, with an English version titled “My Beautiful Boy (For Sasha).” Another track on the album, “Cuando el Tiempo Nos Castiga” (co-written by Emilio and Gian Marco and originally recorded by Jon Secada in 2001), also has a new English version courtesy of Gloria titled “How Will You Be Remembered.”


	Gloria sat with Billboard for a trip down memory lane leading straight to the future.


Going back to your beginnings, what do you remember about your start in the music business? You've said in the past that you were shy.


	It's not that I was shy, because one-on-one I was perfectly fine and I could handle any situation. I was an observer. But what I don't like is to be the center of attention; that's just not my nature. So to join the band, it was for fun. I never thought, “Oh, I'm going to be famous,” or “I'm going to do these crazy things.” No.


And there was a really nice guy in that band…


	He was, but I saw him as a man. He was only four-and-a-half years older than me, but he was very responsible, and he took care of his parents. He worked during the day, he studied at night, he had side jobs, he had businesses. I saw him as “Oh, Mr. Estefan,” you know, the boss … I didn't start dating him until a year after. He had an older girlfriend, let me tell you. She was 36, he was 22. And I didn't think he would be interested in me. I had zero experience, never went out anywhere because I took care of my dad [who had multiple sclerosis]. Joining the band was a freeing experience, and marrying him was an even more freeing experience. I didn't think I'd get married the day after I turned 21. I had no doubt that I wanted to be with him the rest of my life. We've made a very unique partnership, and a lot of the things we've accomplished [are] because we're together.

	











When did you realize that you had really made it in music?


	When “Conga” crossed charts in Billboard, I thought, “OK, they're getting it, they're understanding what we have believed all along could happen.” And look, that song is now going to the Grammy Hall of Fame [after] 40 years.


Which three songs do you consider to be the most important in your career and why?


	“Conga,” clearly. Probably “Mi Tierra.” And “Con Los Años Que Me Quedan,” [which] became a love song and a wedding song and it's the first song that Emilio and I wrote together way back in the day. But there are so many more!


OK, tell me two more.


	If we're going to be real, “Dr. Beat,” which actually broke through, but I didn't write that one. “Anything for You,” my very first No. 1. And “Coming Out of the Dark,” which was a big thank-you to everyone that sent prayers my way after the accident. That song poured out of me in 10 minutes. [In March 1990, Gloria was in a tour bus accident that resulted in a broken back and temporary paralysis. She underwent surgery and a lengthy recovery.]


I remember the first time you sang it live, at the American Music Awards.


	Oh, gosh, it was insane. I wanted to kill Emilio because Dick Clark had called Emilio in September [1990], so I was still at a point where I couldn't move by myself anywhere. And Emilio actually came to me to tell me that Dick Clark wanted me to perform the following January. I was inside this body that didn't feel familiar. I was relearning everything: how to walk, how to wash my face and not be in pain. The last thing that I'm going to think about is getting on a stage. I want to be able to walk and get a glass of water by myself. I want to not put my family through what I went through [with my father] if I could help it. He was nuts. I said, “Babe, I can't.” And then he told Dick Clark, “I can't convince her; you're going have to.” And Dick Clark got on a plane and flew to Miami to talk me into [the performance].

	











Did that help you with the recovery in any way?


	It did. Emilio, as usual, was right. My first outing three months after the accident was to the studio, because I felt so bad for him that he hadn't left my side. He said, “I have this piece of paper that I wrote this thing on the day you had the accident, in the helicopter. I found it today in my pant pocket.” It was all washed. He hands it to me. I look at it and I go, “Why is it in English?” (Laughs.) And it said: “Coming out of the dark.” He said, “I would love for you to come to the studio. Jon Secada is going to meet me there.” And I went, for him. And when I heard the one melody line of (Sings.) “coming out of the dark” that Jon sang, it was like, Oh, my God. And it all poured through me. That's what I was going to perform at the American Music Awards. Having that goal really helped me to focus and not just deambular [wander]. Even though every day I was focused on getting better, it gave me a date to shoot for.


Is there anything you miss doing or wish you could do without being recognized?


	Nothing stops me from doing anything I want. I was talking to my grandson about that the other day, because he and I would get in a car and go to an escape room and inevitably someone would ask for a picture. He knows I'm always going to stop. He always says, “I'll take the picture.” He's very kind about it. My kids lived a different experience, because that part of it — when you are at the top, you literally can't go anywhere because it becomes impossible. It creates a scene, people go crazy, you divert from the kids. Even though I told them, “If we're in public, I'm never going to say no to an autograph, because we have a moment to either make them happy or possibly traumatized from approaching anyone.” They understood, but it was harder for them. That's why I love this moment when, yes, we have a beautiful career and I still get the love, people ask me for hugs, but it's not the craziness of that moment when you're new, fresh; the fame is huge.

	











As one of the most stable and beloved couples in Latin music, how do you and Emilio keep the spark alive?


	Oh, my gosh. He makes me laugh every day. And if he goes on a trip, I'll go to brush my teeth and there's a little note: “Babe, I'm going to miss you.” He draws a little thing, him with the guitar or something. He's just very sweet and thoughtful. He would buy me stuff all year-round, to the point where I tell him, “Babe, please, I don't need any more jewelry,” but he's happy doing that. Me mima, he spoils me in so many ways. And I try to do the same for him. We're excited, we love being with each other, we miss each other. We don't sleep the same when we're apart. It just becomes deeper, and there's a lot of respect and admiration.


Is there anything you still would like to achieve professionally?


	This was always my go-to answer, and it's getting a little more difficult to envision it, but if it were to happen within the next few years, to sing in a free Cuba. Somehow that dream, every time we feel a piece of it — like what happened July 11 [of 2021 with the anti-government demonstrations] and we thought, “Oh, maybe this is it, maybe this is the moment” — it dissipates under the crushing weight of that dictatorship. Celia [Cruz] had that dream, too, and it wasn't in the cards.


As the closing song on Raíces, “How Will You Be Remembered,” goes, how do you wish to be remembered?


	I actually wrote a song answering that exact question years ago, and the title is “Remember Me With Love.” That's all I hope. That when people think about me, either because of my music or the way I represented the culture or family life, they remember me with love, there's a smile on their face and they play the music a lot.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Black-ish creator Kenya Barris is returning to broadcast television with a multi-camera comedy at CBS starring Mike Epps, which is executive produced by Aaron Kaplan of Kapital Entertainment. 


	Created and written by Barris, the comedy comes from BET Studios, where Barris is a principal, and is co-produced by CBS supplier CBS Studios. This marks a rare collaboration between the two studios which are now part of Paramount Chair of TV Media George Cheeks' portfolio.


	In the untitled half-hour, after wildfires sweep through Altadena, two estranged Black brothers — one played by Epps — reunite to sell their late grandmother's house to private developers. But when they learn her caretaker now owns part of the home and refuses to sell, they're forced to live together and confront their differences — and what community, legacy, and family really mean.

	Altadena, a diverse area known for its strong Black community and culture, was devastated by the January 2025 Eaton fire, which killed at least 19 people and destroyed more than 9,000 buildings, with thousands of residents losing their homes and most of their possessions.

	There had been speculation that Epps and Barris may be playing the two brothers but only Epps is attached as an actor for now.  Barris is executive producing through his Khalabo Ink Society. Also executive producing are Epps and his producing partner Niles Kirchner as well as Kaplan.


	The comedy reunites Epps with Barris after the comedian appeared in Barris' 2023 Netflix movie You People. It marks Barris' return to broadcast where he created and executive produced the praised ABC comedy seres black-ish, which spawned a franchise for Disney. 


	Epps stars in and executive produces Netflix's sitcom The Upshaws, which is heading into its fifth and final season. It has been nominated for 10 NAACP Image Awards, with Epps winning for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series in 2024. He is repped by UTA, Artists First and Yorn Levine Barnes.

	











	Barris' Khalabo Ink Society has The Vince Staples Show for Netflix and Diarra From Detroit for BET+, both renewed for a second season, and recently produced the Amazon MGM movie The Underdoggs. The company is in various stages of development on several series, including Group Chat, a collaboration with Kim Kardashian based on LaLa Anthony's best-selling book The Love Playbook, which has a pilot order at Hulu; The Book of Jose, which chronicles the life of rapper Fat Joe; and a limited series about the life and legacy of legendary comedian Richard Pryor. 


	Barris is repped by WME and has a new management company, LBI Entertainment. He is also with Yorn Levine Barnes.

Nothing says comedy like a devasting wildfire that destroyed people's lives.

100-year disaster and Hollywood has dollar signs in its eyes. So tacky.

Probably going to film it in Vancouver, too.

I'd love to see this film in Altadena/LA

it's gonna be budapest standing in for eaton canyon

			By Glenn Garner, Rosy Cordero 


EXCLUSIVE: Marlon Wayans is adapting the popular Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation's S. Korean game show Midnight Horror Story for U.S. audiences, with his producing partner Rick Alvarez, through their Ugly Baby Productions and Craig and Clara Plestis of Smart Dog Media (The Masked Singer).


	Smart Dog Media is collaborating for a second time with MBC Korea to bring a popular S. Korean game show to the States, building on their success with Fox's The Masked Singer (known originally as King of Mask Singer).


	The U.S. version will feature well-known actors who, in each episode, will deliver chilling yet comedic stories, brought to life through immersive, cinematic reenactments, according to the official logline. The set itself will surround performers in the sights and sounds of each tale, heightening the fear factor. 

	











	The goal is for each celebrity to use their acting prowess to tell the scariest story. The show's hidden mystic audience of spirits (a mix of live in-studio and virtual audience members) will illuminate a candle whenever they find a story truly frightening. The celebrity who earns the most candles will be crowned the winner. The new series will amplify the comedy elements as a key factor of the format. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	MBC's Midnight Horror Story premiered with a 1.8% nationwide rating, according to Nielsen Korea, for both parts of its first episode, outperforming competing programs in the same time slot. The episode featured hosts Shin Dong-yup, Kim Sook, Park Na-rae, Hwang Je-seong, and Heo Anna sharing viewer-submitted ghost stories. 

	











	The game show, now in its fifth season, continues to be popular with viewers, and it has expanded significantly into the digital space. The core audience is younger viewers, who primarily watch via OTT and YouTube rather than live TV, MBC touts. Seventy-nine clips of Midnight Horror Story have surpassed 1 million views on YouTube, with the most popular reaching 3.94 million views.


	“With the success of Scary Movie and the ‘A Haunted House' franchise, Rick and I have always had an affinity for the mash-up of horror and comedy. This project fits perfectly in our wheelhouse,” shared Wayans.


	The duo launched Ugly Baby Productions in 2013 to produce filmed entertainment with an entrepreneurial spirit that reaches large global audiences. They have had three #1 global hits on Netflix: Naked, Sextuplets, and The Curse of Bridge Hollow; the indie franchise A Haunted House; Marlon Wayans: Good Grief on Amazon Prime Video; the documentary Unraveling George; and three comedy specials on HBO Max: Marlon Wayans: God Loves Me, Marlon Wayans: You Know What It Is, and Marlon Wayans Presents: The Headliners. Their TV credits include the NBC comedy Marlon, the NBC celebrity competition show I Can Do That, and the TBS comedy competition series Funniest Wins, among others.


	Next up, Ugly Baby Productions will produce the sixth installment of the “Scary Movie” franchise for Paramount and Miramax. The film is set to hit theaters on June 12, 2026. Wayans is repped by 3 Arts, UTA, and Yorn, Levine. Alvarez is repped by 3 Arts, UTA, and Yorn, Levine.


	Emmy award-winning Smart Dog Media, with the Plestises at the helm, is looking to replicate their huge global success with The Masked Singer with Midnight Horror Story. Both were created by MBC Korea and exclusively adapted for the American market by Smart Dog. Through their collaboration with Wayans, Smart Dog is looking to bring another reality competition show to the U.S. They are repped by Paradigm.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","RHOC's Tamra Judge Opens Up About Her Marriage & ‘Toughest Years'","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/rhoc-tamra-judge-marriage-update-eddie/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 14:02:34 GMT","

Fans of the “Real Housewives of Orange County” are well aware of how difficult a time Tamra Judge has had lately. She has been on her own healing journey while trying to support Teddi Mellencamp through stage 4 cancer, and then Tamra jumped back into the Bravo TV mix. Outside looking in, it all seemed like a perfect storm of stressors that could easily lead to precisely the kind of meltdown that Tamra has had.

Luckily, Tamra has a great support system in place, beginning with her ride or die husband, Eddie Judge. She recently chatted with BravoTV.com about how Eddie has helped her navigate one of the toughest years of her life.

When the reality star was asked about how Eddie has handled her emotional roller coaster, Tamra said,  “My husband has been my biggest supporter, my biggest cheerleader. He loves me so much, and he just wants me to do what's right for me or what's healthy. And he's always there for me, so I can't complain.”

Season 19 of the “Real Housewives of Orange County” has been full of ongoing conflicts, and then it seems to have just ripped the band-aid off of Tamra's old feud with Gretchen Rossi.

“You guys are watching my emotional journey happen right here on The Real Housewives of Orange County. It's been definitely a difficult situation for me because I'm not really great with my emotions, but I'm trying to get through it the best that I can. Stop judging me.”

Tamra's breaking point in filming came during a cast trip to New Orleans, the last place that she had traveled to with Teddi. She was already emotional, and then a dinner loaded with conflict was the last straw. She stormed off and then ended up in a car on the phone with Eddie, asking him to book her a flight home.

“I feel not loved and not wanted, and I just don't think there's a place for me in this group,” Tamra later explained in a confessional. While she appeared to quit the series, Andy Cohen recently gave an update on Tamra's status on “Watch What Happens Live.”

When RHOC cast member Heather Dubrow joined Andy in the clubhouse on Aug. 14, 2025, and they discussed the explosive fight. Andy asked Heather, “Did you truly believe she was quitting?” Heather then replied with, “Yes and no.” Andy then confirmed that Tamra did not quit the series.

Do you think that Eddie's rock-solid support will be enough to anchor Tamra through another season on RHOC?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Bravo Star Brittany Cartwright Has Found Her ‘Sparkle' Again","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/bravo-brittany-cartwright-happy-sparkle-update/","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 18:12:49 GMT","

After months of stress and sadness while navigating her split from Jax Taylor, Brittany Cartwright is finally beginning to feel like herself again. “The Valley” star is working hard to put the past behind her, while focusing on all of the exciting things that lie ahead.

Cartwright recently appeared on the “Detox Retox With Tom Schwartz” podcast to discuss getting her “sparkle” back.

The former “Vanderpump Rules” star popped up on Tom Schwartz's podcast to give everyone a bit of a life update. Right off the bat, Schwartz asked Brittany about getting her sparkle back again. “On a scale from 1 to 10, everyone wants to know, how's your sparkle?” 

“My sparkle is coming back,” Brittany said. “It's like eight out of 10. I'm in a much better place than I was last summer. It's time for new beginnings.” He later led her in a meditation that had Brittany saying, “I'm calm, very sparkly, and a beautiful woman.”

If the reality star's latest Instagram carousel is an indicator, then life has turned around for her. Brittany glows in her latest snaps, which feature her swimming with her song, dining with her “The Valley” castmates, and an introduction to her new pup, Dolly.

Brittany captioned the post, “Lately” with a sparkle emoji.

A post shared by Brittany Cartwright 💛 (@brittany)

Brittany's top priority now is the son that she shares with Jax. When Andy Cohen asked during ‘The Valley” reunion how co-parenting was going, she made it very clear that it's going to take a lot for her to trust any words that come out of Jax's mouth. His actions will have to back up his words for a long time before she will believe he has changed.

As far as trying new things goes, Brittany has joined the cast of  “Special Forces: World's Toughest Test Season 4.” She discussed it with Schwartz on his podcast, saying, “I'm glad I did it, cause it was something different, something to push myself with everything that's going on in my life. It felt like something that was needed.”

“It was the toughest thing I've ever done in my life,” she continued. “I've been very open about heights and how that terrifies me. So doing different things like that, I'm proud of myself.”

Where would you like to see Brittany pop up next? Should she stick with “The Valley”?

Every year, fans, critics, and industry artists complain about one or two shows stealing a spotlight that's capable of covering many, many more programs. And every year, the problem only seems to get worse. In 2021, “The Crown” and “The Queen's Gambit” won 11 times — each! Subsequent seasons weren't so redundant, but only by the slimmest of margins: “The White Lotus” and “The Bear” landed 10 trophies apiece in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Then, just last year, “The Bear” topped itself with 11 wins and “Shōgun” won 18 times! 18! I love “Shōgun,” and it was a particularly weak year for drama nominees (if anything, it deserved one more win — for Tadanobu Asano), but still: Only four other shows had at least 18 nominations. There are other shows!

The ceremony's monotony is one thing. Hearing the same thank you's from the same cast and creators, over and over, is a problem, sure, but it's not what's keeping the Emmys from higher ratings. The larger issue is the voters' conformity. People who make television may not have enough time to watch television — Hollywood, by and large, can be a) very busy, and b) shockingly disinterested in its own creations — but the tens of thousands of TV Academy members who vote on the Emmys have a responsibility to broaden their horizons whenever possible. And while the ideal time to do that is before voting on the nominees, the procrastinating majority out there can at least watch all the nominees before picking the winners.

IndieWire is here to help. As in years past, we're putting a frontrunner under the spotlight — in this case, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's “The Studio” — to assess just how big a night it deserves to have. Can it break “The Bear's” record for most Emmys by a comedy in a single season? It would have to top 11 wins, which is very well could do, given it's competing in 18 categories and there's quite a bit of love out there for the show, its cast, creators, and crew.

Voters can use this article as a handy resource — a study guide for the responsible among you who've already watched everything, and a cheat sheet for the truly time-crunched who may not know why people are buzzing about Bryan Cranston's finale performance or Adam Newport-Berra's “Oner” cinematography. Meanwhile, non-voters can better prepare for Emmy night. While your friends take to Bluesky with extreme reactions to “The Studio” over-performing or underperforming, you can lay out exactly why the final tally ended up where it did, with logic and evidence. And for those of you mainly interested in who will win, rather than who should, make sure to keep checking IndieWire Awards Editor Marcus Jones' Emmy predictions.

Maybe you'll disagree with a few picks. Maybe you'll be surprised by a few others. (I know I was.) But we'll all be better informed come Emmys night — and hopefully voters long before that.

Style note: For categories where each nominated program consists of multiple individual artists, not all names are listed. It's just a space issue. Full credits can be found on the Emmys' website.

Nope.

Nominees:
– “The Bear” (Ayo Edebiri)
– “Hacks” (Lucia Aniello)
– “Mid-Century Modern” (James Burrows)
– “The Rehearsal” (Nathan Fielder)
– “The Studio” (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg)

Oners will likely win the day — and I, too, often find myself entranced by all the moving pieces coming together so naturally, and looking so good while doing it — but the same could be said of Nathan Fielder's work on “The Rehearsal,” especially in the nominated episode, “Pilot's Code.” Fans remember it as “The Sully Episode,” in which the writer, director, and star becomes heralded pilot Sully Sullenberger for reasons that defy succinct explanation, yet come to life with moving clarity and absolute hilarity in one of the year's best pieces of entertainment (and yet it's only the second or third best episode of “The Rehearsal” Season 2). It's a testament to Fielder's vision that any of his markedly ambitious show works, let alone thrives, so I'm giving this one to Fielder — though I fully expect the TV Academy to reward Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, which is fine!

Yup.

Nominees:
– “Emily in Paris” (Seamus Tierney)
– “Georgie and Mandy's First Mariage” (Buzz Feltshans IV)
– “Hacks” (Adam Bricker)
– “The Righteous Gemstones” (Paul Daley)
– “The Studio” (Adam Newport-Berra)

At IndieWire, we're big fans of “The Righteous Gemstones” and its Civil War era Season 4 opener, so if Paul Daley can snag the HBO comedy's first Emmy here, we're not going to complain. But yeah, sorry, it should probably go to “The Studio.” Its nominated episode is, of course, “The Oner,” which reflects Matt's anxiety and excitement over shooting a pivotal scene as a long, continuous shot (a “oner”) by capturing the entire episode in the same fashion. It looks great, it pieces together perfectly, and it's a stylish choice that fits the episodic story and the series' overall ethos.

Not quite.

Nominees:
– “Abbott Elementary” (Quinta Brunson)
– “Hacks” (Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs, Jen Statsky)
– “The Rehearsal” (Nathan Fielder, Carrie Kemper, Adam Locke-Norton, Eric Notarnicola)
– “Somebody Somewhere” (Hannah Bos, Paul Thureen, Bridget Everett)
– “The Studio” (Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory, Frida Perez)
– “What We Do in the Shadows” (Sam Johnson, Sarah Naftalis, Paul Simms)

“The Studio” isn't even nominated for its best episode — “Casting” is elite comedy writing — and while I respect the tradition to recognize a new series' premiere episode, it doesn't stack up to the killer competition. “The Rehearsal's” Sully entry is mind-bendingly exquisite, “What We Do in the Shadows'” finale is a clever triumph, and “Somebody Somewhere” ends with such an emotional wallop, I forgive its inclusion despite not being all that funny. Heck, I might even vote for it, but the point remains: “The Studio” is maybe fourth-best among the Outstanding Writing nods.

Yes?

Nominees:
– “Abbott Elementary” (Moira Frazier)
– “Emily in Paris” (Carole Nicolas)
– “Hacks” (Aubrey Marie)
– “The Penguin” (Brian Badie)
– “The Studio” (Vanessa Price)
– “The White Lotus” (Mila Kovero)

I'm sure “Emily in Paris” does plenty of wild ‘dos, and “The White Lotus” had to overcome unbearable humidity to keep everyone looking that good, but I find myself routinely transfixed by Kathryn Hahn's fauxhawk-ponytail hairstyle in “The Studio.” It's not so elaborate that it distracts from the plot, but it's just advanced enough to be exactly what her character would want — edgy, exclusive, and impeccable (not to mention impossible for a rube like me to properly identify).

Nope.

Nominees:
– “Emily in Paris” (Marylin Fitoussi)
– “Hacks” (Kathleen Felix-Hager)
– “The Righteous Gemstones” (Christina Flannery)
– “The Studio” (Kameron Lennox)
– “The White Lotus” (Alex Bovaird)

Just. Look. At. These. LOOKS. It's “The Righteous Gemstones” all the way, baby. Praise Teenjus!

Not really.

Nominees:
– “The Bear” (Joanna Naugle)
– “Hacks” (Susan Vaill)
– “The Rehearsal” (Stacy Moon)
– “The Studio” (Eric Kissack)
– “What We Do in the Shadows” (Yana Gorskaya and Dane McMaster)

While trying to avoid bias toward whatever nominee did the most editing, this one has to go to Yana Gorskaya and Dane McMaster for the “What We Do in the Shadows” finale, right? Not only does the clever, layered conclusion balance a number of delicate tonal shifts, but it also shot and inserted three different “perfect endings” to support the idea that Nadja hypnotized the audience into seeing whatever dream ending they desired. Randomly dropping in a spoof of “Newhart,” “Rosemary's Baby,” or “The Usual Suspects” isn't some grand innovation in editing, but it does speak to how much love and creativity went into making every scene in every episode of this brilliant sitcom. Plus, it's one more joke to land for an editing team that amplified so many.

No!

Nominees:
– “Andor” (Brandon Roberts)
– “Based on a True Story” (Sherri Chung)
– “Cobra Kai” (Leo Birenberg and Zach Robinson)
– “Severance” (Theodore Shapiro)
– “The Studio” (Antonio Sanchez)
– “The White Lotus” (Cristobal Tapla de Veer)

It's “Andor.” Obviously. Just listen to it. Magnificent.

Kind of, but not really.

Nominees:
– “Hacks” (Matt Biffa)
– “The Last of Us” (Evyen Klean, Ian Broucek, and Scott Hanau)
– “The Righteous Gemstones” (DeVoe Yates and Gabe Hilfer)
– “Severance” (George Drakoullas)
– “The Studio” (Gabe Hilfer)
– “The White Lotus” (Gabe Hilfer)

What a year for Gabe Hilfer! Before this year's three nominations, he had two nods— for “Ozark” in 2022 and “The White Lotus” in 2023 — the latter of which he won for. Does he deserve another? Yes, I think so, though my vote is for “The Righteous Gemstones,” a comedy whose curated song selections span quite a range of eras and styles, while offering up plenty of toe-tapping favorites.

Yes!

Nominees:
– “The Bear” (Jeanie Bacharach and Maggie Bacharach)
– “Hacks” (Linda Lowy and Morgan Smith)
– “Only Murders in the Building” (Bernard Telsey, Tiffany Little Canfield, and Destiny Lilly)
– “Shrinking” (Debby Romano and Brett Benner)
– “The Studio” (Melissa Kostenbauder and Francine Maisler)

No matter how you look at the race, “The Studio” has an edge. Are you wowed by the A-list guest stars on “The Bear” and “Only Murders in the Building”? Well, “The Studio” has even more. Do you value the chemistry found in a core ensemble like “Shrinking” and “Hacks”? Great, but “The Studio's” series regulars had to bond on the fly, with no room for error — all those long takes — and they've coalesced nicely in just one season. Plus, Melissa Kostenbauder and Francine Maisler snagged so many stars from this year's other Emmy-nominated shows, including “Hacks” co-creators Jen Statsky and Lucia Aniello, as well as its star, Jean Smart. If you're going to make a meta show about modern Hollywood and promise movie stars, you have to overdeliver — with big names and cinephile favorites alike. “The Studio” did that, and then some.

No, not really.

Nominees:
– “Hacks” (Rob Tokarz)
– “Mid-Century Modern” (Greg Grande)
– “Only Murders in the Building” (Patrick Howe)
– “The Studio” (Julie Berghoff)
– “What We Do in the Shadows” (Shayne Fox)

With all due respect to the difficulty of designing around so many long takes, this one has to go to “What We Do in the Shadows.” The four-time nominee for Outstanding Production Design has yet to win, falling to “The Mandalorian” in 2020 and “Only Murders in the Building” in both 2023 and 2024. Patrick Howe's inventive work merits reconsideration more than your typical repeat winner, as “Only Murders” finds clever and eye-catching ways to incorporate each season's themes (from Broadway to Hollywood), but the team behind “What We Do in the Shadows” is long overdue, and the final season features exciting settings like Guillermo's office, Nandor's war room, and everything in the penultima episode, “Come Out and Play.” FX's excellent sitcom benefits greatly from its inspired design work. Voters shouldn't miss their last chance to recognize as much.

Nah.

Nominees:
– “The Acolyte”
– “Agatha All Along”
– “The Bear”
– “The Righteous Gemstones”
– “The Studio”

With no animated titles nominated this year, my priority turns to soundscapes that have been built largely (not entirely) from scratch, and that favors “The Acolyte” and “Agatha All Along.” Both require their audio engineers to invent nonexistent sounds, whether it's force battles or witchcraft, and the standards set by these franchises' big-screen predecessors means there's a lot to live up to. I'd probably vote for “The Acolyte,” but either way, “The Studio” would be further down the ballot.

Ummmmm, yes, OK, yeah.

Nominees:
– “The Bear” (Scott D. Smith)
– “Mid-Century Modern” (Jeff A. Johnson)
– “Only Murders in the Building” (Joseph White Jr.)
– “Shrinking” (Anna D. Wilborn)
– “The Studio” (Buck Robinson)

As a reminder: Sound Mixing recognizes work done almost completely in post-production, where created, added, and recorded sounds are balanced against each other. “The Bear” has won two years in a row (which I advocated for last year), and another trophy would be more than warranted. But given “The Studio's” preference for long takes, I have to imagine there's a lot of tricky ADR work that can't be as easily masked with an edit. Layer on the noises from a busy casino (in full operation), fully-finished scenes from a variety of fake movies, and the crowds at CinemaCon and the Golden Globes, and “The Studio” team had their work cut out for them.

Naaahhhh.

Nominees:
– Olivia Colman, “The Bear”
– Jamie Lee Curtis, “The Bear”
– Cynthia Erivo, “Poker Face”
– Robby Hoffman, “Hacks”
– Zoë Kravitz, “The Studio”
– Julianne Nicholson, “Hacks”

Kravitz is fun in “The Studio,” but there's a little too much self-awareness in her comedic scenes (especially when her character is tripping on mushrooms). In comparison, Julianne Nicholson is fiercely, courageously committed to the bit, and her drug-addled performance benefits greatly from going all-in.

Still, I gotta go with Cynthia Erivo. Not only does she play multiple parts with razor-sharp specificity, but she understands the baked-in sense of humor her heavily accented roles require. She doesn't reach too far but doesn't do too little either. She lives in just the right zone, making it easy to enjoy her “Poker Face” episode as much as her work in it.

Yes, duh.

Nominees:
– Jon Bernthal, “The Bear”
– Bryan Cranston, “The Studio”
– Dave Franco, “The Studio”
– Ron Howard, “The Studio”
– Anthony Mackie, “The Studio”
– Martin Scorsese, “The Studio”

Bryan Cranston gives the best performance (and the most substantial, given his screen time and significance to the story), but Martin Scorsese would be a worthy winner, too. Great work. (And sorry, but Bernthal — as the only not “Studio” nominee — isn't in a comedy, nor is he giving a comedic performance, so there's no good argument there.)

Nah.

Nominees:
– Ike Barinholtz, “The Studio”
– Colman Domingo, “The Four Seasons”
– Harrison Ford, “Shrinking”
– Jeff Hiller, “Somebody Somewhere”
– Ebon Moss-Bachrach, “The Bear”
– Michael Urie, “Shrinking”
– Bowen Yang, “SNL”

As much as everyone would love to see Barinholtz take the stage and recreate Sal Saperstein's Golden Globes moment, this one has to go to one of two other people: Harrison Ford, who's doing some of the best work of his career on an otherwise forgettable sad-com, or Jeff Hiller, whose endearing breakthrough on the best show of 2024 demands a shelf filled with awards. Personally, I'd vote Hiller (and, side note, I do believe he can win), but for the purposes of this exercise, “The Studio's” submission is at least third on the ballot. (But Barinholtz is very, very good! “The War” is a Top 3 “Studio” episode!) 

It physically pains me to say this, but no.

Nominees:
– Liza Colón-Zayas, “The Bear”
– Hannah Einbinder, “Hacks”
– Kathryn Hahn, “The Studio”
– Janelle James, “Abbott Elementary”
– Catherine O'Hara, “The Studio”
– Sheryl Lee Ralph, “Abbott Elementary”
– Jessica Williams, “Shrinking”

If Kathryn Hahn wins her first Emmy or Catherine O'Hara wins her third Emmy, both for “The Studio,” I will be thrilled. They give the best performances on a series filled with memorable, enthusiastic work, and they're both icons in their own right.

But Hannah Einbinder is looooooong overdue for her “Hacks” Emmy, and she's going to be the rightful pick every year until she's handed a trophy. (Others are bothered by what they see as category fraud, arguing Einbinder should be considered in Lead Actress… but while Ava may be a co-lead with Deborah, in no way can Einbinder and Jean Freaking Smart be seen on equal footing, especially dating back to when the series first began, which is when Max/HBO/HBO Max had to pick their categories. So she's fine to compete here, and she should win no matter where she's nominated.)

You know what? Yes.

Nominees:
– Adam Brody, “Nobody Wants This”
– Seth Rogen, “The Studio”
– Jason Segal, “Shrinking”
– Martin Short, “Only Murders in the Building”
– Jeremy Allen White, “The Bear”

First and foremost, I want to acknowledge the naysayers. Does Seth Rogen do anything that different from what he usually does? No, not really. Are the demands in terms of emotional dexterity placed upon Jeremy Allen White, Jason Segel, and Adam Brody greater than those required of Rogen? Yeah, probably. But White already has two Emmys in this category, and the only thing that matters to him (and everyone) in 2025 is that he nails his Bruce Springsteen biopic. Segel sure gets weepy and loud in “Shrinking,” but he's also the biggest impediment to enjoying the series, so he's out, and Brody could handle playing a rom-com's hot rabbi in his sleep. None of them, really, are comedic leads anyway, so the only real competition for Rogen is Short, who I would love to see win, but this year — and likely only this year — we have to consider the burden on each actor.

Short has been tearing through “Only Murders” for four years now, getting ever more comfortable in a character just as tailor-made to his talents as Rogen's fretful studio boss is his. Meanwhile, Rogen is the lead of a heavily scrutinized, semi-meta comedy filled with massive stars and built on many, many lengthy takes. From an execution level, the difficulty is high, and expectations are even higher; he has to be good enough that audiences are eager to keep watching him, rather than suffering through his scenes while they wait for the next A-lister to show up. “The Studio” never feels that way, and Rogen's lead performance is a big reason why. So yes, give him the Emmy.

No, but it's close!

Nominees:
– “Abbott Elementary”
– “The Bear”
– “Hacks”
– “Nobody Wants This”
– “Only Murders in the Building”
– “Shrinking”
– “The Studio”
– “What We Do in the Shadows”

“What We Do in the Shadows” is the obvious choice — “Hacks” and “Only Murders” had down years, “The Bear” is officially up for Season 3, which is its worst, and the rest range of the nominees from pretty good (“Abbott Elementary”) to fleeting entertainment (“Nobody Wants This”). That leaves “The Studio” to square off with “Shadows,” and seven stellar seasons of real-life vampires trumps one solid season of vampiric movie executives. (And if you're hung up on only voting for the eligible seasons, as you probably should be, the “Shadows” finale tops any episode of “The Studio,” which should help give it the edge overall.)

Final Tally: “The Studio” should win six (6) Emmys at the 77th Annual Emmy Awards (out of 18 categories and 23 total nominations). Oddly enough, that's the exact same number of wins we said “The Bear” deserved last year — from the same number of categories and the same number of nominations — when it ended up with a record-setting 11 Emmys. So come September 14, “The Studio” should feel pretty good about making history!

Tyler, the Creator may have just released a new album, but he's not quite done with last year's Chromakopia. Today, the rapper shared a new self-directed video for the latter LP's Teezo Touchdown-featuring “I, Darling,” in which Tyler woos a series of women in various, eye-popping scenes. The clip features a host of cameos, too, including Ayo Edebiri (who previously appeared in the video for “Noid”), Nia Long, Willow Smith, Teezo Touchdown, and more. Check out the clip below.

Tyler, the Creator dropped Chromakopia last October. He accompanied the release with music videos for the songs “Thought I Was Dead,” “St. Chroma,” and “Noid.” This past July, he released Chromakopia's follow-up, Don't Tap the Glass, after announcing it mere days earlier. That album's  rollout, so far, has featured videos for “Stop Playing With Me” and “Sugar on My Tongue.” Tyler remains on tour in support of Chromakopia.

	President Donald Trump has signed 191 executive orders from his desk in the Oval Office since taking office in January. His recent orders have focused on ramping up his efforts to embolden law enforcement across the country, as well as attempting to ban mail-in voting and allow law enforcement to displace and institutionalize unhoused people. Meanwhile, these critical and consequential decisions are being made in the ugliest room in the White House, according to musician Jack White.


	“Look at how disgusting trump has transformed the historic White House,” White shared on Instagram, where he published an image of Trump's recent meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky. Following a recent redesign, the Oval Office is now covered in harsh yellow-gold accents, like Halloween costume jewelry from a Party City clearance bin. “It's now a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler's dressing room. Can't wait for the UFC match on the front lawn too.” 

A post shared by Jack White (@officialjackwhite)


	In the image, White tagged WWE Hall of Famer Ric Flair in place of Trump. He also compared the president to Idiocracy, the 2006 film in which an anti-intellectualism movement leads to the functional collapse on the United States. “He's almost fully achieved the movie,” White said. The only difference is that the president in Idiocracy was actively seeking out help from intelligent people.

	In July, Trump boasted about the new design. “I picked it all myself. I'm very proud of it,” he said, per USA  Today. Barbara Res, who previously oversaw construction as the former vice president at Trump Organization, told the publication that Trump “used the word ‘class' a lot, and it was a high-class thing for him. It conveyed an illusion of taste and wealth, and that's why he wanted to gild everything.”

	











	White describes Trump's choices differently. “Look at his disgusting taste, would you even buy a used car from this conman, let alone give him the nuclear codes?” the musician asked. “A gold plated trump bible would look perfect up on that mantle with a pair of trump shoes on either side wouldn't it? What an embarrassment to American history. Also pictured in this photograph, a REAL leader of a nation in a black suit.”

F
ew foods are more recognizable — or more American — than the cheeseburger. It's a staple of fast food and backyard barbecues, served in rations to soldiers and on silver platters to presidents. Politicians invoke it as a symbol of abundance, nostalgia, even patriotism. Its parts — beef, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, bun — are so familiar they barely register as something grown, cultivated, or hauled.


	Americans consume an estimated 50 billion burgers each year. Together, those billions of burgers represent a vast system that spans thousands of miles and millions of immigrant workers, most of whom never appear in the advertising.


	To understand just how dependent American agriculture is on immigrant labor, one need only trace the anatomy of a cheeseburger: onions from Idaho, lettuce from Arizona, beef from Kansas feedlots, cheese from Wisconsin dairies. 


	Each ingredient offers a glimpse into the people who grow, process, and deliver it — and the immigration policies that threaten to upend the system.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“More and more of our farmers are at the point of last resort when it comes to labor,” says James O'Neill of the American Business Immigration Coalition. “There is no area of agriculture that is currently not touched by the labor shortage.” He adds, “If half the labor is gone, production is cut in half. Supply is halved, but demand stays the same.”


	Latino immigrants make up the majority of the U.S. agricultural workforce. Federal data from 2021 to 2022 shows that nearly seven in 10 crop workers were born outside of the country, and roughly 42 percent were working without legal authorization.

	











	At the same time, farming-dependent counties during the recent election overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump, whose immigration agenda includes sweeping deportations. In April, Trump signed a series of executive orders compelling local authorities to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.


	One of the first areas the administration has targeted has been agriculture. The Department of Homeland Security has begun carrying out large-scale worksite raids, including on farmland, prompting many farmworkers to stay home. The result is a system under strain. Or, as Shay Myers, one of the country's largest onion farmers, puts it, “We don't grow food in this country without immigrants. Period.”

	From the air, Myers' Owyhee Produce — an expansive Idaho onion operation — looks like a patchwork of dusty rectangles: more than 1,600 acres of onions, lined with drip tape. On the ground, it's a dance of precision and coordination: trucks backing up to conveyors, automated sorters humming in the warehouse, and a crew of 150 workers, almost all of them immigrants, scattered across the farm.


	Myers is not a quiet farmer. On TikTok, where he has nearly 700,000 followers, he posts candid videos in ball caps and flannels, calling out immigration policy as directly as he would a storm on the horizon. 


	“There's not a single person in our operation who isn't brown,” he says. “Fifteen years ago, tractor drivers were retired white guys or the owner himself. Now? They're all from Mexico. Everyone.”


	His farm produces around 200 million onions each year — enough to supply 10.5 million people annually. That accounts for about five percent of all onions consumed in the U.S. If there's a slice of onion on your burger, there's a real chance it came through Myers' shed.


	Among those who've made that possible is Veronica, 31. She came to the United States from Mexico as a toddler and started working on the farm at 18, already a mother of one. Over the next decade, she learned to operate machinery, manage shipments, and eventually run entire facilities. “It was long hours, six days a week,” she says. “And I had three kids by then.”

	But the pressures she feels aren't just professional. Veronica's immigration status remains in limbo. 


	“I've been here since I was two,” she says. “I'm from Mexico, but I don't know Mexico. We don't have a home there. We don't have anything.”

	











	More broadly, she says, mass deportations would leave a huge hole in the food system. “It would be a disaster,” she says. “I don't think there will be people who want to do the kind of job that immigrants do. There just won't be enough people willing to do the work and keep up to feed everybody.”


	Antonio first came to the United States in 2008, crossing the border without documentation, desperate for work. On a Wisconsin dairy farm, he labored nearly nonstop — he says he didn't rest more than three days in two years — sending money back to support his family in Mexico. Eventually, he returned home. But the economic instability pushed him to try again. This time, he entered legally on a tourist visa with his wife and two sons. When the visa expired, they stayed. “We made a life here,” he says. “We had to.”


	Today, Antonio runs daily operations at a Wisconsin dairy. He started as a milker, then moved into animal care, maintenance, and eventually management. His day begins at 5 a.m., checking in with the night shift, assigning tasks, and treating sick animals. He now supervises a crew, most of whom, he says, share his story. “Only a few were born here,” he says. “The rest are like me — people trying to survive.” Statewide, the numbers back him up: A 2023 report from the University of ­Wisconsin–Madison found that 70 percent of all dairy workers in Wisconsin are undocumented.


	On his farm, Hans Breitenmoser, whose family dairy produces five semitruck loads of milk per week — much of it destined to become cheese and food-service slices — operates in good faith. 


	“When someone comes to my farm, they show up armed with documentation,” he says. “And as an employer, it's my obligation to look at that documentation and assume it's legitimate.” But he, also knows that many farmworkers likely live without legal immigration status. “Everybody understands that.”


	Jeff George's feedlot in Finney County, Kansas, turns out 100,000 cattle a year, or more than 55 million pounds of beef. That includes the ground meat found in fast-food chains, school cafeterias, and home kitchens across the country.


	The yard itself is vast — more industrial than pastoral. Rows of pens stretch for acres, bordered by long feed troughs and access lanes. Water trucks roll past bunkers stacked with silage. 


	“This process goes on seven days a week,” George says. “It doesn't matter whether it's Easter or Christmas. There's somebody always here at the yard.”

	











	Of the 52 people on his payroll, 44 are immigrants. They show up at 4:30 a.m., ride pens, monitor feed, check water systems, and treat sick animals. 


	After the feedlot, most of the cattle are shipped to nearby meatpacking plants, where they're processed, sorted, and packed for national distribution. These plants, too, run on immigrant labor. George estimates as much as 85 percent of the workforce across the Kansas beef industry is made up of immigrants working under all kinds of statuses. 


	All told, Kansas exports close to $2 billion in beef each year. But despite the size of the industry, or perhaps because of it, says Matt Teagarden, head of the Kansas Livestock Association, the labor pool is stretched thin. “There's no slack in the workforce,” he says. Feedlots, dairies, meatpackers, and oil and gas operations all draw from the same labor pool, leading to what he calls a constant “trading” of workers. The consequences of mass deportation or visa restrictions, warns Teagarden, would be swift and far-reaching. “We can import workers, or we can import more of our food,” he says. “That's the choice.”


	In Yuma, Arizona, Kristen Smith Eshaya oversees a sprawling romaine operation. Her farm grows roughly 2,000 acres of vegetables. From around October to March, nearly all of the romaine consumed in the U.S. comes from the region's desert fields. 


	Each 30-acre plot is its own fast-moving machine: Tractors shape beds, irrigation teams manage the flow from desert canals, and field crews walk row by row to thin, weed, and harvest. A single crew of 30 workers can cover a field in a day. Thinning alone requires speed and experience. Most of Eshaya's workers are Latino — some U.S.-born, others crossing the border from Mexico. Many are on temporary H-2A visas. “They have to look quickly and know which plant looks healthier, and then take out the other with a hoe,” Eshaya says. “It's skilled labor.”


	Eshaya adds, “Everybody is watching. If raids start happening, and people stop showing up for work, we can't replace them.”

	The bun may be an afterthought when it comes to cheeseburgers, but it's often the most industrially produced. Across the country, large-scale bakeries and frozen-food factories produce millions of hamburger buns each day for fast-food suppliers and grocery-store chains. These facilities rely heavily on immigrant labor: Within the U.S. food-processing industry, immigrant workers represent almost 34 percent of the workforce in commercial bakeries.

	











	Briana Giampaoli's family farm in California produces 45 million pounds of tomatoes each year, but with local labor drying up, and the cost of guest-worker visas rising, she says the future of American farming depends on immigration reform. Without it, fourth-generation farms like hers won't survive.

Samantha Smith‘s Mary Winchester, the boys' badass hunter mom, has been a fixture on Supernatural since the very beginning. In the pilot, the young mom is killed by the demon Azazel in a horrifying scene where the nightgown-clad Mary pinned to the ceiling of baby Sam's nursery and set on fire. Still, she was never forgotten by her boys. Much later, in the Season 11 finale, Mary is resurrected by God's sister Amara (Emily Swallow), shocking her now-adult sons, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles).

Mary struggles with her restored humanity, and she doesn't always make the right choices during her second chance at life, but this imperfect mama bear became a pivotal part of the series and brought a strong female energy the show always needed more of. Eventually, though, she dies a second time in Season 14's “Game Night,” at the hand of nephilim Jack (Alexander Calvert) — accidentally — just a few episodes after she experienced a sweet family reunion with her late husband John (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Still, Mary's legacy on Supernatural carries on, and the character was even celebrated with the prequel spinoff The Winchesters, which explored Mary's life before her sons.

TV Insider caught up with Smith to discuss her complex character in May at a Creation Entertainment convention in New Jersey for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special. Below, she discusses her favorite episode, con memories, and why she thinks some fans never quite connected with her Mary.

I just saw you down on the floor signing autographs not even five minutes ago — what is it like doing these conventions for Supernatural?

Samantha Smith: Lots of running. [Laughs] And it's busy, which is a blessing because you don't want to be sitting there with time to kill. It's a flood of people, a flood of faces. Constant input about how the show has changed people's lives, what it's meant to them, how they watch it with their families. And to me, what I always want to say is that it's an honor that I have gotten to be a part of something that means so much to them. So, I spend a lot of time just reflecting gratitude. And also, the cast is my friends and family, you know? So, I get to see them and spend time with them, which is such an added bonus.

What do you hear the most from fans when you meet them?

The fandom is a little split on Mary. Some people love her, some people do not. I hear a lot, “I love you, I hate Mary. Sorry.” And then I say, “Give me two minutes, I'll change your mind.” And I usually do. We just have a little conversation about what their perception was, and why.

I think that some people were purists. They wanted the show to be about just the boys. And so, Mary came back — and she had been a canonized perfect mom — but when she came back, she was a fully-rounded human. I think that was hard for some people, especially when a couple of episodes in, she takes the journal and bounces because she needed to figure some stuff out. She'd been dead for over 30 years. Her kids were grown, her husband was dead. Like, maybe she needed a minute. [Laughs]

And then, she was working with the British Men of Letters, and everyone says, you know, they tried to kill Sam. But that was just one rogue agent. Mary was just trying to do what was right, not what the boys wanted. She was trying to rid the world of monsters, and she made them sad for a minute while doing that. I always point out: A Winchester takes it upon themselves to do something sort of secretive, but for the greater good while selflessly potentially sacrificing themselves and their relationship for the greater good for the wellbeing of the people they love. Do you know anyone else who's ever done something like that every week?

Fair point, indeed. Looking back, do you have a favorite con memory?

In Vegas, we got all four Winchesters onstage, and that was just a moment. It had a huge crowd. Jared and Jensen were onstage with Jeff, and I just wandered out and they're like, “Where did you come from?” [Laughs]

But also, there have been times where you connect with one particular fan and you have a moment where you realize that you're connecting as people, not as a fan and an actor — something that sort of transcends the show. I love that.

What about your favorite memories from shooting the series?

There's so many for so many different reasons. My very last episode, and just the knowledge while I was filming all that, that I was done. But [also] in the very beginning of Season 12, I got to work with Kim Rhodes [who played Sheriff Jody Mills], who's been one of my closest friends since before Supernatural started — to be on set with her and have our set chairs next to each other was great.

And then there was an episode at the end of Season 13, in the alternate universe, and everyone was there. It was literally 15 actors, and we were all walking down a dirt road. It was dusty and muddy and filthy — we're all covered in dirt. It felt like we were on a family adventure.

Is there a particular episode that stands out to you?

I really loved “Baby” [Season 11, Episode 4]. We heard about the car being the main character, and I thought, “How good could this be?' I had no idea.

If Supernatural returned, where do you see Mary?

I think that her and John [in Heaven] have repossessed the Impala from the boys and they're on adventures. And I have a feeling that she's trying to figure out a way to get back and help some more.

What's your Supernatural secret?

My nightgown in the pilot is actually pink, not white! It's been pink with white lace the entire time. [Laughs]

Following the viral hit of their 2024 release, “Just Like Dat feat. JP THE WAVY,” and the huge success of their first-ever U.S. tour, PSYCHIC FEVER FIRST U.S. TOUR 2025, PSYCHIC FEVER released the music video for “Reflection” today. As the lead track from their third original EP, PSYCHIC FILE III, the modern R&B flair is available on all digital streaming platforms.

Watch the video:

Directed by YERD, the “Reflection” music video makes bold use of 3DCG, creating a striking visual experience. The track is an ambitious work that blends the essence of 90s–'00s R&B with inspiration from DrillnB's atmosphere and sequencing, pursuing a cutting-edge sound. It also served as the powerful opening number for their PSYCHIC FEVER LIVE TOUR 2025 “EVOLVE” in JAPAN held in June. With its lyrical themes of self-awareness and artistic evolution, this song offers fans a deeper glimpse into PSYCHIC FEVER's current creative chapter. The track's smooth yet driving beat, coupled with polished choreography. As the visual narrative unfolds, viewers are invited to experience the group's journey of growth, resilience, and ambition.

“The music video for ‘Reflection' packs in the shine of mirrors, the city, and raw emotion,” the group shares. “Built around the phrase in the lyrics ‘tell me now, what's your vibe', it explores the themes of ‘discovering yourself through someone else' and ‘the person who brings out your glow', creating a mysterious, slightly thrilling world where fantasy and reality intertwine. We would be thrilled if you watched closely and caught all the little details.“

Following the resounding success of their U.S. tour earlier this year, delivering sold-out shows that captivated audiences nationwide, the group further cemented their international presence with a standout appearance at SXSW 2025 in Austin, Texas. Their high-energy performance as headliners for the “Friends From The East Showcase” earned widespread acclaim throughout the music festival, showcasing their ability to seamlessly blend their unique sounds with cutting-edge choreography and stage charisma. In July, celebrating their third anniversary, PSYCHIC FEVER embarked on their first fan meeting tours in Europe and North America, captivating audiences and showcasing their charm to the world.

PSYCHIC FEVER is a seven-member boy group consisting of KOKORO, WEESA, TSURUGI, RYOGA, REN, JIMMY, and RYUSHIN. They debuted in July 2022 as the seventh group from “EXILE TRIBE,” an unparalleled Japanese artist collective under LDH JAPAN. The group's name, PSYCHIC FEVER, was chosen to reflect the unique individual personalities of its seven members, whose performances—featuring dance, vocals, and rap—create a powerful chemistry. Their fanbase is called “ForEVER.” With the purpose of “IGNITE OUR DREAMS,” PSYCHIC FEVER aims to inspire courage in those who watch them, set their hearts ablaze with passion. Since their debut in 2022, they have been actively performing in Japan and throughout Asia, aiming for global success. Their song “Just Like Dat feat. JP THE WAVY,” released in January 2024, gained significant attention both domestically and internationally, surpassing 270 million views on TikTok. It also entered the Viral Top 50 charts on Spotify in nine Asian countries and regions, including Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea, while also becoming a viral hit in the United States. In February 2025, PSYCHIC FEVER successfully held their first U.S. tour, “PSYCHIC FEVER FIRST U.S. TOUR,” in six cities across the United States. That same month, they announced a global contract with Warner Music Group and their transfer to the music label “10K Projects.” In March, they expanded their reach by performing at SXSW 2025, one of the world's largest music festivals in the U.S. Their global journey is accelerating, and they are expected to make even greater strides in the future.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who filed a lawsuit against Candace Owens, revealed that he did so to refute her “nonsense” allegations on his wife Brigitte Macron.

Last month, Macrons sued Owens for defamation after she falsely accused Brigitte of being born a man in her “relentless and unjustified smear campaign.” The couple sued her on 22 charges, including malicious claims and defamation, and they are even requesting damages.

In an interview with Paris Match , the French president discussed the issue for the first time since suing Owens, saying that he felt obligated to do so since the false charges had taken on a life of their own in the United States.

“This has become so widespread in the United States that we had to react,” the French President stated, as per the Independent UK. “It's a question of having the truth respected.”

According to the complaint registered in Delaware state court, Owens initially made the baseless allegation in March 2024 and went on to elaborate on it in her eight-part podcast series titled “Becoming Brigitte.” The complaint claims that the Macrons have suffered “tremendous damage” as a result of her lies.

In order to avoid the “Streisand effect,” which is when someone tries to hide something in order to draw more attention to it, the couple was first told not to make a complaint against Owens, the French president told Paris Match. However, he stated that they felt compelled to reply due to the substantial amount of attention the claims have received.

Macron responded, “It is not freedom of speech to want to prevent the restoration of the truth,” when asked about the negative reaction he and Brigitte have received in the United States following Owens' comments. Those who talk to you about this so-called freedom of speech are the ones who ban journalists from the Oval Office. I do not accept this.”

According to the complaint, Owens' comments exposed the couple to a “campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies.”

“The result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale. Every time the Macrons leave their home, they do so knowing that countless people have heard, and many believe, these vile fabrications. It is invasive, dehumanizing, and deeply unjust,” as per the filing.

The Macrons attacked Owens' credibility as well. The lawsuit alleges that she routinely peddled “misinformation under the guise of legitimate reporting,” such as spreading conspiracy theories against vaccines, and “built a brand on provocation, not truth.” The Covid-19 vaccinations, according to her, are “pure evil.”

In an era of globalized education, where ideals of freedom and inquiry should thrive, an alarming trend has emerged: foreign authoritarian regimes influencing American academia.

In her new book Authoritarians in the Academy, Sarah McLaughlin reveals how higher education institutions — long considered bastions of free thought — are compromising their values for financial gain and international partnerships.

Her investigation uncovers the subtle yet sweeping influence of authoritarian governments, exposing university leaders who prioritize expansion and profit over the principles of free expression. She also describes incidents in which professors and administrators weighed the costs of offending repressive regimes that provide their funding.

McLaughlin's work offers a sobering look at how these compromises in academia mirror broader patterns across industries such as technology, sports, and entertainment.

Sarah McLaughlin is a senior scholar of global expression at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE). Her writing about free speech issues, including protest and blasphemy laws, has been featured in publications including Foreign Policy and The Huffington Post. Her new book is Authoritarians in the Academy: How the Internationalization of Higher Education and Borderless Censorship Threaten Free Speech.

            President Donald Trump escalated his campaign to purge cultural institutions of materials that conflict with his political directives on Tuesday, alleging museums were too focused on highlighting negative aspects of American history, including “how bad slavery was.”
    


            In a Truth Social post, Trump directed his attorneys to conduct a review of museums, comparing the effort to his crackdown on universities across the country.
    


            “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future,” Trump wrote.
    


            Trump's comments come days after the White House announced an unprecedented, sweeping review of the Smithsonian Institution, which runs the nation's major public museums. The initiative, a trio of top Trump aides wrote in a letter to Smithsonian Institution secretary Lonnie Bunch III last week, “aims to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.”
    


            The letter said the review would focus on public-facing content, the curatorial process to understand how work is selected for exhibits, current and future exhibition planning, the use of existing materials and collections and guidelines for narrative standards.
    


            Exhibits at the Smithsonian take years of planning and are heavily evaluated by teams of scholars and curatorial experts before they make their debut. Janet Marstine, a museum ethics expert, said that the demands laid out by the Trump administration “set the Smithsonian up for failure.”
    


            “Nobody could provide those kinds of materials in such a comprehensive way, in that short amount of time, and so it's just an impossible task,” she said. The White House has asked the Smithsonian to provide an array of materials, from internal emails and memos to digital copies of all placards and gallery labels currently on display.
    


            The Smithsonian declined to comment on Trump's latest remarks. A White House official, asked about the attorney review process Trump described, said the president “will explore all options and avenues to get the Woke out of the Smithsonian and hold them accountable.”
    


            Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order that put Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, in charge of stopping government spending on exhibits that don't align with the administration's agenda. He also tasked a former member of his legal team, attorney Lindsey Halligan, with helping to root out “improper ideology” at the Smithsonian.
    


            “Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to divisive narratives,” the executive order said.
    


            The Smithsonian began a review of its own in June, and has repeatedly stressed its commitment to being nonpartisan. The institution told CNN in July that it was committed to an “unbiased presentation of facts and history” and that it would “make any necessary changes to ensure our content meets our standards.”

The White House has announced that several senior US officials will be working to expedite a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky.

Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff will lead coordination efforts to make the talks happen “as soon as possible,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday.

She said that US President Donald Trump spoke with Putin by phone, “and he agreed to begin the next phase of the peace process,” referring to the Russian president meeting with Zelensky, which “would be followed, if necessary, by a trilateral meeting.”

Trump held a summit with Putin in Alaska last week, and later hosted Zelensky along with his Western European backers for talks focused on the peace process. Moscow has confirmed its readiness to take part in further discussions aimed at achieving a lasting solution to the Ukraine conflict.

The US president has since begun efforts to arrange a Putin-Zelensky meeting, while simultaneously urging the Ukrainian leader to be “more flexible.”

In a recent meeting with a cross-party group of British MPs in Washington, I was struck by the outright defeatism on display over the Chagos Islands surrender. I was told that Sir Keir Starmer's shameful agreement in May to hand over the British Indian Ocean Territory to Chinese ally Mauritius was a done deal, and it was pointless to even discuss it. Several of the MPs agreed that the Labour Government's decision was absolutely awful, but the overriding feeling was that nothing could be done to stop it.

Thankfully, there is hope that the deal can still be torpedoed at the twelfth hour. As the Chagos agreement is a treaty that cedes sovereign British territory, legal experts note that it must be ratified first by Westminster. And it would surely be extremely difficult for the Prime Minister to defend the agreement in Parliament if Britain's closest friend and partner stepped in to oppose it.

The US President's upcoming state visit to London on September 17-19 has added a new sense of urgency, with growing concerns in the United States over the implications of the deal for the future of the vital Anglo-American military base at Diego Garcia, which is capable of hosting America's long-range B-2 bombers. Diego Garcia sits at the heart of the Indian Ocean, and will play an increasingly important role for the United States in combatting Communist China in the Indo-Pacific region, a huge strategic priority for the Trump administration.

A growing number of US policymakers fear that the Chagos deal will hand Beijing an unprecedented win at the expense of the United States and the United Kingdom, undermining the long-term future of Diego Garcia and significantly weakening the strategic position of the West in the region. Indeed, the Chagos issue is far from over in Washington, and major red flags are being raised in the US, despite a large-scale PR offensive waged by the Foreign Office earlier this year.

The stakes are incredibly high. There is a very real possibility that Mauritius could, a few years from now, break the agreement with the UK over Diego Garcia under pressure from Beijing, find a reason to end the lease with London, and cut an even more lucrative deal with Communist China. What if the Chinese offered Mauritius double or triple what the British Government is offering to pay? This would be a nightmare scenario for the US, resulting in the loss of an incredibly vital American base.

Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana has been a prominent opponent of the UK giving the Chagos Islands away, and other Members of Congress are now weighing in. In a highly significant development this month on Capitol Hill, the powerful Republican-led House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations directly raised the issue of the Chagos Islands deal between the UK and Mauritius, urging the US Secretary of State to engage further with the British Government on assurances that vital US strategic interests are protected.

In the “National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, 2026”, the Committee recognised “that with the growing challenge from the PRC the military facilities on the island of Diego Garcia are central to Anglo-American power projection and relative control of the Indian Ocean. Recognising the invaluable strategic importance and geographic relevance of Diego Garcia to the United States, the Committee encourages the Secretary of State to engage with His Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom to ensure our long-term access to the facilities and that they remain integral to allied security.”

Meanwhile in the UK, the full cost of the Chagos deal to the British taxpayer is only now seeing the light of day. As The Telegraph recently revealed, the total cost to the British taxpayer to lease the Diego Garcia military base from Mauritius will be almost £35bn if fulfilled, 10 times more than the Labour government originally claimed. This is one of the biggest deceptions by a British government in modern times, and also one of the most dangerous, with massive implications for US and British national security interests on the world stage.

In the weeks ahead, we can expect significantly increased scrutiny of the Starmer Government's Chagos Islands deal on Capitol Hill as well as from the administration, especially in advance of the upcoming presidential state visit to the UK next month.

Significantly, the US State Department backed the Chagos deal in a statement in May, but there has never been an official declaration issued by the White House. A last-minute intervention against the deal is not out of the question.

President Trump still has an opportunity to weigh in directly on the issue, and can and should send the Chagos deal to the depths of the Indian Ocean where it clearly belongs. By doing so, he would be defending vital American strategic interests, denying China a major long-term victory, and protecting a crucial military base at the heart of the US/UK Special Relationship

            Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro announced on Monday the deployment of 4.5 million militiamen throughout the country, assuring that “no empire will touch the sacred soil of Venezuela,” after the United States doubled the reward for information leading to his arrest and increased the number of troops sailing around Latin America and the Caribbean.
    


            Last week, the US government confirmed to CNN that it had ordered naval movements in the region to contain the threat from drug trafficking groups. On Monday, Reuters reported that three US Navy destroyers and some 4,000 military personnel would arrive at the edge of Venezuela's territorial waters within the next 36 hours.
    


            On Tuesday, however, a US Department of Defense official said there are currently no US ships in the area and nor have the ships received orders to head there. Venezuelan territory has almost 2,500 miles of coastline.
    


            “This week I am going to activate a special plan to guarantee coverage with more than 4.5 million militiamen throughout the national territory. Militias prepared, activated, and armed,” Maduro said during a televised meeting with the country's governors and mayors.
    


            The president described the “extravagant, bizarre and outlandish” US threats as “rotten rehashes,” without specifying what he was referring to.
    


            “We defend our seas, our skies, and our lands. We liberated them. We guard and patrol them. No empire will touch the sacred soil of Venezuela, nor should it touch the sacred soil of South America,” he emphasized in his speech.
    


            White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked Tuesday about a possible troop deployment to Venezuela following reports of the military buildup. “President (Donald) Trump has been very clear and consistent. He's prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice,” she said.
    


            She also reiterated the US government's position that Maduro “is not a legitimate president.” Washington and Caracas have not had formal bilateral diplomatic relations since 2019.
    


            The Venezuelan government rejected Washington's accusation of drug trafficking, saying in a statement that the US was resorting to “threats and defamation.”
    


            The Venezuelan Militia, which was created in 2005 by the late President Hugo Chávez and formally established in 2010, is part of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB) and has as its vision the “incorporation of the organized people” to guarantee the “comprehensive defense of the nation.”
    


Trump doubles reward to $50 million for arrest of Venezuela's president to face US drug charges



            Maduro said he will move forward with a plan to activate peasant and worker militias “in all factories and workplaces in the country.”
    


            “Missiles and rifles for the working class, to defend our homeland,” he said.
    


            The Venezuelan Ministry of Defense says on its website that the FANB “is made up of around 95,000 to 150,000 active combatants” and “a growing National Militia made up of hundreds of thousands of people capable of serving as reservists.”
    


            The Global Fire Power website, which specializes in military analyses and uses official statistics or makes estimates when they are not available, ranks Venezuela 50th in military power in the 2025 ranking, among 145 countries. The United States ranks first, Russia second, and China third.
    


            A few weeks ago, the Trump administration doubled the reward to $50 million for information leading to the arrest of Maduro, whom it described as “one of the world's largest drug traffickers,” head of the Cartel of the Suns, and a threat to US national security.
    


            The Venezuelan government and other institutions in the country rejected the announcement, and several Chavista figures have dismissed the allegations. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello has said that the Cartel de los Soles is an “invention” of the US, and the Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López has ‘categorically' rejected Washington's “ridiculous” accusations.

Anti-corruption protests rocked the Serbian capital of Belgrade as student-led demonstrators clashed with supporters of President Aleksandar Vucic and his political party, demanding new elections.

Violent clashes between anti-government protesters and Serbian security forces have intensified over the last week, with protesters setting fire to an office building belonging to the ruling party in Novi Sad.

""You will see the full determination of the Serbian state. We will use everything at our disposal to restore law, peace and order,"" President Vucic said in an address to the nation Saturday night.

Tens of thousands of college students have been marching and protesting since December, demanding justice and accountability after the deaths of 16 people in the collapse of a railway station in the Serbian town of Novi Sad. The canopy at the railway station collapsed Nov. 1 after renovations led by two Chinese companies.

The government is accused of not implementing student demands, including the release of all documentation related to the reconstruction of the train station. In his speech, Vucic said that justice must be served for all those responsible for the 16 victims of the Novi Sad rail station collapse.

Critics have called out the heavy-handed response used against protesters. Alan Berset, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, said in a post on X that he was concerned with the rising violence.

""I call for calm and respect of the right to peaceful assembly. Serbian authorities must uphold Council of Europe standards. The rule of law and respect for human rights must prevail,"" Berset said.

Serbia's foreign minister, Marko Djuric, responded to the criticism in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""We respect and protect peaceful protest—it is part of our democratic fabric. But when demonstrations turn into physical attacks and attempts to destabilize the country, the government has both the right and the duty to respond.""

""This is by far the biggest threat Vucic has faced in the last 13 years, and it is very unlikely that Vucic will weather the storm without elections,"" Helena Ivanov, senior fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital.

""The country is not functioning, and the situation is dangerously escalating. The only way out of the problem is to hold free and fair elections as soon as possible. ""Everything else will further destabilize the situation, which could have devastating consequences,"" Ivanov added.

What originally started as spontaneous protests voicing dissatisfaction with the government's failed response to the railway catastrophe transformed into a movement opposing widespread corruption and the erosion of the rule of law under Vucic.

One of the largest protests in Serbia's history took place on March 15, with nearly 350,000 people gathered in Slavija Square in central Belgrade.

""Serbian students put forward several demands, the first and most important being the release of documentation regarding the reconstruction of the Novi Sad train station, where the collapse of the canopy killed 16 people. To this day, no one has been held accountable,"" Filip Ubović, a student from the University of Belgrade and protest participant on the ground in Belgrade, told Fox News Digital.

Ubovic said the protests were originally aimed at influencing the institutions responsible for upholding the rule of law, and not directly against the ruling party. As the government failed to hold any officials accountable for the tragedy or release any information on the canopy collapse, the protesters realized that it was time to demand elections.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Coming soon to a data center near you? Nuclear reactors","https://www.businessinsider.com/aalo-atomics-100-million-valor-nuclear-reactor-startup-data-center-2025-8","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

One Austin-based startup may have the answer to a crucial problem that the AI industry is still stuck on: how to power it all.

Aalo Atomics says the answer isn't the hulking nuclear plants of decades past. Instead, it's betting on mass-manufactured smaller reactors built to sit beside the data centers they'll fuel.

That pitch earned the company a hefty check. Aalo recently closed a $100 million Series B, CEO Matt Loszak told Business Insider. Valor Equity Partners led the round, and Harpoon Ventures, Alumni Ventures, and others participated, bringing Aalo's total funding to north of $136 million.

The startup's trajectory shows just how tightly AI and energy are now linked. Aalo CEO Matt Loszak said he cofounded the startup ""hand-in-hand"" with the AI boom.

""When we started the company, we had data centers high up on our list,"" he told Business Insider. ""Very rapidly, we were like, 'OK, we have to focus the entire company around this.'""

Loszak and Yasir Arafat, the company's chief technology officer, founded Aalo in 2023 to make mass-manufactured nuclear power plants. The company's main product is the Aalo Pod, a small modular reactor built to power data centers. Aalo says one Pod can power roughly 50,000 homes, or one data center, Loszak said.

""Nuclear really is the ultimate underdog,"" Loszak said. He called it ""the most misunderstood technology I've ever seen in my life,"" citing skepticism of the safety of nuclear power.

In August, the Department of Energy selected Aalo to test the company's experimental power plant Aalo-X, which it plans to complete construction for in 2026, at Idaho National Laboratory under the Trump administration's Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program. This program aims to speed up testing of advanced reactor designs and authorize deployment at sites beyond national labs.

Aalo isn't the only company getting a boost from Washington. Ten nuclear companies—including Antares Nuclear, Radiant Industries, Valar Atomics, and Sam Altman-backed Oklo—have been tapped for the DOE's initiative.

Big Tech companies have also increasingly become interested in leveraging nuclear power to fuel AI ambitions.

Aalo aims to eventually take its factory-built model global. In the future, Aalo hopes to mass-produce reactors in large facilities like its 40,000 square-foot Austin factory, ship them to sites around the world, and assemble them on location. Over time, Loszak said, the company hopes to work with a network of partner developers who would handle installation and operation of the Aalo Pods.

For now, the company hopes to partner with customers ""willing to pay a premium because they value the speed,"" Loszak said, namely, cloud giants with data center projects in the works. The company declined to disclose which hyperscalers it's working with.

Aalo also plans to eventually ""bring costs as low as possible to help bring more energy to everyone,"" Loszak said. Ultimately, it aims to cut energy costs to around three cents per kilowatt hour, though Aalo's prices are currently higher than this, Loszak said. Energy costs can vary greatly depending on location, and electricity across all sectors in the US averages about 13 cents per kilowatt hour as of May 2025, according to the US Energy Information Administration. 

Aalo will use the new funding to double its staff, growing from about 60 employees now to 120 within the next year. It will focus on hiring engineers and manufacturing talent. That's a sharp increase for a startup that was just Loszak and Arafat less than two years ago.

Loszak's interest in nuclear power is personal. He said he developed asthma while growing up in Canada due to coal-plant smog. Once the country expanded nuclear power, though, Loszak said his symptoms disappeared.

""Lo and behold, smog days went to zero, and my asthma went away,"" Loszak said. ""I thought, 'my God, this technology is incredible.'""

Previously, Loszak cofounded Humi, an HR software startup that Employment Hero acquired for over $100 million in January.

Arafat, Aalo's cofounder and CTO, brings the nuclear chops. He started his career at Westinghouse Electric Company and later worked on MARVEL, an advanced nuclear reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory. Arafat earned his Ph.D. in nuclear engineering at North Carolina State University.

""When I met him, I just knew he was the right guy to partner with. We had really similar values, a similar vision for what nuclear should become, and even a similar sense of humor, which is important because we spend a lot of time together,"" Loszak said of Arafat.

Loszak said Aalo's investor, Valor, is a ""special partner"" for the startup because of its relationships with big data center projects.

Valor backed Elon Musk's xAI in a $6 billion Series B in 2024, and the investment firm is in talks with lenders to secure up to $12 billion for xAI's plan to buy a large sum of Nvidia chips for a new mega-sized data center, The Wall Street Journal reported in July. Valor also participated in AI infrastructure company Crusoe's $600 million Series D in late 2024.

Spotify's ad business is floundering.

""We have simply been moving too slowly,"" CEO Daniel Ek said on the company's latest earnings call.

Spotify has said it wants advertising to make up 20% of its overall revenue. As of June, that figure stood at 11% — a share that has barely budged over time. Second-quarter ad revenue was down 0.7% versus the prior year, and media industry analyst Brian Wieser pondered in a recent note to clients whether it had plateaued.

Chris Camacho, CEO of the ad agency Cheil UK, said cracks in Spotify's ad business have been visible for some time. That contrasts with the rest of the company's relatively strong performance, with healthy growth in user numbers and overall revenue, and a stock price that's up over 100% in the last year.

""In a world demanding seamless media execution and measurable impact, Spotify has struggled to connect ambition with action,"" Camacho said of the company's ad efforts.

""It needs to give brands access to cultural moments, not just audio slots,"" he continued. ""That means better content partnerships, richer storytelling formats, and measurement that proves value beyond listens.""

Industry insiders say Spotify's ad efforts have been hampered by the company's focus on its subscription business, which is much more lucrative. Two ad buyers told Business Insider that Spotify's customer service has slipped recently, while podcast industry insiders said its ad rates remain low.

Spotify seems to recognize the need for change. Longtime ad head Lee Brown left last month, and the company confirmed that a search is underway for a new leader. Ek appeared to blame Brown for Spotify's ad struggles, saying on the earnings call that ""execution"" and not strategy led to the poor performance.

""We felt it was the right time for a leadership change,"" Ek added. Brown, who recently became the chief revenue officer at DoorDash, didn't respond to requests for comment.

Spotify's executives said on the recent earnings call that they want advertising to contribute more to the company's revenue.

In some ways, Spotify has a business model that eats its own tail.

If Spotify converts too many free users into Premium subscribers, the audience for advertisers shrinks. If it makes the free offering too attractive, users won't be tempted to upgrade. Spotify's ad-supported tier serves as an important on-ramp for its Premium business — plus the $1.9 billion in ad sales it brought in last year helps toward paying its substantial royalties to music labels and other content creators. However, Premium is the sacred cash cow: Enders Analysis estimates that gross profits for Premium are around 15 to 20 times those of the advertising tier.

The company's big push into podcasts — which have ads for those on the Premium tier — offered a way to bridge that gap. It also gave advertisers the chance to reach more affluent audiences. Spotify spent more than $1 billion to acquire companies like Gimlet Media and Anchor, and signed exclusive deals with Joe Rogan and the Obamas.

Podcast executives and ad buyers told Business Insider that the podcast advertising strategy has been messy, with several pivots in its few years of operation. Spotify ended some of its original and exclusive programming, cut staff, flip-flopped its stance on areas like measurement and ad pricing floors, and made a pivot to video that is still in the early stages and has yet to prove itself as a guaranteed moneymaker.

Spotify acquired the podcast hosting and adtech company Megaphone in 2020 in a $235 million deal that was designed to help podcast publishers make more money through its advertising marketplace.

There were hiccups from the start. A former Spotify ad sales exec said there was an irony in the company attempting to sell Megaphone to podcasters as a best-in-class adtech solution while Spotify itself uses Google as its ad server.

One podcast publisher said they were getting around $8 or $9 CPMs — the cost of 1,000 impressions for a digital ad — on average through Megaphone, versus the $20 to $40 CPMs they would achieve for host-read ads. However, they acknowledged that directly sold ads usually fetch higher prices than those sold via third-party adtech, such as Spotify's. The average CPM price advertisers paid for digital audio ads in the second quarter of this year was $16.51, according to the analytics company Measured — though the final fee a podcast publisher would receive after platforms and other third parties take their cut would be smaller.

A Spotify spokesperson said the average CPM on Spotify is ""far above"" $9, though they declined to provide additional specifics. They said that ad revenue is influenced by macroeconomic and seasonal shifts that may impact overall CPMs. Publisher revenue generated through the Spotify Audience Network had seen double-digit growth year-over-year, the spokesperson said.

Spotify has been introducing other money-making opportunities to offset volatile ad prices.

This year, as part of a big video push, it launched the Spotify Partner Program, offering creators a 50% share of the ad revenue their videos generate. It has encouraged some publishers and creators to get on board by giving them minimum revenue guarantees, though it's unclear how long those will last.

The Spotify Partner Program has been a ""big win"" for YMH Studios, producer of podcasts including ""Your Mom's House"" and ""2 Bears, 1 Cave,"" according to the company's head of ad revenue, Alan Abdine. He said the company had seen a consistent 20% to 30% revenue lift.

Several ad buyers told Business Insider that Spotify must prove it can be a meaningful player in video.

""Video here feels like an add-on,"" Cheil's Camacho said. ""If Spotify wants to be bold, brave, and first, it needs to reinvent what video within an audio experience could be.""

A Spotify spokesperson said video podcast consumption is up 54% this year, with users who watch a podcast consuming 1.5 times as much as those who just listen. The spokesperson said it is building ways to improve the creative options available for creators, fans, and advertisers, such as audio-to-video playback, built-in community tools, better on-platform analytics, and new monetization models like the Spotify Partner Program.

Some advertisers have been put off by Spotify's increasing focus on automated ad buying and by high turnover in the company's ad sales staff.

Spotify cut 2,300 jobs through three rounds of layoffs in 2023. Last year, it axed 40 positions and 17 open roles in its ad and campaign management teams.

Dan Granger, CEO of the audio ad agency Oxford Road, said getting a response from the Spotify team could take days versus a matter of hours from other partners, and that many of its accounts were handled offshore.

The Spotify spokesperson said the company prides itself on its customer service and aims to respond to advertisers within three to six hours, with the goal of resolving any issues or queries within 48 hours. They added that Spotify has dedicated customer service managers and client partners for every direct sales account.

Granger said his agency had experienced consistency issues when Spotify inserted ads into podcast streams. Sometimes, ads are clustered in a short burst instead of being paced evenly, eroding a campaign's performance. Ad prices had recently jumped without a commensurate increase in the value they delivered, Granger said, adding that Spotify's measurement offering was ""inhospitable"" for brands.

In an August note to clients, analysts from Arete Research said they questioned whether Spotify ""has the DNA of an ads company, or whether ads are simply a way to spur users into paying for Premium.""

This dynamic isn't lost on the ad community.

""Spotify just doesn't prioritize the needs of the advertising community the way it does that of its subscriber business,"" Granger said.

Some in the ad industry think Spotify can turn its fortunes around.

Spotify has made a raft of announcements in the last year. Among them, it launched the Spotify Ad Exchange, which lets customers buy ads using demand-side platforms, an in-house creative lab, and a generative AI tool to help advertisers create audio ads. It hopes these rollouts will help turn the dial for its ads business by 2026.

Will Doherty, senior vice president of inventory partnerships at The Trade Desk, said Spotify's decision to partner with adtech companies gives ad buyers more choice and control versus rival ""walled garden"" Big Tech platforms from whom they can only buy directly. The Trade Desk is a Spotify Ad Exchange partner.

Doherty said moves like these put Spotify's ad business in a position to grow.

""From a technical standpoint, Spotify is pretty sophisticated,"" Doherty said. ""It takes time for any business to consolidate and unify an ad stack on a global scale, while managing the various partnerships needed to grow and be successful.""

 Some large traders are raising the stakes and putting money on ETH price avoiding a trip below $4,000 and rebounding toward $4,300 soon. 

Key takeaways:

ETH price has a short liquidation cluster “magnet” at $4,300–$4,360.

Ether price technicals support the case for a rally toward $4,750–$8,000.

An Ethereum whale has opened a massive $16.35 million long position on Ether (ETH), using 25x leverage, in what looks like a bold wager that the latest dip is over.

The position, entered at $4,229.83 per ETH, is already slightly in profit with ETH trading just above $4,240. At this scale, a mere 1% rise from the entry would add over $163,000 in profit. 

Fresh liquidation heatmaps support the timing of the whale's entry. 

Data from Kingfisher shows a dense cluster of short liquidations above $4,300–$4,360, with a particularly large pocket near $4,336. Markets are often drawn toward such liquidity “magnets” as market makers hunt stops.

Strategically, this means ETH doesn't need a full-blown breakout to validate the whale's trade. A simple push into the $4,336 liquidity pool could generate multimillion-dollar paper gains.

The whale's position could be up by nearly $450,000 in unrealized profit if ETH hits that level.

Related: SharpLink purchases $667M in Ether at near record prices

On the flip side, a 4.34% drop to around $4,046 would completely liquidate the trade, erasing the margin behind the position.

Ethereum is also holding firm above its 20-day exponential moving average (20-day EMA; the green wave), a support that has guided the uptrend since July, barring a brief breakdown last month. 

The level now aligns with the lower boundary of a developing falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, a classic bullish reversal setup. This confluence of support strengthens the case for the whale's $16.35 million long bet. 

ETH could eye an upside target around $4,750, nearly 13% higher from current levels, if the wedge and 20-day EMA fractal play out. A close below $4,140, however, risks invalidating the setup.

Zooming out to the weekly chart, ETH is staging what some analysts call one of the “obvious weekly retests” in years. 

DIY Investing notes that Ethereum has flipped its “biggest resistance” around the $3,900-4,000 area into support, adding:

SkyBridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci's investment management firm, plans to tokenize $300 million worth of its hedge funds on the Avalanche AVAX$22.68 network.

The firm is bringing its Digital Macro Master Fund and Legion Strategies on-chain in partnership with tokenization provider Tokeny and its parent, Apex Group, which manages more than $3.5 trillion in assets, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday. Apex acquired Tokeny earlier this year.

The initiative uses the ERC-3643 token standard with operational support from Apex's Digital 3.0 platform, which handles issuance, administration, and distribution.

SkyBridge's decision underlines the growing appeal of using blockchain rails to transfer and record ownership of traditional financial instruments like bonds, funds and stocks, a process often dubbed tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Global banks and asset managers are exploring this technology to cut settlement times, increase transparency and keep markets open around the clock.

Securitization firm VERT Capital announced to tokenize $1 billion of debt and receivables on XDC network and debuted a tokenized credit platform on XRP Ledger, while tokenization specialist Securitize also offers tokens of various funds by Hamilton Lane, Apollo and KKR.

The tokenized RWA market has doubled over the past year, surpassing $26 billion, per RWA.xyz data,  and is projected to grow into a trillion-dollar market by 2030, according to reports by McKinsey, Ripple, BCG and others.

""We look forward to bringing our hedge funds into the digital, on-chain era, improving transparency, liquidity, and accessibility for our investors, and demonstrating how traditional finance and blockchain can work together to create smarter, more efficient investment solutions,"" SkyBridge Capital founder and CEO Anthony Scaramucci said in a statement.

Avalanche increasingly aims to position itself as a hub for tokenized assets. Bergen County in New Jersey uses the network to digitize property deeds of $240 billion in real estate, combating fraud and cutting processing time.

DISCLOSURES August 19, 2025  

Researchers in Madagascar have reported the first randomised controlled trial for the treatment of bubonic plague. Published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the study found that “oral ciprofloxacin monotherapy for 10 days was non-inferior to an aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin sequential combination for the treatment of patients with bubonic plague.”

The bubonic plague remains endemic to Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Peru. In Madagascar, cases occur almost every year during the epidemic season from September to April.

Current treatment guidelines are based on weak evidence, and until now, no randomised controlled trial has directly compared therapeutic options.

According to Madagascar's national guideline, adults are treated with 3 days of injectable aminoglycosides, such as streptomycin or gentamicin, followed by 7 days of oral ciprofloxacin. Oral ciprofloxacin monotherapy is recommended as the first-line option for children aged less than 15 years.

“The lack of higher-quality evidence supporting treatment regimens and the shortcomings of aminoglycosides (eg, delivery by injection, unacceptable side effects, and poor intracellular penetration) prompted us to design this randomized controlled trial to compare the two treatment options,” wrote lead author Rindra Vatosoa Randremanana, PhD, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, Antananarivo, Madagascar.

The open label, noninferiority IMASOY study, conducted between 2020 and 2024, enrolled 450 patients with suspected bubonic plague. Of these, 220 were laboratory-confirmed, and two had probable infection. The participants were 2-72 years old, with a median age of 14.

The bubonic plague, known as the “Black Death” in the Middle Ages, has claimed millions of lives over centuries. It is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis, which circulates mainly among rodents and their fleas. Although rare, the disease persists. In 2018, the World Health Organization reported 248 cases worldwide, mostly in Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Sulfonamides were the first treatment in the 1930s, effective only for bubonic plague and not for pneumonic plague. A major advance was made in 1948 with streptomycin, the first antibiotic effective against severe pneumonic plague. 

Studies in India and Madagascar have confirmed its efficacy, and streptomycin has remained the standard for decades.

In 2015, the US FDA approved ciprofloxacin for plague under the “Animal Rule,” allowing approval based on animal data when human trials are not feasible. There are no comparable regulations in the European Union where ciprofloxacin is used off-label for plague infections.

In 2017, a major outbreak of bubonic plague occurred in Madagascar's capital, Antananarivo, with over 2400 suspected cases. At the time, the standard treatment was twice-daily streptomycin injections for 7 days, a regimen difficult to implement widely. The outbreak highlighted the challenges of applying this treatment across the population. The new study suggests that a fully oral ciprofloxacin regimen could offer an even simpler and effective alternative.

The study compared the two treatments included in the national plague guidelines: oral ciprofloxacin for 10 days (ciprofloxacin monotherapy) or injectable aminoglycoside for 3 days, followed by oral ciprofloxacin for 7 days (aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin).

The primary endpoint was treatment failure on day 11, with treatment failure defined as death, fever, secondary pneumonic plague, or alternative or prolonged plague treatment.

Ciprofloxacin monotherapy was non-inferior to aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin therapy among patients with confirmed or probable infection.

Treatment failure occurred in 9.0% of patients (10 of 111) receiving 10 days of oral ciprofloxacin and 8.1% (9 of 111) in the control group, which received 3 days of injectable streptomycin followed by 7 days of oral ciprofloxacin, confirming non-inferiority.

The mortality rate was approximately 4% in both the groups. Secondary pneumonic plague developed in three patients per group. Subgroup analyses confirmed the non-inferiority of ciprofloxacin monotherapy.

Adverse events were similar between the groups (18.0% vs 18.9%), with serious adverse events in 7.2% and 5.4%. No severe events were classified as drug-related.

The authors concluded, “In patients with confirmed or suspected bubonic plague, 10 days of oral ciprofloxacin was an effective alternative to a regimen involving an injected aminoglycoside.” They noted that this approach can be more practical and cost-effective in resource-limited settings.

LOUGHBOROUGH, England (Aug. 19, 2025) – The U.S. Women's Cerebral Palsy (CP) National Team utilized goals from seven different players, including a second-half hat trick from Joey Martin and braces from Kaia Spencer, Jesslyn Kuhnel and Echo Yale, to earn a 12-1 win against Nepal in the team's opening match of the 2025 IFCPF Intercontinental Cup at Loughborough University.

Idle on the first day of the five-team competition on Monday, the USA wasted little time on Matchday Two, bagging three goals in the first four minutes. Spencer tallied a first-half brace just four minutes in, sandwiched around captain Cassidy Leake's second minute goal. Kuhnel found the back of the net in the fifth and ninth minutes, before Michelle Cross got on the score sheet in the 18th to make it 6-0 heading into halftime. 

Echo Yale earned their debut by starting the match between the sticks, while Janie Richardson collected her first cap when she replaced Kuhnel just before halftime. At the start of the second half, Gabby Scotto replaced Yale in goal to become the third debutant on the day, with Yale re-entering the match as a field player later in the second frame. 

WATCH: USA 12, Nepal 1

It took the USA a little time to get going in the second half, and Nepal actually tallied their first goal of the tournament as Matilda Stacey pulled one back to make 6-1 in the 34th minute. 

That lone strike was the interval between another onslaught of U.S. goals, as Richardson tallied on her U.S. debut to make it 7-1 in the 38th minute. Yale followed suit with her first goal in a U.S. shirt three minutes later. Second half substitute Martin scored her first off a feed from Richardson in the 44th, before setting up Yale for their second in the 47th minute.

Yale then returned the favor twice more to Martin, feeding her second goal in the 48th, before helping her complete her hat trick with the last kick of the game in the 50th minute. 

Now with a 10W-2L-2D all-time record, the CP WNT is back in action Wednesday when it faces Denmark. Kick off from Loughborough, England is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast live via the IFCPF YouTube channel.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","ATP, TikTok partner to capitalize on content boom","https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/46021392/atp-partners-tiktok-capitalize-rise-content","Tue, 19 Aug 2025 20:33:00 GMT","

NEW YORK -- The newest popular influencer on TikTok's ""For You"" page might be the scroller's favorite tennis player.

At least, the ATP hopes so.

The governing body of men's professional tennis announced Tuesday it will be partnering with TikTok to further develop tennis content and bolster engagement on the platform.

The partnership is two-fold. One of its stated goals is player engagement, aimed at helping more ATP players build up followings on the platform and give tennis fans ""exclusive behind-the-scenes"" access to the sport, according to a press release.

Its other goal is the creation of the ""Tennis Creator Network,"" an initiative that will help existing non-athlete creators create TikTok content at ATP tour events.

""This strategic content partnership with TikTok builds on current trends with our audiences, places ATP at the forefront of the intersection of culture and sport, and creates discoverable content that cuts through for both players and tournaments,"" Andrew Walker, senior vice president of brand and marketing for the ATP, said in the release.

Currently, only 20 of the ATP's top 100 players have a presence on TikTok. Some of those 20 have become verifiable stars on the platform - Carlos Alcaraz has 1.1 million followers, Novak Djokovic has 666,000 and Ben Shelton has 448,000, to look at the upper echelon. They share everything from behind-the-scenes looks at tournaments to clips of them mowing the lawn and learning calligraphy.

The ATP TikTok account itself has nearly 600,000 followers.

The partnership is an acknowledgement of a blazing trend in sports media - candid, behind-the-scenes content created by athletes. Its popularity and virality is on the rise, manifesting itself everywhere from TikTok accounts to podcast studios.

In July, a pair of Minnesota Lynx players - Courtney Williams and Natisha Hiedeman, nicknamed ""The Studbudz"" - amassed hundreds of thousands of views and followers after live streaming the entirety of WNBA All-Star weekend, parties and all. The duo have now turned the momentum into official merchandise and newfound stardom.

Athlete-hosted podcasts, with an hour of casual conversation from star athletes, have also repeatedly become headline makers. ""New Heights"" with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is an obvious one, but shows like Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham's ""Show me something"" have spiked similar engagement as their hosts offer candid insight into life beyond the game.

The ATP is looking to tap into that surge in behind-the-scenes content with this partnership.

""(It) encourages more players to share their stories,"" said TikTok's head of global sports partnerships, Rollo Goldstaub, in the release, ""further igniting tennis' cultural movement on TikTok.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Shooting begins later this month with two actors from the filmmaker's 'Rebel Moon' movies.

Zack Snyder is finally tackling his passion project, and there is not a single cape, zombie or rebellious moon in sight.


	Starting later this month, Snyder will begin filming The Last Photograph, a drama that he originated and has been developing since the mid-2000s.




	Stuart Martin and Fra Free, both of whom appeared in Snyder's Rebel Moon movies, will star in the feature, an indie whose budget will be significantly lower than many of the epics Snyder has captained before.

					 Zack Snyder to Direct 'Brawler' for UFC		
			









	Snyder is producing with creative partner and wife Deborah Snyder and Wesley Coller via their Stone Quarry banner. Also producing will be Gianni Nunnari and his Hollywood Gang Productions company.

	The project, a war drama, will shoot in several locales around the globe, including Colombia, Iceland and Los Angeles. 


	Local companies will assist in producing in the film's the far-flung locations. Executive producers include the Spanish company Mediaset España, through its film production arm Telecinco Cinema, as well as William Doyle and Columbia's Jaguar Bite, which is run by  Juan Pablo Solano and Simon Beltran. True North serves as the production service company in Iceland. 


Photograph is qualifying for Colombia's CINA incentive (Audiovisual Investment Certificate), which is a tax discount equivalent to 35 percent of the expenditure on audiovisual services in the country. 

	











	Snyder also has his composers lined up as well: Hans Zimmer, Steven Doar and Omer Benyamin. 


	Longtime Snyder colleague Kurt Johnstad wrote the script after working with Snyder on 300 and Rebel Moon. It is based on a story from Snyder.


	The story, according to the producers, is thus: “An ex-DEA operative must return to the mountains of South America in an effort to find his missing niece and nephew, following the brutal murders of their diplomat parents. Enlisting the help of a washed-up junkie war photographer, the only person to have seen the face of the killers, he sets out, determined to find the children and the truth, but soon learns he must also face the ghosts of his past. Their journey into the unknown takes them further and further away from civilization, bringing into question everything they believe, while slowly eroding the distinction between real and surreal.”


	The project has gone under some changes during its 20 years or so in development. For one, the setting used to be Afghanistan and centered on a war correspondent being the lone survivor of an attack on a group of Americans. In the early 2010s, Christian Bale and Sean Penn were attached to star, before Snyder took a detour into his DC movies.


	“The idea of taking camera in hand and simply making a movie in an intimate way is very appealing to me,” Snyder said in a statement provided to The Hollywood Reporter. “The Last Photograph is a meditation of life and death, embodying some of the trials that I have experienced in my own life and the exploration of those ideas through image making.”

	











	Snyder has several movie projects in development, among them an MMA slugfest titled Brawler and an action thriller centered around the LAPD.

	Snyder has long wanted to make The Last Photograph, but his busy schedule directing big-budget tentpoles has always led to having table the film. Recently, he not only saw a window to fit the film in before focusing on another large production and also had the actors he wanted to star in it after the three had a strong bond working on Rebel Moon together. Once the financing was in place, pre-production was off to the races, and Snyder officially was underway. He is repped by CAA and Sloane Offer Weber & Dern.

On the TV side, Martin has the Channel 4 series In Flight. He is repped by UTA, Independent Talent Group, Untitled Entertainment and Sloane Offer Weber Dern.


	Besides the Rebel Moon films, Fee most recently was seen in the Apple TV+ series Prime Target and also had a role in the Marvel series Hawkeye. He is repped by Paradigm Talent Agency, 42, Untitled Entertainment and Goodman Genow Schenkman.

Madonna celebrated her 67th birthday in spectacular fashion by fulfilling a longtime dream to attend the historic Palio di Siena horse race in Italy, surrounded by her children and boyfriend Akeem Morris during an unforgettable Tuscan getaway.

The Queen of Pop marked her special day on August 16 by experiencing one of Italy's most treasured traditions, sharing the moments with her family while staying at a luxurious 16th-century villa in the heart of Tuscany's wine country.

Madonna's birthday celebration centered around attending the legendary Palio di Siena, a horse race that has entertained audiences since medieval times. The event held special significance for the singer, who had long hoped to witness this particular tradition on her birthday.

“My Dream for many years has been to watch the Palio horse race in Sienna that takes place on my birthday, August 16, since 1482!!” Madonna shared on Instagram, in a reel of the spectacular celebration. “There are no words to describe the excitement, the suspense, and the Pageantry!! A truly sacred ritual to witness thousands of people hushed to a silence before the race begins!”

The singer was clearly moved by the experience, describing the race as “impossible to describe” while expressing gratitude for the opportunity to witness such a meaningful cultural event. She concluded her heartfelt message by stating, “Dreams do come true.”

Madonna watched the historic race from a balcony overlooking the track, accompanied by her children, including daughter Lourdes, 28, son Rocco, 25, and her adopted twin daughters Stella and Estere, 12. Her boyfriend, Akeem Morris, 28, also joined the family celebration.

The Palio di Siena has taken place in the Tuscan city twice yearly since the 17th century, with the first formal race organized in 1633. The event represents centuries of Italian tradition and pageantry, making Madonna's attendance particularly meaningful given her deep appreciation for Italian culture.

A post shared by Madonna (@madonna)

Following the horse race, Madonna and her family retreated to Villa Il Palagio, Sting and Trudie Styler's exclusive 16th-century Tuscan estate. The luxury property sits on 900 acres of picturesque vineyards and is available for private rental, reportedly costing £18,000 for two nights, according to the Daily Mail.

The celebration included a VIP dinner and fireworks display at the stunning villa. A source told the Daily Mail: “Everyone turned out to support Madonna and she had an amazing trip. She loves to celebrate her birthday in Italy and this was one of the best yet. She's been friends with Sting for years so I'm sure he will have sorted her out mates rates for his huge estate.”

One of the celebration's most talked-about elements was Madonna's birthday cake, which featured a pink Labubu doll design complete with her iconic conical bra look. The cake included the playful message “Happy birthday Madudu.” 

Swedish fashion designer Bea Åkerlund documented parts of the celebration on Instagram, sharing glimpses of the fireworks and festivities at the magnificent estate.

The birthday celebration comes just months after Madonna honored her father, Silvio Ciccone's, 94th birthday with a touching tribute. “He has survived many wars and many losses in his life, and he still has a sense of humor and a strong desire to get out of bed every morning and make the most of his day,” she wrote.

Celebrity friends, including Andy Cohen, who wrote “Happy birthday Queen,” Katy Perry, who added “MY QUEEN,” and Justin Trudeau, Former Prime Minister of Canada, who added, “Happy happy birthday,” joined in wishing Madonna well on social media.
