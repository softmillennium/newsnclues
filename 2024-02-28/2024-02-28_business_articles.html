Lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried, the former head of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, have requested a sentence of just five to six years in prison in the wake of his conviction last year on seven counts of fraud.

U.S. probation officials have recommended a sentence of 100 years for Bankman-Fried's role in orchestrating what prosecutors described as an elaborate, multibillion-dollar fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced March 28. 

In a 98-page memo filed Tuesday, Bankman-Fried's lawyers portray him as suffering from an array of neurological and personality issues that could not be overcome, turning him into a "tragic" figure.

"Sam presents at times as a paradox," the lawyers write. "Not because he is deliberately deceiving or conniving, but rather because that is how he is 'wired' as a human. He has an exceptional IQ, but difficulty with conventional styles of communication, especially around emotion."

They add that those who know Bankman-Fried know he is "selfless, altruistic, and cares about those less fortunate."

"Well before ... FTX ever existed, Sam committed his life to philanthropy, pledging to earn money and give it away, with the goal of 'helping the world’s poorest people,'" the lawyers write, citing another statement made by a Bankman-Fried character witness.

Bankman-Fried was not motivated by greed or material concerns, the lawyers write — a notion seemingly belied by the lavish style he and his colleagues enjoyed in the Bahamas while they ran FTX, which included living in a $35 million penthouse.

The lawyers further allege that the loss to FTX customers was ultimately zero — and indeed, representatives for the bankruptcy estate of FTX said this month that they expect to fully repay customers and creditors with legitimate claims.

Bankman-Fried is being held at a detention facility in New York City. Citing the statement of a fellow inmate, the lawyers say Bankman-Fried's neurodiversity and lack of physical stature, along with the high-profile nature of his crimes, may put him at risk of physical harm in prison.

"Sam being the 'least physically intimidating person' … has and will lead to him being frequently targeted for hazing, harassment, and assault more so than the average inmate," the lawyers write.

Prosecutors have until March 15 to respond to the memo.

Jamie Dimon applauded Texas for its business-friendly policies and said other areas including New York City should do more to attract investment. 

The chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co. praised Texas’s lack of an income tax and its light regulatory touch, which have prompted companies to relocate or expand in the state. JPMorgan’s workforce in Texas has surpassed 30,000 in recent years while New York’s total has slipped to less than 29,000 from 35,000. </p>

Heritage Foundation director of the tech policy center Kara Frederick discusses Google's plan to relaunch its AI image generator tool on 'Varney & Co.'

Google is working to fix its Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) tool, CEO Sundar Pichai told employees on Tuesday, calling the images generated by the model "biased" and "completely unacceptable." 

The Alphabet-owned company paused Gemini's image generation feature last week after users on social media flagged that Gemini was creating inaccurate historical images that sometimes replaced White people with images of Black, Native American and Asian people. 

In a note to employees, Pichai said the tool's responses were offensive to users and had shown bias.

"Our teams have been working around the clock to address these issues. We're already seeing a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts ... And we'll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale," he said.

The company now plans to relaunch Gemini AI in the next few weeks. News website Semafor first reported the news, which was later confirmed by a Google spokesperson.

Google has issued several apologies for Gemini after critics slammed the AI for creating "woke" content. 

Prabhakar Raghavan, senior vice president of Google's Knowledge & Information, said Friday that the AI tool "missed the mark" in a blog post explaining what went wrong.

While explaining "what happened," Raghavan said Gemini was built to avoid "creating violent or sexually explicit images, or depictions of real people" and that various prompts should provide a "range of people" versus images of "one type of ethnicity."

"However, if you prompt Gemini for images of a specific type of person — such as ‘a Black teacher in a classroom,’ or ‘a white veterinarian with a dog’ — or people in particular cultural or historical contexts, you should absolutely get a response that accurately reflects what you ask for," Raghavan wrote. "So what went wrong? In short, two things. First, our tuning to ensure that Gemini showed a range of people failed to account for cases that should clearly not show a range. And second, over time, the model became way more cautious than we intended and refused to answer certain prompts entirely — wrongly interpreting some very anodyne prompts as sensitive."

"These two things led the model to overcompensate in some cases, and be over-conservative in others, leading to images that were embarrassing and wrong," he continued. "This wasn’t what we intended. We did not want Gemini to refuse to create images of any particular group. And we did not want it to create inaccurate historical — or any other — images."

Raghavan said Gemini's image generation feature will go through "extensive testing" before it is back online. 

Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, Google has been racing to produce AI software rivaling what the Microsoft-backed company had introduced.

When Google released its generative AI chatbot Bard a year ago, the company shared inaccurate information about pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system in a promotional video, causing shares to slide as much as 9%.

Bard was rebranded as Gemini earlier this month and Google has introduced three versions of the product at different subscription tiers: Gemini Ultra, the largest and most capable of highly complex tasks; Gemini Pro, best for scaling across a wide range of tasks; and Gemini Nano, the most efficient for on-device tasks.

Police are investigating after employees at a Dairy Queen in Kentucky say they were forced to eat ice cream contaminated with cleaning solution, local outlet WKYT reported.

Angela Patton told the outlet her 17-year-old daughter was among the employees involved in the incident at the Dairy Queen, located in Campton, Kentucky.

"They were told by the manager that whether or not they liked chocolate ice cream, they were going to taste it today," Patton told WKYT.

Patton told the outlet many of the about eight employees involved in the incident were minors, and their manager had told the group that they hadn't cleaned the ice cream machine properly, so they were served the contaminated ice cream as a punishment.

Several of them, she said, experienced burning sensations while eating the ice cream and sought medical treatment, though Business Insider could not verify her claims.

"The safety of our fans and crew members is our top priority. When we received complaints, we immediately began an investigation, which is ongoing. We are reviewing our processes and covering expenses for crew members involved," franchise owner Steve Caudill said in a statement to Business Insider. "The manager involved is no longer employed at our restaurant. Know that we contacted local law enforcement to assist and we are fully cooperating with their investigation."

Wolfe County Sheriff's Office, the local authorities investigating the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular working hours.

Elijah Banks, a deputy with Wolfe County Sheriff's Office, told WKYT that little could be shared about the ongoing investigation due to the involvement of the juveniles. However, he said Wolfe County officials are in contact with the county attorney to determine the next steps.

No charges have yet been filed.

In New York, a woman was recently denied a retrial after she received a 23-year sentence for poisoning and killing her boss with a medication used for gout.

Incidents of product tampering can also result in felony charges, as in the 2019 case of a mother who allowed her young daughter to lick a tongue depressor at a medical clinic and then put it back, resulting in a felony charge that was later reduced to a misdemeanor. The woman was inspired to record a video of the incident due to an online trend of licking consumer products and putting them back for unsuspecting buyers to take home.

The trend has been around for nearly a decade. It has grown exponentially since 2015 when Ariana Grande was famously caught on camera licking a doughnut that was later sold to an unsuspecting customer — for which she faced intense backlash.

But the filthy habit has also continued into recent years, with a so-called "sushi terrorism" resulting in several arrests after videos went viral of pranksters in Japan licking utensils and soy sauce bottles and rubbing saliva on the conveyer belt.

February 28, 2024 — This story has been updated with a response from the Dairy Queen franchise owner.
