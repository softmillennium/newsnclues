The strong interest in Chinese social media of bitcoin prices‚Äô ascent reflects how a community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts on the mainland continues to thrive, despite Beijing‚Äôs rigid stance against all crypto-related activities.

Investing in cryptocurrencies has recently become more attractive to some people on the mainland, as the country‚Äôs stock market continues to plummet amid its economic woes, according to a Reuters report in January.

Cryptocurrency trading via a number of major exchanges has also remained active in mainland China, as traders employ a range of workarounds to skirt loosely implemented restrictions.

Still, the Chinese government has ramped up its scrutiny of all activities related to cryptocurrencies over the years, citing risks to financial stability.

In research firm Chainalysis‚Äô ranking of cryptocurrency adoption in 20 major countries, mainland China took the No 11 spot last year after placing tenth in 2022.

While mainland China‚Äôs ranking in terms of trading volume on centralised crypto exchanges dropped to the No 10 spot last year after placing second in 2022, Chainalysis said the country ranked 13th in peer-to-peer trading volume last year, up from No 144 in 2022.</p>

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged on Wednesday to break above $60,000, putting it within striking distance of its all-time high as enthusiasm for the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency reached a frenzy last seen during a 2021 boom.

The digital asset climbed as high as $63,900, touching its highest intraday point since November 2021, before dropping back to the $60,000 level amid reports that some users of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) began showing a $0 balance in their accounts.

Coinbase first said on its website that "we are aware that some users may see a zero balance across their Coinbase accounts and may experience errors in buying or selling" but that "your assets are safe."

A second update said "we‚Äôre beginning to see improvement in customer trading. Due to increased traffic, some customers may still see errors in login, sends, receives and with some payment methods." A third update offered the assurance that "we are starting to see Coinbase.com activity normalizing."

Its CEO Brian Armstrong also tried to calm customers Wednesday. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, he first said that "we are dealing with a LARGE surge of traffic ‚Äî apologies for any issues you encounter. The team is working to remediate."

Later in the day he said "apps are now recovering" and wrote that the surge in traffic had exceeded what the company had "load tested."

Apps are now recovering.We had modeled a ~10x surge in traffic and load tested it. This exceeded that number.It's expensive to keep services over-provisioned, but we'll need to keep working on auto-scaling solutions, and killing any remaining bottlenecks. Thank you for‚Ä¶ https://t.co/JXVppV57AF

‚Äî Brian Armstrong üõ°Ô∏è (@brian_armstrong) February 28, 2024

Before prices pulled back amid the Coinbase snafu, the rally had been pushing closer to bitcoin's all-time mark of $68,789. That apex came in November 2021, six months before a spectacular crash in 2022.

"Ultimately, what we're seeing is crypto is kind of rising from the ashes of the 2022 market," said Ryan Rasmussen, a senior crypto research analyst for Bitwise Asset Management.

Bitcoin is riding a wave of excitement sparked by a series of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that started trading in January. Those funds gave everyday investors widespread exposure to the digital asset, triggering predictions of a new bull run.

"Our assumption is that the price of bitcoin is going to achieve $125,000 by the end of 2025," Benchmark's Mark Palmer added on Yahoo Finance Live.

Investors are bidding other cryptocurrencies and related stocks higher too. Year to date, the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), has outperformed bitcoin by more than 4% while the total market value for all crypto assets is up roughly 34% to $2.22 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.

One sign of surging enthusiasm for bitcoin is the trading activity in the bitcoin ETFs that launched in January. They have logged more than $6.7 billion in net flows as of Wednesday, according to data collected by London-based fund Farside Investors.

So far this quarter, bitcoin trading volume has surpassed levels seen for the same period in every quarter of 2023.

That activity has been a boon to major crypto trading venues, including Coinbase and Robinhood (HOOD).

But the surge in trading also became a liability for Coinbase Wednesday as some of its users began reporting that their account balances showed $0.

Coinbase's stock dropped in intraday trading as it provided updates about its efforts to resolve the issue and it closed roughly flat for the day.

We are aware that some users may see a zero balance across their Coinbase accounts & may experience errors in buying or selling. Our team is investigating this & will provide an update shortly. Your assets are safe.You can track this incident at https://t.co/a3pl4WiDhZ

‚Äî Coinbase Support (@CoinbaseSupport) February 28, 2024

Other bitcoin-related stocks are also riding higher. Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital (MARA) and bitcoin holder MicroStrategy (MSTR) have risen 35% and 40%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. MicroStrategy announced Monday morning that it acquired an additional 3,000 BTC, bringing its total investment to 193,000 BTC, which was valued at over $11.8 billion as of Wednesday.

Derivatives traders are also now piling into the bitcoin rally, according to Cumberland Labs analyst Christopher Newhouse.

There are roughly $25 billion of open contracts in the bitcoin futures market, according to crypto derivatives data provider Coinglass. That‚Äôs a new high for outstanding bitcoin futures bets, surpassing a mark last set in April 2021.

"In the options market, the narrative is clear," Newhouse added. "People are bullish."

Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, but that was pushed to the max today as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) jumped as much as 12.6% to over $64,000 for a moment only to plunge to $59,000 an hour later. At 3:30 p.m. ET, the cryptocurrency is trading at around $60,000 and is still up 5% over the past 24 hours.

The entire market followed Bitcoin's move, but Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were two of the more notable movers. Ethereum jumped 7.4% at its peak only to fall back to flat for the day. Dogecoin regained most of its late afternoon pop and is up 13% on the day.

When assets move quickly, it often causes a squeeze on leveraged positions. When a stock or cryptocurrency rises, this is known as a short squeeze where short-sellers are forced to buy to cover losses, fueling the rally further. According to Coinglass, in the last 24 hours, there were $175.5 million in short leverage positions liquidated for Bitcoin and $363 million across crypto, which could have fueled the run-up.

But on the way down the opposite is true. Leverage long positions must be sold, which causes the drop to accelerate. In the past 24 hours, $85.9 million in long Bitcoin positions and $336.4 million in crypto long positions were liquidated.

It didn't help that Coinbase Global¬†had a glitch on its app that caused customers to see a zero balance. That caused some people to be unable to trade during this period of high volatility.

CEO Brian Armstrong said there was an over 10x increase in traffic to the company's apps during this period. That shows just how much trading was likely taking place in a very short period of time.

The move in Ethereum comes about two weeks ahead of the upgrade being called Dencun, which is expected to make the blockchain less expensive and faster. That could increase the utilization of Ethereum as a token for real-world utility.

It has also helped that the rise in Bitcoin following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs has led to speculation that Ethereum ETFs could be next. This is the second-largest cryptocurrency and would make sense as the next crypto ETF given the scale and name recognition.

Dogecoin also has name recognition and as a memecoin that's driven by sentiment on most days, it's not surprising to see the token up big today. But that doesn't mean the move will last because there's no fundamental change in the token from just a day ago.

The one thing that is certain is that crypto will be volatile in the future. What's less clear is where prices are headed.

The crypto industry is driven largely by sentiment and over the last few months the sentiment has been strong for both crypto and growth stocks, which are usually correlated with crypto values.

If momentum continues, values could easily go higher. But keep in mind that the momentum could turn quickly if the market goes south.

BREAKING: Dow Futures Fall As Snowflake Tumbles









Cryptocurrency News: Crypto prices and related stocks continued to rally Wednesday as bitcoin scrambled above $59,000. Coinbase stock climbed beyond its buy range after Monday's breakout.

Coinbase and converted bitcoin ETFs Grayscale Bitcoin Trust(GBTC) and Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) are now trading above their pre-Jan. 11 highs. DEFI broke out past a buy point on Tuesday.

Jan. 11 was a historic day for the crypto industry after the SEC approved 11 bitcoin ETF applications late Jan. 10, which included issuers ARK Invest (ARKK), BlackRock (BLK), Grayscale, VanEck and more. Coinbase is serving as the custodian for a majority of the new ETF issuers. How are crypto custodians keeping digital assets secure?

Other trends are set to drive bitcoin in 2024, including the upcoming halving event in April and influx of institutional participation.

Bitcoin had spiked to $49,000 January 11 on the ETF launch day but then fell back into its early December 2023 level prior to the SEC announcement. The world's largest cryptocurrency rebounded about 157% in 2023. Bitcoin is up more than 40% so far this year, with most of the gains compounded in February.

Ethereum touched a new 52-week high of $3,368, before easing slightly. It is trading at its best level since April 2022. The No. 2 crypto leapt roughly 92% in 2023. Ethereum jumped 45% so far in 2024.

Digital asset investments are extremely volatile. While cryptocurrency's fundamentals and technical indicators may differ, investors should focus on the same key objectives. First, stay protected by learning when it's time to sell, cut losses or capture profits. Second, prepare to profit if the cryptocurrency starts to rebound.

Despite their original promise, cryptocurrencies haven't acted as hedges against inflation. Instead, they've trended with the broader indexes. Read The Big Picture and Market Pulse to track daily market trends.

Eric Poliner believes in digital currency as an alternative to cash and is banking on others feeling the same, too.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still waiting for that random customer to walk in and say, ‚ÄòDo you take bitcoin?‚Äô I‚Äôm doing what I can to see that happen,‚Äù said Poliner, whose team of technology specialists helped to set up a groundbreaking move in the world of digital currency at Chadd‚Äôs Bistro in Shelby Township.

The establishment was a takeout business but this month owner Chad Elliot opened a restaurant down the street that not only features his popular selection of original sandwiches but offers patrons a menu of ways for cashing out.

Credit card, cash, Bitcoin and even gold backs are accepted by the cashiers who have no problem navigating the program Poliner‚Äôs MI Lightning Rod team including himself, Brendan Brown and Sagar Shah created for Elliot.

‚ÄúThis is what a bill would look like,‚Äù said Poliner demonstrating a typical transaction at Chadd‚Äôs Bistro.

The bill for a bitcoin-paying customer has a QR code that the customer scans. Then their personal crypto wallet reads the virtual address where it should send the payment. This address is usually a one-time destination code.

Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and enthusiasts feel the more people become familiar with it, the more businesses will start accepting it.

‚ÄúWe are excited to embrace the future of finance and cater to the growing community of cryptocurrency users,‚Äù said Elliot. ‚ÄúBy accepting bitcoin, lightning and other cryptocurrencies, Chadd‚Äôs Bistro aims to become a hub for Michigan‚Äôs vibrant community of bitcoin enthusiasts.‚Äú

Elliot who supports voluntaryist principles that stem from the idea of natural rights, equality, non-coercion, and non-aggression said he wishes more people would trade their bitcoins rather than just sitting on it.

‚ÄúConvincing people to spend it is a big part of what we‚Äôre hoping to see happen,‚Äù he said.

How can you become a bitcoin user?

Chadd‚Äôs Bistro is not only a gathering place for individuals and families looking to eat but once a month hosts a happy hour for bitcoin enthusiasts looking to exchange ideas, questions or currency for food. Poliner said there are a handful of people across the state developing their own crypto/bitcoin projects independently.

‚ÄúWe loosely connect to share progress, use each other‚Äôs products, and exchange ideas,‚Äù Poliner said.

Their next meeting at the bistro is March 5 at 4 p.m.

Need to find a bitcoin ATM before the meeting or lunch? There are about 807 bitcoin ATMs in 34 states and 559 cities including more than a few in Michigan. In fact you cannot see the state‚Äôs outline on a map of bitcoin ATMs as the orange tacks show locations from Taylor and White Lake to Roseville, Detroit and Warren.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use it but I think it‚Äôs good to have that option for customers who do,‚Äù said Carol Profit of Troy.

Other customers agreed the more options the better including Brandon Thomas of Shelby Township, who was joined by his wife Janice, although she insists on the old adage, ‚Äúcash is king.‚Äù

As for their son Brice? By the time he‚Äôs old enough to pay the bill chances are bitcoin will be one of many digital currencies that he will use. For now the 11-year-old was just happy his dad was treating him to a platter of barbecued pork and coleslaw sliders.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre really good,‚Äù said Brice.
