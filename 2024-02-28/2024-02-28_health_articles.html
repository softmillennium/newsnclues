CHARLESTON COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - It’s been about six months since a new medical provider took over healthcare operations at the Al Canon Detention Center in Charleston County.

On Wednesday, VitalCore representatives attended a Criminal Justice Coordinating Council meeting, introduced themselves and answered questions from community advocates in the audience.

In July 2023, VitalCore Health Strategies replaced Wellpath, the company U.S. Justice Department was investigating after several inmates died at the jail. 

VitalCore introduced a behavioral health clinic a few weeks into its operations, highlighting it as something the jail and inmates did not have before that provides onsite mental health services. Right now, the behavioral health unit has four employees who all see patients.

Vice President of Behavioral Health at VitalCore Jeff Brewer talked about what the transition process has been like as well as what services VitalCore has to offer.

“Then we took over behavior health because we didn’t have behavior health there, at all. So we started fresh with that group of individuals, so that they’re all new, and we had to seek them out through the community,” Brewer said. 

Vital Core representatives explained their other health services including on-site dental, dialysis, 24-hour providers and nurses, lab, a pharmacist and MAT addiction treatment.

“We try and keep as much of the staff as we can, because starting fresh, bringing a whole bunch of people into the corrections environment that haven’t worked there before can be kind of chaotic. So we try and keep as many people as we can, and not do something with turnover,” Brewer said.

People at Wednesday’s meeting who heard the presentation had questions for the provider. Criminal Justice Coordinating Council Director Ellen Steinberg said VitalCore reached out to them about giving a presentation.

“A lot of people were really eager to meet them and hear from them. I felt like everybody had their questions answered. We did not see them try to dodge any questions,” Steinberg said.

Questions included how to iron out access to MAT drug methadone in addition to suboxone or buprenorphine. Right now, people are able to continue their addiction-weaning treatment with the other two drugs but don’t have access to methadone within the jail yet if that’s their brand.

Another question came from a stakeholder who works with juvenile court. They noticed that youth offenders were still being given papers to leave the nearby detention center to get treatment.

“So one of the questions was regarding our services to the juvenile offenders. And I was a little shocked when I heard that we weren’t servicing those individuals because I believe that we are. So I just didn’t want to talk with some people and make sure that there’s not any loopholes with that process and that we’re able to give the juveniles the best care we can,” Brewer said.

Steinberg said it’s a good sign that the representatives were willing to answer their questions.

“At this point, I’m looking forward to the future partnership. Again, the fact that they reached out to us and wanted to speak to us and introduce themselves. That’s a game changer,” she said.

Since VitalCore took the healthcare at the jail, there has been one death at the Al Cannon Detention Center.

The coroner ruled the cause of death an overdose and a report states the inmate was not responsive but healthcare workers were not called before they had died in custody.

The Charleston County Sheriff’s Office provided the following statement regarding the transition to VitalCore at the jail:

We have been very pleased with Vital Core’s service and constant communication within the Sheriff Al Canon Detention Center since taking over last year. We look forward to continuing to grow this relationship.

EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) - Gov. Tony Evers partially signed Senate Bill 1015 today, securing $15 million in crisis response resources to support healthcare access in western Wisconsin in the wake of HSHS and Prevea Health’s decision to close several locations.

We are pleased with the actions taken by Gov. Evers today to put $15 million toward hospital services in the Chippewa Valley. We also thank Sen. Jesse James, Rep. Rob Summerfield and other local legislators for their leadership on this legislation and getting it signed into law.

While there are many issues and challenges that face health care in the region with more work to do, this is an appropriate first step.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A hack of one of the country’s largest healthcare technology companies is causing headaches and delays for local veterans trying to fill their prescriptions.

>>> STREAM ACTION NEWS JAX LIVE <<<

Currently, pharmacies have to manually process prescriptions while the company works to get its systems back online.

Last week, a cyber attack against Change Healthcare, one of the country’s largest healthcare technology companies, forced the payment processor to shut down its systems.

One of the biggest healthcare providers impacted by the attack is Tricare, which covers 9.5 million veterans and other beneficiaries.

Retired US Navy veteran. Jeffery Rutland told Action News Jax since the hack, he’s been hitting one roadblock after another trying to get prescriptions filled for him and his wife.

“It’s not up. It’s not up. Now, today they told me, well, you can go get an appointment to see your doctor, the doctor can give you a new prescription for you to go outside to a Walgreens, CVS. But then Tricare still can’t process,” said Rutland.

According to Naval Hospital Jacksonville, the pharmacy is still processing prescriptions for chronic pain, ADHD medications, and emergency refills for medically necessary medications.

“Each military hospital and clinic will continue to offer pharmacy operations based on their local manning and resources. Please be patient while pharmacies take longer than usual to safely fill prescription needs,” a hospital spokesperson told Action News Jax in an emailed statement.

“The company is saying it should be within a matter of days to get partial capability back,” said US Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL 6th District).

Waltz, a former Green Beret, told Action News Jax veterans can likely expect some delays for weeks as Change Healthcare works to get its systems fully restored.

In addition to the headaches for veterans, Waltz argued the cyber attack has exposed a key vulnerability in terms of national security, as there are only a few companies that provide these payment processing services for prescriptions.

“Yes, we have military strength, but really the strength of the United States of America is our economy. And whether it’s nukes in space that could take out our satellites or cyber attacks that could hit our critical infrastructure, we have to be prepared,” said Waltz.

Waltz said the cyber attack should be a wakeup call for federal lawmakers to start considering whether the number of health care payment processors should be expanded to ensure a future attack won’t have such widespread impacts.

For veterans like Rutland, they’re just hoping things get back to normal as soon as possible.

“Everything is not running the way it’s supposed to be running. And there has been a hack and they’re telling me there has been a hack. Okay, so I can understand that now. So, what can we do to expedite the situation?” said Rutland.

The group known by the names of Blackcat and Alphv says it exfiltrated 6 TB of data in the attack.










The cybercriminal group known by the names of Blackcat and Alphv claimed responsibility Wednesday for the disruptive cyberattack against Change Healthcare.

The Russian-speaking cybercriminal gang said on its darkweb site that it exfiltrated 6 TB of data in the attack against Change Healthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group’s Optum subsidiary.

A spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group said the company is aware of the claims and is looking into them.

[Related: Blackcat Ransomware Linked With ScreenConnect, Recent Health Care Attacks: US]

The attack has disrupted U.S. pharmacies as well as other health-care facilities and offices.

Reuters had reported Monday that the attack involved the Blackcat ransomware strain.

The report linking Blackcat with the Change Healthcare attack—and now the apparent confirmation by the cybercriminal group—has raised questions about UnitedHealth’s initial attribution of the attack to a nation-state threat actor. The attribution was part of UnitedHealth’s disclosure of the incident to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 21.

The latest statement posted by Change Healthcare Wednesday does not contain any new information from its prior disclosures. “The disruption is expected to last at least through the day,” the statement read, repeating a line that was included in the statements of prior days.

The latest post also reiterated that Change Healthcare is taking “multiple approaches to restore the impacted environment.”

In a statement provided Tuesday to media outlets including CRN, UnitedHealth said it has seen “minimal reports” of patients being unable to access prescriptions.

In part, this is because more than 90 percent of pharmacies in the U.S. are believed to use “modified electronic claim processing to mitigate impacts from the Change Healthcare cyber security issue,” the company said in the statement.</p>

A new collaborative study between Boston Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia finds exposure to neighborhood violence among children was associated with unmet health needs and increased acute care utilization. Published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and based on nationally representative data on violence exposure and gold standard access to care measures from the National Health Interview Survey, this study shows that evidence-based interventions to improve access to care in communities impacted by violence are needed to mitigate long-term physical and mental health consequences for children.

Millions of children in the U.S. are exposed to violence in their homes or communities. Research has shown that children exposed to violence have worse school performance in childhood, increased rates of substance use disorder in adolescence, increased rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder in adulthood, and increased risk of developing chronic medical conditions throughout their lives. Exposure to violence also deepens child health inequities, particularly in marginalized communities disproportionately exposed to violence due to systemic racism across generations.

This study helps examine violence exposure at the population level as both a direct driver of health inequities and as a consequence of fundamental causes like racism, poverty, and other structural risk conditions. The researchers found that, even after controlling for the effects of other important factors like family income and insurance status, children exposed to neighborhood violence face unmet physical and mental health care needs, cost-related barriers, decreased access to prescription drugs, increased urgent care and emergency department utilization, and decreased access to preventive care, mental health care, and medications.

The study also identified an association between exposure to neighborhood violence and mental health symptoms, including increased rates of depression and anxiety, which was consistent with multiple previous studies. Researchers also found that children exposed to violence have higher rates of delayed and forgone mental health care despite experiencing more mental health symptoms. Prior research shows how early access to care can mitigate the mental health consequences of violence exposure; improving access to high-quality, affordable mental health care services remains critical in communities impacted by neighborhood violence.

Researchers call attention to built-in environment reforms like neighborhood greening and cleanup, poverty alleviation interventions like the expanded Child Tax Credit, insurance coverage protections like continuous Medicaid enrollment, and hospital-based violence prevention programs as opportunities to take action.

Our findings highlight the profound impacts of limited access to care in communities affected by violence. We also identify specific opportunities for evidence-based clinician, health system, and policy actions that can reduce the incidence of neighborhood violence and mitigate its health consequences."

"To improve health outcomes for the millions of children in the United States affected by neighborhood violence, we have to invest in their families and communities," said senior author Aditi Vasan, MD, MSHP, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. "Our findings underscore the need for both upstream policy interventions, like the expanded Child Tax Credit, which would provide essential economic support for families in low-income communities impacted by violence, and downstream health system interventions focused on improving access to high-quality, trauma-informed care for these children and their families."

At this year's 2024 HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition in Orlando, attendees will again have the chance to attend and participate in the conference's annual Views from the Top sessions – special high-level keynotes and presentations from leaders from across healthcare, government and the private sector.

The 60-minute lectures will offer fresh and fascinating insights into the hottest topics in healthcare in 2024, from AI challenges and opportunities to the collaborative priorities between government agencies aimed at boosting IT innovation in how healthcare is delivered and disrupted, regulated and reimbursed.

Here are just a few of the Views from the Top sessions on offer at HIMSS24.

On Tuesday March 12 at 10:30 a.m. in room W224E, Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Deputy National Coordinator Steve Posnack of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT will offer insights into the collaborative nature – and future – of the relationship between CDC and the ONC, and how public health can make better use of information and technology.

In addition to their thoughts on the power of partnership to advance tech innovations in healthcare, Cohen and Posnack will also outline their strategic priorities for the year ahead during the session, ONC & CDC Discuss the Nexus of Health IT and Public Health.

In the session, Digital Health Start-ups: Harnessing Innovation to Disrupt and Improve Care Delivery, scheduled for Tuesday, March 12 at noon in room W224E, Sally Frank, worldwide lead for health and life sciences at Microsoft, will moderate a panel of leaders from successful startups on the need for passion, curiosity and a healthy dose of skepticism when seeking to foster an innovative culture across the digital health ecosystem.

By synthesizing patient journey experiences, stakeholders can drive meaningful and lasting change, while the significance of patient-centric care focused on quality outcomes and accessibility, will require the adoption of innovative approaches to respond to evolving market forces.

And on Tuesday March 12 at 1:30 p.m. in room W224E, longtime health IT pioneer Dr. John Halamka, president of Mayo Clinic Platform, will hold court on a topic he has been deeply curious about in recent years – along with all of us – generative AI. No question the technology is poised to set off a revolution in healthcare and promises transformative value. While the potential benefits are immense, so too are the challenges. Implementing qualitative, clinical and technical guardrails is crucial to navigating this complex landscape effectively.

Halamka's lecture, Keeping the Generative AI Bullet Train on the Tracks, looks at ways to address both advantages and disadvantages of genAI to help healthcare leaders ensure this high-speed innovation train stays on track and leverage innovation to drive positive impacts in patient care and healthcare delivery.

On Wednesday, March 13 at 1 p.m. in room W224E, Angela Shippy, senior physician executive and director at Amazon Web Services, will moderate a panel comprising three healthcare IT leaders who will explore methods to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and achieve clinical, financial and patient-care objectives.

At the session, Reinventing Healthcare Delivery with the Digital Transformation: Optimizing Costs, Experiences, and Outcomes, attendees will gain insights into the implications of the workforce shortfall, leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery, workforce satisfaction and bridging health IT competency gaps to advance the quadruple aim of healthcare.

And on Wednesday, March 13 at 2:30 p.m. in room W224E, Michael Meucci, president and CEO of Arcadia, will emcee a panel discussion exploring payment reform and cost pressures that considers technology and offers strategies for providers to navigate change.

That session, Tech-Driven Healthcare Transformation: Navigating Innovation, Payment Reform and Patient Care, will help attendees will learn about strategies of digital-first competitors and essential capabilities for competing in the evolving healthcare landscape. The discussion aims to help attendees develop strategies to incorporate digital and AI capabilities into care delivery for competitive advantage.

HIMSS24 is scheduled to take place March 11-15 in Orlando. Learn more and register.

Nuvance Health, a hospital system that services Putnam, Dutchess and Connecticut, is joining with Northwell Health, the biggest hospital systems in the New York metro area.

In a news release Wednesday, both nonprofit hospital systems say they decided to join forces to "form a new integrated regional health system" connecting New York and Connecticut.

“This partnership opens a new and exciting chapter for Northwell and Nuvance Health and provides an incredible opportunity to enhance both health systems and take patient care and services to an even higher level,” said Michael Dowling, president and CEO of Northwell Health. “We have similar missions in providing high-quality care for patients in the communities we serve. We look forward to building on the care that Nuvance Health’s 14,000 staff members and providers deliver each and every day.”

The newly combined systems would grow to 14,500 providers and over 1,000 healthcare sites, including 28 hospitals.

Local hospitals within the existing Nuvance Health system like Putnam Hospital in Carmel, Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie and Danbury Hospital in Connecticut will now be affiliated with the Northwell Health system name, Nuvance spokesperson John Nelson said.

Local Northwell Health affiliated hospitals include Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco and Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow.

However, Nuvance Health patients won't see any changes for some time, according to Nuvance Health spokesperson John Nelson.

"We still have to go through the regulatory approval process, which could take about a year or more," Nelson said.

Northwell Health systems said it will make "significant investments" in Nuvance's locations and services to improve the system's quality of care and increase capacity to serve a larger population. Patients of the combined hospital systems will now have access to healthcare in Connecticut, Mid and Lower Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island.

“By joining forces with Northwell Health, we are taking a giant leap forward in our shared mission to enhance the quality, accessibility and equity of the health care we provide to our communities,” said John M. Murphy, MD, president and CEO of Nuvance Health. “This agreement enables us to make significant improvements to health outcomes for community hospitals and to deliver unparalleled care and drive positive change in the health care landscape.”

Northwell and Nuvance said the merger would also help address health disparities throughout the New York metro region, as well as providing new jobs for healthcare workers across the area.</p>

Empower Healthcare Know Your Numbers by Heart Event

Pahokee, Fla. February 28, 2024– On February 3, 2023, the Empower Healthcare clinic in Pahokee, FL, partnered with Healthier Glades, a Palm Health Foundation initiative, for “Know Your Numbers by Heart,” a special event to promote heart health during American Heart Month. Fifty attendees came to the Senior Resource Room in Pahokee for rapid A1C and cholesterol screenings, nutritional counseling, live CPR demonstrations, and education about preventing heart disease. Testing and information were provided by seventeen community partners, including the American Heart Association, Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, and the Diabetes Coalition of Palm Beach County.

According to the 2022 Palm Beach County, Florida Community Health Assessment, heart disease was the leading cause of death in Palm Beach County. What’s more, Black Americans—the majority in Pahokee—are 54% more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than White Americans, due to distinct risk factors like genetics and systemic disparities.

Empower Health, under the leadership of its founder Dr. Jinga Oglesby-Brihm, has been focused on comprehensive and innovative chronic disease management for the rural Glades community since the clinic opened on the campus of First United Methodist Church in 2022. The heart health event is one of many ways she integrates local and county partners to improve patient health education and access to care. “We are grateful for the opportunity to connect with the community to provide free potentially lifesaving screenings and educational sessions,” she said.

Healthier Glades and Palm Health Foundation have invested in Dr. Oglesby-Brihm to support her goal to “break the chains of healthcare disparity.” A Healthier Glades mini-grant provided funding to deliver healthcare services through churches in the Glades, and a Palm Health Foundation scholarship supported her doctoral studies at FAU College of Nursing, her first exposure to the Glades’ healthcare disparities.

Dr. Oglesby-Brihm’s comprehensive, innovative care for the rural Glades community has also captured national recognition. She placed second in the American Heart Association’s 2022 Empowered to Serve Business Accelerator, awarding her training and a grant of $25,000 to help her grow her health clinic.

“Dr. Oglesby-Brihm and Empower Healthcare are building a culture of health in the Glades by building trust,” said Annie Ifill, Healthier Glades project director. “Her love of the people of our region and her approach to delivering health and services through her clinic and out in the community through events like “Know Your Numbers by Heart,” are helping to overcome disparities and lead the way to a better quality of life.”

A dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. When an unvaccinated person is exposed to measles, public health guidance if for them to get vaccinated within three days.

In mid-February, a measles outbreak started at the Manatee Bay Elementary School in Broward County in South Florida. There are now at least nine cases in the county and one additional one in Polk County in Central Florida. 

Several public health researchers say Florida's current response to the outbreak goes against well-established public health guidance. Florida's surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, has so far not urged parents of unvaccinated children at the school with the outbreak to get their children vaccinated, or to quarantine them. In a Feb. 20 letter, Ladapo left it up to parents to decide whether to send their kids to school.

"I'm flummoxed about this," says Dr. Ali Khan, dean of public health at the University of Nebraska. "I've never heard of a surgeon general who didn't at least advocate for best public health practice." 

Khan says flouting science-based guidance is dangerous. "If you're undermining confidence in public health, including vaccination and public health measures, you are putting an increasing number of people at risk of these diseases that we no longer see anymore," he says. 

Measles is a highly infectious disease, says Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "I mean, you can walk by somebody and catch measles if they have it. It's one of the most infectious diseases that we know about." 

And when people who are not vaccinated or don't have prior immunity get exposed to it, up to 9 out of 10 will get measles, according to CDC.

State data shows that around 8% of kindergartners in Broward County are not vaccinated for measles. 

"If you've been vaccinated, if your children are vaccinated, you don't have to worry about it. [The risk] is really for a small proportion of people whose children are not vaccinated," Plescia says, "But 8% is [still] a lot of children, and the risk is that we could see many of those children getting sick." 

Measles has been around for a very long time – it's been studied for well over a century. And there are clear steps to take to contain an outbreak, says Dr. Scott Rivkees, a public health professor at Brown University: "If you have an outbreak, try to get [unvaccinated] people vaccinated within three days of exposure," he says. 

And because people can spread the virus even if they don't have symptoms, he says, people who are not vaccinated that have been exposed need to quarantine for 21 days.

Rivkees is the former surgeon general in Florida. And that's the advice Florida would be getting, if he was still in the role. 

But Rivkees left in 2021 and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis appointed Ladapo to the role. Ladapo was part of a group that pushed unproven COVID treatments before he took the post. And as surgeon general, he refused to wear masks and discouraged people from getting COVID vaccines.

Rivkees is concerned that skepticism over vaccines for COVID may be spreading to another potentially deadly disease.  

"We have seen an incredible attack on vaccines over the past couple of years," he says. "[Now] we're seeing parents who are not getting their children vaccinated, parents who believe that getting the vaccine, for example, will actually cause measles, when it doesn't."

And when it comes to measles, that vaccine reluctance could lead to unnecessary suffering and even risk of death. While measles is rare in the U.S. because of high vaccination rates, it can be serious. 

A mild case of measles can involve getting a rash, diarrhea and dehydration. In some cases, it can turn into pneumonia. In rare cases it can lead to brain swelling, which can cause kids to lose their sight or hearing.

In late 2022, there was an outbreak in Columbus, Ohio, where 85 people got sick from measles – and 40% of them ended up in the hospital. 

It can also be deadly. Before the vaccine, the U.S. was seeing 500 deaths from measles each year. 

Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in the year 2000. There are still cases, but those usually come when people travel to other countries and bring it back. The U.S. should be able to keep that "elimination" status — so long as each measles outbreak gets contained within a year, according to CDC.

So far this year, there have been at least 35 cases in 15 states. Those numbers will likely continue to grow, especially in parts of the country with low vaccination rates. And experts say that, when state and local authorities flout longstanding public health advice, it could lead to more disease in more communities.

"This is a very, very serious disease and it's completely vaccine preventable," says Khan.

Neal dejong, MD, MPH, at the UNC School of Medicine, David Y. Ming, MD, at Duke University School of Medicine and Ryan Coller, MD, at University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, received $5.5 million to study hospital-to-home transitions across settings for children and youth with special healthcare needs.

Neal dejong, MD, MPH, associate professor of pediatrics and member of the UNC Children’s Research Institute at the UNC School of Medicine
Nearly one in five children, almost 14 million in the United States, have a special healthcare need that may require hospitalization. After a child’s hospital stay, the transition back home can be risky, particularly for children with chronic health issues and complex medical conditions. To understand how to best support children and youth with special healthcare needs (CYSHCN), researchers of the CYSHCN National Research Network (CYSHCNet) received $5.5 million for a multi-site study funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to compare two types of hospital-to-home transitional care to optimize outcomes.
The CYSHCNet researchers are led by David Y. Ming, MD, principal investigator, associate professor of pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine; Neal dejong, MD, MPH, associate professor of pediatrics and member of the UNC Children’s Research Institute at the UNC School of Medicine; and Ryan Coller, MD, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.
Over a one-month post-discharge period, researchers will compare the effectiveness of two transitional care approaches — focused dose versus extended dose — reducing return visits to the hospital or emergency department and increasing parent-reported confidence. They will also evaluate the impact of each type of hospital-to-home transitional care on specific CYSHCN patient groups, including those with highly complex clinical needs and those from racial/ethnic minority groups or living in rural areas. Lastly, researchers will investigate how and why each approach to hospital-to-home transitional care is effective and for whom they work best.
The study team includes multiple community partners, including parents and caregivers with lived experience, clinicians, policymakers, and health system leaders. A community advisory board, primarily composed of a diverse group of parents/caregivers of CYSHCN, will work closely with the research team throughout the study. This collaborative effort aims to contribute to the equitable improvement of overall care for all CYSHCN transitioning from hospital to home.

In comparison to their traditional Medicare counterparts, Medicare Advantage patients are more likely to experience delays in care (22% vs. 13% for original Medicare). The delays in care for MA patients were largely due to the need to get prior approval, or authorization, according to a Commonwealth Fund survey.

MA beneficiaries are also less able to afford care due to copayments or deductibles (12% vs. 7% for original Medicare beneficiaries).  

The survey asked a nationally representative sample of 3,280 Medicare beneficiaries aged 18 and older about the value of their care as measured by access to benefits, services, providers, care coordination and satisfaction.

Among beneficiaries reporting a challenge in getting care, about a third in MA plans (33%) and a third in traditional Medicare (32%) said the problem occurred when trying to access primary care. Smaller shares said the challenge occurred when trying to get surgery (13% for MA plans and 15% for traditional Medicare), physical therapy or rehabilitative care (13% for both), or cardiology care (13% vs. 10%).

About one in six beneficiaries said they were told to go to urgent care because their provider had no appointments available, with no significant difference between people with MA or traditional Medicare (16% vs. 18%).

WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

By most measures, the federal government has always paid MA plans more than what it would cost to cover similar people in traditional Medicare, authors said. Although estimates vary, one study finds that plans were overpaid by more than $27 billion in 2023. These overpayments have raised questions about whether MA enrollees receive greater value that merits the extra cost to Medicare.

MA plans typically provide benefits not covered by traditional Medicare, such as some coverage for vision, hearing, or dental services, and they can help to coordinate enrollees' care, as well as limit their out-of-pocket costs for Medicare-covered benefits. Traditional Medicare, meanwhile, allows beneficiaries to see any provider without the need to obtain prior authorization or a referral – which MA plans often require – and offers a larger selection of Part D plans for prescription drug coverage.

Whether enrolled in Medicare Advantage or traditional Medicare, about two in three beneficiaries overall said their coverage has fully met their expectations, the survey found. Those who said it fell short of expectations pointed to a lack of coverage for needed services, high costs or uncertainty about what benefits are covered.

Three in five beneficiaries in MA plans and one-quarter in traditional Medicare said they were asked to undergo a health assessment, which most frequently resulted in a discussion with their doctor. Few said it resulted in any changes to their care plan or in more services or benefits being offered.

Seven in 10 beneficiaries in MA said they used some of their plan's supplemental benefits in the past year; three in 10 did not use any. Four in 10 reported using their dental or vision benefits or an allowance for over-the-counter medications.

Whether enrolled in Medicare Advantage or traditional Medicare, beneficiaries reported similar access to benefits, services and providers, as well as similar challenges and experiences. Overall, one-third of beneficiaries indicated their coverage fell short of their expectations.

THE LARGER TREND

While Medicare Advantage remains attractive to the healthcare industry due to strong growth, high revenue and earnings per member, profitability is on the decline, a Moody's analysis found this month.

MA performance has remained under pressure in 2023 because of a significant spike in utilization for most of the companies, which Moody's expects will result in lower full-year MA earnings for insurers. Adding to that is lower reimbursement rates for the first time in years that are likely to remain weaker in 2025 and 2026, which is credit negative.

Moody's analysts contend that MA may have "lost its luster," citing as evidence Cigna's efforts to sell its MA business, even after a failed merger with Humana. Cigna recently announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Medicare Advantage, Supplemental Benefits, Medicare Part D and CareAllies businesses to Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) for about $3.7 billion.

Despite the challenges, MA remains popular with seniors, boasting lower out-of-pocket costs and premiums than traditional Medicare. Analysts cited a 2023 Milliman report showing annual estimated healthcare costs per beneficiary are $3,138 compared to $5,000 for traditional Medicare fee-for-service, and over $5,700 if a traditional Medicare beneficiary also buys a Medigap plan. Besides the lower cost, MA also offers additional benefits such as dental, vision and hearing, which are not covered by traditional Medicare.

MA membership has grown nationally at an annual rate of 8% to approximately 32 million, while traditional Medicare has declined at an average annual rate of 1%. Over that time, the percentage of people choosing MA has grown to 49% from 28%.

Last fall, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the Medicare Advantage, Part C and Medicare Part D Star Ratings that rank MA plans by the quality of health and drug services received by consumers. Thirty-one contracts for both Medicare Advantage and the Part D drug plan earned 5 stars, compared to 57 in 2023. Four contracts received the low overall ranking of 2 stars, the same number as in 2023.

ROCHESTER, Minn. — Fueled by strong performance across all activities in 2023, Mayo Clinic achieved remarkable progress toward its goal of transforming healthcare for people everywhere by making critical investments in valued staff, innovative facilities and pioneering digital technologies.

Key performance highlights include:

“By every measure, Mayo Clinic made excellent progress in 2023 towards our goal of creating a better healthcare system for the United States and globally,” says Gianrico Farrugia, M.D., president and CEO, Mayo Clinic. “Our dedicated staff have created and have used new tools and technologies to deliver transformation and are creating a brighter future of healthcare for our patients and ourselves.”

In 2023, Mayo Clinic continued its investment in Mayo Clinic Platform, the first true platform in healthcare. Mayo Clinic Platform is curating the world's healthcare data in a privacy protected, ethical and culturally sensitive way. The Platform brings together solution developers, large and small, around these rich data to accelerate healthcare innovation, and 28 solution developers have utilized the Platform in 2023. Through this work, Mayo Clinic Platform is connecting healthcare systems nationally and globally to these solutions, with an impact on 45 million lives.

Mayo Clinic also invested in the physical component of its strategy to transform healthcare. The organization announced the largest capital investment in Mayo Clinic's history, Bold. Forward. Unbound. in Rochester, which will create innovative spaces incorporating digital technologies and novel care concepts to transform both the patient and staff member experience.

Additional projects underway across the enterprise include Arizona Bold. Forward., which is more than doubling the size of Mayo's Phoenix campus; expansion of the Mayo Clinic hospital in Florida to meet increasing patient demand for complex care; a plan to increase access for patients and spur significant growth in Mayo's cancer practice in Florida; and new Mayo Clinic Health System hospital bed towers in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Mankato, Minnesota. Mayo Clinic also opened the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Building in Rochester, which provides 176,000 square feet of new research space on the campus.

Investing in staff

Last year, 80,221 Mayo Clinic staff cared for 1.3 million patients from over 130 countries. To support patients, growing campuses and new service lines, Mayo Clinic welcomed about 14,000 staff into new roles in 2023, a 4.9% increase from 2022.

Mayo Clinic 2023 staff investments include:

“Our staff deliver excellent care to patients today and innovate to design the care of tomorrow,” says Christina Zorn, chief administrative officer, Mayo Clinic. “Together, we're beginning 2024 in a position of strength and with a spirit of purpose of putting the needs of our patients first."

The U.S. government is warning about the resurgence of BlackCat (aka ALPHV) ransomware attacks targeting the healthcare sector as recently as this month.

"Since mid-December 2023, of the nearly 70 leaked victims, the healthcare sector has been the most commonly victimized," the government said in an updated advisory.

"This is likely in response to the ALPHV/BlackCat administrator's post encouraging its affiliates to target hospitals after operational action against the group and its infrastructure in early December 2023."

The alert comes courtesy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The BlackCat ransomware operation suffered a major blow late last year after a coordinated law enforcement operation led to the seizure of its dark leak sites. But the takedown turned out to be a failure after the group managed to regain control of the sites and switched to a new TOR data leak portal that continues to remain active to date.

It has also ramped up assaults against critical infrastructure organizations in recent weeks, having claimed responsibility for attacks on Prudential Financial, LoanDepot, Trans-Northern Pipelines, and UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Optum.

The development has prompted the U.S. government to announce financial rewards of up to $15 million for information leading to the identification of key members as well as affiliates of the e-crime group.

BlackCat's ransomware spree coincides with the return of LockBit after similar disruption efforts led by the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) last week. Zscaler ThreatLabz said the ransomware gang has updated its encryptor's ransom notes with TOR URLs pointing to the new infrastructure.

According to a report from SC Magazine, the threat actors breached Optum's network by leveraging the recently disclosed critical security flaws in ConnectWise's ScreenConnect remote desktop and access software.

BlackCat, however, has refuted that it used ConnectWise flaws in its attack against Optum. "For all those cyber intelligence so called expert dumbasses we did not use ConnectWise exploit as our initial access so you should base your reports you tell people on actual facts not kiddi speculations," it claimed.

The flaws, which allow for remote code execution on susceptible systems, have been weaponized by the Black Basta and Bl00dy ransomware gangs as well as by other threat actors to deliver Cobalt Strike Beacons, XWorm, and remote management tools like Atera, Syncro, and even another ScreenConnect client.

The mass exploitation of the two vulnerabilities has also been complemented by adversaries exploiting ScreenConnect and deploying a new Windows variant of KrustyLoader, which was previously spotted as part of a campaign targeting critical vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure appliances.

Attack surface management firm Censys said, as of February 27, 2024, it observed no less than 3,400 exposed potentially vulnerable ScreenConnect hosts online, with a majority of them located in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, Germany, France, India, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Ireland.

"It's clear that remote access software like ScreenConnect continues to be a prime target for threat actors," Censys security researcher Himaja Motheram said.

The findings come as ransomware groups like RansomHouse, Rhysida, and a Phobos variant called Backmydata have continued to compromise various organizations in the U.S., U.K., Europe, and the Middle East. 

In a sign that these cybercrime groups are shifting to more nuanced and sophisticated tactics, RansomHouse has been found utilizing a custom tool dubbed MrAgent to deploy the file-encrypting malware at scale.

"MrAgent is a binary designed to run on [VMware ESXi] hypervisors, with the sole purpose of automating and tracking the deployment of ransomware across large environments with a high number of hypervisor systems," Trellix said. Details of MrAgent first came to light in September 2023.

Another significant tactic adopted by some ransomware groups is the sale of direct network access as a new monetization method via their own blogs, on Telegram channels, or data leak websites, KELA said.

It also follows the public release of a Linux-specific, C-based ransomware threat known as Kryptina, which surfaced in December 2023 on underground forums and has since been made available for free on BreachForums by its creator.

"The release of the RaaS source code, complete with extensive documentation, could have significant implications for the spread and impact of ransomware attacks against Linux systems," SentinelOne researcher Jim Walter said.

"It is likely to increase the ransomware builder's attractiveness and usability, drawing in yet more low-skilled participants to the cybercrime ecosystem. There is also significant risk that it will lead to the development of multiple spin-offs and an increase in attacks."

(The story was updated after publication to include additional information about the exploitation of ConnectWise ScreenConnect flaws.)

Nine out of 10 beds in state psychiatric hospitals are occupied by people sent there by the courts, leaving no space for others in mental health crisis.

"The statistic of 93% of the beds in psychiatric hospitals being occupied, that the average person who has a mental health problem or you have someone in your family, and they've not committed a crime, they can't get in there," Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday. "That's crazy."

DeWine said he wants to fix that as well as help county jails provide mental health services to incarcerated people. The governor said he'll soon appoint a group of experts − judges, sheriffs, mental health professionals − to make specific recommendations.

Courts send people to the state hospitals so they can be restored to mental competency and then able to stand trial − often for minor crimes.

"We know that the court has to be able to put that person somewhere, but our state hospitals probably are not the most appropriate place for most of them to be," DeWine said. "The guy who stole a piece of pizza, he's occupying space that someone, who if we could get them in there in a reasonable period of time, you might totally save their life and turn their life around."

Since the 1950s, Ohio and other states closed mental health hospitals and promised to treat those patients in local facilities.

"We said we were going to stop warehousing people, deinstitutionalize most of them, and then at the same time build up a local, county-by-county system," DeWine said. "We didn't do it."

Ohio closed two state hospitals, Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare in Dayton and Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare in Cambridge in 2008 to help balance the state budget. Six state hospitals remain open.

DeWine pointed out that it's not just an Ohio problem.

Nationwide, states closed 62 psychiatric hospitals between 1997 and 2015 and since the 1950s, there has been a 91% decrease in state beds, according to the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors.

In 2019, following the mass shooting in Dayton, DeWine called for a change in how Ohio uses its state psychiatric beds.

One in three inmates in Ohio have a mental illness, forcing jails to act as the de facto treatment centers, according to the Stepping Up Initiative, which seeks to divert people with serious mental illnesses from lockups.

"More people with mental illnesses are sitting, untreated, in local jails than ever before," the group said. "Across the nation and in Ohio, jails have become revolving doors for people with mental illnesses."

Evelyn Stratton, a former Ohio Supreme Court justice who leads Stepping Up, said the state lacks places to take people experiencing mental health crises so they often end up in jails.

Jails need to provide medication assisted treatment for those suffering from opiate withdrawals, psychotropic drugs and therapy for people and train guards in crisis intervention techniques, she said.

Stratton said jails need to link people to services, such as Medicaid, before they are released and communities need to build out more supportive housing so people have stable places to live.

She agrees with the governor that existing state hospital beds need to be more available. Her answer is to shift to outpatient treatment for many of the people being restored to competency before standing trial.

Roughly 300,000 people are booked into Ohio's 89 full-service jails each year and the state prison system holds about 45,000 people. Most of them qualify for health care via Medicaid, a state and federally funded program.

But federal rules block Medicaid coverage for inmates. Ohio prisons and jails have focused on making sure Medicaid coverage is re-started as soon as people leave incarceration.

Some states have applied for a special waiver from the federal government to have Medicaid cover medical costs for inmates close to release. The waiver would mean the federal government would pay about 60% of the tab for some inmates' medical costs.

When asked why Ohio Medicaid hasn't applied for that waiver, DeWine said: "I will look at that."
