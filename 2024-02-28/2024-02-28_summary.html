ARLINGTON - Four live Texas Rangers spring training games will be aired on TXA 21, as part of a partnership announced Wednesday between the team and the network.

"I'm thrilled to announce that CBS Texas will be the only local broadcaster for four of the Texas Rangers' spring training games," said Raquel Amparo, the president and general manager of CBS Texas. "We are dedicated to bringing our viewers early access to their favorite team, and we look forward to capturing every moment of the excitement as the Rangers gear up for the season ahead."  

CBS Texas' Bill Jones will serve as the on-field reporter for all four games.    

The games will be broadcast by a mix of Dave Raymond, Jared Sandler, David Murphy, and Dave Valle.  

"We are thrilled to partner with TXA 21 to bring Texas Rangers baseball into millions of households in the metroplex and surrounding areas," said Rangers Chief Revenue Officer Jim Cochrane. "Giving Rangers fans the opportunity to watch their team play when they can't do it in person remains a top priority for our organization." 

The following games are included in the agreement:

The Rangers and CBS Texas / TXA 21 have partnered on several initiatives over the years, including Weather Day, Fan Fest, Winter Caravan and a variety of Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation and community events. TXA previously carried Rangers spring training games from 2010-20.

Birthrate continues to fall as young people increasingly reluctant to have children due to bleak job prospects, cost of living and work culture

The number of babies born in Japan last year fell for an eighth straight year to a new low, government data has shown, and a top official says it is critical for the country to reverse the trend in the coming half-dozen years.

The 758,631 babies born in Japan in 2023 were a 5.1% decline from the previous year, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry on Tuesday. It was the lowest number of births since Japan started compiling the statistics in 1899.

The number of marriages fell by 5.9% to 489,281 couples, falling below a half million for the first time in 90 years – one of the key reasons for the declining births. Out-of-wedlock births are rare in Japan because of family values based on a paternalistic tradition.

Surveys show that many younger Japanese balk at marrying or having families, discouraged by bleak job prospects, the high cost of living that rises at a faster pace than salaries and corporate cultures that are not compatible with having both parents work. Crying babies and children playing outside are increasingly considered a nuisance, and many young parents say they often feel isolated.

Chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters Tuesday that the ongoing declining birthrate is at a “critical state.”

“The period over the next six years or so until 2030s, when the younger population will start declining rapidly, will be the last chance we may be able to reverse the trend,” he said. “There is no time to waste.”

Prime minister Fumio Kishida has called the low births “the biggest crisis Japan faces,” and put forward a package of measures that have included more support and subsidies mostly for childbirth, children and their families.

But experts say they doubt whether the government’s efforts will be effective because so far they have largely focused on people who already are married or already are planning to have children, while not adequately addressing a growing population of young people who are reluctant to go that far.

The number of births has been falling since 50 years ago, when it peaked at about 2.1 million. The decline to an annual number below 760,000 has happened faster than earlier projections predicting that would happen by 2035.

Japan’s population of more than 125 million is projected to fall by about 30% to 87 million by 2070, with four out of every 10 people at age 65 or older. A shrinking and ageing population has big implications for the economy and for national security as the country seeks to fortify its military to counter China’s increasingly assertive territorial ambitions.

Lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried, the former head of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, have requested a sentence of just five to six years in prison in the wake of his conviction last year on seven counts of fraud.

U.S. probation officials have recommended a sentence of 100 years for Bankman-Fried's role in orchestrating what prosecutors described as an elaborate, multibillion-dollar fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced March 28. 

In a 98-page memo filed Tuesday, Bankman-Fried's lawyers portray him as suffering from an array of neurological and personality issues that could not be overcome, turning him into a "tragic" figure.

"Sam presents at times as a paradox," the lawyers write. "Not because he is deliberately deceiving or conniving, but rather because that is how he is 'wired' as a human. He has an exceptional IQ, but difficulty with conventional styles of communication, especially around emotion."

They add that those who know Bankman-Fried know he is "selfless, altruistic, and cares about those less fortunate."

"Well before ... FTX ever existed, Sam committed his life to philanthropy, pledging to earn money and give it away, with the goal of 'helping the world’s poorest people,'" the lawyers write, citing another statement made by a Bankman-Fried character witness.

Bankman-Fried was not motivated by greed or material concerns, the lawyers write — a notion seemingly belied by the lavish style he and his colleagues enjoyed in the Bahamas while they ran FTX, which included living in a $35 million penthouse.

The lawyers further allege that the loss to FTX customers was ultimately zero — and indeed, representatives for the bankruptcy estate of FTX said this month that they expect to fully repay customers and creditors with legitimate claims.

Bankman-Fried is being held at a detention facility in New York City. Citing the statement of a fellow inmate, the lawyers say Bankman-Fried's neurodiversity and lack of physical stature, along with the high-profile nature of his crimes, may put him at risk of physical harm in prison.

"Sam being the 'least physically intimidating person' … has and will lead to him being frequently targeted for hazing, harassment, and assault more so than the average inmate," the lawyers write.

Prosecutors have until March 15 to respond to the memo.

Jamie Dimon applauded Texas for its business-friendly policies and said other areas including New York City should do more to attract investment. 

The chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co. praised Texas’s lack of an income tax and its light regulatory touch, which have prompted companies to relocate or expand in the state. JPMorgan’s workforce in Texas has surpassed 30,000 in recent years while New York’s total has slipped to less than 29,000 from 35,000.

Heritage Foundation director of the tech policy center Kara Frederick discusses Google's plan to relaunch its AI image generator tool on 'Varney & Co.'

Google is working to fix its Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) tool, CEO Sundar Pichai told employees on Tuesday, calling the images generated by the model "biased" and "completely unacceptable." 

The Alphabet-owned company paused Gemini's image generation feature last week after users on social media flagged that Gemini was creating inaccurate historical images that sometimes replaced White people with images of Black, Native American and Asian people. 

In a note to employees, Pichai said the tool's responses were offensive to users and had shown bias.

"Our teams have been working around the clock to address these issues. We're already seeing a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts ... And we'll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale," he said.

The company now plans to relaunch Gemini AI in the next few weeks. News website Semafor first reported the news, which was later confirmed by a Google spokesperson.

Google has issued several apologies for Gemini after critics slammed the AI for creating "woke" content. 

Prabhakar Raghavan, senior vice president of Google's Knowledge & Information, said Friday that the AI tool "missed the mark" in a blog post explaining what went wrong.

While explaining "what happened," Raghavan said Gemini was built to avoid "creating violent or sexually explicit images, or depictions of real people" and that various prompts should provide a "range of people" versus images of "one type of ethnicity."

"However, if you prompt Gemini for images of a specific type of person — such as ‘a Black teacher in a classroom,’ or ‘a white veterinarian with a dog’ — or people in particular cultural or historical contexts, you should absolutely get a response that accurately reflects what you ask for," Raghavan wrote. "So what went wrong? In short, two things. First, our tuning to ensure that Gemini showed a range of people failed to account for cases that should clearly not show a range. And second, over time, the model became way more cautious than we intended and refused to answer certain prompts entirely — wrongly interpreting some very anodyne prompts as sensitive."

"These two things led the model to overcompensate in some cases, and be over-conservative in others, leading to images that were embarrassing and wrong," he continued. "This wasn’t what we intended. We did not want Gemini to refuse to create images of any particular group. And we did not want it to create inaccurate historical — or any other — images."

Raghavan said Gemini's image generation feature will go through "extensive testing" before it is back online. 

Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, Google has been racing to produce AI software rivaling what the Microsoft-backed company had introduced.

When Google released its generative AI chatbot Bard a year ago, the company shared inaccurate information about pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system in a promotional video, causing shares to slide as much as 9%.

Bard was rebranded as Gemini earlier this month and Google has introduced three versions of the product at different subscription tiers: Gemini Ultra, the largest and most capable of highly complex tasks; Gemini Pro, best for scaling across a wide range of tasks; and Gemini Nano, the most efficient for on-device tasks.

Police are investigating after employees at a Dairy Queen in Kentucky say they were forced to eat ice cream contaminated with cleaning solution, local outlet WKYT reported.

Angela Patton told the outlet her 17-year-old daughter was among the employees involved in the incident at the Dairy Queen, located in Campton, Kentucky.

"They were told by the manager that whether or not they liked chocolate ice cream, they were going to taste it today," Patton told WKYT.

Patton told the outlet many of the about eight employees involved in the incident were minors, and their manager had told the group that they hadn't cleaned the ice cream machine properly, so they were served the contaminated ice cream as a punishment.

Several of them, she said, experienced burning sensations while eating the ice cream and sought medical treatment, though Business Insider could not verify her claims.

"The safety of our fans and crew members is our top priority. When we received complaints, we immediately began an investigation, which is ongoing. We are reviewing our processes and covering expenses for crew members involved," franchise owner Steve Caudill said in a statement to Business Insider. "The manager involved is no longer employed at our restaurant. Know that we contacted local law enforcement to assist and we are fully cooperating with their investigation."

Wolfe County Sheriff's Office, the local authorities investigating the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular working hours.

Elijah Banks, a deputy with Wolfe County Sheriff's Office, told WKYT that little could be shared about the ongoing investigation due to the involvement of the juveniles. However, he said Wolfe County officials are in contact with the county attorney to determine the next steps.

No charges have yet been filed.

In New York, a woman was recently denied a retrial after she received a 23-year sentence for poisoning and killing her boss with a medication used for gout.

Incidents of product tampering can also result in felony charges, as in the 2019 case of a mother who allowed her young daughter to lick a tongue depressor at a medical clinic and then put it back, resulting in a felony charge that was later reduced to a misdemeanor. The woman was inspired to record a video of the incident due to an online trend of licking consumer products and putting them back for unsuspecting buyers to take home.

The trend has been around for nearly a decade. It has grown exponentially since 2015 when Ariana Grande was famously caught on camera licking a doughnut that was later sold to an unsuspecting customer — for which she faced intense backlash.

But the filthy habit has also continued into recent years, with a so-called "sushi terrorism" resulting in several arrests after videos went viral of pranksters in Japan licking utensils and soy sauce bottles and rubbing saliva on the conveyer belt.

February 28, 2024 — This story has been updated with a response from the Dairy Queen franchise owner.

The strong interest in Chinese social media of bitcoin prices’ ascent reflects how a community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts on the mainland continues to thrive, despite Beijing’s rigid stance against all crypto-related activities.

Investing in cryptocurrencies has recently become more attractive to some people on the mainland, as the country’s stock market continues to plummet amid its economic woes, according to a Reuters report in January.

Cryptocurrency trading via a number of major exchanges has also remained active in mainland China, as traders employ a range of workarounds to skirt loosely implemented restrictions.

Still, the Chinese government has ramped up its scrutiny of all activities related to cryptocurrencies over the years, citing risks to financial stability.

In research firm Chainalysis’ ranking of cryptocurrency adoption in 20 major countries, mainland China took the No 11 spot last year after placing tenth in 2022.

While mainland China’s ranking in terms of trading volume on centralised crypto exchanges dropped to the No 10 spot last year after placing second in 2022, Chainalysis said the country ranked 13th in peer-to-peer trading volume last year, up from No 144 in 2022.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged on Wednesday to break above $60,000, putting it within striking distance of its all-time high as enthusiasm for the world’s largest cryptocurrency reached a frenzy last seen during a 2021 boom.

The digital asset climbed as high as $63,900, touching its highest intraday point since November 2021, before dropping back to the $60,000 level amid reports that some users of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) began showing a $0 balance in their accounts.

Coinbase first said on its website that "we are aware that some users may see a zero balance across their Coinbase accounts and may experience errors in buying or selling" but that "your assets are safe."

A second update said "we’re beginning to see improvement in customer trading. Due to increased traffic, some customers may still see errors in login, sends, receives and with some payment methods." A third update offered the assurance that "we are starting to see Coinbase.com activity normalizing."

Its CEO Brian Armstrong also tried to calm customers Wednesday. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, he first said that "we are dealing with a LARGE surge of traffic — apologies for any issues you encounter. The team is working to remediate."

Later in the day he said "apps are now recovering" and wrote that the surge in traffic had exceeded what the company had "load tested."

Apps are now recovering.We had modeled a ~10x surge in traffic and load tested it. This exceeded that number.It's expensive to keep services over-provisioned, but we'll need to keep working on auto-scaling solutions, and killing any remaining bottlenecks. Thank you for… https://t.co/JXVppV57AF

Before prices pulled back amid the Coinbase snafu, the rally had been pushing closer to bitcoin's all-time mark of $68,789. That apex came in November 2021, six months before a spectacular crash in 2022.

"Ultimately, what we're seeing is crypto is kind of rising from the ashes of the 2022 market," said Ryan Rasmussen, a senior crypto research analyst for Bitwise Asset Management.

Bitcoin is riding a wave of excitement sparked by a series of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that started trading in January. Those funds gave everyday investors widespread exposure to the digital asset, triggering predictions of a new bull run.

"Our assumption is that the price of bitcoin is going to achieve $125,000 by the end of 2025," Benchmark's Mark Palmer added on Yahoo Finance Live.

Investors are bidding other cryptocurrencies and related stocks higher too. Year to date, the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), has outperformed bitcoin by more than 4% while the total market value for all crypto assets is up roughly 34% to $2.22 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.

One sign of surging enthusiasm for bitcoin is the trading activity in the bitcoin ETFs that launched in January. They have logged more than $6.7 billion in net flows as of Wednesday, according to data collected by London-based fund Farside Investors.

So far this quarter, bitcoin trading volume has surpassed levels seen for the same period in every quarter of 2023.

That activity has been a boon to major crypto trading venues, including Coinbase and Robinhood (HOOD).

But the surge in trading also became a liability for Coinbase Wednesday as some of its users began reporting that their account balances showed $0.

Coinbase's stock dropped in intraday trading as it provided updates about its efforts to resolve the issue and it closed roughly flat for the day.

We are aware that some users may see a zero balance across their Coinbase accounts & may experience errors in buying or selling. Our team is investigating this & will provide an update shortly. Your assets are safe.You can track this incident at https://t.co/a3pl4WiDhZ

— Coinbase Support (@CoinbaseSupport) February 28, 2024

Other bitcoin-related stocks are also riding higher. Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital (MARA) and bitcoin holder MicroStrategy (MSTR) have risen 35% and 40%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. MicroStrategy announced Monday morning that it acquired an additional 3,000 BTC, bringing its total investment to 193,000 BTC, which was valued at over $11.8 billion as of Wednesday.

Derivatives traders are also now piling into the bitcoin rally, according to Cumberland Labs analyst Christopher Newhouse.

There are roughly $25 billion of open contracts in the bitcoin futures market, according to crypto derivatives data provider Coinglass. That’s a new high for outstanding bitcoin futures bets, surpassing a mark last set in April 2021.

"In the options market, the narrative is clear," Newhouse added. "People are bullish."

Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, but that was pushed to the max today as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) jumped as much as 12.6% to over $64,000 for a moment only to plunge to $59,000 an hour later. At 3:30 p.m. ET, the cryptocurrency is trading at around $60,000 and is still up 5% over the past 24 hours.

The entire market followed Bitcoin's move, but Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were two of the more notable movers. Ethereum jumped 7.4% at its peak only to fall back to flat for the day. Dogecoin regained most of its late afternoon pop and is up 13% on the day.

When assets move quickly, it often causes a squeeze on leveraged positions. When a stock or cryptocurrency rises, this is known as a short squeeze where short-sellers are forced to buy to cover losses, fueling the rally further. According to Coinglass, in the last 24 hours, there were $175.5 million in short leverage positions liquidated for Bitcoin and $363 million across crypto, which could have fueled the run-up.

But on the way down the opposite is true. Leverage long positions must be sold, which causes the drop to accelerate. In the past 24 hours, $85.9 million in long Bitcoin positions and $336.4 million in crypto long positions were liquidated.

It didn't help that Coinbase Global had a glitch on its app that caused customers to see a zero balance. That caused some people to be unable to trade during this period of high volatility.

CEO Brian Armstrong said there was an over 10x increase in traffic to the company's apps during this period. That shows just how much trading was likely taking place in a very short period of time.

The move in Ethereum comes about two weeks ahead of the upgrade being called Dencun, which is expected to make the blockchain less expensive and faster. That could increase the utilization of Ethereum as a token for real-world utility.

It has also helped that the rise in Bitcoin following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs has led to speculation that Ethereum ETFs could be next. This is the second-largest cryptocurrency and would make sense as the next crypto ETF given the scale and name recognition.

Dogecoin also has name recognition and as a memecoin that's driven by sentiment on most days, it's not surprising to see the token up big today. But that doesn't mean the move will last because there's no fundamental change in the token from just a day ago.

The one thing that is certain is that crypto will be volatile in the future. What's less clear is where prices are headed.

The crypto industry is driven largely by sentiment and over the last few months the sentiment has been strong for both crypto and growth stocks, which are usually correlated with crypto values.

If momentum continues, values could easily go higher. But keep in mind that the momentum could turn quickly if the market goes south.

BREAKING: Dow Futures Fall As Snowflake Tumbles









Cryptocurrency News: Crypto prices and related stocks continued to rally Wednesday as bitcoin scrambled above $59,000. Coinbase stock climbed beyond its buy range after Monday's breakout.

Coinbase and converted bitcoin ETFs Grayscale Bitcoin Trust(GBTC) and Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) are now trading above their pre-Jan. 11 highs. DEFI broke out past a buy point on Tuesday.

Jan. 11 was a historic day for the crypto industry after the SEC approved 11 bitcoin ETF applications late Jan. 10, which included issuers ARK Invest (ARKK), BlackRock (BLK), Grayscale, VanEck and more. Coinbase is serving as the custodian for a majority of the new ETF issuers. How are crypto custodians keeping digital assets secure?

Other trends are set to drive bitcoin in 2024, including the upcoming halving event in April and influx of institutional participation.

Bitcoin held above $59,000 early Tuesday, after reaching as high as $59,496. The gains move the cryptocurrency further against its highest trading levels since November 2021. Bitcoin is now about 16% below its record high, set in early November 2021.

Bitcoin had spiked to $49,000 January 11 on the ETF launch day but then fell back into its early December 2023 level prior to the SEC announcement. The world's largest cryptocurrency rebounded about 157% in 2023. Bitcoin is up more than 40% so far this year, with most of the gains compounded in February.

Ethereum touched a new 52-week high of $3,368, before easing slightly. It is trading at its best level since April 2022. The No. 2 crypto leapt roughly 92% in 2023. Ethereum jumped 45% so far in 2024.

Digital asset investments are extremely volatile. While cryptocurrency's fundamentals and technical indicators may differ, investors should focus on the same key objectives. First, stay protected by learning when it's time to sell, cut losses or capture profits. Second, prepare to profit if the cryptocurrency starts to rebound.

Despite their original promise, cryptocurrencies haven't acted as hedges against inflation. Instead, they've trended with the broader indexes. Read The Big Picture and Market Pulse to track daily market trends.

Eric Poliner believes in digital currency as an alternative to cash and is banking on others feeling the same, too.

“We’re still waiting for that random customer to walk in and say, ‘Do you take bitcoin?’ I’m doing what I can to see that happen,” said Poliner, whose team of technology specialists helped to set up a groundbreaking move in the world of digital currency at Chadd’s Bistro in Shelby Township.

The establishment was a takeout business but this month owner Chad Elliot opened a restaurant down the street that not only features his popular selection of original sandwiches but offers patrons a menu of ways for cashing out.

Credit card, cash, Bitcoin and even gold backs are accepted by the cashiers who have no problem navigating the program Poliner’s MI Lightning Rod team including himself, Brendan Brown and Sagar Shah created for Elliot.

“This is what a bill would look like,” said Poliner demonstrating a typical transaction at Chadd’s Bistro.

The bill for a bitcoin-paying customer has a QR code that the customer scans. Then their personal crypto wallet reads the virtual address where it should send the payment. This address is usually a one-time destination code.

Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and enthusiasts feel the more people become familiar with it, the more businesses will start accepting it.

“We are excited to embrace the future of finance and cater to the growing community of cryptocurrency users,” said Elliot. “By accepting bitcoin, lightning and other cryptocurrencies, Chadd’s Bistro aims to become a hub for Michigan’s vibrant community of bitcoin enthusiasts.“

Elliot who supports voluntaryist principles that stem from the idea of natural rights, equality, non-coercion, and non-aggression said he wishes more people would trade their bitcoins rather than just sitting on it.

“Convincing people to spend it is a big part of what we’re hoping to see happen,” he said.

How can you become a bitcoin user?

Chadd’s Bistro is not only a gathering place for individuals and families looking to eat but once a month hosts a happy hour for bitcoin enthusiasts looking to exchange ideas, questions or currency for food. Poliner said there are a handful of people across the state developing their own crypto/bitcoin projects independently.

“We loosely connect to share progress, use each other’s products, and exchange ideas,” Poliner said.

Their next meeting at the bistro is March 5 at 4 p.m.

Need to find a bitcoin ATM before the meeting or lunch? There are about 807 bitcoin ATMs in 34 states and 559 cities including more than a few in Michigan. In fact you cannot see the state’s outline on a map of bitcoin ATMs as the orange tacks show locations from Taylor and White Lake to Roseville, Detroit and Warren.

“I don’t use it but I think it’s good to have that option for customers who do,” said Carol Profit of Troy.

Other customers agreed the more options the better including Brandon Thomas of Shelby Township, who was joined by his wife Janice, although she insists on the old adage, “cash is king.”

As for their son Brice? By the time he’s old enough to pay the bill chances are bitcoin will be one of many digital currencies that he will use. For now the 11-year-old was just happy his dad was treating him to a platter of barbecued pork and coleslaw sliders.

“They’re really good,” said Brice.

The University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health recently expanded its Oregon Child Absenteeism Due to Respiratory Disease Study, using air sampling and complementary methods to track the prevalence of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in the Oregon, Wisconsin School District.

ORCHARDS research program manager Shari Barlow said the opportunity to test air sampling arose from connections to the Oregon School District. UW professor in the department of pathology and laboratory science Shelby O’Connor introduced the use of air sampling to test its effectiveness by comparing its results to an additional three methods, which included 

, school absences and PCR tests.

The air samplers were placed in communal gathering spaces — like cafeterias — where they picked up microscopic viruses and viral particles by taking up air through passive diffusion into the machine, forcing the air through a solution that helps particles stick to the sampler cartridge.

These cartridges were collected and replaced twice a week to be analyzed via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions to detect the presence of viral genetic material.

Viruses replicate using RNA, which hold genetic instructions for building the proteins that make up the physical virus. RT-PCR creates small, complementary strands of DNA called primers that can attach to the viral RNA. The RNA are placed in a thermocycler, which creates an alternating environment of warm and hot cycles that prompt the replication activity of DNA-building proteins called DNA polymerases. This process generates the binding of complementary viral RNA strands to be replicated again and again to produce a significant amount of viral DNA.

Large quantities of DNA make the viral DNA detectable to scientific instruments, so scientists can determine if viral DNA is present, indicating a positive result. The sites chosen for complementary primers have a very low chance of mutating when the virus does, so the process does not decrease in accuracy as the virus evolves, according to O’Connor.

Air sampling not only proved to be an effective method at determining the presence of viruses when compared with the other three methods, but also held a few advantages over them.

“The first [advantage] is that there is one sampler per school and antigen-testing every two days, so cost-wise, it’s a lot less…you can get a lot more information about a lot more people for a lot less money,” O’Connor said.

O’Connor said the lower cost means if schools have to use one method to monitor viruses, air sampling could be viable. Testing students also requires getting consent from students and parents, whereas the air samplers are a non-invasive measure. Antigen tests were performed on consenting students in their schools, where PCR tests were only administered to children who had opted-in to testing at home when they got sick.

But the air sampler also had some drawbacks compared to the other methods. Barlow said the air sampling was not specific to an individual, showing only that someone in the area was sick.

Because of this limitation, Barlow said air sampling could instead be used to determine when to implement transmission-mitigation measures, like masking and social distancing.

“[Another] challenge of the air sampler is that the results are delayed,” O’Connor said. “With a rapid antigen test you get your negative or positive [result]. Unfortunately with the air sampler we have to gather and get our results, which can take about a week.”

Testing samples takes large amounts of time due to the preparation needed for drawing up multiple solutions and running them through a thermocycler that oscillates between four different temperatures for a number of cycles. O’Connor said researchers are working to reduce the time-lag of air sampler testing and collecting so they can be used in other locations where more instantaneous feedback is needed.

A new method that reduces the amount of prep work for the samples so they can immediately be placed in the cycler would cut down on the time for processing, especially when paired with a cycler able to produce the testing sample in only thirty minutes.

Another downside of air sampling is the viral load — how much virus was in the air — is not discernible due to how the tests for the viruses afterwards are conducted. This is an issue for COVID-19 specifically, because people infected with the virus often shed viral particles long after they stop being contagious.

According to O’Connor, the amount of particles were not detectable by antigen tests, but the sensitive PCR tests administered to the air samples would detect the virus. This reasoning might also explain why there were no detections by rapid antigen testing after winter break in the study, but the air samplers continued to detect COVID-19.

Overall, the study found air sampling to be correlated with other methods of detection, which could help it towards a wider implementation for disease monitoring. According to Barlow, air sampling is already being used in clinics and long-term care facilities around Madison.

O’Connor believes it could be useful in monitoring where viruses are coming from and where they are being spread. But until there is a renewed interest in public health, it is unlikely to see more widespread use.

					Not having a tail is one way apes differ from monkeys				

A new study suggests that apes, including chimpanzees and humans, lack tails because a genetic parasite altered a gene important for tail development when the group diverged from other primates around 25 million years ago.

14 hours ago

A genetic parasite may have robbed humans and other apes of their tails.

Around 25 million years ago, this parasite, a small stretch of repetitive DNA called an Alu element, ended up in a gene important for tail development, researchers report in the Feb. 29 Nature. The single insertion altered the gene Tbxt in a way that seems to have sparked one of the defining differences between monkeys and apes: Monkeys have tails, apes don’t.

“It was like lightning struck once,” says Jef Boeke, a geneticist at New York University Langone Health, and ape behinds ultimately became bare.

The genetic tweak may also give insight into why some babies are born with spinal cord defects such as spina bifida, when the tube that holds the cord doesn’t close all the way (SN: 12/6/16). 

Alu elements are part of a group of genetic parasites known as transposons or jumping genes that can hop across genetic instruction books, inserting themselves into their hosts’ DNA (SN: 5/16/17). Sometimes, when the gene slips itself into a piece of DNA that is passed down to offspring, these insertions become permanent parts of our genetic code.  

Transposons, including more than 1 million Alu elements, are found throughout our genome, says geneticist and systems biologist Bo Xia of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Researchers once thought of transposons as genetic garbage, but some have central roles in evolution. Without transposons, the placenta, immune system and insulation around nerve fibers may not exist (SN: 2/16/24).

And humans might still have tails.

To find out how apes lost their tails, Xia, then at NYU Langone Health, Boeke and colleagues analyzed 140 genes involved in vertebrate tail development. The team found that in monkeys, including baboons and rhesus macaques, the Tbxt gene was missing a chunk of DNA that’s found in humans, chimpanzees and other apes. It was a “eureka moment,” Boeke says. The insertion may have appeared around the time apes diverged from African and Asian monkeys, around 25 million years ago.

But the missing chunk was in a part of the gene called an intron, a bit of genetic material that isn’t made into proteins. “So why would that even matter?” he asks. A close look at the gene’s structure provided a plausible explanation: The missing bit tweaked Tbxt so that the gene makes a different form of the protein in apes than in monkeys.

Experiments in mice seemed to confirm the hypothesis. Mice, like monkeys, make normal versions of the Tbxt protein and have full-length tails. But when genetically engineered to make shortened versions of the Tbxt protein like apes do, the mice had shorter tails or none at all. Some mice also had spinal cord defects similar to spinal bifida, suggesting that there may be drawbacks to tail loss.

Other genes may also be involved in tail loss. Many more Alu elements are scattered among human introns that could have yet-to-be-known effects on other aspects of human evolution, Boeke and Xia say.

The new findings do begin to unravel how apes lost their tails, says Gabrielle Russo, a biological anthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York. But why it happened, she says, is a much harder question to answer. Research from the early 1900s linked tail loss to muscle changes that helped human bodies move upright, but shifts in posture, as well as learning to walk on two feet, didn’t happen until millions of years later (SN: 9/15/21; SN: 4/14/21). So, it’s unlikely the new findings will shed light on these human traits, Russo says.

A natural next step, Russo says, is exploring whether the genetic underpinnings of tail loss in apes also happened in other mammals with shortened tails or none at all such as koalas, capybaras and bears.

					Generative AI is not very skillful at applying what it learns to new situations				

Contributing Correspondent

18 hours ago

As impressive as they seem, the latest computer brains usually fail at tasks that require generalizing concepts — tasks that come easily to humans.

DrAfter123/GETTY IMAGES

Apart from the northward advance of killer bees in the 1980s, nothing has struck as much fear into the hearts of headline writers as the ascent of artificial intelligence.

Ever since the computer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, humans have faced the prospect that their supremacy over machines is merely temporary. Back then, though, it was easy to show that AI failed miserably in many realms of human expertise, from diagnosing disease to transcribing speech.

But then about a decade ago or so, computer brains — known as neural networks — received an IQ boost from a new approach called deep learning. Suddenly computers approached human ability at identifying images, reading signs and enhancing photographs — not to mention converting speech to text as well as most typists.

Those abilities had their limits. For one thing, even apparently successful deep learning neural networks were easy to trick. A few small stickers strategically placed on a stop sign made an AI computer think the sign said “Speed Limit 80,” for example. And those smart computers needed to be extensively trained on a task by viewing numerous examples of what they should be looking for. So deep learning produced excellent results for narrowly focused jobs but couldn’t adapt that expertise very well to other arenas. You would not (or shouldn’t) have hired it to write a magazine column for you, for instance.

But AI’s latest incarnations have begun to threaten job security not only for writers but also a lot of other professionals.

“Now we’re in a new era of AI,” says computer scientist Melanie Mitchell, an artificial intelligence expert at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. “We’re beyond the deep learning revolution of the 2010s, and we’re now in the era of generative AI of the 2020s.”

Generative AI systems can produce things that had long seemed safely within the province of human creative ability. AI systems can now answer questions with seemingly human linguistic skill and knowledge, write poems and articles and legal briefs, produce publication quality artwork, and even create videos on demand of all sorts of things you might want to describe.

Many of these abilities stem from the development of large language models, abbreviated as LLMs, such as ChatGPT and other similar models. They are large because they are trained on huge amounts of data — essentially, everything on the internet, including digitized copies of countless printed books. Large can also refer to the large number of different kinds of things they can “learn” in their reading — not just words but also word stems, phrases, symbols and mathematical equations.

By identifying patterns in how such linguistic molecules are combined, LLMs can predict in what order words should be assembled to compose sentences or respond to a query. Basically, an LLM calculates probabilities of what word should follow another, something critics have derided as “autocorrect on steroids.”

Even so, LLMs have displayed remarkable abilities — such as composing texts in the style of any given author, solving riddles and deciphering from context whether “bill” refers to an invoice, proposed legislation or a duck.

“These things seem really smart,” Mitchell said this month in Denver at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

LLMs’ arrival has induced a techworld version of mass hysteria among some experts in the field who are concerned that run amok, LLMs could raise human unemployment, destroy civilization and put magazine columnists out of business. Yet other experts argue that such fears are overblown, at least for now.

At the heart of the debate is whether LLMs actually understand what they are saying and doing, rather than just seeming to. Some researchers have suggested that LLMs do understand, can reason like people (big deal) or even attain a form of consciousness. But Mitchell and others insist that LLMs do not (yet) really understand the world (at least not in any sort of sense that corresponds to human understanding).

“What’s really remarkable about people, I think, is that we can abstract our concepts to new situations via analogy and metaphor.”

In a new paper posted online at arXiv.org, Mitchell and coauthor Martha Lewis of the University of Bristol in England show that LLMs still do not match humans in the ability to adapt a skill to new circumstances. Consider this letter-string problem: You start with abcd and the next string is abce. If you start with ijkl, what string should come next?

Humans almost always say the second string should end with m. And so do LLMs. They have, after all, been well trained on the English alphabet.

But suppose you pose the problem with a different “counterfactual” alphabet, perhaps the same letters in a different order, such as a u c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t b v w x y z. Or use symbols instead of letters. Humans are still very good at solving letter-string problems. But LLMs usually fail. They are not able to generalize the concepts used on an alphabet they know to another alphabet.

“While humans exhibit high performance on both the original and counterfactual problems, the performance of all GPT models we tested degrades on the counterfactual versions,” Mitchell and Lewis report in their paper.

Other similar tasks also show that LLMs do not possess the ability to perform accurately in situations not encountered in their training. And therefore, Mitchell insists, they do not exhibit what humans would regard as “understanding” of the world.

“Being reliable and doing the right thing in a new situation is, in my mind, the core of what understanding actually means,” Mitchell said at the AAAS meeting.

Human understanding, she says, is based on “concepts” — basically mental models of things like categories, situations and events. Concepts allow people to infer cause and effect and to predict the probable results of different actions — even in circumstances not previously encountered.

“What’s really remarkable about people, I think, is that we can abstract our concepts to new situations via analogy and metaphor,” Mitchell said.

She does not deny that AI might someday reach a similar level of intelligent understanding. But machine understanding may turn out to be different from human understanding. Nobody knows what sort of technology might achieve that understanding and what the nature of such understanding might be.

If it does turn out to be anything like human understanding, it will probably not be based on LLMs.

After all, LLMs learn in the opposite direction from humans. LLMs start out learning language and attempt to abstract concepts. Human babies learn concepts first, and only later acquire the language to describe them.

So LLMs are doing it backward. In other words, perhaps reading the internet might not be the correct strategy for acquiring intelligence, artificial or otherwise.

CHARLESTON COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - It’s been about six months since a new medical provider took over healthcare operations at the Al Canon Detention Center in Charleston County.

On Wednesday, VitalCore representatives attended a Criminal Justice Coordinating Council meeting, introduced themselves and answered questions from community advocates in the audience.

In July 2023, VitalCore Health Strategies replaced Wellpath, the company U.S. Justice Department was investigating after several inmates died at the jail. 

VitalCore introduced a behavioral health clinic a few weeks into its operations, highlighting it as something the jail and inmates did not have before that provides onsite mental health services. Right now, the behavioral health unit has four employees who all see patients.

Vice President of Behavioral Health at VitalCore Jeff Brewer talked about what the transition process has been like as well as what services VitalCore has to offer.

“Then we took over behavior health because we didn’t have behavior health there, at all. So we started fresh with that group of individuals, so that they’re all new, and we had to seek them out through the community,” Brewer said. 

Vital Core representatives explained their other health services including on-site dental, dialysis, 24-hour providers and nurses, lab, a pharmacist and MAT addiction treatment.

“We try and keep as much of the staff as we can, because starting fresh, bringing a whole bunch of people into the corrections environment that haven’t worked there before can be kind of chaotic. So we try and keep as many people as we can, and not do something with turnover,” Brewer said.

People at Wednesday’s meeting who heard the presentation had questions for the provider. Criminal Justice Coordinating Council Director Ellen Steinberg said VitalCore reached out to them about giving a presentation.

“A lot of people were really eager to meet them and hear from them. I felt like everybody had their questions answered. We did not see them try to dodge any questions,” Steinberg said.

Questions included how to iron out access to MAT drug methadone in addition to suboxone or buprenorphine. Right now, people are able to continue their addiction-weaning treatment with the other two drugs but don’t have access to methadone within the jail yet if that’s their brand.

Another question came from a stakeholder who works with juvenile court. They noticed that youth offenders were still being given papers to leave the nearby detention center to get treatment.

“So one of the questions was regarding our services to the juvenile offenders. And I was a little shocked when I heard that we weren’t servicing those individuals because I believe that we are. So I just didn’t want to talk with some people and make sure that there’s not any loopholes with that process and that we’re able to give the juveniles the best care we can,” Brewer said.

Steinberg said it’s a good sign that the representatives were willing to answer their questions.

“At this point, I’m looking forward to the future partnership. Again, the fact that they reached out to us and wanted to speak to us and introduce themselves. That’s a game changer,” she said.

Since VitalCore took the healthcare at the jail, there has been one death at the Al Cannon Detention Center.

The coroner ruled the cause of death an overdose and a report states the inmate was not responsive but healthcare workers were not called before they had died in custody.

The Charleston County Sheriff’s Office provided the following statement regarding the transition to VitalCore at the jail:

We have been very pleased with Vital Core’s service and constant communication within the Sheriff Al Canon Detention Center since taking over last year. We look forward to continuing to grow this relationship.

EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) - Gov. Tony Evers partially signed Senate Bill 1015 today, securing $15 million in crisis response resources to support healthcare access in western Wisconsin in the wake of HSHS and Prevea Health’s decision to close several locations.

We are pleased with the actions taken by Gov. Evers today to put $15 million toward hospital services in the Chippewa Valley. We also thank Sen. Jesse James, Rep. Rob Summerfield and other local legislators for their leadership on this legislation and getting it signed into law.

While there are many issues and challenges that face health care in the region with more work to do, this is an appropriate first step.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A hack of one of the country’s largest healthcare technology companies is causing headaches and delays for local veterans trying to fill their prescriptions.

Currently, pharmacies have to manually process prescriptions while the company works to get its systems back online.

Last week, a cyber attack against Change Healthcare, one of the country’s largest healthcare technology companies, forced the payment processor to shut down its systems.

One of the biggest healthcare providers impacted by the attack is Tricare, which covers 9.5 million veterans and other beneficiaries.

Retired US Navy veteran. Jeffery Rutland told Action News Jax since the hack, he’s been hitting one roadblock after another trying to get prescriptions filled for him and his wife.

“It’s not up. It’s not up. Now, today they told me, well, you can go get an appointment to see your doctor, the doctor can give you a new prescription for you to go outside to a Walgreens, CVS. But then Tricare still can’t process,” said Rutland.

According to Naval Hospital Jacksonville, the pharmacy is still processing prescriptions for chronic pain, ADHD medications, and emergency refills for medically necessary medications.

“Each military hospital and clinic will continue to offer pharmacy operations based on their local manning and resources. Please be patient while pharmacies take longer than usual to safely fill prescription needs,” a hospital spokesperson told Action News Jax in an emailed statement.

“The company is saying it should be within a matter of days to get partial capability back,” said US Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL 6th District).

Waltz, a former Green Beret, told Action News Jax veterans can likely expect some delays for weeks as Change Healthcare works to get its systems fully restored.

In addition to the headaches for veterans, Waltz argued the cyber attack has exposed a key vulnerability in terms of national security, as there are only a few companies that provide these payment processing services for prescriptions.

“Yes, we have military strength, but really the strength of the United States of America is our economy. And whether it’s nukes in space that could take out our satellites or cyber attacks that could hit our critical infrastructure, we have to be prepared,” said Waltz.

Waltz said the cyber attack should be a wakeup call for federal lawmakers to start considering whether the number of health care payment processors should be expanded to ensure a future attack won’t have such widespread impacts.

For veterans like Rutland, they’re just hoping things get back to normal as soon as possible.

“Everything is not running the way it’s supposed to be running. And there has been a hack and they’re telling me there has been a hack. Okay, so I can understand that now. So, what can we do to expedite the situation?” said Rutland.

The group known by the names of Blackcat and Alphv says it exfiltrated 6 TB of data in the attack.










The cybercriminal group known by the names of Blackcat and Alphv claimed responsibility Wednesday for the disruptive cyberattack against Change Healthcare.

The Russian-speaking cybercriminal gang said on its darkweb site that it exfiltrated 6 TB of data in the attack against Change Healthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group’s Optum subsidiary.

A spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group said the company is aware of the claims and is looking into them.

The attack has disrupted U.S. pharmacies as well as other health-care facilities and offices.

Reuters had reported Monday that the attack involved the Blackcat ransomware strain.

The report linking Blackcat with the Change Healthcare attack—and now the apparent confirmation by the cybercriminal group—has raised questions about UnitedHealth’s initial attribution of the attack to a nation-state threat actor. The attribution was part of UnitedHealth’s disclosure of the incident to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 21.

The latest statement posted by Change Healthcare Wednesday does not contain any new information from its prior disclosures. “The disruption is expected to last at least through the day,” the statement read, repeating a line that was included in the statements of prior days.

The latest post also reiterated that Change Healthcare is taking “multiple approaches to restore the impacted environment.”

In a statement provided Tuesday to media outlets including CRN, UnitedHealth said it has seen “minimal reports” of patients being unable to access prescriptions.

In part, this is because more than 90 percent of pharmacies in the U.S. are believed to use “modified electronic claim processing to mitigate impacts from the Change Healthcare cyber security issue,” the company said in the statement.

A new collaborative study between Boston Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia finds exposure to neighborhood violence among children was associated with unmet health needs and increased acute care utilization. Published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and based on nationally representative data on violence exposure and gold standard access to care measures from the National Health Interview Survey, this study shows that evidence-based interventions to improve access to care in communities impacted by violence are needed to mitigate long-term physical and mental health consequences for children.

Millions of children in the U.S. are exposed to violence in their homes or communities. Research has shown that children exposed to violence have worse school performance in childhood, increased rates of substance use disorder in adolescence, increased rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder in adulthood, and increased risk of developing chronic medical conditions throughout their lives. Exposure to violence also deepens child health inequities, particularly in marginalized communities disproportionately exposed to violence due to systemic racism across generations.

This study helps examine violence exposure at the population level as both a direct driver of health inequities and as a consequence of fundamental causes like racism, poverty, and other structural risk conditions. The researchers found that, even after controlling for the effects of other important factors like family income and insurance status, children exposed to neighborhood violence face unmet physical and mental health care needs, cost-related barriers, decreased access to prescription drugs, increased urgent care and emergency department utilization, and decreased access to preventive care, mental health care, and medications.

The study also identified an association between exposure to neighborhood violence and mental health symptoms, including increased rates of depression and anxiety, which was consistent with multiple previous studies. Researchers also found that children exposed to violence have higher rates of delayed and forgone mental health care despite experiencing more mental health symptoms. Prior research shows how early access to care can mitigate the mental health consequences of violence exposure; improving access to high-quality, affordable mental health care services remains critical in communities impacted by neighborhood violence.

Researchers call attention to built-in environment reforms like neighborhood greening and cleanup, poverty alleviation interventions like the expanded Child Tax Credit, insurance coverage protections like continuous Medicaid enrollment, and hospital-based violence prevention programs as opportunities to take action.

Our findings highlight the profound impacts of limited access to care in communities affected by violence. We also identify specific opportunities for evidence-based clinician, health system, and policy actions that can reduce the incidence of neighborhood violence and mitigate its health consequences."

Rohan Khazanchi, MD, MPH, lead author, resident in the Harvard Internal Medicine-Pediatrics Residency Program at Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center

"To improve health outcomes for the millions of children in the United States affected by neighborhood violence, we have to invest in their families and communities," said senior author Aditi Vasan, MD, MSHP, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. "Our findings underscore the need for both upstream policy interventions, like the expanded Child Tax Credit, which would provide essential economic support for families in low-income communities impacted by violence, and downstream health system interventions focused on improving access to high-quality, trauma-informed care for these children and their families."

On Tuesday March 12 at 10:30 a.m. in room W224E, Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Deputy National Coordinator Steve Posnack of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT will offer insights into the collaborative nature – and future – of the relationship between CDC and the ONC, and how public health can make better use of information and technology.

In addition to their thoughts on the power of partnership to advance tech innovations in healthcare, Cohen and Posnack will also outline their strategic priorities for the year ahead during the session, ONC & CDC Discuss the Nexus of Health IT and Public Health.

In the session, Digital Health Start-ups: Harnessing Innovation to Disrupt and Improve Care Delivery, scheduled for Tuesday, March 12 at noon in room W224E, Sally Frank, worldwide lead for health and life sciences at Microsoft, will moderate a panel of leaders from successful startups on the need for passion, curiosity and a healthy dose of skepticism when seeking to foster an innovative culture across the digital health ecosystem.

By synthesizing patient journey experiences, stakeholders can drive meaningful and lasting change, while the significance of patient-centric care focused on quality outcomes and accessibility, will require the adoption of innovative approaches to respond to evolving market forces.

And on Tuesday March 12 at 1:30 p.m. in room W224E, longtime health IT pioneer Dr. John Halamka, president of Mayo Clinic Platform, will hold court on a topic he has been deeply curious about in recent years – along with all of us – generative AI. No question the technology is poised to set off a revolution in healthcare and promises transformative value. While the potential benefits are immense, so too are the challenges. Implementing qualitative, clinical and technical guardrails is crucial to navigating this complex landscape effectively.

Halamka's lecture, Keeping the Generative AI Bullet Train on the Tracks, looks at ways to address both advantages and disadvantages of genAI to help healthcare leaders ensure this high-speed innovation train stays on track and leverage innovation to drive positive impacts in patient care and healthcare delivery.

On Wednesday, March 13 at 1 p.m. in room W224E, Angela Shippy, senior physician executive and director at Amazon Web Services, will moderate a panel comprising three healthcare IT leaders who will explore methods to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and achieve clinical, financial and patient-care objectives.

At the session, Reinventing Healthcare Delivery with the Digital Transformation: Optimizing Costs, Experiences, and Outcomes, attendees will gain insights into the implications of the workforce shortfall, leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery, workforce satisfaction and bridging health IT competency gaps to advance the quadruple aim of healthcare.

And on Wednesday, March 13 at 2:30 p.m. in room W224E, Michael Meucci, president and CEO of Arcadia, will emcee a panel discussion exploring payment reform and cost pressures that considers technology and offers strategies for providers to navigate change.

That session, Tech-Driven Healthcare Transformation: Navigating Innovation, Payment Reform and Patient Care, will help attendees will learn about strategies of digital-first competitors and essential capabilities for competing in the evolving healthcare landscape.

Nuvance Health, a hospital system that services Putnam, Dutchess and Connecticut, is joining with Northwell Health, the biggest hospital systems in the New York metro area.

In a news release Wednesday, both nonprofit hospital systems say they decided to join forces to "form a new integrated regional health system" connecting New York and Connecticut.

“This partnership opens a new and exciting chapter for Northwell and Nuvance Health and provides an incredible opportunity to enhance both health systems and take patient care and services to an even higher level,” said Michael Dowling, president and CEO of Northwell Health. “We have similar missions in providing high-quality care for patients in the communities we serve. We look forward to building on the care that Nuvance Health’s 14,000 staff members and providers deliver each and every day.”

The newly combined systems would grow to 14,500 providers and over 1,000 healthcare sites, including 28 hospitals.

Local hospitals within the existing Nuvance Health system like Putnam Hospital in Carmel, Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie and Danbury Hospital in Connecticut will now be affiliated with the Northwell Health system name, Nuvance spokesperson John Nelson said.

Local Northwell Health affiliated hospitals include Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco and Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow.

However, Nuvance Health patients won't see any changes for some time, according to Nuvance Health spokesperson John Nelson.

"We still have to go through the regulatory approval process, which could take about a year or more," Nelson said.

Northwell Health systems said it will make "significant investments" in Nuvance's locations and services to improve the system's quality of care and increase capacity to serve a larger population. Patients of the combined hospital systems will now have access to healthcare in Connecticut, Mid and Lower Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island.

“By joining forces with Northwell Health, we are taking a giant leap forward in our shared mission to enhance the quality, accessibility and equity of the health care we provide to our communities,” said John M. Murphy, MD, president and CEO of Nuvance Health. “This agreement enables us to make significant improvements to health outcomes for community hospitals and to deliver unparalleled care and drive positive change in the health care landscape.”

Northwell and Nuvance said the merger would also help address health disparities throughout the New York metro region, as well as providing new jobs for healthcare workers across the area.

Empower Healthcare Know Your Numbers by Heart Event

Pahokee, Fla. February 28, 2024– On February 3, 2023, the Empower Healthcare clinic in Pahokee, FL, partnered with Healthier Glades, a Palm Health Foundation initiative, for “Know Your Numbers by Heart,” a special event to promote heart health during American Heart Month. Fifty attendees came to the Senior Resource Room in Pahokee for rapid A1C and cholesterol screenings, nutritional counseling, live CPR demonstrations, and education about preventing heart disease. Testing and information were provided by seventeen community partners, including the American Heart Association, Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, and the Diabetes Coalition of Palm Beach County.

According to the 2022 Palm Beach County, Florida Community Health Assessment, heart disease was the leading cause of death in Palm Beach County. What’s more, Black Americans—the majority in Pahokee—are 54% more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than White Americans, due to distinct risk factors like genetics and systemic disparities.

Empower Health, under the leadership of its founder Dr. Jinga Oglesby-Brihm, has been focused on comprehensive and innovative chronic disease management for the rural Glades community since the clinic opened on the campus of First United Methodist Church in 2022. The heart health event is one of many ways she integrates local and county partners to improve patient health education and access to care. “We are grateful for the opportunity to connect with the community to provide free potentially lifesaving screenings and educational sessions,” she said.

Healthier Glades and Palm Health Foundation have invested in Dr. Oglesby-Brihm to support her goal to “break the chains of healthcare disparity.” A Healthier Glades mini-grant provided funding to deliver healthcare services through churches in the Glades, and a Palm Health Foundation scholarship supported her doctoral studies at FAU College of Nursing, her first exposure to the Glades’ healthcare disparities.

Dr. Oglesby-Brihm’s comprehensive, innovative care for the rural Glades community has also captured national recognition. She placed second in the American Heart Association’s 2022 Empowered to Serve Business Accelerator, awarding her training and a grant of $25,000 to help her grow her health clinic.

“Dr. Oglesby-Brihm and Empower Healthcare are building a culture of health in the Glades by building trust,” said Annie Ifill, Healthier Glades project director. “Her love of the people of our region and her approach to delivering health and services through her clinic and out in the community through events like “Know Your Numbers by Heart,” are helping to overcome disparities and lead the way to a better quality of life.”

A dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. When an unvaccinated person is exposed to measles, public health guidance if for them to get vaccinated within three days.

In mid-February, a measles outbreak started at the Manatee Bay Elementary School in Broward County in South Florida. There are now at least nine cases in the county and one additional one in Polk County in Central Florida. 

Several public health researchers say Florida's current response to the outbreak goes against well-established public health guidance. Florida's surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, has so far not urged parents of unvaccinated children at the school with the outbreak to get their children vaccinated, or to quarantine them. In a Feb. 20 letter, Ladapo left it up to parents to decide whether to send their kids to school.

"I'm flummoxed about this," says Dr. Ali Khan, dean of public health at the University of Nebraska. "I've never heard of a surgeon general who didn't at least advocate for best public health practice." 

Khan says flouting science-based guidance is dangerous. "If you're undermining confidence in public health, including vaccination and public health measures, you are putting an increasing number of people at risk of these diseases that we no longer see anymore," he says. 

Measles is a highly infectious disease, says Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "I mean, you can walk by somebody and catch measles if they have it. It's one of the most infectious diseases that we know about." 

And when people who are not vaccinated or don't have prior immunity get exposed to it, up to 9 out of 10 will get measles, according to CDC.

State data shows that around 8% of kindergartners in Broward County are not vaccinated for measles. 

"If you've been vaccinated, if your children are vaccinated, you don't have to worry about it. [The risk] is really for a small proportion of people whose children are not vaccinated," Plescia says, "But 8% is [still] a lot of children, and the risk is that we could see many of those children getting sick." 

Measles has been around for a very long time – it's been studied for well over a century. And there are clear steps to take to contain an outbreak, says Dr. Scott Rivkees, a public health professor at Brown University: "If you have an outbreak, try to get [unvaccinated] people vaccinated within three days of exposure," he says. 

And because people can spread the virus even if they don't have symptoms, he says, people who are not vaccinated that have been exposed need to quarantine for 21 days.

Rivkees is the former surgeon general in Florida. And that's the advice Florida would be getting, if he was still in the role. 

But Rivkees left in 2021 and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis appointed Ladapo to the role. Ladapo was part of a group that pushed unproven COVID treatments before he took the post. And as surgeon general, he refused to wear masks and discouraged people from getting COVID vaccines.

Rivkees is concerned that skepticism over vaccines for COVID may be spreading to another potentially deadly disease.  

"We have seen an incredible attack on vaccines over the past couple of years," he says. "[Now] we're seeing parents who are not getting their children vaccinated, parents who believe that getting the vaccine, for example, will actually cause measles, when it doesn't."

And when it comes to measles, that vaccine reluctance could lead to unnecessary suffering and even risk of death. While measles is rare in the U.S. because of high vaccination rates, it can be serious. 

A mild case of measles can involve getting a rash, diarrhea and dehydration. In some cases, it can turn into pneumonia. In rare cases it can lead to brain swelling, which can cause kids to lose their sight or hearing.

In late 2022, there was an outbreak in Columbus, Ohio, where 85 people got sick from measles – and 40% of them ended up in the hospital. 

It can also be deadly. Before the vaccine, the U.S. was seeing 500 deaths from measles each year. 

Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in the year 2000. There are still cases, but those usually come when people travel to other countries and bring it back. The U.S. should be able to keep that "elimination" status — so long as each measles outbreak gets contained within a year, according to CDC.

So far this year, there have been at least 35 cases in 15 states. Those numbers will likely continue to grow, especially in parts of the country with low vaccination rates. And experts say that, when state and local authorities flout longstanding public health advice, it could lead to more disease in more communities.

"This is a very, very serious disease and it's completely vaccine preventable," says Khan.

Neal dejong, MD, MPH, at the UNC School of Medicine, David Y. Ming, MD, at Duke University School of Medicine and Ryan Coller, MD, at University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, received $5.5 million to study hospital-to-home transitions across settings for children and youth with special healthcare needs.

Neal dejong, MD, MPH, associate professor of pediatrics and member of the UNC Children’s Research Institute at the UNC School of Medicine
Nearly one in five children, almost 14 million in the United States, have a special healthcare need that may require hospitalization. After a child’s hospital stay, the transition back home can be risky, particularly for children with chronic health issues and complex medical conditions. To understand how to best support children and youth with special healthcare needs (CYSHCN), researchers of the CYSHCN National Research Network (CYSHCNet) received $5.5 million for a multi-site study funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to compare two types of hospital-to-home transitional care to optimize outcomes.
The CYSHCNet researchers are led by David Y. Ming, MD, principal investigator, associate professor of pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine; Neal dejong, MD, MPH, associate professor of pediatrics and member of the UNC Children’s Research Institute at the UNC School of Medicine; and Ryan Coller, MD, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.
Over a one-month post-discharge period, researchers will compare the effectiveness of two transitional care approaches — focused dose versus extended dose — reducing return visits to the hospital or emergency department and increasing parent-reported confidence. They will also evaluate the impact of each type of hospital-to-home transitional care on specific CYSHCN patient groups, including those with highly complex clinical needs and those from racial/ethnic minority groups or living in rural areas. Lastly, researchers will investigate how and why each approach to hospital-to-home transitional care is effective and for whom they work best.
The study team includes multiple community partners, including parents and caregivers with lived experience, clinicians, policymakers, and health system leaders. A community advisory board, primarily composed of a diverse group of parents/caregivers of CYSHCN, will work closely with the research team throughout the study. This collaborative effort aims to contribute to the equitable improvement of overall care for all CYSHCN transitioning from hospital to home.
About CYSHCNet: 
CYSHCNet brings academic researchers and lived experience partners together to study the health care system issues that matter most to CYSHCN and their families.

The study team includes multiple community partners, including parents and caregivers with lived experience, clinicians, policymakers, and health system leaders. A community advisory board, primarily composed of a diverse group of parents/caregivers of CYSHCN, will work closely with the research team throughout the study. This collaborative effort aims to contribute to the equitable improvement of overall care for all CYSHCN transitioning from hospital to home.

In comparison to their traditional Medicare counterparts, Medicare Advantage patients are more likely to experience delays in care (22% vs. 13% for original Medicare). The delays in care for MA patients were largely due to the need to get prior approval, or authorization, according to a Commonwealth Fund survey.

MA beneficiaries are also less able to afford care due to copayments or deductibles (12% vs. 7% for original Medicare beneficiaries).  

The survey asked a nationally representative sample of 3,280 Medicare beneficiaries aged 18 and older about the value of their care as measured by access to benefits, services, providers, care coordination and satisfaction.

Among beneficiaries reporting a challenge in getting care, about a third in MA plans (33%) and a third in traditional Medicare (32%) said the problem occurred when trying to access primary care. Smaller shares said the challenge occurred when trying to get surgery (13% for MA plans and 15% for traditional Medicare), physical therapy or rehabilitative care (13% for both), or cardiology care (13% vs. 10%).

About one in six beneficiaries said they were told to go to urgent care because their provider had no appointments available, with no significant difference between people with MA or traditional Medicare (16% vs. 18%).

WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

By most measures, the federal government has always paid MA plans more than what it would cost to cover similar people in traditional Medicare, authors said. Although estimates vary, one study finds that plans were overpaid by more than $27 billion in 2023. These overpayments have raised questions about whether MA enrollees receive greater value that merits the extra cost to Medicare.

MA plans typically provide benefits not covered by traditional Medicare, such as some coverage for vision, hearing, or dental services, and they can help to coordinate enrollees' care, as well as limit their out-of-pocket costs for Medicare-covered benefits. Traditional Medicare, meanwhile, allows beneficiaries to see any provider without the need to obtain prior authorization or a referral – which MA plans often require – and offers a larger selection of Part D plans for prescription drug coverage.

Whether enrolled in Medicare Advantage or traditional Medicare, about two in three beneficiaries overall said their coverage has fully met their expectations, the survey found. Those who said it fell short of expectations pointed to a lack of coverage for needed services, high costs or uncertainty about what benefits are covered.

Three in five beneficiaries in MA plans and one-quarter in traditional Medicare said they were asked to undergo a health assessment, which most frequently resulted in a discussion with their doctor. Few said it resulted in any changes to their care plan or in more services or benefits being offered.

Seven in 10 beneficiaries in MA said they used some of their plan's supplemental benefits in the past year; three in 10 did not use any. Four in 10 reported using their dental or vision benefits or an allowance for over-the-counter medications.

Whether enrolled in Medicare Advantage or traditional Medicare, beneficiaries reported similar access to benefits, services and providers, as well as similar challenges and experiences. Overall, one-third of beneficiaries indicated their coverage fell short of their expectations.

THE LARGER TREND

While Medicare Advantage remains attractive to the healthcare industry due to strong growth, high revenue and earnings per member, profitability is on the decline, a Moody's analysis found this month.

MA performance has remained under pressure in 2023 because of a significant spike in utilization for most of the companies, which Moody's expects will result in lower full-year MA earnings for insurers. Adding to that is lower reimbursement rates for the first time in years that are likely to remain weaker in 2025 and 2026, which is credit negative.

Moody's analysts contend that MA may have "lost its luster," citing as evidence Cigna's efforts to sell its MA business, even after a failed merger with Humana. Cigna recently announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Medicare Advantage, Supplemental Benefits, Medicare Part D and CareAllies businesses to Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) for about $3.7 billion.

Despite the challenges, MA remains popular with seniors, boasting lower out-of-pocket costs and premiums than traditional Medicare. Analysts cited a 2023 Milliman report showing annual estimated healthcare costs per beneficiary are $3,138 compared to $5,000 for traditional Medicare fee-for-service, and over $5,700 if a traditional Medicare beneficiary also buys a Medigap plan. Besides the lower cost, MA also offers additional benefits such as dental, vision and hearing, which are not covered by traditional Medicare.

MA membership has grown nationally at an annual rate of 8% to approximately 32 million, while traditional Medicare has declined at an average annual rate of 1%. Over that time, the percentage of people choosing MA has grown to 49% from 28%.

Last fall, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the Medicare Advantage, Part C and Medicare Part D Star Ratings that rank MA plans by the quality of health and drug services received by consumers. Thirty-one contracts for both Medicare Advantage and the Part D drug plan earned 5 stars, compared to 57 in 2023. Four contracts received the low overall ranking of 2 stars, the same number as in 2023.

ROCHESTER, Minn. — Fueled by strong performance across all activities in 2023, Mayo Clinic achieved remarkable progress toward its goal of transforming healthcare for people everywhere by making critical investments in valued staff, innovative facilities and pioneering digital technologies.

Key performance highlights include:

“By every measure, Mayo Clinic made excellent progress in 2023 towards our goal of creating a better healthcare system for the United States and globally,” says Gianrico Farrugia, M.D., president and CEO, Mayo Clinic. “Our dedicated staff have created and have used new tools and technologies to deliver transformation and are creating a brighter future of healthcare for our patients and ourselves.”

In 2023, Mayo Clinic continued its investment in Mayo Clinic Platform, the first true platform in healthcare. Mayo Clinic Platform is curating the world's healthcare data in a privacy protected, ethical and culturally sensitive way. The Platform brings together solution developers, large and small, around these rich data to accelerate healthcare innovation, and 28 solution developers have utilized the Platform in 2023. Through this work, Mayo Clinic Platform is connecting healthcare systems nationally and globally to these solutions, with an impact on 45 million lives.

Mayo Clinic also invested in the physical component of its strategy to transform healthcare. The organization announced the largest capital investment in Mayo Clinic's history, Bold. Forward. Unbound. in Rochester, which will create innovative spaces incorporating digital technologies and novel care concepts to transform both the patient and staff member experience.

Additional projects underway across the enterprise include Arizona Bold. Forward., which is more than doubling the size of Mayo's Phoenix campus; expansion of the Mayo Clinic hospital in Florida to meet increasing patient demand for complex care; a plan to increase access for patients and spur significant growth in Mayo's cancer practice in Florida; and new Mayo Clinic Health System hospital bed towers in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Mankato, Minnesota. Mayo Clinic also opened the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Building in Rochester, which provides 176,000 square feet of new research space on the campus.

Investing in staff

Last year, 80,221 Mayo Clinic staff cared for 1.3 million patients from over 130 countries. To support patients, growing campuses and new service lines, Mayo Clinic welcomed about 14,000 staff into new roles in 2023, a 4.9% increase from 2022.

Mayo Clinic 2023 staff investments include:

“Our staff deliver excellent care to patients today and innovate to design the care of tomorrow,” says Christina Zorn, chief administrative officer, Mayo Clinic. “Together, we're beginning 2024 in a position of strength and with a spirit of purpose of putting the needs of our patients first."

The U.S. government is warning about the resurgence of BlackCat (aka ALPHV) ransomware attacks targeting the healthcare sector as recently as this month.

"Since mid-December 2023, of the nearly 70 leaked victims, the healthcare sector has been the most commonly victimized," the government said in an updated advisory.

"This is likely in response to the ALPHV/BlackCat administrator's post encouraging its affiliates to target hospitals after operational action against the group and its infrastructure in early December 2023."

The alert comes courtesy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The BlackCat ransomware operation suffered a major blow late last year after a coordinated law enforcement operation led to the seizure of its dark leak sites. But the takedown turned out to be a failure after the group managed to regain control of the sites and switched to a new TOR data leak portal that continues to remain active to date.

It has also ramped up assaults against critical infrastructure organizations in recent weeks, having claimed responsibility for attacks on Prudential Financial, LoanDepot, Trans-Northern Pipelines, and UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Optum.

The development has prompted the U.S. government to announce financial rewards of up to $15 million for information leading to the identification of key members as well as affiliates of the e-crime group.

BlackCat's ransomware spree coincides with the return of LockBit after similar disruption efforts led by the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) last week. Zscaler ThreatLabz said the ransomware gang has updated its encryptor's ransom notes with TOR URLs pointing to the new infrastructure.

According to a report from SC Magazine, the threat actors breached Optum's network by leveraging the recently disclosed critical security flaws in ConnectWise's ScreenConnect remote desktop and access software.

BlackCat, however, has refuted that it used ConnectWise flaws in its attack against Optum. "For all those cyber intelligence so called expert dumbasses we did not use ConnectWise exploit as our initial access so you should base your reports you tell people on actual facts not kiddi speculations," it claimed.

The flaws, which allow for remote code execution on susceptible systems, have been weaponized by the Black Basta and Bl00dy ransomware gangs as well as by other threat actors to deliver Cobalt Strike Beacons, XWorm, and remote management tools like Atera, Syncro, and even another ScreenConnect client.

The mass exploitation of the two vulnerabilities has also been complemented by adversaries exploiting ScreenConnect and deploying a new Windows variant of KrustyLoader, which was previously spotted as part of a campaign targeting critical vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure appliances.

Attack surface management firm Censys said, as of February 27, 2024, it observed no less than 3,400 exposed potentially vulnerable ScreenConnect hosts online, with a majority of them located in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, Germany, France, India, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Ireland.

"It's clear that remote access software like ScreenConnect continues to be a prime target for threat actors," Censys security researcher Himaja Motheram said.

The findings come as ransomware groups like RansomHouse, Rhysida, and a Phobos variant called Backmydata have continued to compromise various organizations in the U.S., U.K., Europe, and the Middle East. 

In a sign that these cybercrime groups are shifting to more nuanced and sophisticated tactics, RansomHouse has been found utilizing a custom tool dubbed MrAgent to deploy the file-encrypting malware at scale.

"MrAgent is a binary designed to run on [VMware ESXi] hypervisors, with the sole purpose of automating and tracking the deployment of ransomware across large environments with a high number of hypervisor systems," Trellix said. Details of MrAgent first came to light in September 2023.

Another significant tactic adopted by some ransomware groups is the sale of direct network access as a new monetization method via their own blogs, on Telegram channels, or data leak websites, KELA said.

It also follows the public release of a Linux-specific, C-based ransomware threat known as Kryptina, which surfaced in December 2023 on underground forums and has since been made available for free on BreachForums by its creator.

"The release of the RaaS source code, complete with extensive documentation, could have significant implications for the spread and impact of ransomware attacks against Linux systems," SentinelOne researcher Jim Walter said.

"It is likely to increase the ransomware builder's attractiveness and usability, drawing in yet more low-skilled participants to the cybercrime ecosystem. There is also significant risk that it will lead to the development of multiple spin-offs and an increase in attacks."

(The story was updated after publication to include additional information about the exploitation of ConnectWise ScreenConnect flaws.)

Nine out of 10 beds in state psychiatric hospitals are occupied by people sent there by the courts, leaving no space for others in mental health crisis.

"The statistic of 93% of the beds in psychiatric hospitals being occupied, that the average person who has a mental health problem or you have someone in your family, and they've not committed a crime, they can't get in there," Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday. "That's crazy."

DeWine said he wants to fix that as well as help county jails provide mental health services to incarcerated people. The governor said he'll soon appoint a group of experts − judges, sheriffs, mental health professionals − to make specific recommendations.

Courts send people to the state hospitals so they can be restored to mental competency and then able to stand trial − often for minor crimes.

"We know that the court has to be able to put that person somewhere, but our state hospitals probably are not the most appropriate place for most of them to be," DeWine said. "The guy who stole a piece of pizza, he's occupying space that someone, who if we could get them in there in a reasonable period of time, you might totally save their life and turn their life around."

Since the 1950s, Ohio and other states closed mental health hospitals and promised to treat those patients in local facilities.

"We said we were going to stop warehousing people, deinstitutionalize most of them, and then at the same time build up a local, county-by-county system," DeWine said. "We didn't do it."

Ohio closed two state hospitals, Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare in Dayton and Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare in Cambridge in 2008 to help balance the state budget. Six state hospitals remain open.

DeWine pointed out that it's not just an Ohio problem.

Nationwide, states closed 62 psychiatric hospitals between 1997 and 2015 and since the 1950s, there has been a 91% decrease in state beds, according to the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors.

In 2019, following the mass shooting in Dayton, DeWine called for a change in how Ohio uses its state psychiatric beds.

One in three inmates in Ohio have a mental illness, forcing jails to act as the de facto treatment centers, according to the Stepping Up Initiative, which seeks to divert people with serious mental illnesses from lockups.

"More people with mental illnesses are sitting, untreated, in local jails than ever before," the group said. "Across the nation and in Ohio, jails have become revolving doors for people with mental illnesses."

Evelyn Stratton, a former Ohio Supreme Court justice who leads Stepping Up, said the state lacks places to take people experiencing mental health crises so they often end up in jails.

Jails need to provide medication assisted treatment for those suffering from opiate withdrawals, psychotropic drugs and therapy for people and train guards in crisis intervention techniques, she said.

Stratton said jails need to link people to services, such as Medicaid, before they are released and communities need to build out more supportive housing so people have stable places to live.

She agrees with the governor that existing state hospital beds need to be more available. Her answer is to shift to outpatient treatment for many of the people being restored to competency before standing trial.

Roughly 300,000 people are booked into Ohio's 89 full-service jails each year and the state prison system holds about 45,000 people. Most of them qualify for health care via Medicaid, a state and federally funded program.

But federal rules block Medicaid coverage for inmates. Ohio prisons and jails have focused on making sure Medicaid coverage is re-started as soon as people leave incarceration.

Some states have applied for a special waiver from the federal government to have Medicaid cover medical costs for inmates close to release. The waiver would mean the federal government would pay about 60% of the tab for some inmates' medical costs.

When asked why Ohio Medicaid hasn't applied for that waiver, DeWine said: "I will look at that."

People say that crises bring opportunities. Many imagined a new-look Acapulco following the devastation of Hurricane Otis, an apocalypse that would usher in peace through the reconstruction of the city, or so the most optimistic people thought. However, the calm has not followed the storm, at least not yet. During these days, in which the battered pearl of the Pacific is staging the Mexican Tennis Open as a symbol of the yearned-for normality, all is still not well in the region. There are still long queues in supermarkets to exchange the vouchers issued by the government for food before they expire and many of those affected are waiting to be censused to receive the expected aid. Violence has resulted in various deaths in the last week alone, with the customary scenario of bodies shot to death or severed heads accompanied by narco-messages. Public and private transportation has ceased to operate on several occasions in protest against the attacks perpetrated by organized criminal groups. In the meantime, the governors have hailed the big Latin American tennis event with grandiose phrases: “The port lives, shines and will shine stronger than ever. We want a new Acapulco,” recently exclaimed the governor, Evelyn Salgado.

Hoteliers still estimate that it will take two years before they can run at full capacity, given the extent of the destruction caused by the hurricane that swept in from the sea in the early hours of October 26. Health officials are working tirelessly to bring to an end as soon as possible the dengue epidemic that caused the collapse of the health services. Acapulco is still struggling to get back on its feet, which is why the tennis tournament, hosted in the city since 2001, represents two sides of the coin. On the one hand, it is an opportunity to stimulate tourism and employment. On the other, it is evidence that basic needs and outbreaks of violence cannot be camouflaged with a sporting showcase.

“The Open only provides Acapulco with publicity. This year, the state government has earmarked 20 million pesos for its organization, but in reality it only benefits the people who are in its immediate environment,” says Óscar Ricardo Muñoz Cano, journalist of El Sur de Guerrero newspaper, over the phone. He says that there are around 11,000 families who benefit from the tennis, those who work in hotels, transportation, and so forth, but that the attendees are foreigners because there is not enough wealth in Acapulco for residents to afford the cost of the tickets. “In addition, practically everything is consumed indoors, in the enclosure, they do not usually go outside, they do not coexist,” by that he means the money they spend does not go far beyond the tennis courts in the enclosure. However, the players have had kind words of good fortune for Acapulco, and Stefanos Tsitsipas has promised to donate $1,000 for every ace he racks up. We can only wish him luck.

Days after the houses were swept away, the palm trees lay on the beach and the streets, the hotels were left with the bare skeleton of their structure and 56 lives were lost in the catastrophe (there are still many missing that may have been dragged down by the sea), there was still solidarity in the midst of the looting and plundering. The first weeks of devastation subsided and last Sunday, the navy announced that it was closing its collection centers from which it had supplied the population with basic goods and food, but the supply has not yet returned to normal and the reconstruction aid is not getting to everyone. Some of those affected attempted to block roads in protest because they were not being censused, and therefore did not receive what they were entitled to, they protested.

Around 10,000 national guards were assigned to the area at the time. Acapulco was already a barbaric region where organized crime had been gaining influence over the juicy profits from tourism, including drugs and prostitution, for years. The city lost its past splendor and the celebrities secluded themselves in certain privileged areas along the coast. The others left for other vacation destinations. Violence was becoming visible every afternoon, in full daylight. Hundreds of tourists, many arriving from the Mexican capital, looked on in astonishment as gunmen entered a local restaurant and killed a waiter, as an example. The deployment of the military on the beaches, uniformed and armed, had little effect, as they provided an unusual photo opportunity for beachgoers.

Perhaps nothing can stop crime. People thought at first, the hurricane that devastated the city would drive the corrupt narcos out of Acapulco and the community could rebuild itself with other social parameters. But this was not the case. The assassinations have been ongoing and there are many who believe that the economic gains from the reconstruction will provide a lifeline for the gang members and their diverse circle, which sometimes involves politics and the business sector. The crisis of violence in the transport sector certainly includes some of this. “We thought that with Otis’ battering they would have no one to extort money from, all the businesses closed, but they have targeted the transport sector,” says the journalist Muñoz Cano. Indeed, the mafias that fight over transportation have triggered numerous crises in Acapulco and the whole state of Guerrero, causing deaths and placing the state government in a complex situation. Burned taxis, murdered drivers. The state responds to each crisis by pledging to provide more police to reinforce the routes, but nothing can deter crime.

“We are still in trouble. Here we are doing what we can for the reconstruction, but private and public resources are not enough, they want to make out that we are fine, that they are opening hotels, but the most emblematic ones, such as the Princess or the Mundo Imperial are at 50%. The statistics include the very old, small guesthouses where groups of young people stay,” says Muñoz Cano. And he goes on to mention intermittent transport stoppages, violence and food aid. On a scale of 0 to 10? “Acapulco has always been a six or seven. What we have is resilience.”

In the last few days, the local news reported that the stolen mariachi frogs were recovered and were singing again. This news and the Tennis Open are the things to be most optimistic about in the area at present.

ATP, the men’s professional tennis tour, and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund agreed to a five-year partnership Wednesday that will make the country a major sponsor of the league, the latest in a series of moves by the kingdom to invest in professional sports.

Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has invested heavily in golf, soccer, and Formula 1 racing. 

As part of the deal, the PIF, the Saudi wealth fund, will have naming rights for the ATP rankings which were previously sponsored by Pepperstone, an Australian online trading firm, ATP said Wednesday.

PIF will partner with ATP for other events in Beijing, Indian Wells, Madrid and Miami, ATP said in a statement.

Before Wednesday’s announcement, Saudi Arabia had a deal to host the Next Generation ATP finals—a tournament for younger players—in Jeddah from 2023 to 2027.

Women’s tennis is also exploring the possibility of partnering with the Saudis. The WTA women’s tennis tour has reportedly been in negotiations with Saudi Arabia to play its WTA Finals in the country.

This is the latest in a series of investments the Saudi’s have made in professional sports in recent years. Most notably, the PIF made major investments in professional golf when they allocated billions of dollars to start LIV Golf, in 2022 as a direct competitor to the PGA Tour. With that money, LIV recruited some of the PGA Tour’s best known golfers and challenged PGA’s control of professional golf. Then competing golf tours surprised the world last year when they suddenly announced they were merging. The Saudis have made investments to host major soccer tournaments in their country including the 2027 Asian Cup and 2023 Club World Cup.The Saudi’s also appear interested in investing in Formula 1 after they signed a 10-year contract in 2020 to host a race in the country each year beginning in 2021. Bloomberg reported the PIF considered making a $20 billion bid for Formula 1 in 2022. This heavy investment in sports is part of Crown Prince Muhammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030, a government program aimed at diversifying the oil-rich country’s economy.

Some athletes have been critical of the growing relationship between professional sports and Saudi Arabia. The country has been accused of “sportswashing” or involving itself in sports in an attempt to distract from the country’s human rights violations. The United Nations Human Rights Council last month criticized Saudi Arabia’s restrictions on LGBTQ+ people—same-sex relations are punishable by death in Saudi Arabia and all forms of LGBTQ+ advocacy are banned in the country. The Saudis’ also faced criticism, including from President Joe Biden, over the purported role of bin Salman in the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Andy Murray says he is "likely not going to play past this summer" with the three-time Grand Slam champion in line to play at the French Open, Wimbledon and this summer's Olympics in Paris

Andy Murray says he's "likely not going to play past this summer" with the two-time Olympic gold medallist eyeing another run at Paris 2024.

Speaking after his defeat to Frenchman Ugo Humbert in the second round of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, he said: "I'm likely not going to play past this summer. I get asked about it after every single match that I play, every single tournament that I play. I'm bored of the question, to be honest."

The 36-year-old also confirmed he plans to play at this year's French Open where he was runner-up to Novak Djokovic eight years ago.

"I've had experiences through my career where I didn't play the French Open in 2013 and I won Wimbledon. I also played the French Open and did really well in 2016. I don't think it makes a huge difference if you get an extra week's practice or so on the grass. So yeah, I would like to play one more time," he confirmed.

Murray sparked speculation over his potential retirement on Monday when, after beating Denis Shapovalov in Dubai, he said: "I probably don't have too long left, but I'll do as best as I can these last few months."

The Scot has said previously he has an idea of when he would like to bow out, and he told Radio 4's Today programme he is likely to make that information public at some point.

"When the time is right I will probably say something before I play my last match and my last tournament," he said. "Whether I say anything months ahead of the time, I don't know."

Murray is also the only tennis player to have won back-to-back singles gold medals at the Olympics, at London 2012 and Rio 2016.

"Hopefully I can get the chance to compete at another one," he added.

The Paris Olympics start on Saturday July 27, less than two weeks after the end of Wimbledon, which runs from July 1 to July 14.

Murray has endured a difficult start to 2024, losing his opening four matches to see him slip down to 67th in the rankings. If he failed to qualify outright for the Olympics, he could seek a spot in the draw as a previous champion.

The youngster has regularly changed coaches in recent years

Emma Raducanu's agent admits he does not agree with her decision to regularly change coaches early in her tennis career.

However, Max Eisenbud admits some of the criticism that has come the 21-year-old's way is 'malicious' and out of line.

Raducanu has suffered with form and fitness since she stunned the tennis world by winning the US Open at the age of 18.

She missed much of 2023 after undergoing surgery on both wrists as well as her ankle, not returning to action until early this January.

Raducanu has earned a reputation for not having a coach for an extended period of time in the first few years of her professional career.

Nigel Sears was the first coach she had between June and July 2021, with Andrew Richardson taking the role for three months between July and September that year.

Richardson was coach at Raducanu's US Open win and he was replaced by Torben Beltz, who lasted five months until April 2022.

Childhood coach Jane O’Donoghue returned to help Raducanu at Wimbledon in 2022 before Dmitry Tursunov took on the reigns between August and October.

Sebastian Sachs was next to be appointed and he lasted six months before they parted ways in June 2023.

Another of Raducanu's childhood coaches, Nick Cavaday, is now in the role having been reunited in January.

Eisenbud doesn't agree with Raducanu's approach but believes it works for her and is backing her for more Grand Slam glory.

Speaking on Andy Roddick's Served podcast, Eisenbud said: "As the agent, do I necessarily agree with it? I don’t. But it seems to work for her.

"And as the agent, we can only try to recommend and say, ‘Hey, this one did it this way.’ But they [the family] seem to be very comfortable in the way they are doing it and I have to respect that.

"Maybe that changes and maybe it doesn’t. But she really is a hard worker. And tennis is her priority.

"Yes, people want to see that she does other things. But the way I see her work and how smart she is, I believe she’ll win more slams."

Raducanu has struggled upon her return to playing, failing to get past the second round in any of the four tournaments she has played.

Even Adam Sandler sometimes gets nervous when meeting A-list celebrities.

Most notably, Taylor Swift. The "Spaceman" actor revealed he gets a "little f---ing jumpy" around the pop star in a new interview.

"Taylor Swift because of what she means to my kids, I get a little f---ing jumpy, because I don't want to blow it for my kids," Sandler said during an appearance on SiriusXM's "Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend." "I talk a little too loud. I don't act as cool as I can."

"I can see that," O'Brien responded, noting how famous Swift has become. "I mean, she's this whole other level now."

Sandler compared Swift to The Beatles, specifically how people knew all of their songs.

"People talk about The Beatles of it all and her. I mean, f---, so many smash hits. There's not a word my kids don't know."

O'Brien admitted his daughter knows all of Swift's songs as well.

"I know them too, by the way," Sandler quipped, before adding, "but they know them inside and out. But remember The Beatles… every single song on the record you knew — that's Taylor Swift too. There's not a song you skip. You go, ‘Oh that one's pretty cool.'"

Swift has cemented her place among The Beatles after breaking multiple records set by the band. In July 2023, the "Midnights" singer matched one of the band's most impressive records — having three songs from three different albums within the Billboard Hot 100.

At that time, "I Can See You (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)" on "Speak Now (Taylor's Version)" landed at No. 5, "Cruel Summer" from "Lover" at No. 9, and "Karma" with Ice Spice from "Midnights" at No. 10.

The Beatles also accomplished this feat in February 1964, according to Forbes.

"I Want To Hold Your Hand" from "Meet The Beatles" as No. 1, "She Loves You" from "The Beatles' Second Album" at No. 2, and "Please Please Me" from "Introducing... The Beatles" at No. 6.

TV's "Wonder Woman" has high hopes for the upcoming film adaptation starring Gal Gadot. Learn why in our exclusive interview above, then stay tuned for Carter's thoughts on STILL being recognized as Wonder Woman after all these years.

It's been just over three years since Lynda Carter's husband, Robert Altman, passed away from a rare form of leukemia. The original "Wonder Woman" is still navigating her grief, and finding new ways to honor her late love.

While she's best known for her time on the small screen, Carter is also a singer, and has written a new song as a tribute to Altman. 

"The soul of the song is about how you miss a person so much, because they're such a presence in your life that it's almost impossible to imagine that you won't physically see them again in this life," she told People magazine.

"You wonder, 'How can I communicate with you? Where are you? You didn't just die — there's too much of you left on this earth, too many people that love you.'"

‘WONDER WOMAN' STAR LYNDA CARTER SPEAKS OUT ON HUSBAND ROBERT A. ALTMAN'S DEATH: 'HE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE'

On Valentine's Day, Carter announced her new single, "Letters from Earth," on her social media.

"I've been singing for over 50 years," she told the outlet. "I started singing in clubs when I was 14, and was writing music before I became an actor."

To this day, she has a hard time resolving that Altman isn't just off somewhere else. 

"He was the great love of my life," she prefaced to People. "I think of him every day. There's so much of my day to day where I find myself thinking, 'Oh Robert will know.' Or if I'm on a flight, I still expect him to text to ask, ‘Did you land safely? Was everything alright?’"

"These letters are almost a prayer to your loved one. Hopefully people will relate to it. It's a celebration of love, as much as it is heartbreaking."

Carter married Altman, a video game executive and lawyer, in 1984. The couple shared son James and daughter Jessica together.

"He was this very calm, great, kind of an even-keeled person, and he liked my personality and the things I'd come up with. It was an interesting life together," she said of the couple's nearly three-decade relationship. "We did fun things and we laughed and laughed. We had children, wonderful friends. We went through some serious things but life was an adventure with him."

Carter admits it's difficult not having her partner with whom she can do activities: "We were always traveling and doing fun things, and then when you're alone, you have to do everything alone. And that's no fun."

"Of course I've got some very good girlfriends. And the children are wonderful. They also had a wonderful relationship with him, and we talk about him all the time."

Richard Lewis, the legendary stand-up comedian who also starred alongside Larry David on "Curb Your Enthusiasm," has died. He was 76.

According to his publicist, Jeff Abraham of Jonas Public Relations, Lewis died peacefully at his home in Los Angeles on Tuesday night after suffering a heart attack.

Abraham stated, "His wife, Joyce Lapinsky, thanks everyone for all the love, friendship and support and asks for privacy at this time."

He noted that Lewis announced he was living with Parkinson's disease in April 2023, and can currently be seen co-starring in the final season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" on HBO with creator and star Larry David.

David, in a statement via an HBO spokesperson, expressed his sadness at the loss of his dear friend and co-star.

"Richard and I were born three days apart in the same hospital and for most of my life he’s been like a brother to me. He had that rare combination of being the funniest person and also the sweetest. But today he made me sob and for that I’ll never forgive him," David said.

Their "Curb" co-star Cheryl Hines also expressed her heartbreak over Lewis' death.

"When I was young I had the biggest crush on Richard Lewis. He was the funniest person on stage and the most handsome comedian. Then when I was cast on ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm,’ I got to work with him and it was a dream come true," Hines said in a statement.

She continued, "Through the years I learned who Richard really was and the gifts he gave. Yes, he was the comedian I fell in love with, but he was also one of the most loving people I know. He would take time to tell the people he loved what they meant to him — especially in recent years. In between takes on ‘Curb,' he would tell me how special I was to him and how much he loved me."

Hines concluded, "To be loved by Richard Lewis. A true gift. I love you Richard."

HBO also issued a statement, saying, "We are heartbroken to learn that Richard Lewis has passed away. His comedic brilliance, wit and talent were unmatched. Richard will always be a cherished member of the HBO and ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ families, our heartfelt condolences go out to his family, friends and all the fans who could count on Richard to brighten their days with laughter."

Lewis was born in New York City in 1947 and raised in New Jersey, the youngest of three children.

His stand-up career took off in the 1970s and '80s, and he earned the nickname "The Prince of Pain" for his melancholy topics and pouring his anguish and torment on stage.

Comedy Central named Lewis one of the top 50 stand-up comedians of all time, and he earned a place on GQ magazine’s list of the "20th Century’s Most Influential Humorists." He also lent his humor for charity causes, including Comic Relief and Comedy Gives Back.

In 1989, he delivered a memorable performance at Carnegie Hall, appearing on stage with taped-together yellow legal pad papers for a two and a half hour set that led to two standing ovations.

The "Howard Stern" regular also produced comedy specials for HBO and Showtime, including "I’m in Pain," "I’m Exhausted, I’m Doomed," and "Richard Lewis: The Magical Misery Tour."

In addition to stand-up, Lewis acted regularly. He co-starred on the ABC series "Anything But Love" with Jamie Lee Curtis, and appeared in films like Mel Brooks' "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" as a deeply neurotic Prince John. Lewis also dabbled in dramatic roles, with a cameo in the Nicolas Cage drama "Leaving Las Vegas," which led to his own indie film, "Drunks," a picture that dealt with alcoholism.

Lewis was also open in his comedy about his addiction, alcohol and mental health struggles, something he detailed in his 2008 memoir "The Other Great Depression" and a follow-up, "Reflections From Hell: Richard Lewis' Guide on How Not to Live," released in 2015.

The comedian sought treatment in 1994 for drugs and alcohol after a cocaine overdose and had been sober since.

In 2000, Lewis joined the recurring cast of "Curb Your Enthusiasm," created and written by and starring his friend David. Lewis played a fictionalized version of himself across the show's 12 seasons.

He also addressed his Parkinson's diagnosis and decision to retire from stand-up on X, saying in a video, "I'm finished with stand-up, I'm focusing on writing and acting."

Lewis added, "I have Parkinson's disease, but I'm under a doctor's care and everything is cool, and I love my wife, I love my little puppy dog, and I love all my friends and my fans, and now you know where it's been at the last three and a half years."

Jon and Andy Erwin, the producers behind "Ordinary Angels," wanted the Lionsgate/Kingdom Story film to serve as a follow-up to their 2023 hit film "Jesus Revolution," a tangible example of what Christian service should look like after spiritual transformation.

And without being too heavy-handed or overly preachy, "Ordinary Angels," starring Hilary Swank and Alan Ritchson, does exactly that. 

Based on a true story, "Ordinary Angels" opens in 1990s Louisville, Kentucky, where Ed Schmitt (Ritchson) is saying goodbye to his wife, Theresa, who is dying due to a rare liver disease. It's the same disease the younger of their two daughters, Michelle, has, and the only cure is a liver transplant. Unfortunately, the medical bills are overwhelming, and Ed, a roofer, can't keep up. 

Viewers are then introduced to Sharon Stevens (Swank), a hairdresser battling alcoholism who has a fractured relationship with her son. She encounters the Schmitt family's ordeal in the local newspaper at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. She quickly discovers her new purpose: aiding the Schmitt family in getting Michelle the life-saving treatment she needs. 

Michelle's plight becomes the catalyst for Sharon's journey toward purpose and self-discovery. Her initial gesture of organizing a fundraiser at her hair salon is just the beginning of her relentless efforts to support the family despite Ed's resistance (he doesn't understand why Sharon would meddle in the lives of people she barely knows). 

Taking on roles far beyond those of a hairdresser, she becomes an indispensable source of hope and assistance to the Schmitts, raising significant funds, advocating for their cause and managing their finances, though sometimes her tactics aren't the most scrupulous.

In one scene, she tells Ed that some bills are worth ignoring. They're "like wine," she says. "They get better with age."

Yet, this journey is not without its challenges. Sharon's compulsion to help mirrors her struggles with addiction — a fact she's soon confronted with — and avoidance of her own fragile familial relationships, suggesting a complex path toward redemption and healing.

Ed, meanwhile, embodies the tireless love and dedication of a father facing the worst fears imaginable. He works tirelessly to provide for his daughters and to maintain a semblance of normalcy in their lives despite experiencing his own grief. It's his crisis of faith  — how can a good God allow such terrible things to happen — and the local church's efforts to support the Schmitts that highlight the profound questions of suffering and divine presence in times of hardship.

"My faith? You know how many prayer lists Theresa was on?" he says in one scene. "Seventeen. And now, they got Michelle on those same lists. Lots of good faith's doing me."

Though a family-friendly movie, "Ordinary Angels" does explore serious themes like addiction, grief, illness and despair. Sharon is shown drunk on several occasions, and in one particularly heartbreaking scene, Michelle vomits blood. Filmmakers don't shy away from portraying people realistically — messy, broken and in need of redemption. 

Yet, the film ultimately celebrates the extraordinary impact of compassion and action, highlighting the reality that anyone — even those battling their own demons — can make a difference in the lives of others. Sharon's journey from self-destruction to self-improvement, paralleled by her unwavering commitment to the Schmitt family, offers a message of hope amid brokenness and the transformative power of kindness.

Also central to the film's message is the theme of communal support, showcased in Sharon's initiative to host a fundraiser, which bridges the gap between her and Ed's family and rallies the broader community in a collective effort to uplift one of their own.

Ultimately, the helicopter equipped to bring Michelle to her life-saving treatment in the middle of a blizzard lands at the local church, thanks to the efforts of congregants who brave freezing weather to dig out a landing strip. 

Directed by Jon Gunn ("Case for Christ"), "Ordinary Angels" invites audiences to find beauty in imperfection and strength in adversity without feeling overly preachy, a rare feat in the world of historically neatly packaged faith-based films. 

The goal of "Ordinary Angel," filmmakers told The Christian Post, is to encourage those who profess Christ to turn their faith into action, as "faith without works is dead." They said that even the most unlikely heroes can be an "ordinary angel" in their community. It's a powerful and timely message, yet one rarely made in film and media. 

"What makes a cheesy Christian film is the fact that, as Christians, sometimes we're scared to embrace struggle and tension, and all those things of being flawed individuals, to get to that place of hope or that place of redemption," Andy Erwin said.

"What we try to do with all of our movies is embrace the struggle. In this case, Sharon is a hot mess of a person, but she's also an 'ordinary angel' in Ed's life who finds her purpose in saving a little girl. I think it gives hope to the ordinary, everyday person that is flawed and struggling their way through life to find their calling and their purpose."

"Ordinary Angels" is now playing in theaters.

Las Vegas will be without one of its resident performers next month. 

In a statement shared on social media, Adele regretfully informed her followers that she has to postpone her "Weekends with Adele" residency for the entirety of March, due to ongoing health issues.

"Sadly I have to take a beat and pause my Vegas residency," she wrote. "I was sick at the end of the last leg and all the way through my break. I hadn't quite gotten the chance to get back to full health before shows resumed and now I'm sick again."

"And unfortunately it's all taken a toll on my voice. And so on Doctors orders I have no choice but to rest thoroughly," she explained. "The remaining 5 weekends of this leg are being postponed to a later date. We are already working out the details and you will be sent the information asap."

She noted in the caption that she'd miss her fans "like mad" and that she's "sorry for the inconvenience."

A representative for the "Rolling In The Deep" singer did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for further comment.

Adele initially announced this residency in 2021, only to stun and disappoint fans months later by postponing the tour in its entirety. In an emotional video shared by the British star, Adele told fans that the caliber of her show was not up to par and that she and her crew wouldn't be ready to begin on time.

Adele's revamped residency finally began in November 2022, with the singer announcing the first extension of her stay in March 2023. In October, she announced her final stint would run from January through June 2024.

Just last month, Adele informed her fans that when her residency concludes in Vegas, she's off to Munich, Germany, to perform a series of shows. 

"I haven’t played in Europe since 2016! I couldn’t think of a more wonderful way to spend my summer and end this beautiful phase of my life and career with shows closer to home during such an exciting summer," she wrote of the opportunity.

A slew of stars declined Jennifer Lopez' invitation to be featured in her new Amazon Original film This Is Me…Now: A Love Story, released earlier this month. According to Entertainment Weekly, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, and Snoop Dog, are just a few artists who turned down the cameo opportunity. The film, encompassing a multi-decade healing journey towards self-love, was released in tandem with the "On The Floor" hitmaker's ninth studio album on February 16th.

Lopez revealed that she believed the role would have been a "big leap of faith" for some of the artists who declined to be featured in the film. 

Lizzo, Jason Momoa, Jennifer Coolidge, Vanessa Hudgens, and Khloe Kardashian were also asked to be apart of the project and were either uninterested or "unavailable." Despite a handful of standouts turning down the invitation, many entertainment greats said yes to the opportunity. 

Entertainment Weekly mentioned that Jane Fonda, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Post Malone, Kim Petras, Keke Palmer, and Jenifer Lewis, all graciously accepted cameos in This Is Me…Now: A Love Story. 

The world-renowned actress gave fans an exclusive look behind the making of the film in a documentary titled The Greatest Love Story Never Told, available Amazon Prime Video as of Tuesday (February 27). During the documentary, Lopez revealed the names of the stars that chose to be apart of the film, and those who declined. The dazzling entertainer "broke down in tears" as she discussed the role that husband Ben Affleck played in boosting her confidence over the years. Despite their breakup in the early 2000's Affleck continued to positively influence Lopez' journey all the way through their rekindled romance in 2021 and their marriage in 2022. 

Fans can check out This Is Me…Now: A Love Story, currently streaming on Amazon Prime, for deeper look into JLo's journey.

Great news for former CNN host, Don Lemon after being fired from CNN in April of last year. Reportedly, CNN and Lemon have settled on a separation deal that would pay Lemon approximately $24.5 million, which is the amount that was left on Lemon’s contract at CNN when he was fired. That’s three and a half years’ worth of salary, which equals to $24.5 million. Lemon recently announced plans to launch “The Don Lemon Show” podcast on the X platform and promises that his podcast will allow him to be “bigger, bolder, freer.” His podcast starts on March 11th.

In sad news, our condolences and prayers are going out to the family of City Councilman Eric Mays of Flint, Michigan. Mays died over the weekend at age 65 of natural causes stemming from an illness, according to his family. Flint’s Mayor Sheldon Neeley said Councilman Eric Mays’ bold and courageous service made him beloved among his constituents and his strong presence will be missed at City Hall. Mays’ older sister said Mays leaves behind a legacy in Flint for being funny, generous and outspoken. She said she will miss her brother’s loud voice and laugh, along with the craziness he brought to the family.

And finally… Probably the most flashy Bishop of all time had his first day in court this week… Bishop Lamor Whitehead’s federal court trial started on Monday in New York. Almost two years ago, Whitehead was indicted for wire fraud, attempted extortion, and for making false statements to fund his opulent lifestyle. He is, of course, best known for wearing iced out jewelry and flamboyant designer suits and clothing to church and to court. Monday he shocked reporters by wearing a conservative navy suit to court. As he left the courthouse, he declined comment but he laughed when a reporter asked him what designer he was wearing.

Wendy Williams' family are hoping to remove her from the treatment facility where she is currently living because they want to "take care of her".

The 59-year-old TV star is under the care of a court-appointed guardian as she battles health conditions including primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia, but her brother Tommy Williams claims she's "stuck" in the system and being kept apart from her relatives who only get minimal contact with her.

Tommy has now declared they are trying to "unstick" her, telling UsWeekly: "I know that she is stuck and we are trying to unstick her. Her family is here and she doesn’t need a facility. We are here to take care of her. All I want for her is freedom. We have a father who would love to see her ...

"We’re dealing with unknowns. We just want to be able to check in with her. I would fly up there [to see her] , but where do I go? No one knows anything."

He added of the communication issues: "We can’t communicate unless someone patches us through. We wait for calls. I wait for calls from Wendy or my sister or whoever she can get to first and we can all hop on. When she makes that phone call [to us], we’re committed to listening and sharing for the moment."

Wendy, 59, was diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia - a rare condition that affects the nervous system and inhibits the ability to communicate - and frontotemporal dementia - which affects personality, behaviour and language - last year but the diagnosis was only recently made public.

She broke her silence on her health battle in a statement released on Friday (23.02.24) in which she thanked fans for the well wishes and insisted she needs "personal space and peace".

The statement read: "I want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Let me say, wow! Your response has been overwhelming.

"The messages shared with me have touched me, reminding me of the power of unity and the need for compassion. I hope that others with FTD may benefit from my story.

"I want to also thank the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration for their kind words of support and their extraordinary efforts to raise awareness of FTD. I continue to need personal space and peace to thrive. Please just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated."

WATCH LIVE

NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- Sandy Kenyon sits down with Emmy Award-winning entertainment reporter Joelle Garguilo, who is joining the WABC-TV Channel 7 Eyewitness News in New York team. Garguilo will take over for our beloved veteran reporter as he transitions to consultant for ABC Owned Television Stations.

In this special episode of "The Sitdown with Sandy Kenyon", Sandy asks Joelle about her television career and what she's looking forward to most about her new role.

Garguilo, a native New Yorker began her career in broadcast television 15 years ago at NBC -- throughout which she has interviewed hundreds of stars on the screen and stage including Oprah Winfrey, Tom Cruise, George Clooney, Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Jim Carrey, Zendaya, Timothee Chalamet, Julia Roberts, Tony Bennett, Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, among others.

Throughout her tenure, she held multiple roles across the network. Most recently, she worked as an on-air entertainment and features reporter for "New York Live," correspondent for "E!" News while contributing to the "Today Show with Hoda & Jenna" and has covered some of the biggest entertainment events of this last year, including the "Oppenheimer," "Barbie," and "Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1" premieres, the Met Gala, the MTV VMAs and the Tribeca Film Festival, among many others. As a contributor to the "Today Show with Hoda & Jenna" since 2021, she hosted the special segment "Scoop on the Scene," an entertainment news segment combining entertainment news and celebrity interviews as well as co-developed and hosted the live and taped segments for "Just the Good News."

Garguilo began her career with NBC News Mobile where she wrote, produced, edited, and anchored human interest, news, and features packages. From there, Garguilo joined the weekend 'TODAY' show launching 'POPStart' as host and producer as well as introducing 'Orange Room'. Simultaneously, she was reporting for New York Live, including the opportunity to co-host Golden Globes live pre-show specials and co-host their SNL 40th anniversary special. Garguilo also created 'POPSTART EXTRA' for TODAY.com where she wrote, hosted, and edited all digital segments.

In addition to entertainment coverage, Garguilo is passionate about sharing lifestyle, small business, human interest, and "feel good" content. Earlier in her career, she worked as a financial analyst for New Line Cinema.

Garguilo will report alongside Kenyon for Hollywood's Biggest Night, covering the 96th Oscars. The two will be on-site at the Dolby Theater to share all things Oscars from can't-miss moments leading up to, during, and after the big event on March 10.

You can watch the episode here, but if you want to enjoy a better experience, did you know you can catch 'The Sitdown with Sandy Kenyon' on your television set? Just make sure you add the ABC7NY app to your streaming device (Roku, Apple TV, etc.) to check out this and other episodes of this and other WABC-TV original streaming series.
