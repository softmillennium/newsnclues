The University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health recently expanded its Oregon Child Absenteeism Due to Respiratory Disease Study, using air sampling and complementary methods to track the prevalence of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in the Oregon, Wisconsin School District.

ORCHARDS research program manager Shari Barlow said the opportunity to test air sampling arose from connections to the Oregon School District. UW professor in the department of pathology and laboratory science Shelby O’Connor introduced the use of air sampling to test its effectiveness by comparing its results to an additional three methods, which included 

, school absences and PCR tests.

The air samplers were placed in communal gathering spaces — like cafeterias — where they picked up microscopic viruses and viral particles by taking up air through passive diffusion into the machine, forcing the air through a solution that helps particles stick to the sampler cartridge.

These cartridges were collected and replaced twice a week to be analyzed via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions to detect the presence of viral genetic material.

Viruses replicate using RNA, which hold genetic instructions for building the proteins that make up the physical virus. RT-PCR creates small, complementary strands of DNA called primers that can attach to the viral RNA. The RNA are placed in a thermocycler, which creates an alternating environment of warm and hot cycles that prompt the replication activity of DNA-building proteins called DNA polymerases. This process generates the binding of complementary viral RNA strands to be replicated again and again to produce a significant amount of viral DNA.

Large quantities of DNA make the viral DNA detectable to scientific instruments, so scientists can determine if viral DNA is present, indicating a positive result. The sites chosen for complementary primers have a very low chance of mutating when the virus does, so the process does not decrease in accuracy as the virus evolves, according to O’Connor.

Air sampling not only proved to be an effective method at determining the presence of viruses when compared with the other three methods, but also held a few advantages over them.

“The first [advantage] is that there is one sampler per school and antigen-testing every two days, so cost-wise, it’s a lot less…you can get a lot more information about a lot more people for a lot less money,” O’Connor said.

O’Connor said the lower cost means if schools have to use one method to monitor viruses, air sampling could be viable. Testing students also requires getting consent from students and parents, whereas the air samplers are a non-invasive measure. Antigen tests were performed on consenting students in their schools, where PCR tests were only administered to children who had opted-in to testing at home when they got sick.

But the air sampler also had some drawbacks compared to the other methods. Barlow said the air sampling was not specific to an individual, showing only that someone in the area was sick.

Because of this limitation, Barlow said air sampling could instead be used to determine when to implement transmission-mitigation measures, like masking and social distancing.

“[Another] challenge of the air sampler is that the results are delayed,” O’Connor said. “With a rapid antigen test you get your negative or positive [result]. Unfortunately with the air sampler we have to gather and get our results, which can take about a week.”

Testing samples takes large amounts of time due to the preparation needed for drawing up multiple solutions and running them through a thermocycler that oscillates between four different temperatures for a number of cycles. O’Connor said researchers are working to reduce the time-lag of air sampler testing and collecting so they can be used in other locations where more instantaneous feedback is needed.

A new method that reduces the amount of prep work for the samples so they can immediately be placed in the cycler would cut down on the time for processing, especially when paired with a cycler able to produce the testing sample in only thirty minutes.

Another downside of air sampling is the viral load — how much virus was in the air — is not discernible due to how the tests for the viruses afterwards are conducted. This is an issue for COVID-19 specifically, because people infected with the virus often shed viral particles long after they stop being contagious.

According to O’Connor, the amount of particles were not detectable by antigen tests, but the sensitive PCR tests administered to the air samples would detect the virus. This reasoning might also explain why there were no detections by rapid antigen testing after winter break in the study, but the air samplers continued to detect COVID-19.

Overall, the study found air sampling to be correlated with other methods of detection, which could help it towards a wider implementation for disease monitoring. According to Barlow, air sampling is already being used in clinics and long-term care facilities around Madison.

O’Connor believes it could be useful in monitoring where viruses are coming from and where they are being spread. But until there is a renewed interest in public health, it is unlikely to see more widespread use.

					Not having a tail is one way apes differ from monkeys				

A new study suggests that apes, including chimpanzees and humans, lack tails because a genetic parasite altered a gene important for tail development when the group diverged from other primates around 25 million years ago.

A genetic parasite may have robbed humans and other apes of their tails.

Around 25 million years ago, this parasite, a small stretch of repetitive DNA called an Alu element, ended up in a gene important for tail development, researchers report in the Feb. 29 Nature. The single insertion altered the gene Tbxt in a way that seems to have sparked one of the defining differences between monkeys and apes: Monkeys have tails, apes don’t.

“It was like lightning struck once,” says Jef Boeke, a geneticist at New York University Langone Health, and ape behinds ultimately became bare.

The genetic tweak may also give insight into why some babies are born with spinal cord defects such as spina bifida, when the tube that holds the cord doesn’t close all the way (SN: 12/6/16). 

Alu elements are part of a group of genetic parasites known as transposons or jumping genes that can hop across genetic instruction books, inserting themselves into their hosts’ DNA (SN: 5/16/17). Sometimes, when the gene slips itself into a piece of DNA that is passed down to offspring, these insertions become permanent parts of our genetic code.  

Transposons, including more than 1 million Alu elements, are found throughout our genome, says geneticist and systems biologist Bo Xia of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Researchers once thought of transposons as genetic garbage, but some have central roles in evolution. Without transposons, the placenta, immune system and insulation around nerve fibers may not exist (SN: 2/16/24).

And humans might still have tails.

To find out how apes lost their tails, Xia, then at NYU Langone Health, Boeke and colleagues analyzed 140 genes involved in vertebrate tail development. The team found that in monkeys, including baboons and rhesus macaques, the Tbxt gene was missing a chunk of DNA that’s found in humans, chimpanzees and other apes. It was a “eureka moment,” Boeke says. The insertion may have appeared around the time apes diverged from African and Asian monkeys, around 25 million years ago.

But the missing chunk was in a part of the gene called an intron, a bit of genetic material that isn’t made into proteins. “So why would that even matter?” he asks. A close look at the gene’s structure provided a plausible explanation: The missing bit tweaked Tbxt so that the gene makes a different form of the protein in apes than in monkeys.

Experiments in mice seemed to confirm the hypothesis. Mice, like monkeys, make normal versions of the Tbxt protein and have full-length tails. But when genetically engineered to make shortened versions of the Tbxt protein like apes do, the mice had shorter tails or none at all. Some mice also had spinal cord defects similar to spinal bifida, suggesting that there may be drawbacks to tail loss.

Other genes may also be involved in tail loss. Many more Alu elements are scattered among human introns that could have yet-to-be-known effects on other aspects of human evolution, Boeke and Xia say.

The new findings do begin to unravel how apes lost their tails, says Gabrielle Russo, a biological anthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York. But why it happened, she says, is a much harder question to answer. Research from the early 1900s linked tail loss to muscle changes that helped human bodies move upright, but shifts in posture, as well as learning to walk on two feet, didn’t happen until millions of years later (SN: 9/15/21; SN: 4/14/21). So, it’s unlikely the new findings will shed light on these human traits, Russo says.

A natural next step, Russo says, is exploring whether the genetic underpinnings of tail loss in apes also happened in other mammals with shortened tails or none at all such as koalas, capybaras and bears.

					Generative AI is not very skillful at applying what it learns to new situations				

Contributing Correspondent

18 hours ago

As impressive as they seem, the latest computer brains usually fail at tasks that require generalizing concepts — tasks that come easily to humans.

Apart from the northward advance of killer bees in the 1980s, nothing has struck as much fear into the hearts of headline writers as the ascent of artificial intelligence.

Ever since the computer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, humans have faced the prospect that their supremacy over machines is merely temporary. Back then, though, it was easy to show that AI failed miserably in many realms of human expertise, from diagnosing disease to transcribing speech.

But then about a decade ago or so, computer brains — known as neural networks — received an IQ boost from a new approach called deep learning. Suddenly computers approached human ability at identifying images, reading signs and enhancing photographs — not to mention converting speech to text as well as most typists.

Those abilities had their limits. For one thing, even apparently successful deep learning neural networks were easy to trick. A few small stickers strategically placed on a stop sign made an AI computer think the sign said “Speed Limit 80,” for example. And those smart computers needed to be extensively trained on a task by viewing numerous examples of what they should be looking for. So deep learning produced excellent results for narrowly focused jobs but couldn’t adapt that expertise very well to other arenas. You would not (or shouldn’t) have hired it to write a magazine column for you, for instance.

But AI’s latest incarnations have begun to threaten job security not only for writers but also a lot of other professionals.

“Now we’re in a new era of AI,” says computer scientist Melanie Mitchell, an artificial intelligence expert at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. “We’re beyond the deep learning revolution of the 2010s, and we’re now in the era of generative AI of the 2020s.”

Generative AI systems can produce things that had long seemed safely within the province of human creative ability. AI systems can now answer questions with seemingly human linguistic skill and knowledge, write poems and articles and legal briefs, produce publication quality artwork, and even create videos on demand of all sorts of things you might want to describe.

Many of these abilities stem from the development of large language models, abbreviated as LLMs, such as ChatGPT and other similar models. They are large because they are trained on huge amounts of data — essentially, everything on the internet, including digitized copies of countless printed books. Large can also refer to the large number of different kinds of things they can “learn” in their reading — not just words but also word stems, phrases, symbols and mathematical equations.

By identifying patterns in how such linguistic molecules are combined, LLMs can predict in what order words should be assembled to compose sentences or respond to a query. Basically, an LLM calculates probabilities of what word should follow another, something critics have derided as “autocorrect on steroids.”

Even so, LLMs have displayed remarkable abilities — such as composing texts in the style of any given author, solving riddles and deciphering from context whether “bill” refers to an invoice, proposed legislation or a duck.

“These things seem really smart,” Mitchell said this month in Denver at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

LLMs’ arrival has induced a techworld version of mass hysteria among some experts in the field who are concerned that run amok, LLMs could raise human unemployment, destroy civilization and put magazine columnists out of business. Yet other experts argue that such fears are overblown, at least for now.

At the heart of the debate is whether LLMs actually understand what they are saying and doing, rather than just seeming to. Some researchers have suggested that LLMs do understand, can reason like people (big deal) or even attain a form of consciousness. But Mitchell and others insist that LLMs do not (yet) really understand the world (at least not in any sort of sense that corresponds to human understanding).

“What’s really remarkable about people, I think, is that we can abstract our concepts to new situations via analogy and metaphor.”

In a new paper posted online at arXiv.org, Mitchell and coauthor Martha Lewis of the University of Bristol in England show that LLMs still do not match humans in the ability to adapt a skill to new circumstances. Consider this letter-string problem: You start with abcd and the next string is abce. If you start with ijkl, what string should come next?

Humans almost always say the second string should end with m. And so do LLMs. They have, after all, been well trained on the English alphabet.

But suppose you pose the problem with a different “counterfactual” alphabet, perhaps the same letters in a different order, such as a u c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t b v w x y z. Or use symbols instead of letters. Humans are still very good at solving letter-string problems. But LLMs usually fail. They are not able to generalize the concepts used on an alphabet they know to another alphabet.

“While humans exhibit high performance on both the original and counterfactual problems, the performance of all GPT models we tested degrades on the counterfactual versions,” Mitchell and Lewis report in their paper.

Other similar tasks also show that LLMs do not possess the ability to perform accurately in situations not encountered in their training. And therefore, Mitchell insists, they do not exhibit what humans would regard as “understanding” of the world.

“Being reliable and doing the right thing in a new situation is, in my mind, the core of what understanding actually means,” Mitchell said at the AAAS meeting.

Human understanding, she says, is based on “concepts” — basically mental models of things like categories, situations and events. Concepts allow people to infer cause and effect and to predict the probable results of different actions — even in circumstances not previously encountered.

“What’s really remarkable about people, I think, is that we can abstract our concepts to new situations via analogy and metaphor,” Mitchell said.

She does not deny that AI might someday reach a similar level of intelligent understanding. But machine understanding may turn out to be different from human understanding. Nobody knows what sort of technology might achieve that understanding and what the nature of such understanding might be.

If it does turn out to be anything like human understanding, it will probably not be based on LLMs.

After all, LLMs learn in the opposite direction from humans. LLMs start out learning language and attempt to abstract concepts. Human babies learn concepts first, and only later acquire the language to describe them.

So LLMs are doing it backward. In other words, perhaps reading the internet might not be the correct strategy for acquiring intelligence, artificial or otherwise.
