On a rainy Tuesday afternoon, Yejin is cooking lunch for her friends at her apartment, where she lives alone on the outskirts of Seoul, happily single.

While they eat, one of them pulls up a well-worn meme of a cartoon dinosaur on her phone. ""Be careful,"" the dinosaur says. ""Don't let yourself become extinct like us.""

The women all laugh.

""It's funny, but it's dark, because we know we could be causing our own extinction,"" says Yejin, a 30-year-old television producer.

Neither she, nor any of her friends, are planning on having children. They are part of a growing community of women choosing the child-free life. 

South Korea has the lowest birth rate in the world, and it continues to plummet, beating its own staggeringly low record year after year. 

Figures released on Wednesday show it fell by another 8% in 2023 to 0.72. 

This refers to the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime. For a population to hold steady, that number should be 2.1. 

If this trend continues, Korea's population is estimated to halve by the year 2100.  

Globally, developed countries are seeing birth rates fall, but none in such an extreme way as South Korea. 

Its projections are grim. 

In 50 years time, the number of working age people will have halved, the pool eligible to take part in the country's mandatory military service will have shrunk by 58%, and nearly half the population will be older than 65. 

This bodes so badly for the country's economy, pension pot, and security that politicians have declared it ""a national emergency"".  

For nearly 20 years, successive governments have thrown money at the problem - 379.8 trillion KRW ($286bn; £226bn) to be exact. 

Couples who have children are showered with cash, from monthly handouts to subsidised housing and free taxis. Hospital bills and even IVF treatments are covered, though only for those who are married. 

Such financial incentives have not worked, leading politicians to brainstorm more ""creative"" solutions, like hiring nannies from South East Asia and paying them below minimum wage, and exempting men from serving in the military service if they have three children before turning 30. 

Unsurprisingly, policymakers have been accused of not listening to young people - especially women - about their needs. And so, over the past year we have travelled around the country, speaking to women to understand the reasons behind their decision not to have children.

When Yejin decided to live alone in her mid-20s, she defied social norms - in Korea, single living is largely considered a temporary phase in one's life. 

Then five years ago, she decided not to get married, and not to have children. 

""It's hard to find a dateable man in Korea - one who will share the chores and the childcare equally,"" she tells me, ""And women who have babies alone are not judged kindly."" 

In 2022, only 2% of births in South Korea occurred outside of marriage. 

Instead, Yejin has chosen to focus on her career in television, which, she argues, doesn't allow her enough time to raise a child anyway. Korean work hours are notoriously long. 

Yejin works a traditional 9-6 job (the Korean equivalent of a 9-5) but says she usually doesn't leave the office until 8pm and there is overtime on top of that. Once she gets home, she only has time to clean the house or exercise before bed. 

""I love my job, it brings me so much fulfilment,"" she says. ""But working in Korea is hard, you're stuck in a perpetual cycle of work.""

Yejin says there is also pressure to study in her spare time, to get better at her job: ""Koreans have this mindset that if you don't continuously work on self-improvement, you're going to get left behind, and become a failure. This fear makes us work twice as hard."" 

""Sometimes at the weekends I go and get an IV drip, just to get enough energy to go back to work on Monday,"" she adds casually, as if this were a fairly normal weekend activity. 

She also shares the same fear of every woman I spoke to - that if she were to take time off to have a child, she might not be able to return to work. 

""There is an implicit pressure from companies that when we have children, we must leave our jobs,"" she says. She has watched it happen to her sister and her two favourite news presenters. 

One 28-year-old woman, who worked in HR, said she'd seen people who were forced to leave their jobs or who were passed over for promotions after taking maternity leave, which had been enough to convince her never to have a baby. 

Both men and women are entitled to a year's leave during the first eight years of their child's life.  But in 2022, only 7% of new fathers used some of their leave, compared to 70% of new mothers. 

Korean women are the most highly educated of those in OECD countries, and yet the country has the worst gender pay gap and a higher-than-average proportion of women out of work compared to men.

Researchers say this proves they are being presented with a trade-off - have a career or have a family. Increasingly, they are choosing a career. 

I met Stella Shin at an afterschool club, where she teaches five-year-olds English. 

""Look at the children. They're so cute,"" she cooed. But at 39, Stella does not have children of her own. It was not an active decision, she says. 

She has been married for six years, and both she and her husband wanted a child but were so busy working and enjoying themselves that time slipped away. Now she has accepted that her lifestyle makes it ""impossible"". 

""Mothers need to quit work to look after their child full time for the first two years, and this would make me very depressed,"" she said. ""I love my career and taking care of myself.""

In her spare time Stella attends K-pop dance classes with a group of older women. 

This expectation that women take two to three years off work when they have a child is common among women. When I asked Stella whether she could share the parental leave with her husband, she dismissed me with a look. 

""It's like when I make him do the dishes and he always misses a bit, I couldn't rely on him,"" she said. 

Even if she wanted to give up work, or juggle a family and a career, she said she could not afford to because the cost of housing is too high.

More than half the population live in or around the capital Seoul, which is where the vast majority of opportunities are, creating huge pressure on apartments and resources. Stella and her husband have been gradually pushed further and further away from the capital, into neighbouring provinces, and are still unable to buy their own place. 

Seoul's birth rate has sunk to 0.55 - the lowest in the country.

Then there is the cost of private education. While unaffordable housing is a problem the world over, this is what makes Korea truly unique.

From the age of four, children are sent to an array of expensive extra-curricular classes - from maths and English, to music and Taekwondo. 

The practice is so widespread that to opt out is seen as setting your child up to fail, an inconceivable notion in hyper-competitive Korea. This has made it the most expensive country in the world to raise a child. 

A 2022 study found that only 2% of parents did not pay for private tuition, while 94% said it was a financial burden.  

As a teacher at one of these cram schools, Stella understands the burden all too well. She watches parents spend up to £700 ($890) per child a month, many of whom cannot afford it. 

""But without these classes, the children fall behind,"" she said. ""When I'm around the children, I want to have one, but I know too much."" 

For some, this system of excessive private tuition cuts deeper than cost. 

""Minji"" wanted to share her experience, but not publicly. She is not ready for her parents to know she will not be having children. ""They will be so shocked and disappointed,"" she said, from the coastal city of Busan, where she lives with her husband. 

Minji confided that her childhood and 20s had been unhappy.

""I've spent my whole life studying,"" she said - first to get into a good university, then for her civil servant exams, and then to get her first job at 28.

She remembers her childhood years spent in classrooms until late at night, cramming maths, which she loathed and was bad at, while she dreamed of being an artist. 

""I've had to compete endlessly, not to achieve my dreams, but just to live a mediocre life,"" she said. ""It's been so draining.""

Only now, aged 32, does Minji feel free, and able to enjoy herself. She loves to travel and is learning to dive. 

But her biggest consideration is that she does not want to put a child through the same competitive misery she experienced. 

""Korea is not a place where children can live happily,"" she has concluded. Her husband would like a child, and they used to fight about it constantly, but he has come to accept her wishes. Occasionally her heart wavers, she admits, but then she remembers why it cannot be. 

Over in the city of Daejeon, Jungyeon Chun, is in what she calls a ""single-parenting marriage"". After picking up her seven-year-old daughter and four-year-old son from school, she tours the nearby playgrounds, passing the hours until her husband returns from work. He rarely makes it home by bedtime. 

""I didn't feel like I was making a major decision having children, I thought I would be able to return to work pretty quickly,"" she said. 

But soon the social and financial pressures kicked in, and to her surprise she found herself parenting alone. Her husband, a trade unionist, did not help with the childcare or the housework. 

""I felt so angry,"" she said. ""I had been well-educated and taught that women were equal, so I could not accept this.""  

This sits at the heart of the problem. 

Over the past 50 years, Korea's economy has developed at break-neck speed, propelling women into higher education and the workforce, and expanding their ambitions, but the roles of wife and mother have not evolved at nearly the same pace. 

Frustrated, Jungyeon began to observe other mothers. ""I was like, 'Oh, my friend who's raising a child is also depressed and my friend across the street is depressed too' and I was like, 'Oh, this is a social phenomenon'.""

She began to doodle her experiences and post them online. ""The stories were pouring out of me,"" she said. Her webtoon became a huge success, as women across the country related to her work, and Jungyeon is now the author of three published comic books. 

Now she says she is past the stage of anger and regret. ""I just wish I'd known more about the reality of raising kids, and how much mothers are expected to do,"" she said. ""The reason women are not having children now is because they have the courage to talk about it.""

But Jungyeon is sad, she says, that women are being denied the wonder of motherhood, because of the ""tragic situation they will be forced into"". 

But Minji says she is grateful she has agency. ""We are the first generation who get to choose. Before it was a given, we had to have children. And so we choose not to because we can.""

Back at Yejin's apartment, after lunch, her friends are haggling over her books and other belongings. 

Fatigued with life in Korea, Yejin has decided to leave for New Zealand. She woke up one morning with a lightbulb realisation that no-one was forcing her to live here. 

She researched which countries ranked highly on gender equality, and New Zealand emerged a clear winner. ""It's a place where men and women are paid equally,"" she says, almost disbelievingly, ""So I'm off."" 

I ask Yejin and her friends what, if anything, could convince them to change their minds. 

Minsung's answer surprises me. ""I'd love to have children. I'd have 10 if I could,"" So, what's stopping her, I ask? The 27-year-old tells me she is bisexual and has a same-sex partner. 

Same-sex marriage is illegal in South Korea, and unmarried women are not generally permitted to use sperm donors to conceive. 

""Hopefully one day this will change, and I'll be able to marry and have children with the person I love,"" she says. 

The friends point out the irony, given Korea's precarious demographic situation, that some women who want to be mothers are not allowed to be.

But it appears politicians might slowly be accepting the depth and complexity of the crisis. 

This month, South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol acknowledged that the attempts to spend their way out of the problem ""hadn't worked"", and that South Korea was ""excessively and unnecessarily competitive"". 

He said his government would now treat the low birth rate as a ""structural problem"" - though how this will translate into policy is still to be seen. 

Earlier this month, I caught up with Yejin from New Zealand, where she had been living for three months. 

She was buzzing about her new life and friends, and her job working in the kitchen of a pub. ""My work-life balance is so much better,"" she said. She can arrange to meet her friends during the week. 

""I feel so much more respected at work and people are less judgemental,"" she added.

""It's making me not want to go home.""

Representative democracy remains a favorite system of governance around the globe, but its appeal is slipping on the eve of elections in much of the world, according to a survey of 24 democratic countries by the Pew Research Center released Wednesday.

While a median of 77% across the 24 surveyed countries said representative democracy was a “good” system of government, higher than any other alternative, a median of 59% told pollsters they were dissatisfied with how democracy was working in their own country. In the 22 countries where data was available from 2017, the last time Pew asked about democracy, the share describing democracy as a “very good” system was down in half of them.

“People do like representative democracy. But you see here in lots of different ways people are really frustrated with how it’s performing,” said Richard Wike, managing director of Pew’s Global Attitudes research. “There’s a real disconnect between people and their representatives.”

Across the 24 countries — all democracies — a median of 74% said they don’t believe elected officials care what people like them think. Only 10 of the 24 national leaders on the survey had favorable ratings from half or more of the public.

But the alternatives were seen as even worse. Only six opposition leaders got favorable reviews, and a median of 42% of respondents said no political party in their country represented their viewpoint. People in the political center were more likely to report not feeling like a party represents their views.




The poll comes as the world’s democracies prepare for a titanic year, with elections scheduled in more than 50 nations that represent half the world’s population. That includes Indian elections this spring, European Union-wide elections in June and the November presidential election in the United States.

The voting comes as support for more authoritarian forms of government are on the rise. The Pew survey found that in eight of the surveyed countries, support for a “strong leader” who can make decisions without court or legislative interference increased since 2017.

Those countries included Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Kenya and Argentina, where Javier Milei, a self-described “anarcho-capitalist” whose supporters call him “the madman,” won that country’s presidential election in November, after the Pew survey work was completed earlier last year. Overall, just under one-third typically backed some sort of authoritarian system across the surveyed countries.

Support for a strong leader also rose in India, which stood out as the country with the highest level of support for that form of government, with 67% of those surveyed ranking it as a good system, an increase of 12 % from when Pew asked the question in 2017.

India’s popular prime minister, Narendra Modi, has been criticized for eroding that country’s democratic and secular traditions with his Hindu nationalist party. But the country’s residents also reported a high level of satisfaction with democracy in the poll, and Wike said the two factors are intertwined in India.

“These authoritarian models have more support there,” Wike said. “That gives authorities some foundation of public support they can draw on.”

The poll found support for a strong leader increased the most in Mexico, where it jumped 23% since 2017. At the same time, Mexico was one of three countries where support for democracy increased — Brazil and Poland were the other two.

Support for more authoritarian leadership tended to be strongest among those with lower levels of education and income, as well as those on the ideological right. Poorer countries registered higher support for autocratic systems, including military rule. Having the military in control of governing also was backed by about a third of all residents in eight of what Pew called more “middle-income” countries, such as Mexico, India, Indonesia and South Africa. Overall, though, military rule is the least popular form of government, with a median of just 15% supporting it.

The U.S. is an outlier in multiple categories, including its support for more autocratic systems.

It was the wealthiest country surveyed, and while its support for autocratic systems was well below majority level — only 15% back military rule and 26% back a strong leader system — they were higher than half the other countries in the poll.

That comes as former President Donald Trump, the leading candidate for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, has continued to speak warmly about authoritarian leaders, such as China’s Xi Jinping, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.

Wike said the U.S. also stands out for its polarization over questions of whether more diverse representation would improve the country’s policies. A median of 50% across the surveyed countries believe policies would improve if more women were elected, while in the U.S. that share was only 42%.

Across the surveyed countries, a median of 46% believed electing more younger adults to office would improve policies, while in the U.S. that share was 38%, the second-lowest recorded after Japan. The U.S. also registered the largest ideological gap on the question, with 7 in 10 liberals saying younger leaders would improve conditions and only 2 in 10 conservatives agreeing.

While representative democracy was the most popular system, direct democracy, in which citizens themselves vote on major issues, was close behind, with a median of 70% saying it would be a good way to run their country. Pew also found an increase in support for a system run by experts rather than elected officials, with a median of 58% backing that model.

Pew surveyed 30,861 people in 24 countries between February and May 2023. The margin of error varied by country.

Birthrate continues to fall as young people increasingly reluctant to have children due to bleak job prospects, cost of living and work culture

The number of babies born in Japan last year fell for an eighth straight year to a new low, government data has shown, and a top official says it is critical for the country to reverse the trend in the coming half-dozen years.

The 758,631 babies born in Japan in 2023 were a 5.1% decline from the previous year, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry on Tuesday. It was the lowest number of births since Japan started compiling the statistics in 1899.

The number of marriages fell by 5.9% to 489,281 couples, falling below a half million for the first time in 90 years – one of the key reasons for the declining births. Out-of-wedlock births are rare in Japan because of family values based on a paternalistic tradition.

Surveys show that many younger Japanese balk at marrying or having families, discouraged by bleak job prospects, the high cost of living that rises at a faster pace than salaries and corporate cultures that are not compatible with having both parents work. Crying babies and children playing outside are increasingly considered a nuisance, and many young parents say they often feel isolated.

Chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters Tuesday that the ongoing declining birthrate is at a “critical state.”

“The period over the next six years or so until 2030s, when the younger population will start declining rapidly, will be the last chance we may be able to reverse the trend,” he said. “There is no time to waste.”

Prime minister Fumio Kishida has called the low births “the biggest crisis Japan faces,” and put forward a package of measures that have included more support and subsidies mostly for childbirth, children and their families.

But experts say they doubt whether the government’s efforts will be effective because so far they have largely focused on people who already are married or already are planning to have children, while not adequately addressing a growing population of young people who are reluctant to go that far.

The number of births has been falling since 50 years ago, when it peaked at about 2.1 million. The decline to an annual number below 760,000 has happened faster than earlier projections predicting that would happen by 2035.

Japan’s population of more than 125 million is projected to fall by about 30% to 87 million by 2070, with four out of every 10 people at age 65 or older. A shrinking and ageing population has big implications for the economy and for national security as the country seeks to fortify its military to counter China’s increasingly assertive territorial ambitions.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Justices to consider whether former president is immune from prosecution over effort to overturn election loss to Biden

The US supreme court agreed on Wednesday to take up the unprecedented claim that Donald Trump has absolute immunity from prosecution in the criminal case over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, throwing into jeopardy whether it goes to trial before the 2024 election.

The justices set oral arguments for the week of 22 April to consider a recent ruling by a three-judge panel at the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, which categorically rejected Trump’s immunity claim in a decision earlier this month.

Trump’s criminal case will remain on hold until the supreme court ultimately rules on the matter, inserting it into the politically charged position of potentially influencing whether Trump will go to trial before the presidential election in November.

The unsigned order said the court intended to address at oral arguments “whether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office”.

In the federal 2020 election case, Trump faces a four-count indictment in Washington DC brought by the special counsel, Jack Smith, that charges him with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct the congressional certification of the election results, and violating rights.

Trump sought to have the charges dismissed last year, arguing in a 52-page filing that the conduct he was charged with fell under the so-called “outer perimeter” of his official duties, which meant he could not be prosecuted because of the broad protections afforded to the presidency.

The motion to dismiss contended that all of Trump’s attempts to reverse his 2020 election defeat detailed in the indictment, from pressuring his vice-president, Mike Pence, to stop the congressional certification of Biden’s victory to organizing fake slates of electors, were in his capacity as president and therefore protected.

At the heart of the Trump legal team’s filing was the extraordinary contention that not only was Trump entitled to absolute presidential immunity, but that the immunity applied regardless of Trump’s intent in engaging in the conduct described in the indictment.

The arguments were rejected by the presiding US district judge Tanya Chutkan, and subsequently by the three-judge panel at the DC circuit, which wrote in an unsigned but unanimous decision that they could not endorse such an interpretation of executive power.

“At bottom, former President Trump’s stance would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the President beyond the reach of all three Branches,” the opinion said. “We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter.”

Trump’s lawyers settled on advancing the immunity claim last October in large part because it is what is known as an interlocutory appeal – an appeal that can be litigated pre-trial – and one that crucially put the case on hold while it was resolved.

Putting the case on hold was important because Trump’s overarching strategy has been to seek delay, ideally even beyond the election, in the hopes that winning a second presidency could enable him to pardon himself or allow him to install a loyal attorney general who would drop the charges.

The involvement of the supreme court now means the case continues to remain frozen until the justices issue a ruling. And even if the court rules against Trump, the case may not be ready for trial until late into the summer or beyond.

The reason that Trump will not go to trial as soon as the supreme court rules is because Trump is technically entitled to the “defense preparation time” that he had remaining when he filed his first appeal to the DC circuit on 8 December 2023, which triggered the stay.

Trump has 87 days remaining from that period, calculated by finding the difference between the original 4 March trial date and 8 December. The earliest that Trump could go to trial in Washington, as a result, is by adding 87 days to the date of the supreme court’s final decision.

With oral arguments set for April, a ruling might not be handed down until May. Alternatively, in the worst case scenario for the special counsel, the supreme court could wait until the end of its current term in July, which could mean the trial might be delayed until late September at the earliest.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Ex-president’s lawyers had asked court to halt collection of rest of amount plus ban on securing new loans from New York banks

A New York appeals judge has denied Donald Trump’s request to pay just $100m of the $454m judgment for his New York fraud trial.

Trump’s lawyers had asked the appeals court to halt the collection of the rest of the amount, along with the judgment’s ban on Trump securing new loans from New York banks, until the appeal goes through.

On Wednesday, Judge Anil Singh appeared to have some sympathy for Trump, staying the ban over Trump from taking out loans from New York banks and another ban on him serving as an officer of a New York company, both for the next three years.

“The exorbitant and punitive amount of the judgment, coupled with an unlawful and unconstitutional blanket prohibition on lending transactions, would make it impossible to secure and post a complete bond,” Trump’s lawyers Clifford Robert, Alina Habba and Michael Farina wrote.

The New York attorney general’s office said the appeals court should deny Trump’s request as Trump has not said he does not have the assets to fulfil the judgment’s full amount.

“Defendants all but concede that Trump has insufficient liquid assets to satisfy the judgment; defendants would need ‘to raise capital’,” prosecutors told the court in a filing. “A prevailing plaintiff is entitled to have her award secured, and defendants have never demonstrated that Mr Trump’s liquid assets could satisfy the full amount of the judgment.”

Judge Arthur Engoron found that Trump, his company and top executives, including his sons Eric and Donald Jr, schemed for years to deceive banks and insurers by inflating his wealth on financial statements used to secure loans and make deals. Among other penalties, the judge put strict limitations on the ability of Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, to do business.

Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355m plus interest – pushing the penalty to more than $450m at the time of the ruling, with another $112,000 in interest accruing each day.

Trump filed his appeal on Monday. His lawyers are asking the appellate division of the state’s trial court to decide whether Engoron “committed errors of law and/or fact” and whether he abused his discretion or “acted in excess” of his jurisdiction.

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and filing the appeal did not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until 25 March to secure a stay – a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals.

Trump would receive an automatic stay if he were to put up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. He also had the option, which he has now exercised, to ask the appeals court to grant a stay with a bond for a lower amount.

Trump lawyers said Trump’s vast real estate assets and oversight mandated by Engoron’s ruling, including supervision of his company by an independent monitor, “would alone be sufficient to adequately secure any judgment affirmed”.

The $100m bond, they said, “would simply serve as further security”.

Trump, the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400m in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

In all, Trump has at least $543.4m in personal legal liabilities from Engoron’s ruling and two other civil court judgments in the last year.

In January, a jury ordered Trump to pay $83.3m to writer E Jean Carroll for defaming her after she accused him in 2019 of sexually assaulting her in a Manhattan department store in the 1990s. That is on top of the $5m a jury awarded Carroll in a related trial last year.

Congressional leaders work to keep government funded and pass $60bn aid package for Ukraine as far-Republicans refuse to budge

With a government shutdown looming and Ukraine desperate for Washington’s aid, the House returns to session on Wednesday to face a towering to-do list and strong objections from the Republican right flank.

Congressional leaders worked frantically to reach a deal ahead of the 1 March deadline to avert a partial government shutdown that could shutter vital services in several key departments, temporarily endangering access to federal food assistance programs and federal housing vouchers.

On Tuesday, Joe Biden summoned to the White House the top four congressional leaders – the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson; the Democratic Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer; the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell; and the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries – to discuss a funding deal and the president’s push for a wartime aid package that would allocate $60bn to Ukraine’s fight against Russia. It would also provide $14.1bn in security assistance for Israel and $9.2bn in humanitarian assistance for civilians in war zones.

Leaders of both parties expressed optimism that they would be able to avoid a government shutdown this week, although Democrats suggested another short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), would be necessary to continue their work.

“The speaker said unequivocally he wants to avoid a government shutdown,” Schumer told reporters after the meeting. “We made it clear that that means not letting any of the government appropriations bills lapse, which means you need some CRs to get that done. But we’re making good progress, and we’re hopeful we can get this done really quickly.”

On the question of providing more aid to Ukraine, Schumer described the discussion as “one of the most intense I’ve ever encountered in my many meetings in the Oval Office”. Hard-right Republicans have insisted they will not take action on Ukraine without linking the aid to stricter border policies, and Johnson reiterated that position on Tuesday.

“The first priority of the country is our border and making sure it’s secure. I believe the president can take executive authority right now, today, to change that. And I told him that again today in person,” Johnson told reporters. “It’s time for action. It is a catastrophe, and it must stop, and we will get the government funded, and we’ll keep working on that.”

The current standoff comes after hard-right Republicans, at the encouragement of Donald Trump, blocked a bipartisan border and national security package that would have addressed Ukraine and overhauled the asylum system for migrants. After killing that deal, Republicans have once again demanded stricter border measures in exchange for approving more foreign aid.

The border security demands have infuriated lawmakers who worked for months to broker a bipartisan immigration plan only to see it torpedoed by Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. Schumer warned Johnson that there was not a moment to waste on Ukraine, urging him to prioritize the nation’s security over his political party.

“We said to the speaker: get it done,” Schumer said on Tuesday. “And if you don’t do the right thing, whatever the immediate politics are, you will regret it.”

The House’s return on Wednesday follows a two-week recess that Biden denounced as “bizarre” given the urgency of approving the $95bn national security package. That bill passed the Senate in a bipartisan vote of 70 to 29, with 22 Republicans supporting the proposal, but Johnson has been reluctant to bring it to the floor for a vote. At a recent security conference in Munich, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, referenced the delay in passing the bill, warning “dictators don’t go on vacation”.

“This is one of those instances where one person can bend the course of history,” the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday on ABC’s This Week. “Speaker Johnson, if he put this bill on the floor, would produce a strong, bipartisan majority vote in favor of the aid to Ukraine.”

While the House was away, Russia captured the strategically important eastern frontline city of Avdiivka, a significant battlefield victory that arrived just days before Ukraine marked the second anniversary of the full-scale Russian invasion. Meanwhile, the death of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison sent shockwaves across western capitals earlier this month, with Biden and other world leaders laying the blame squarely on Russia’s autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin.

Zelenskiy, has been pleading with the US to replenish its weapons stock, with the country outnumbered and outgunned as the war enters a third year. In an interview with NBC this week, Zelenskiy said without American assistance “we will lose a lot of people. We will lose territories.”

Returning from a congressional visit to Ukraine last week, Schumer implored Johnson to override the objections of Trump’s far-right allies on Capitol Hill and allow a vote on the bill.

In a letter to colleagues, Schumer said Zelenskiy told him that without additional defense assistance, “Putin will win.”

“We were told in no uncertain terms that if more weaponry had been available in Avdiivka, the outcome would have been different,” he added, appealing to “pragmatic Republicans” for help prodding Johnson “to meet the moment”.

“I know our caucus recognizes that if we abandon Ukraine, the political, diplomatic, economic and military consequences will reverberate for years, not only for Ukraine and Europe, but for the American people,” he said. “The death of Russia’s brave opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, shows the danger and menace of Putin’s autocracy.”

In a statement, Johnson dismissed Schumer’s letter and said now was “not a time for petty politics”.

“House Republicans will continue to work in good faith and hope to reach an outcome as soon as possible,” he said, “even as we continue to insist that our own border security must be addressed immediately.”

Congressional leaders are simultaneously searching for a deal that would keep the federal government operating through the end of the fiscal year. But conservative policy demands on issues ranging from immigration to abortion have stalled talks.

Without a deal, appropriators may be forced to consider another temporary extension to avert a shutdown that could rattle the still-recovering economy. As of now, funding for roughly one-fifth of the federal government is set to expire on Friday. The rest of federal funding, which includes money for the Department of Homeland Security, the Pentagon and the state department, will run out a week later on 8 March.

“We are making real progress on the appropriations bills that are scheduled to lapse on 1 March, and I’m cautiously optimistic that we can do what is necessary within the next day or so to close down these bills and avoid a government shutdown,” Jeffries told reporters after the meeting at the White House on Tuesday.

“At the same time, it may be important to come to an agreement that’s bipartisan and anchored in common sense to extend the pending expiration of the eight additional bills that are scheduled to lapse on 8 March, so that good-faith, tough negotiations can continue in the absence of a government shutdown.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Multimillionaire Gary Pilnick was excoriated on the internet, especially as cereal prices have risen 28% over the last four years

The multimillionaire chief executive officer of the US food processing giant Kellogg’s has drawn scorn from some quarters after recently suggesting that families with strained finances could cope by eating “cereal for dinner”.

Gary Pilnick was speaking live on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street on 21 February when he delivered the remarks in question, which some have compared to the “let them eat cake” phrase frequently attributed without evidence to Marie Antoinette before her execution during the French Revolution.

“The cereal category has always been quite affordable, and it tends to be a great destination when consumers are under pressure,” Pilnick said amid a discussion about high grocery prices. “If you think about the cost of cereal for a family versus what they might otherwise do, that’s going to be much more affordable.”

The CNBC host Carl Quintanilla asked Pilnick – whose company’s brands include Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, Corn Pops and Rice Krispies – whether his remarks could “land the wrong way” with consumers who have been forced to spend about 26% more on groceries in general since 2020.

Pilnick doubled down, saying: “In fact, it’s landing really well right now. Cereal for dinner is something that is probably more on trend now, and we would expect [it] to continue as that consumer is under pressure.”

That message has not actually landed that well with everyone who has heard it.

One TikTok user derisively referred to a September 2023 Securities and Exchange Commission filing which showed Pilnick earned an annual base salary of $1m and more than $4m in incentives.

“This fool is making 4m bucks a year,” that user said. “Do you think he’s feeding his kids cereal for dinner?”

Another user on that social media platform reacted by saying: “What the hell kind of dystopian hellscape is this? Give the peasants cereal for dinner!”

One retorted: “Eat the rich instead"".” Various others pointed out how cereal – especially brands manufactured by Kellogg’s – isn’t especially cheap.

One person argued that a $10 family-size box of cereal along with a $3 carton of milk would cost about the same as frozen lasagne meant to feed the same amount of people for dinner.

And others challenged whether it was all that healthy to eat cereal, given how much sugar some brands contain.

Kellogg’s has been touting its “cereal for dinner” campaign since about 2022, when food prices increased by 9.9%, more than in any year since 1979, according to the US agriculture department’s economic research service.

Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows cereal prices have jumped 28% in the last four years, several media outlets have reported. And in information from its latest fiscal year, Kellogg’s raised its prices 12% as it pleads with its customers to eat cereal for dinner and “give chicken the night off”.

“Advertising to hungry people that cereal might be good for dinner is not ‘meeting people where they are’,” self-help author Marianne Williamson wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “It’s exploiting the hungry for financial gain.”

Pilnick, 59, has been Kellogg’s CEO since October, his profile on LinkedIn shows. He has worked for the Michigan-based organization for more than 23 years.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Police are investigating after employees at a Dairy Queen in Kentucky say they were forced to eat ice cream contaminated with cleaning solution, local outlet WKYT reported.

Angela Patton told the outlet her 17-year-old daughter was among the employees involved in the incident at the Dairy Queen, located in Campton, Kentucky.

""They were told by the manager that whether or not they liked chocolate ice cream, they were going to taste it today,"" Patton told WKYT.

Patton told the outlet many of the about eight employees involved in the incident were minors, and their manager had told the group that they hadn't cleaned the ice cream machine properly, so they were served the contaminated ice cream as a punishment.

Several of them, she said, experienced burning sensations while eating the ice cream and sought medical treatment, though Business Insider could not verify her claims.

""The safety of our fans and crew members is our top priority. When we received complaints, we immediately began an investigation, which is ongoing. We are reviewing our processes and covering expenses for crew members involved,"" franchise owner Steve Caudill said in a statement to Business Insider. ""The manager involved is no longer employed at our restaurant. Know that we contacted local law enforcement to assist and we are fully cooperating with their investigation.""

Wolfe County Sheriff's Office, the local authorities investigating the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular working hours.

Elijah Banks, a deputy with Wolfe County Sheriff's Office, told WKYT that little could be shared about the ongoing investigation due to the involvement of the juveniles. However, he said Wolfe County officials are in contact with the county attorney to determine the next steps.

No charges have yet been filed.

In New York, a woman was recently denied a retrial after she received a 23-year sentence for poisoning and killing her boss with a medication used for gout.

Incidents of product tampering can also result in felony charges, as in the 2019 case of a mother who allowed her young daughter to lick a tongue depressor at a medical clinic and then put it back, resulting in a felony charge that was later reduced to a misdemeanor. The woman was inspired to record a video of the incident due to an online trend of licking consumer products and putting them back for unsuspecting buyers to take home.

The trend has been around for nearly a decade. It has grown exponentially since 2015 when Ariana Grande was famously caught on camera licking a doughnut that was later sold to an unsuspecting customer — for which she faced intense backlash.

But the filthy habit has also continued into recent years, with a so-called ""sushi terrorism"" resulting in several arrests after videos went viral of pranksters in Japan licking utensils and soy sauce bottles and rubbing saliva on the conveyer belt.

February 28, 2024 — This story has been updated with a response from the Dairy Queen franchise owner.

Heritage Foundation director of the tech policy center Kara Frederick discusses Google's plan to relaunch its AI image generator tool on 'Varney & Co.'

Google is working to fix its Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) tool, CEO Sundar Pichai told employees on Tuesday, calling the images generated by the model ""biased"" and ""completely unacceptable."" 

The Alphabet-owned company paused Gemini's image generation feature last week after users on social media flagged that Gemini was creating inaccurate historical images that sometimes replaced White people with images of Black, Native American and Asian people. 

In a note to employees, Pichai said the tool's responses were offensive to users and had shown bias.

""Our teams have been working around the clock to address these issues. We're already seeing a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts ... And we'll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale,"" he said.

The company now plans to relaunch Gemini AI in the next few weeks. News website Semafor first reported the news, which was later confirmed by a Google spokesperson.

Google has issued several apologies for Gemini after critics slammed the AI for creating ""woke"" content. 

Prabhakar Raghavan, senior vice president of Google's Knowledge & Information, said Friday that the AI tool ""missed the mark"" in a blog post explaining what went wrong.

While explaining ""what happened,"" Raghavan said Gemini was built to avoid ""creating violent or sexually explicit images, or depictions of real people"" and that various prompts should provide a ""range of people"" versus images of ""one type of ethnicity.""

""However, if you prompt Gemini for images of a specific type of person — such as ‘a Black teacher in a classroom,’ or ‘a white veterinarian with a dog’ — or people in particular cultural or historical contexts, you should absolutely get a response that accurately reflects what you ask for,"" Raghavan wrote. ""So what went wrong? In short, two things. First, our tuning to ensure that Gemini showed a range of people failed to account for cases that should clearly not show a range. And second, over time, the model became way more cautious than we intended and refused to answer certain prompts entirely — wrongly interpreting some very anodyne prompts as sensitive.""

""These two things led the model to overcompensate in some cases, and be over-conservative in others, leading to images that were embarrassing and wrong,"" he continued. ""This wasn’t what we intended. We did not want Gemini to refuse to create images of any particular group. And we did not want it to create inaccurate historical — or any other — images.""

Raghavan said Gemini's image generation feature will go through ""extensive testing"" before it is back online.

When Google released its generative AI chatbot Bard a year ago, the company shared inaccurate information about pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system in a promotional video, causing shares to slide as much as 9%.

Bard was rebranded as Gemini earlier this month and Google has introduced three versions of the product at different subscription tiers: Gemini Ultra, the largest and most capable of highly complex tasks; Gemini Pro, best for scaling across a wide range of tasks; and Gemini Nano, the most efficient for on-device tasks.

Lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried, the former head of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, have requested a sentence of just five to six years in prison in the wake of his conviction last year on seven counts of fraud.

U.S. probation officials have recommended a sentence of 100 years for Bankman-Fried's role in orchestrating what prosecutors described as an elaborate, multibillion-dollar fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced March 28. 

In a 98-page memo filed Tuesday, Bankman-Fried's lawyers portray him as suffering from an array of neurological and personality issues that could not be overcome, turning him into a ""tragic"" figure.

""Sam presents at times as a paradox,"" the lawyers write. ""Not because he is deliberately deceiving or conniving, but rather because that is how he is 'wired' as a human. He has an exceptional IQ, but difficulty with conventional styles of communication, especially around emotion.""

They add that those who know Bankman-Fried know he is ""selfless, altruistic, and cares about those less fortunate.""

""Well before ... FTX ever existed, Sam committed his life to philanthropy, pledging to earn money and give it away, with the goal of 'helping the world’s poorest people,'"" the lawyers write, citing another statement made by a Bankman-Fried character witness.

Bankman-Fried was not motivated by greed or material concerns, the lawyers write — a notion seemingly belied by the lavish style he and his colleagues enjoyed in the Bahamas while they ran FTX, which included living in a $35 million penthouse.

The lawyers further allege that the loss to FTX customers was ultimately zero — and indeed, representatives for the bankruptcy estate of FTX said this month that they expect to fully repay customers and creditors with legitimate claims.

Bankman-Fried is being held at a detention facility in New York City. Citing the statement of a fellow inmate, the lawyers say Bankman-Fried's neurodiversity and lack of physical stature, along with the high-profile nature of his crimes, may put him at risk of physical harm in prison.

""Sam being the 'least physically intimidating person' … has and will lead to him being frequently targeted for hazing, harassment, and assault more so than the average inmate,"" the lawyers write.

Prosecutors have until March 15 to respond to the memo.

EL SEGUNDO, CALIF. — A rule of thumb in business is if a loss incurred by a company is nearly as high as its annual sales — it’s not great.

Beyond Meat, Inc. suffered a loss of $338.1 million during fiscal 2023 on sales of $343.4 million. Much of the loss stems from impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter as management tries to right size the business for the future. The fiscal 2023 results follow fiscal 2022, when the company incurred a loss of $366.1 million on sales of $419 million.

During the fourth quarter, Beyond Meat incurred a loss of $155.1 million, significantly higher than the loss of $66.9 million during the year before. Quarterly sales fell to $73.7 million from $80 million the year prior.

Some of the non-cash charges taken during the fourth quarter related to the cost of goods sold and excess and obsolete inventory, operating expenses related to fixed assets, and a discontinuing of some product lines, most notably the jerky product developed and distributed in partnership with PepsiCo, Inc., Purchase, NY.

“These refinements of our focus and resources (will) be put against our latest product platform innovation Beyond IV and other SKUs, which we believe have higher profitable growth potential here in the US and are consistent with my intention to focus more resources against key markets and customers in Europe,” said Ethan Brown, president and chief executive officer, during a Feb. 27 conference call with securities analysts to discuss the company’s results.

Additional changes being made by the company include shrinking its manufacturing footprint from working with 13 contract manufacturers to one and raising prices in the year ahead.

“The broad pricing programs we put in place over the last 18 months simply didn't accomplish the goal of crossing from early adopters into the mainstream,” Brown said. “In retrospect, the noise and swirl surrounding the category reached decibels that were perhaps sufficient to ground out pricing and other messages.”

Brown added that the price increases are part of an effort to reset the business from a focus of more growth at all costs to one that is focused on sustainability and profitability.

In the United States, Beyond Meat’s sales fell 32% to $205.9 million from $304 million the year before. International sales rose 19.7% to $137.5 million from $114.9 million.

In the United States, retail and foodservice volumes fell 26% and 30%, respectively, while international retail and foodservice volumes rose 3.5% and 60%, respectively.

Lubi Kutua, chief financial officer, said during the call that the reality is Beyond Meat’s US retail business continues to be challenged. Those challenges have prompted the company to consider international opportunities.

“…If you look at our international business relative to (the) US, it does skew more toward foodservice and … we’ve built a pretty meaningful business…,” he said.

For fiscal 2024, Beyond Meat is guiding sales to be in a range between $315 million and $345 million. Net sales for the first quarter are expected to be between $70 million and $75 million, according to the company.

The show took place Jan. 21-23 in Las Vegas.

As impressive as they seem, the latest computer brains usually fail at tasks that require generalizing concepts — tasks that come easily to humans.

Apart from the northward advance of killer bees in the 1980s, nothing has struck as much fear into the hearts of headline writers as the ascent of artificial intelligence.

Ever since the computer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, humans have faced the prospect that their supremacy over machines is merely temporary. Back then, though, it was easy to show that AI failed miserably in many realms of human expertise, from diagnosing disease to transcribing speech.

But then about a decade ago or so, computer brains — known as neural networks — received an IQ boost from a new approach called deep learning. Suddenly computers approached human ability at identifying images, reading signs and enhancing photographs — not to mention converting speech to text as well as most typists.

Those abilities had their limits. For one thing, even apparently successful deep learning neural networks were easy to trick. A few small stickers strategically placed on a stop sign made an AI computer think the sign said “Speed Limit 80,” for example. And those smart computers needed to be extensively trained on a task by viewing numerous examples of what they should be looking for. So deep learning produced excellent results for narrowly focused jobs but couldn’t adapt that expertise very well to other arenas. You would not (or shouldn’t) have hired it to write a magazine column for you, for instance.

But AI’s latest incarnations have begun to threaten job security not only for writers but also a lot of other professionals.

“Now we’re in a new era of AI,” says computer scientist Melanie Mitchell, an artificial intelligence expert at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. “We’re beyond the deep learning revolution of the 2010s, and we’re now in the era of generative AI of the 2020s.”

Generative AI systems can produce things that had long seemed safely within the province of human creative ability. AI systems can now answer questions with seemingly human linguistic skill and knowledge, write poems and articles and legal briefs, produce publication quality artwork, and even create videos on demand of all sorts of things you might want to describe.

Many of these abilities stem from the development of large language models, abbreviated as LLMs, such as ChatGPT and other similar models. They are large because they are trained on huge amounts of data — essentially, everything on the internet, including digitized copies of countless printed books. Large can also refer to the large number of different kinds of things they can “learn” in their reading — not just words but also word stems, phrases, symbols and mathematical equations.

By identifying patterns in how such linguistic molecules are combined, LLMs can predict in what order words should be assembled to compose sentences or respond to a query. Basically, an LLM calculates probabilities of what word should follow another, something critics have derided as “autocorrect on steroids.”

Even so, LLMs have displayed remarkable abilities — such as composing texts in the style of any given author, solving riddles and deciphering from context whether “bill” refers to an invoice, proposed legislation or a duck.

“These things seem really smart,” Mitchell said this month in Denver at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

LLMs’ arrival has induced a techworld version of mass hysteria among some experts in the field who are concerned that run amok, LLMs could raise human unemployment, destroy civilization and put magazine columnists out of business. Yet other experts argue that such fears are overblown, at least for now.

At the heart of the debate is whether LLMs actually understand what they are saying and doing, rather than just seeming to. Some researchers have suggested that LLMs do understand, can reason like people (big deal) or even attain a form of consciousness. But Mitchell and others insist that LLMs do not (yet) really understand the world (at least not in any sort of sense that corresponds to human understanding).

“What’s really remarkable about people, I think, is that we can abstract our concepts to new situations via analogy and metaphor.”

In a new paper posted online at arXiv.org, Mitchell and coauthor Martha Lewis of the University of Bristol in England show that LLMs still do not match humans in the ability to adapt a skill to new circumstances. Consider this letter-string problem: You start with abcd and the next string is abce. If you start with ijkl, what string should come next?

Humans almost always say the second string should end with m. And so do LLMs. They have, after all, been well trained on the English alphabet.

But suppose you pose the problem with a different “counterfactual” alphabet, perhaps the same letters in a different order, such as a u c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t b v w x y z. Or use symbols instead of letters. Humans are still very good at solving letter-string problems. But LLMs usually fail. They are not able to generalize the concepts used on an alphabet they know to another alphabet.

“While humans exhibit high performance on both the original and counterfactual problems, the performance of all GPT models we tested degrades on the counterfactual versions,” Mitchell and Lewis report in their paper.

Other similar tasks also show that LLMs do not possess the ability to perform accurately in situations not encountered in their training. And therefore, Mitchell insists, they do not exhibit what humans would regard as “understanding” of the world.

“Being reliable and doing the right thing in a new situation is, in my mind, the core of what understanding actually means,” Mitchell said at the AAAS meeting.

Human understanding, she says, is based on “concepts” — basically mental models of things like categories, situations and events. Concepts allow people to infer cause and effect and to predict the probable results of different actions — even in circumstances not previously encountered.

“What’s really remarkable about people, I think, is that we can abstract our concepts to new situations via analogy and metaphor,” Mitchell said.

She does not deny that AI might someday reach a similar level of intelligent understanding. But machine understanding may turn out to be different from human understanding. Nobody knows what sort of technology might achieve that understanding and what the nature of such understanding might be.

If it does turn out to be anything like human understanding, it will probably not be based on LLMs.

After all, LLMs learn in the opposite direction from humans. LLMs start out learning language and attempt to abstract concepts. Human babies learn concepts first, and only later acquire the language to describe them.

So LLMs are doing it backward. In other words, perhaps reading the internet might not be the correct strategy for acquiring intelligence, artificial or otherwise.

Plant-derived compounds offer enticing skincare benefits, but their stability in product formulations is not guaranteed. Some decompose when exposed to sunlight or heat, limiting their effectiveness as active ingredients in sunscreens and cosmetics.

To overcome this issue, researchers have devised a strategy which they tested on hydroxy-α-sanshool, a natural product derived from Zanthoxylum bungeanum — a plant species found in Asia. Commonly referred to as sanshool, its strong, peppery flavor lends itself to cooking, and its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects have established it as a traditional herbal medicine. 

Sanshool also absorbs UV light, making it a promising sunscreen ingredient. However, the compound contains long-chain unsaturated fatty acids in its chemical structure, which make it susceptible to degradation and limit its application in skincare. 



To bolster sanshool, the research team enlisted the help of molecules called polyphenols, which are antioxidants found in plants. “The main role of polyphenols is to act as a stabilizer, [providing] multiple interactions to stabilize the antioxidative and anti-ultraviolet properties of sanshool for improved application potential,” explained Zhipeng Gu, a professor at Sichuan University’s College of Polymer Science and Engineering.  

“Nanoparticles were formed by the molecular aggregate derived from [these] chemical and physical interactions,“ Gu continued. “The nanoparticles were synthesized via supramolecular self-assembly by adding sanshool to aqueous solutions of polyphenols. The selected polyphenols included epigallocatechin gallate [which is abundant in green tea], tea polyphenol, and grapeseed polyphenol, which are easily obtained in daily life.”

To screen the sun protection performance of the polyphenol–sanshool nanoparticles, the researchers tested their ability to absorb UV radiation. When irradiated with simulated sunlight for two hours, the nanoparticles based on epigallocatechin gallate and tea polyphenols retained around 90% of their UV-absorbance ability — much better than naked sanshool, which retained only 50%. Even after five days, the nanoparticle solution offered over 80% UV protection.

The researchers also assessed the polyphenol–sanshool nanoparticles’ antioxidative power — how well they could scavenge cell-damaging free radicals, which is essential for sun protection. When they left the nanoparticles outdoors for up to five days, they found that free radicals were effectively scavenged over the entire period. Sanshool, on the other hand, lost this ability over time.



Although these initials results were promising, the biocompatibility of the polyphenol–sanshool nanoparticles with actual human skin also needed to be assessed. To do this, Gu and his team cultured human skin cells and treated them with varying concentrations of the polyphenol–sanshool nanoparticles. 

To measure the cell viability, they used a cell counting kit that correlates the production of a dye called formazan with the amount of living cells in the culture. According to the results, the skin cells had a viability of over 80% when the nanoparticles were applied at optimal concentrations, while the viability of the cells treated with naked sanshool was lower.     

“The selected polyphenols have more than one catechol in their molecular structures, which could bind modified sanshool molecules through borate esterification interactions,“ Gu elaborated. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, a technique used to determine the composition of a substance, confirmed the high content of sanshool in the nanoparticles.

When exposed to UV radiation, the cells treated with the epigallocatechin gallate-based nanoparticles fared the best in terms of UV protection and free radical damage. The researchers partially attributed this to the higher purity of epigallocatechin gallate, as the tea and grapeseed polyphenols contain mixed phenolic building blocks. 

The effectiveness of the polyphenol–sanshool nanoparticles was also evident in a mouse model. When exposed to UV radiation, skin thickens and collagen fibers are destroyed. Although naked sanshool offered some protection to UVB radiation, skin treated with the polyphenol–sanshool nanoparticles was clearly in better condition, particularly the skin treated with the epigallocatechin gallate-based nanoparticles.

The polyphenol–sanshool nanoparticles and their preparation process currently have a few drawbacks. For one, Zanthoxylum species are known for their potent odor, which might deter consumers. “The yields of the polyphenol–sanshool nanoparticles are [also] still unsatisfactory, and the unfriendly smell presents a significant challenge in product formulations,” Gu revealed.

“We are currently exploring optimized strategies to meet the demands of industrial production, and introducing more interactions to control the smell of sanshool,” he concluded.

					The spindly lunar lander will lose power and shut down February 28, but may reawaken later

Odysseus has exceeded engineers’ expectations during its odyssey on the moon. NASA confirmed that the spindly solar-powered robotic lander, built and operated by the Houston-based private U.S. company Intuitive Machines, has been alive and collecting data since it touched down, and toppled over, on the lunar surface on February 22.

“What a magnificent job that lander did,” said Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus during a NASA news briefing on February 28. “So much data and information and science. It’s just an incredible testament to how robust that little spacecraft is, so we’re really happy with that.”

The spacecraft, which carried payloads from universities, industry and NASA, was the first American spacecraft to perform a soft landing on the moon in more than 50 years (SN: 2/22/24). Odysseus, or Odie as it’s nicknamed, is slowly running out of power, and scientists expect to put it into sleep mode February 28, after roughly six days on the lunar surface. They will try to reawaken Odie in about three weeks when the sun hits the lander’s solar panels again.

Much like its namesake, the epic hero from the Greek classic The Odyssey, the spacecraft Odysseus underwent trials and tribulations in its journey. Its autonomous landing system’s laser range finder malfunctioned, causing engineers to scramble for a solution that involved two extra hours in orbit and reconfiguring a couple backup lasers on a NASA payload. After a nail-biting descent, Odysseus’s landing gear caught on the sloped ground or possibly a crevice, breaking the gear and sending the spacecraft gently tipping over on its side.

Despite the mishap, “our navigation system landed us with precision and the shock absorbers took the load,” Altemus said. “The landing gear did what it was supposed to do and protect the lander as it landed on the surface.”

The spacecraft was originally supposed to operate for about a week, though during a Feb. 23 briefing with reporters mission director Tim Crain, chief technology officer of Intuitive Machines, said that under the best case scenario it might last for nine to 10 days. 

Instead, after six days on the moon, the lander was expected to run out of power. “We’re going to tuck Odie in for the cold night of the moon,” Crain said during the Feb. 28 briefing. “We are going to leave the computers and the power system in a place where we can wake it up … once it gets power again.”

The main limiting factor to whether Odysseus comes back online will be its batteries; their chemistry-based technology will struggle with the extreme temperature plunge of lunar night. “We’re confident that when the sun comes back up, the solar arrays will energize and they’ll send power,” said Crain. “The real question is, ‘Are the batteries there to receive that power and pass it on?’”

Odysseus, which stands about 4 meters tall and 1.5 meters wide, came down at a site roughly 300 kilometers away from the lunar south pole on the slope of a crater called Malapert A. Astronauts with NASA’s crewed Artemis program may land at a similar site or nearby in the coming decades (SN: 12/1/22).

Some of the spacecraft’s various payloads have had their own little adventures during the mission. For instance, a camera built by students at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla., was supposed to detach during descent and take pictures as the spacecraft touched down. Due to the problems with landing, the camera, known as EagleCam, was not deployed, but Crain said he and others are working on getting it ready for ejection.

But the International Lunar Observatory Association, a private company based in Kamuela, Hawaii, has received images from a telescope it sent on Odysseus named ILO‐X. The instrument is a precursor to a larger telescope the company hopes to deploy at Malapert A in the future and is intended to conduct scientific observations of the Milky Way from the moon. The association confirmed that ILO-X was able to snap images during the mission, which show portions of the lunar landscape, the sun and the Odysseus lander. The images are expected to be released February 29.

All of the NASA instruments that Odysseus carried have been transmitting useful data, said Sue Lederer, project scientist for NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Engineers were able to troubleshoot initial problems with the spacecraft’s antenna that prevented full transmission, and have since received a flood of data.

“We went from basically a cocktail straw of data coming back to a boba-tea-sized straw of data,” Lederer said. “We’ve gotten over 15 megabytes of data.” This will be useful for understanding the spacecraft’s touchdown sequence as well as informing future missions to the moon and Mars, she said.

A new experimental technique to measure extremely weak gravitational forces with remarkable precision has recently emerged. The scientists behind the development believe it could one day help probe quantum effects in gravity– a holy grail in modern theoretical physics.

“By understanding quantum gravity, we could solve some of the mysteries of our Universe — like how it began, what happens inside black holes, or uniting all forces into one big theory,” Tim Fuchs, a physicist at Leiden University and one of the authors of the study, explained in a press release.



Although gravity is perhaps one of the most easily observed of all the fundamental forces, it has remained resistant to “quantization”, which is the incorporation of quantum theory that occurs on microscopic scales.

Quantum gravitational effects are too miniscule to be observed or be of relevance in most interactions of large bodies, such as stars and planets. However, they are expected to become “visible” when matter reaches intense densities and temperatures, orders of magnitude higher than anything we can achieve in a lab.

Since, the method proposed by the authors of the study emerges as a pivotal avenue for experimental exploration, potentially leading to a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity — an imperative for unraveling the Universe’s deepest mysteries.

These extreme conditions make quantum gravity very difficult to study experimentally. The energies of particles in accelerators are too low for quantum-gravitational effects to manifest in their collisions, and astronomical observations have also not yet provided any information about these effects.

But in their recent study, Fuchs and his colleagues propose a sensitive experiment that will allow them to delve into how slight deviations in the behavior of gravitating bodies might deviate from predictions made by Einstein’s theory of relativity, which describe gravity in classical terms. These deviations from classical behavior might encode previously unseen quantum effects in gravitational interactions.

“For a century, scientists have tried and failed to understand how gravity and quantum mechanics work together,” said Fuchs. “Now we have successfully measured gravitational signals at the smallest mass ever recorded, it means we are one step closer to finally realizing how it works in tandem.”



In their study, the authors used a superconducting magnetic trap to study the subtle attraction between masses used to create a sort of artificial gravitational field and a test mass used as a probe. 

The 0.43 milligram test mass is a neodymium-iron-boron magnet that levitated over a superconductor made of tantalum. This lack of physical support makes the test mass extremely sensitive to any external influence.

The gravitational field under study was generated by three 2.45 kg masses, evenly spaced on a wheel, which was placed on the side of the magnet. The wheel’s rotation changes their distance to the test mass, altering the magnitude of the gravitational attraction between them.

To suppress all mechanical and thermal noise, the experimental apparatus was suspended on a multi-stage spring system and chilled to temperatures near  absolute zero (-273.15 degrees Celsius).

In their experiment, the team were able to measure a minute displacement of the test mass, which allowed them to determine tiny changes  in the gravitational attraction between the source masses and the test mass. This was on the order of tens of attoNewtons — 18 orders of magnitude lower compared to Earth’s gravitational pull on a 1 kg mass.

While initial measurements didn’t reveal deviations from classical gravitational theory, the researchers anticipate that by reducing noise, as well as the  source mass to the scale of the test mass,  they will be able to probe the variations in the gravitational field so small that quantum effects in gravity will become noticeable. “From here we will start scaling the source down using this technique until we reach the quantum world on both sides,” Fuchs said.

“We are pushing the boundaries of science that could lead to new discoveries about gravity and the quantum world,” concluded Hendrik Ulbricht, a professor of physics at Hendrik Ulbricht and a coauthor of the study. 

“Our new technique that uses extremely cold temperatures and devices to isolate vibration of the particle will likely prove the way forward for measuring quantum gravity,” he continued. “Unraveling these mysteries will help us unlock more secrets about the Universe’s very fabric, from the tiniest particles to the grandest cosmic structures.”

					Not having a tail is one way apes differ from monkeys				

A new study suggests that apes, including chimpanzees and humans, lack tails because a genetic parasite altered a gene important for tail development when the group diverged from other primates around 25 million years ago.

A genetic parasite may have robbed humans and other apes of their tails.

Around 25 million years ago, this parasite, a small stretch of repetitive DNA called an Alu element, ended up in a gene important for tail development, researchers report in the Feb. 29 Nature. The single insertion altered the gene Tbxt in a way that seems to have sparked one of the defining differences between monkeys and apes: Monkeys have tails, apes don’t.

“It was like lightning struck once,” says Jef Boeke, a geneticist at New York University Langone Health, and ape behinds ultimately became bare.

The genetic tweak may also give insight into why some babies are born with spinal cord defects such as spina bifida, when the tube that holds the cord doesn’t close all the way (SN: 12/6/16). 

Alu elements are part of a group of genetic parasites known as transposons or jumping genes that can hop across genetic instruction books, inserting themselves into their hosts’ DNA (SN: 5/16/17). Sometimes, when the gene slips itself into a piece of DNA that is passed down to offspring, these insertions become permanent parts of our genetic code.  

Transposons, including more than 1 million Alu elements, are found throughout our genome, says geneticist and systems biologist Bo Xia of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Researchers once thought of transposons as genetic garbage, but some have central roles in evolution. Without transposons, the placenta, immune system and insulation around nerve fibers may not exist (SN: 2/16/24).

And humans might still have tails.

To find out how apes lost their tails, Xia, then at NYU Langone Health, Boeke and colleagues analyzed 140 genes involved in vertebrate tail development. The team found that in monkeys, including baboons and rhesus macaques, the Tbxt gene was missing a chunk of DNA that’s found in humans, chimpanzees and other apes. It was a “eureka moment,” Boeke says. The insertion may have appeared around the time apes diverged from African and Asian monkeys, around 25 million years ago.

But the missing chunk was in a part of the gene called an intron, a bit of genetic material that isn’t made into proteins. “So why would that even matter?” he asks. A close look at the gene’s structure provided a plausible explanation: The missing bit tweaked Tbxt so that the gene makes a different form of the protein in apes than in monkeys.

Experiments in mice seemed to confirm the hypothesis. Mice, like monkeys, make normal versions of the Tbxt protein and have full-length tails. But when genetically engineered to make shortened versions of the Tbxt protein like apes do, the mice had shorter tails or none at all. Some mice also had spinal cord defects similar to spinal bifida, suggesting that there may be drawbacks to tail loss.

Other genes may also be involved in tail loss. Many more Alu elements are scattered among human introns that could have yet-to-be-known effects on other aspects of human evolution, Boeke and Xia say.

The new findings do begin to unravel how apes lost their tails, says Gabrielle Russo, a biological anthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York. But why it happened, she says, is a much harder question to answer. Research from the early 1900s linked tail loss to muscle changes that helped human bodies move upright, but shifts in posture, as well as learning to walk on two feet, didn’t happen until millions of years later (SN: 9/15/21; SN: 4/14/21). So, it’s unlikely the new findings will shed light on these human traits, Russo says.

A natural next step, Russo says, is exploring whether the genetic underpinnings of tail loss in apes also happened in other mammals with shortened tails or none at all such as koalas, capybaras and bears.

Abby Cima/The Badger Herald

The University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health recently expanded its Oregon Child Absenteeism Due to Respiratory Disease Study, using air sampling and complementary methods to track the prevalence of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in the Oregon, Wisconsin School District.

ORCHARDS research program manager Shari Barlow said the opportunity to test air sampling arose from connections to the Oregon School District. UW professor in the department of pathology and laboratory science Shelby O’Connor introduced the use of air sampling to test its effectiveness by comparing its results to an additional three methods, which included 

, school absences and PCR tests.

The air samplers were placed in communal gathering spaces — like cafeterias — where they picked up microscopic viruses and viral particles by taking up air through passive diffusion into the machine, forcing the air through a solution that helps particles stick to the sampler cartridge.

These cartridges were collected and replaced twice a week to be analyzed via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions to detect the presence of viral genetic material.

Viruses replicate using RNA, which hold genetic instructions for building the proteins that make up the physical virus. RT-PCR creates small, complementary strands of DNA called primers that can attach to the viral RNA. The RNA are placed in a thermocycler, which creates an alternating environment of warm and hot cycles that prompt the replication activity of DNA-building proteins called DNA polymerases. This process generates the binding of complementary viral RNA strands to be replicated again and again to produce a significant amount of viral DNA.

Large quantities of DNA make the viral DNA detectable to scientific instruments, so scientists can determine if viral DNA is present, indicating a positive result. The sites chosen for complementary primers have a very low chance of mutating when the virus does, so the process does not decrease in accuracy as the virus evolves, according to O’Connor.

Air sampling not only proved to be an effective method at determining the presence of viruses when compared with the other three methods, but also held a few advantages over them.

“The first [advantage] is that there is one sampler per school and antigen-testing every two days, so cost-wise, it’s a lot less…you can get a lot more information about a lot more people for a lot less money,” O’Connor said.

O’Connor said the lower cost means if schools have to use one method to monitor viruses, air sampling could be viable. Testing students also requires getting consent from students and parents, whereas the air samplers are a non-invasive measure. Antigen tests were performed on consenting students in their schools, where PCR tests were only administered to children who had opted-in to testing at home when they got sick.

But the air sampler also had some drawbacks compared to the other methods. Barlow said the air sampling was not specific to an individual, showing only that someone in the area was sick.

Because of this limitation, Barlow said air sampling could instead be used to determine when to implement transmission-mitigation measures, like masking and social distancing.

Study reveals positive relationship between art representation, science understandingIn a recently published study on the effects of visual art on emotions, interest and social media engagement, assistant professor Read…

“[Another] challenge of the air sampler is that the results are delayed,” O’Connor said. “With a rapid antigen test you get your negative or positive [result]. Unfortunately with the air sampler we have to gather and get our results, which can take about a week.”

Testing samples takes large amounts of time due to the preparation needed for drawing up multiple solutions and running them through a thermocycler that oscillates between four different temperatures for a number of cycles. O’Connor said researchers are working to reduce the time-lag of air sampler testing and collecting so they can be used in other locations where more instantaneous feedback is needed.

A new method that reduces the amount of prep work for the samples so they can immediately be placed in the cycler would cut down on the time for processing, especially when paired with a cycler able to produce the testing sample in only thirty minutes.

Another downside of air sampling is the viral load — how much virus was in the air — is not discernible due to how the tests for the viruses afterwards are conducted. This is an issue for COVID-19 specifically, because people infected with the virus often shed viral particles long after they stop being contagious.

According to O’Connor, the amount of particles were not detectable by antigen tests, but the sensitive PCR tests administered to the air samples would detect the virus. This reasoning might also explain why there were no detections by rapid antigen testing after winter break in the study, but the air samplers continued to detect COVID-19.

Overall, the study found air sampling to be correlated with other methods of detection, which could help it towards a wider implementation for disease monitoring. According to Barlow, air sampling is already being used in clinics and long-term care facilities around Madison.

O’Connor believes it could be useful in monitoring where viruses are coming from and where they are being spread. But until there is a renewed interest in public health, it is unlikely to see more widespread use.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged on Wednesday to break above $60,000, putting it within striking distance of its all-time high as enthusiasm for the world’s largest cryptocurrency reached a frenzy last seen during a 2021 boom.

The digital asset climbed as high as $63,900, touching its highest intraday point since November 2021, before dropping back to the $60,000 level amid reports that some users of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) began showing a $0 balance in their accounts.

Coinbase first said on its website that ""we are aware that some users may see a zero balance across their Coinbase accounts and may experience errors in buying or selling"" but that ""your assets are safe.""

A second update said ""we’re beginning to see improvement in customer trading. Due to increased traffic, some customers may still see errors in login, sends, receives and with some payment methods."" A third update offered the assurance that ""we are starting to see Coinbase.com activity normalizing.""

Its CEO Brian Armstrong also tried to calm customers Wednesday. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, he first said that ""we are dealing with a LARGE surge of traffic — apologies for any issues you encounter. The team is working to remediate.""

Later in the day he said ""apps are now recovering"" and wrote that the surge in traffic had exceeded what the company had ""load tested.""

Apps are now recovering.We had modeled a ~10x surge in traffic and load tested it. This exceeded that number.It's expensive to keep services over-provisioned, but we'll need to keep working on auto-scaling solutions, and killing any remaining bottlenecks. Thank you for… https://t.co/JXVppV57AF

Before prices pulled back amid the Coinbase snafu, the rally had been pushing closer to bitcoin's all-time mark of $68,789. That apex came in November 2021, six months before a spectacular crash in 2022.

""Ultimately, what we're seeing is crypto is kind of rising from the ashes of the 2022 market,"" said Ryan Rasmussen, a senior crypto research analyst for Bitwise Asset Management.

Bitcoin is riding a wave of excitement sparked by a series of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that started trading in January. Those funds gave everyday investors widespread exposure to the digital asset, triggering predictions of a new bull run.

""Our assumption is that the price of bitcoin is going to achieve $125,000 by the end of 2025,"" Benchmark's Mark Palmer added on Yahoo Finance Live.

Investors are bidding other cryptocurrencies and related stocks higher too. Year to date, the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), has outperformed bitcoin by more than 4% while the total market value for all crypto assets is up roughly 34% to $2.22 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.

One sign of surging enthusiasm for bitcoin is the trading activity in the bitcoin ETFs that launched in January. They have logged more than $6.7 billion in net flows as of Wednesday, according to data collected by London-based fund Farside Investors.

So far this quarter, bitcoin trading volume has surpassed levels seen for the same period in every quarter of 2023.

That activity has been a boon to major crypto trading venues, including Coinbase and Robinhood (HOOD).

But the surge in trading also became a liability for Coinbase Wednesday as some of its users began reporting that their account balances showed $0.

Coinbase's stock dropped in intraday trading as it provided updates about its efforts to resolve the issue and it closed roughly flat for the day.

We are aware that some users may see a zero balance across their Coinbase accounts & may experience errors in buying or selling. Our team is investigating this & will provide an update shortly. Your assets are safe.You can track this incident at https://t.co/a3pl4WiDhZ

— Coinbase Support (@CoinbaseSupport) February 28, 2024

Other bitcoin-related stocks are also riding higher. Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital (MARA) and bitcoin holder MicroStrategy (MSTR) have risen 35% and 40%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. MicroStrategy announced Monday morning that it acquired an additional 3,000 BTC, bringing its total investment to 193,000 BTC, which was valued at over $11.8 billion as of Wednesday.

Derivatives traders are also now piling into the bitcoin rally, according to Cumberland Labs analyst Christopher Newhouse.

There are roughly $25 billion of open contracts in the bitcoin futures market, according to crypto derivatives data provider Coinglass. That’s a new high for outstanding bitcoin futures bets, surpassing a mark last set in April 2021.

""In the options market, the narrative is clear,"" Newhouse added. ""People are bullish.""

The Ethereum blockchain has seen significant upgrades in recent times, enhancing its scalability, efficiency, and security. These improvements address the blockchain trilemma — the challenge of balancing security, decentralization and scalability. These ongoing enhancements are crucial for improving network performance while keeping costs low.

The upcoming Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (“Dencun”) hard fork upgrade is set to be deployed on the mainnet on March 13. This upgrade will prioritize scalability, efficiency and security through various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), notably EIP-4844 for proto-danksharding. This proposal aims to optimize gas fees and enhance network scalability.

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.

The Dencun upgrade marks the beginning of ""The Surge"" era in Ethereum's roadmap, paving the way for achieving mass scalability through layer-two rollups. These rollups will make Ethereum more accessible and user-friendly, driving adoption and utility across various sectors, including DeFi 2.0.

The Benefits of Layer-2 Rollups

Layer-2 rollups enhance Ethereum's scalability and efficiency by processing transactions off-chain while preserving the security assurances of the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer-1). They have the following characteristics:

Significance of EIP-4844 for Proto-Danksharding

EIP-4844, or Proto-Danksharding, aims to significantly enhance the network's scalability by introducing temporary data blobs attached to blocks. This innovation reduces processing costs and increases throughput by:

Trading Outlook around the Cancun-Deneb Upgrade

Ethereum's network transitioned from Proof-of-Stake to Proof-of-Work in 2022 (the “Merge”), with ether becoming a deflationary asset as a result. Currently, more than 25% of Ethereum's total supply is locked in staking platforms, significantly reducing the available supply for trading or investing. This shock coincides with a burning mechanism reducing ETH supply by 0.21% per year.

Dencun is expected to act as a positive catalyst for ETH. Ether holders have significantly reduced their exposure to exchanges by transferring more than $1.3 billion worth of ETH into private wallets. Recent data from Bloomberg shows the ETH/BTC spot ratio retracting to 0.5, reminiscent of post-Luna/Terra levels in 2022.

This presents a reasonable entry point for Ethereum enthusiasts. Moreover, there has been a surge in short-term call buying for ETH, with traders anticipating a move towards $4,000 by the end of March. Traders also favor buying March 2024 calls and selling April 2024 calendar strategies. Traders' bullish sentiment is evident in the market, with approximately $2.5 billion worth of ETH calls and $1 billion worth of ETH puts in notional value.

ETH/BTC Cross

As we look ahead, in addition to ether, other high beta names in Layer 2 are also poised to benefit from the Dencun upgrade. Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), which bundle transactions before posting them back to the main chain, are expected to reap significant advantages from the introduction of data blobs, for instance.

Ethereum (ETH) has seen its price rise by 11% in the past week, driven primarily by buying pressure in the United States, according to data from CryptoQuant, a firm that tracks activity on cryptocurrency exchanges.

The data reveals a significant increase in demand for ETH from Coinbase, a US-regulated exchange. This surge is reflected in the ""Coinbase premium,"" which measures the price difference between ETH/USD pairs on Coinbase and Binance, a popular global exchange.

The rising Coinbase premium suggests that the upward trend for Ethereum may continue in the coming weeks. This indicator previously signaled price surges in the past, and its current rise hints at potential further growth.

The U.S. buying spree on Coinbase could be attributed to two factors. Firstly, experienced traders have been accumulating ETH since January, suggesting confidence in the asset's long-term potential. Secondly, anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the U.S. might be fueling investor interest. As of now, several major investment firms have filed applications for launching such ETFs.

While the prospect of an ETF could lead to sustained growth for Ethereum, some traders believe it might not trigger explosive price increases. Currently, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, and an ETF could potentially attract more institutional investors, leading to a steadier growth pattern rather than sudden spikes.

The strong interest in Chinese social media of bitcoin prices’ ascent reflects how a community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts on the mainland continues to thrive, despite Beijing’s rigid stance against all crypto-related activities.

Investing in cryptocurrencies has recently become more attractive to some people on the mainland, as the country’s stock market continues to plummet amid its economic woes, according to a Reuters report in January.

Cryptocurrency trading via a number of major exchanges has also remained active in mainland China, as traders employ a range of workarounds to skirt loosely implemented restrictions.

Still, the Chinese government has ramped up its scrutiny of all activities related to cryptocurrencies over the years, citing risks to financial stability.

In research firm Chainalysis’ ranking of cryptocurrency adoption in 20 major countries, mainland China took the No 11 spot last year after placing tenth in 2022.

While mainland China’s ranking in terms of trading volume on centralised crypto exchanges dropped to the No 10 spot last year after placing second in 2022, Chainalysis said the country ranked 13th in peer-to-peer trading volume last year, up from No 144 in 2022.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}"

Eric Poliner believes in digital currency as an alternative to cash and is banking on others feeling the same, too.

“We’re still waiting for that random customer to walk in and say, ‘Do you take bitcoin?’ I’m doing what I can to see that happen,” said Poliner, whose team of technology specialists helped to set up a groundbreaking move in the world of digital currency at Chadd’s Bistro in Shelby Township.

The establishment was a takeout business but this month owner Chad Elliot opened a restaurant down the street that not only features his popular selection of original sandwiches but offers patrons a menu of ways for cashing out.

Credit card, cash, Bitcoin and even gold backs are accepted by the cashiers who have no problem navigating the program Poliner’s MI Lightning Rod team including himself, Brendan Brown and Sagar Shah created for Elliot.

“This is what a bill would look like,” said Poliner demonstrating a typical transaction at Chadd’s Bistro.

The bill for a bitcoin-paying customer has a QR code that the customer scans. Then their personal crypto wallet reads the virtual address where it should send the payment. This address is usually a one-time destination code.

Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and enthusiasts feel the more people become familiar with it, the more businesses will start accepting it.

“We are excited to embrace the future of finance and cater to the growing community of cryptocurrency users,” said Elliot. “By accepting bitcoin, lightning and other cryptocurrencies, Chadd’s Bistro aims to become a hub for Michigan’s vibrant community of bitcoin enthusiasts.“

Elliot who supports voluntaryist principles that stem from the idea of natural rights, equality, non-coercion, and non-aggression said he wishes more people would trade their bitcoins rather than just sitting on it.

“Convincing people to spend it is a big part of what we’re hoping to see happen,” he said.

How can you become a bitcoin user?

Chadd’s Bistro is not only a gathering place for individuals and families looking to eat but once a month hosts a happy hour for bitcoin enthusiasts looking to exchange ideas, questions or currency for food. Poliner said there are a handful of people across the state developing their own crypto/bitcoin projects independently.

“We loosely connect to share progress, use each other’s products, and exchange ideas,” Poliner said.

Their next meeting at the bistro is March 5 at 4 p.m.

Need to find a bitcoin ATM before the meeting or lunch? There are about 807 bitcoin ATMs in 34 states and 559 cities including more than a few in Michigan. In fact you cannot see the state’s outline on a map of bitcoin ATMs as the orange tacks show locations from Taylor and White Lake to Roseville, Detroit and Warren.

“I don’t use it but I think it’s good to have that option for customers who do,” said Carol Profit of Troy.

Other customers agreed the more options the better including Brandon Thomas of Shelby Township, who was joined by his wife Janice, although she insists on the old adage, “cash is king.”

As for their son Brice? By the time he’s old enough to pay the bill chances are bitcoin will be one of many digital currencies that he will use. For now the 11-year-old was just happy his dad was treating him to a platter of barbecued pork and coleslaw sliders.

“They’re really good,” said Brice.

BREAKING: Dow Futures Fall As Snowflake Tumbles









Cryptocurrency News: Crypto prices and related stocks continued to rally Wednesday as bitcoin scrambled above $59,000. Coinbase stock climbed beyond its buy range after Monday's breakout.

Coinbase and converted bitcoin ETFs Grayscale Bitcoin Trust(GBTC) and Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) are now trading above their pre-Jan. 11 highs. DEFI broke out past a buy point on Tuesday.

Jan. 11 was a historic day for the crypto industry after the SEC approved 11 bitcoin ETF applications late Jan. 10, which included issuers ARK Invest (ARKK), BlackRock (BLK), Grayscale, VanEck and more. Coinbase is serving as the custodian for a majority of the new ETF issuers. How are crypto custodians keeping digital assets secure?

Other trends are set to drive bitcoin in 2024, including the upcoming halving event in April and influx of institutional participation.

Bitcoin held above $59,000 early Tuesday, after reaching as high as $59,496. The gains move the cryptocurrency further against its highest trading levels since November 2021. Bitcoin is now about 16% below its record high, set in early November 2021.

Bitcoin had spiked to $49,000 January 11 on the ETF launch day but then fell back into its early December 2023 level prior to the SEC announcement. The world's largest cryptocurrency rebounded about 157% in 2023. Bitcoin is up more than 40% so far this year, with most of the gains compounded in February.

Ethereum touched a new 52-week high of $3,368, before easing slightly. It is trading at its best level since April 2022. The No. 2 crypto leapt roughly 92% in 2023. Ethereum jumped 45% so far in 2024.

Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, but that was pushed to the max today as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) jumped as much as 12.6% to over $64,000 for a moment only to plunge to $59,000 an hour later. At 3:30 p.m. ET, the cryptocurrency is trading at around $60,000 and is still up 5% over the past 24 hours.

The entire market followed Bitcoin's move, but Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were two of the more notable movers. Ethereum jumped 7.4% at its peak only to fall back to flat for the day. Dogecoin regained most of its late afternoon pop and is up 13% on the day.

When a stock or cryptocurrency rises, this is known as a short squeeze where short-sellers are forced to buy to cover losses, fueling the rally further. According to Coinglass, in the last 24 hours, there were $175.5 million in short leverage positions liquidated for Bitcoin and $363 million across crypto, which could have fueled the run-up.

But on the way down the opposite is true. Leverage long positions must be sold, which causes the drop to accelerate. In the past 24 hours, $85.9 million in long Bitcoin positions and $336.4 million in crypto long positions were liquidated.

It didn't help that Coinbase Global had a glitch on its app that caused customers to see a zero balance. That caused some people to be unable to trade during this period of high volatility.

CEO Brian Armstrong said there was an over 10x increase in traffic to the company's apps during this period. That shows just how much trading was likely taking place in a very short period of time.

The move in Ethereum comes about two weeks ahead of the upgrade being called Dencun, which is expected to make the blockchain less expensive and faster. That could increase the utilization of Ethereum as a token for real-world utility.

It has also helped that the rise in Bitcoin following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs has led to speculation that Ethereum ETFs could be next. This is the second-largest cryptocurrency and would make sense as the next crypto ETF given the scale and name recognition.

Dogecoin also has name recognition and as a memecoin that's driven by sentiment on most days, it's not surprising to see the token up big today. But that doesn't mean the move will last because there's no fundamental change in the token from just a day ago.

The one thing that is certain is that crypto will be volatile in the future. What's less clear is where prices are headed.

The crypto industry is driven largely by sentiment and over the last few months the sentiment has been strong for both crypto and growth stocks, which are usually correlated with crypto values.

If momentum continues, values could easily go higher. But keep in mind that the momentum could turn quickly if the market goes south.

Nuvance Health, a hospital system that services Putnam, Dutchess and Connecticut, is joining with Northwell Health, the biggest hospital systems in the New York metro area.

In a news release Wednesday, both nonprofit hospital systems say they decided to join forces to ""form a new integrated regional health system"" connecting New York and Connecticut.

“This partnership opens a new and exciting chapter for Northwell and Nuvance Health and provides an incredible opportunity to enhance both health systems and take patient care and services to an even higher level,” said Michael Dowling, president and CEO of Northwell Health. “We have similar missions in providing high-quality care for patients in the communities we serve. We look forward to building on the care that Nuvance Health’s 14,000 staff members and providers deliver each and every day.”

The newly combined systems would grow to 14,500 providers and over 1,000 healthcare sites, including 28 hospitals.

Local hospitals within the existing Nuvance Health system like Putnam Hospital in Carmel, Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie and Danbury Hospital in Connecticut will now be affiliated with the Northwell Health system name, Nuvance spokesperson John Nelson said.

Local Northwell Health affiliated hospitals include Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco and Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow.

However, Nuvance Health patients won't see any changes for some time, according to Nuvance Health spokesperson John Nelson.

""We still have to go through the regulatory approval process, which could take about a year or more,"" Nelson said.

Northwell Health systems said it will make ""significant investments"" in Nuvance's locations and services to improve the system's quality of care and increase capacity to serve a larger population. Patients of the combined hospital systems will now have access to healthcare in Connecticut, Mid and Lower Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island.

“By joining forces with Northwell Health, we are taking a giant leap forward in our shared mission to enhance the quality, accessibility and equity of the health care we provide to our communities,” said John M. Murphy, MD, president and CEO of Nuvance Health. “This agreement enables us to make significant improvements to health outcomes for community hospitals and to deliver unparalleled care and drive positive change in the health care landscape.”

Northwell and Nuvance said the merger would also help address health disparities throughout the New York metro region, as well as providing new jobs for healthcare workers across the area.","{'href': 'https://www.lohud.com', 'title': 'The Journal News'}"

John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital

Greetings from Los Angeles, where health industry executives, startup founders and investors gathered at the ViVE conference. Unsurprisingly the implications of artificial intelligence in healthcare were top of mind for everyone, especially the battle heating up for customers in the AI medical scribe market. Before the conference kicked off, Abridge announced a $150 million Series C round at an $850 million valuation (check out the story below).

Harjinder Sandhu, CTO of Health and Life Sciences Platforms at Microsoft, which has a competing product called DAX Copilot (via its $18.8 billion acquisition of Nuance Communications in 2022), said Microsoft encourages its customers to think about a value versus risk grid when incorporating large language models into healthcare settings. Microsoft invested $10 billion into OpenAI, the makers of the models that power the viral ChatGPT. He describes AI scribes as sitting in the “high value, low risk” quadrant, during a conference presentation, since all of the output will be reviewed by doctors. “You have a qualified human that's in the workflow, assessing what the AI system is doing and is able to detect errors,” he said.

The next use case that everyone is clamoring for but is at higher risk is using AI models to summarize a patient’s entire medical record history before they see a doctor. “It's really difficult in that context to decide whether or not the system has given you false information,” Sandhu said. “It'll be mostly correct and there may be one thing that is thrown in there that's hallucinated or something that is omitted to tell you.” He predicted that chart summarization tools are probably a “year or two out.”

Another big concern for healthcare customers is data privacy and security. Sandhu described the LLMs as “memory-less,” meaning they don’t remember the prompt you type. “What it does remember what you’ve done is that software layer on top that’s mediating your interaction with the language model,” he said.

John Brownstein, the chief innovation officer of Boston Children’s Hospital, told Forbes that they wanted hospital staff to be able to experiment and use GPT for different tasks but also needed to guarantee that no protected health information would be sent back to OpenAI via that software layer on top. “We worked with Microsoft to essentially create a separate cloud instance of Azure that allows people in our organization to access GPT in a way that is sectioned off,” he said. “It wasn’t trivial,” he added.

Brownstein said Boston Children’s created a web portal for people in the hospital to essentially access their own instance of ChatGPT and tracks logins, tokens and usage. So far they’ve found people are using it for a variety of tasks. For example, asking questions and getting answers about certain hospital protocols or drafting patient handoff documents between nursing teams.

 

Abridge

Lightspeed Venture Partners and Redpoint Ventures have co-led a $150 million Series C investment in Pittsburgh-based startup Abridge, which uses AI to transcribe patient conversations with doctors and automatically transform them into medical notes. The company’s post-money valuation is $850 million, according to a person familiar with the deal.

This round comes just four months after Abridge closed a $30 million Series B that valued the company at $200 million. “This is really on the back of the commercial momentum,” Abridge cofounder and CEO Shiv Rao told Forbes. In the past few weeks, he said Abridge has started deployments in 10 different health systems. In total, Abridge has contracted more than 10,000 clinicians to use the software with the latest addition being Yale New Haven Health.

The new funding will be used to help the company boost sales into more hospitals, as well as invest in technical research and development.

Nine out of 10 beds in state psychiatric hospitals are occupied by people sent there by the courts, leaving no space for others in mental health crisis.

""The statistic of 93% of the beds in psychiatric hospitals being occupied, that the average person who has a mental health problem or you have someone in your family, and they've not committed a crime, they can't get in there,"" Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday. ""That's crazy.""

DeWine said he wants to fix that as well as help county jails provide mental health services to incarcerated people. The governor said he'll soon appoint a group of experts − judges, sheriffs, mental health professionals − to make specific recommendations.

Courts send people to the state hospitals so they can be restored to mental competency and then able to stand trial − often for minor crimes.

""We know that the court has to be able to put that person somewhere, but our state hospitals probably are not the most appropriate place for most of them to be,"" DeWine said. ""The guy who stole a piece of pizza, he's occupying space that someone, who if we could get them in there in a reasonable period of time, you might totally save their life and turn their life around.""

Since the 1950s, Ohio and other states closed mental health hospitals and promised to treat those patients in local facilities.

""We said we were going to stop warehousing people, deinstitutionalize most of them, and then at the same time build up a local, county-by-county system,"" DeWine said. ""We didn't do it.""

Ohio closed two state hospitals, Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare in Dayton and Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare in Cambridge in 2008 to help balance the state budget. Six state hospitals remain open.

DeWine pointed out that it's not just an Ohio problem.

Nationwide, states closed 62 psychiatric hospitals between 1997 and 2015 and since the 1950s, there has been a 91% decrease in state beds, according to the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors.

In 2019, following the mass shooting in Dayton, DeWine called for a change in how Ohio uses its state psychiatric beds.

One in three inmates in Ohio have a mental illness, forcing jails to act as the de facto treatment centers, according to the Stepping Up Initiative, which seeks to divert people with serious mental illnesses from lockups.

""More people with mental illnesses are sitting, untreated, in local jails than ever before,"" the group said. ""Across the nation and in Ohio, jails have become revolving doors for people with mental illnesses.""

Evelyn Stratton, a former Ohio Supreme Court justice who leads Stepping Up, said the state lacks places to take people experiencing mental health crises so they often end up in jails.

Jails need to provide medication assisted treatment for those suffering from opiate withdrawals, psychotropic drugs and therapy for people and train guards in crisis intervention techniques, she said.

Stratton said jails need to link people to services, such as Medicaid, before they are released and communities need to build out more supportive housing so people have stable places to live.

She agrees with the governor that existing state hospital beds need to be more available. Her answer is to shift to outpatient treatment for many of the people being restored to competency before standing trial.

Roughly 300,000 people are booked into Ohio's 89 full-service jails each year and the state prison system holds about 45,000 people. Most of them qualify for health care via Medicaid, a state and federally funded program.

But federal rules block Medicaid coverage for inmates. Ohio prisons and jails have focused on making sure Medicaid coverage is re-started as soon as people leave incarceration.

Some states have applied for a special waiver from the federal government to have Medicaid cover medical costs for inmates close to release. The waiver would mean the federal government would pay about 60% of the tab for some inmates' medical costs.

When asked why Ohio Medicaid hasn't applied for that waiver, DeWine said: ""I will look at that.""

CHARLESTON COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - It’s been about six months since a new medical provider took over healthcare operations at the Al Canon Detention Center in Charleston County.

On Wednesday, VitalCore representatives attended a Criminal Justice Coordinating Council meeting, introduced themselves and answered questions from community advocates in the audience.

In July 2023, VitalCore Health Strategies replaced Wellpath, the company U.S. Justice Department was investigating after several inmates died at the jail. 

VitalCore introduced a behavioral health clinic a few weeks into its operations, highlighting it as something the jail and inmates did not have before that provides onsite mental health services. Right now, the behavioral health unit has four employees who all see patients.

Vice President of Behavioral Health at VitalCore Jeff Brewer talked about what the transition process has been like as well as what services VitalCore has to offer.

“Then we took over behavior health because we didn’t have behavior health there, at all. So we started fresh with that group of individuals, so that they’re all new, and we had to seek them out through the community,” Brewer said. 

Vital Core representatives explained their other health services including on-site dental, dialysis, 24-hour providers and nurses, lab, a pharmacist and MAT addiction treatment.

“We try and keep as much of the staff as we can, because starting fresh, bringing a whole bunch of people into the corrections environment that haven’t worked there before can be kind of chaotic. So we try and keep as many people as we can, and not do something with turnover,” Brewer said.

People at Wednesday’s meeting who heard the presentation had questions for the provider. Criminal Justice Coordinating Council Director Ellen Steinberg said VitalCore reached out to them about giving a presentation.

“A lot of people were really eager to meet them and hear from them. I felt like everybody had their questions answered. We did not see them try to dodge any questions,” Steinberg said.

Questions included how to iron out access to MAT drug methadone in addition to suboxone or buprenorphine. Right now, people are able to continue their addiction-weaning treatment with the other two drugs but don’t have access to methadone within the jail yet if that’s their brand.

Another question came from a stakeholder who works with juvenile court. They noticed that youth offenders were still being given papers to leave the nearby detention center to get treatment.

“So one of the questions was regarding our services to the juvenile offenders. And I was a little shocked when I heard that we weren’t servicing those individuals because I believe that we are. So I just didn’t want to talk with some people and make sure that there’s not any loopholes with that process and that we’re able to give the juveniles the best care we can,” Brewer said.

Steinberg said it’s a good sign that the representatives were willing to answer their questions.

“At this point, I’m looking forward to the future partnership. Again, the fact that they reached out to us and wanted to speak to us and introduce themselves. That’s a game changer,” she said.

Since VitalCore took the healthcare at the jail, there has been one death at the Al Cannon Detention Center.

The coroner ruled the cause of death an overdose and a report states the inmate was not responsive but healthcare workers were not called before they had died in custody.

The Charleston County Sheriff’s Office provided the following statement regarding the transition to VitalCore at the jail:

We have been very pleased with Vital Core’s service and constant communication within the Sheriff Al Canon Detention Center since taking over last year. We look forward to continuing to grow this relationship.

AHA and 51 other national organizations Feb. 27 voiced support for the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act (H.R. 6205/S. 3211), bipartisan legislation that would recapture 25,000 unused employment-based visas for foreign-born nurses and 15,000 for foreign-born physicians to help address staffing shortages.

“The United States is facing an urgent health care workforce shortage that is only expected to get worse over the next decade,” the group said in letters to the bill’s House and Senate sponsors. “Shortages of physicians and nurses contribute to increased wait times and reduced overall access to health services, which ultimately leads to worsening health conditions and outcomes.”The bill was reintroduced last November.

The group known by the names of Blackcat and Alphv says it exfiltrated 6 TB of data in the attack.










The cybercriminal group known by the names of Blackcat and Alphv claimed responsibility Wednesday for the disruptive cyberattack against Change Healthcare.

The Russian-speaking cybercriminal gang said on its darkweb site that it exfiltrated 6 TB of data in the attack against Change Healthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group’s Optum subsidiary.

A spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group said the company is aware of the claims and is looking into them.

[Related: Blackcat Ransomware Linked With ScreenConnect, Recent Health Care Attacks: US]

The attack has disrupted U.S. pharmacies as well as other health-care facilities and offices.

Reuters had reported Monday that the attack involved the Blackcat ransomware strain.

The report linking Blackcat with the Change Healthcare attack—and now the apparent confirmation by the cybercriminal group—has raised questions about UnitedHealth’s initial attribution of the attack to a nation-state threat actor. The attribution was part of UnitedHealth’s disclosure of the incident to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 21.

The latest statement posted by Change Healthcare Wednesday does not contain any new information from its prior disclosures. “The disruption is expected to last at least through the day,” the statement read, repeating a line that was included in the statements of prior days.

The latest post also reiterated that Change Healthcare is taking “multiple approaches to restore the impacted environment.”

In a statement provided Tuesday to media outlets including CRN, UnitedHealth said it has seen “minimal reports” of patients being unable to access prescriptions.

In part, this is because more than 90 percent of pharmacies in the U.S. are believed to use “modified electronic claim processing to mitigate impacts from the Change Healthcare cyber security issue,” the company said in the statement.","{'href': 'https://www.crn.com', 'title': 'CRN'}"

Neal dejong, MD, MPH, at the UNC School of Medicine, David Y. Ming, MD, at Duke University School of Medicine and Ryan Coller, MD, at University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, received $5.5 million to study hospital-to-home transitions across settings for children and youth with special healthcare needs.

Nearly one in five children, almost 14 million in the United States, have a special healthcare need that may require hospitalization. After a child’s hospital stay, the transition back home can be risky, particularly for children with chronic health issues and complex medical conditions. To understand how to best support children and youth with special healthcare needs (CYSHCN), researchers of the CYSHCN National Research Network (CYSHCNet) received $5.5 million for a multi-site study funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to compare two types of hospital-to-home transitional care to optimize outcomes.
The CYSHCNet researchers are led by David Y. Ming, MD, principal investigator, associate professor of pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine; Neal dejong, MD, MPH, associate professor of pediatrics and member of the UNC Children’s Research Institute at the UNC School of Medicine; and Ryan Coller, MD, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.
Over a one-month post-discharge period, researchers will compare the effectiveness of two transitional care approaches — focused dose versus extended dose — reducing return visits to the hospital or emergency department and increasing parent-reported confidence. They will also evaluate the impact of each type of hospital-to-home transitional care on specific CYSHCN patient groups, including those with highly complex clinical needs and those from racial/ethnic minority groups or living in rural areas. Lastly, researchers will investigate how and why each approach to hospital-to-home transitional care is effective and for whom they work best.
The study team includes multiple community partners, including parents and caregivers with lived experience, clinicians, policymakers, and health system leaders. A community advisory board, primarily composed of a diverse group of parents/caregivers of CYSHCN, will work closely with the research team throughout the study. This collaborative effort aims to contribute to the equitable improvement of overall care for all CYSHCN transitioning from hospital to home.

February 28, 2024 - Although nearly a third of the American public thinks racism in medicine is a major problem, that proportion is actually much lower than the public perception of other sectors, potentially signaling a healthy level of patient trust across racial and ethnic groups, according to new KFF polling.

Still, the researchers said trust levels, and consequently positive perceptions, are lower among racial and ethnic minorities who are more likely to report a recent experience of racism in healthcare.

Racism in healthcare has become a key talking point as industry experts continue to work toward health equity. While many racial health disparities have been carved out at the hands of institutional racism, there’s growing evidence that implicit and explicit bias in the medical setting has also created inequities.

This most recent KFF survey showed that 32 percent of all Americans agree that is the case, but that public perception could be much worse. While a third of respondents agreed racism is a major problem in healthcare, more than half said the same of policing (51 percent), the criminal justice system (54 percent), and politics (56 percent).

But those perceptions aren’t the same across racial and ethnic minorities.

Indeed, healthcare is the most-trusted sector across the three polling areas regardless of race or ethnicity, but the data showed that White people are less likely to think racism is a major problem in medicine than Hispanic people (34 percent), Black people (52 percent), Asian people (35 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native people (35 percent).

These differences are likely the result of vastly different healthcare experiences, the data indicated.

For example, Black people are significantly more likely to have experienced at least one form of discrimination in a healthcare setting at least a few times in the past year compared to their White counterparts. While 33 percent of White respondents said they’d recently experienced discrimination in healthcare, 60 percent of Black folks said the same.

For Hispanic respondents, that figure was 43 percent, and for Asian respondents, it was 45 percent.

Distilled further, the researchers said an unfair or discriminatory healthcare experience is a key predictor of poor patient trust. Overall, 49 percent of those reporting disrespect in healthcare said racism is a major problem in the industry; only 28 percent without a poor experience said the same.

For Black patients, those figures are 74 and 46 percent, respectively, and for Hispanic patients, it was 58 and 30 percent.

As expected, White people were generally less likely to report that racism is a major problem in US healthcare, but bad prior experiences were also a weaker predictor for this population, the data showed. Around four in 10 (39 percent) White people reporting unfair or disrespectful treatment from a healthcare worker said racism is a big problem in healthcare; 25 percent with no bad healthcare experiences said the same.

Despite these concerning figures, the researchers said patients of all races and ethnicities largely trust their doctors and clinicians providing direct care to them.

Nearly three-quarters (72 percent) said they trust their providers to do what is right for them most of the time. This was mostly consistent across race and ethnicity, although Black adults with self-reported very dark/dark skin tone were slightly less likely to trust their providers.

That said, Black patients did become more likely to say they trusted their doctors when they had more visits with doctors who were also Black. In fact, racial concordance improved trust levels among Black patients (74 percent), Asian patients (83 percent), and White patients (78 percent).

These findings corroborate what other analyses have found to be true: racial concordance is good for the patient-provider relationship. However, data has indicated that patient-provider racial concordance is elusive, mostly due to poor healthcare workforce diversity.

Healthcare needs to reexamine the medical education pipeline in order to cultivate greater workforce diversity. This includes encouraging more students of color to pursue medicine and making changes to the medical education environment to ensure less attrition of students of color. At the same time, efforts to promote cultural competency could help improve patient perceptions of healthcare.

Healthcare has faced unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, governments, clinics, hospitals, and frontline workers were confronted with additional pressures of tracing and tracking new infections, treating COVID-19 patients while managing their usual duties, respecting social distance rules, and maintaining the flow of medical supplies. This increased the strain on an already under-resourced system.

Following the pandemic, observers from various industries have remarked that a decade’s worth of innovation occurred in just ten months. PwC Singapore’s Health Industries Leader has also said that the pandemic expedited the emergence of what he terms the New Health Economy—or the future of healthcare.

This future is without a doubt digital. Healthcare institutions in many countries are embracing telehealth services, diagnostics, digital therapeutics, remote data analytics, and patient monitoring to reduce the gap between patient and provider, providing personalized, proactive, and higher-quality healthcare. If the pandemic has shown anything, it is the massive potential of digital technologies to help us combat future challenges.

As we move out of the COVID-19 pandemic, how can it be ensured that healthcare is future-proofed? New challenges will likely emerge again, and we require systems that enable healthcare institutions to ensure disruptions and respond with agility and speed.

To begin with, countries are starting to construct a common digital infrastructure to eliminate data siloes and improve healthcare decision-making. In the Netherlands, the pandemic inspired the government to create a national portal for the digital exchange of COVID-19 patient records.

Earlier this year, 72 million citizens in Germany were given legal access to a national patient record. Germany continues to advocate for a European Union (EU)-wide common health data sharing framework.

On an organizational level, healthcare institutions can harness the innovation catalyzed by COVID-19 by intensifying their focus on telehealth services, communication technologies, data analytics capabilities, and supply chain management. This approach aims to install resilience and agility into their operations.

In times of workplace accidents, natural disasters, or future pandemics, frontline workers and hospital staff need to stay updated on the rapidly changing situation. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare teams faced the constant challenge of evolving case numbers, changing regulations and measures, and more.

Providing healthcare members with mobile computers that enable real-time collaboration and communication is key to facilitating the flow of information. Intelligent in-vehicle edge gateways additionally improve communication between ambulances and the control tower, enhancing first-aid care and dispatch decisions.

This allows clinics, hospitals, and ambulatory services to respond quickly and efficiently to situational needs, enhancing healthcare outcomes, particularly in moments when they are most needed.

These tablets, laptops, and other devices come equipped with fast connectivity and enterprise-grade security to ensure hospital and patient data is protected while ensuring that urgent information is sent and received in a reliable and timely manner.

A recent report from Frost & Sullivan stated that we are experiencing “a radical telehealth expansion.” In the United States, its annual projected compound growth rate vaulted from just over 28 % (pre-COVID) to approximately 40 % (post-COVID), while remote patient monitoring has been projected to increase 150 % this year alone.

Telehealth services are an essential part of healthcare resilience and business continuity. Today, hospitals are looking to limit risk by keeping non-urgent or vulnerable cases, as well as non-essential personnel, away from their premises. Innovations in telecare for remote diagnosis and support narrow the divide, enabling hospitals to deliver continued care using digital channels while maintaining their humanity.

For effective data analytics, a robust system is required for the collection and organization of data. Healthcare institutions must determine which data needs collecting and how it will be collected. For instance, RFID tags to track the movement of patients, powerful software to streamline surgeries and schedules, and sensors to monitor building system integrity.

After completing the first step, intelligence must be built into these systems. Machine learning technologies and artificial intelligence are advancing every day. The healthcare sector could accelerate screening processes and match patients with required services more efficiently. It could also convert data into personalized insights to improve care or predict catastrophes that will overwhelm supplies and resources.

From a resilience perspective, data analytics helps healthcare institutions keep up to date with minute environmental changes, extracting insights that will result in timely action to address all manner of challenges and disruptions.

For everyday uses, analytics frees up time and resources and helps to open up new opportunities for specific and high-quality healthcare.

An essential element of resilience is supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic placed a visible strain on global medical resources as the demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), masks, and other healthcare supplies significantly increased. As the world adapts to the new normal, medical institutions should address their supply chains and collaborate to fill gaps and urgently address these issues.

It would be prudent for healthcare institutions to invest in advanced digital capabilities. The key goal should be gaining visibility throughout the supply chain to remain prepared for future disruptions. It is also the ideal time to drive scenario modeling and create plans for the potential challenges of the future. This will build greater resilience and agility in supply chain operations.

Many of the foundations of a resilient healthcare system are in place. The healthcare industry is rich in data, and COVID-19 only expedited the utilization of digital capabilities that are well-suited to future requirements.

If built on a solid core digital infrastructure and robust security, healthcare institutions are in a good position to provide reliable, efficient, and humane care services during both peaceful and challenging times.

A new collaborative study between Boston Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia finds exposure to neighborhood violence among children was associated with unmet health needs and increased acute care utilization. Published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and based on nationally representative data on violence exposure and gold standard access to care measures from the National Health Interview Survey, this study shows that evidence-based interventions to improve access to care in communities impacted by violence are needed to mitigate long-term physical and mental health consequences for children.

Millions of children in the U.S. are exposed to violence in their homes or communities. Research has shown that children exposed to violence have worse school performance in childhood, increased rates of substance use disorder in adolescence, increased rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder in adulthood, and increased risk of developing chronic medical conditions throughout their lives. Exposure to violence also deepens child health inequities, particularly in marginalized communities disproportionately exposed to violence due to systemic racism across generations.

This study helps examine violence exposure at the population level as both a direct driver of health inequities and as a consequence of fundamental causes like racism, poverty, and other structural risk conditions. The researchers found that, even after controlling for the effects of other important factors like family income and insurance status, children exposed to neighborhood violence face unmet physical and mental health care needs, cost-related barriers, decreased access to prescription drugs, increased urgent care and emergency department utilization, and decreased access to preventive care, mental health care, and medications.

The study also identified an association between exposure to neighborhood violence and mental health symptoms, including increased rates of depression and anxiety, which was consistent with multiple previous studies. Researchers also found that children exposed to violence have higher rates of delayed and forgone mental health care despite experiencing more mental health symptoms. Prior research shows how early access to care can mitigate the mental health consequences of violence exposure; improving access to high-quality, affordable mental health care services remains critical in communities impacted by neighborhood violence.

Researchers call attention to built-in environment reforms like neighborhood greening and cleanup, poverty alleviation interventions like the expanded Child Tax Credit, insurance coverage protections like continuous Medicaid enrollment, and hospital-based violence prevention programs as opportunities to take action.

Our findings highlight the profound impacts of limited access to care in communities affected by violence. We also identify specific opportunities for evidence-based clinician, health system, and policy actions that can reduce the incidence of neighborhood violence and mitigate its health consequences.""

""To improve health outcomes for the millions of children in the United States affected by neighborhood violence, we have to invest in their families and communities,"" said senior author Aditi Vasan, MD, MSHP, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. ""Our findings underscore the need for both upstream policy interventions, like the expanded Child Tax Credit, which would provide essential economic support for families in low-income communities impacted by violence, and downstream health system interventions focused on improving access to high-quality, trauma-informed care for these children and their families.""

A dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. When an unvaccinated person is exposed to measles, public health guidance if for them to get vaccinated within three days.

In mid-February, a measles outbreak started at the Manatee Bay Elementary School in Broward County in South Florida. There are now at least nine cases in the county and one additional one in Polk County in Central Florida. 

Several public health researchers say Florida's current response to the outbreak goes against well-established public health guidance. Florida's surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, has so far not urged parents of unvaccinated children at the school with the outbreak to get their children vaccinated, or to quarantine them. In a Feb. 20 letter, Ladapo left it up to parents to decide whether to send their kids to school.

""I'm flummoxed about this,"" says Dr. Ali Khan, dean of public health at the University of Nebraska. ""I've never heard of a surgeon general who didn't at least advocate for best public health practice."" 

Khan says flouting science-based guidance is dangerous. ""If you're undermining confidence in public health, including vaccination and public health measures, you are putting an increasing number of people at risk of these diseases that we no longer see anymore,"" he says. 

Measles is a highly infectious disease, says Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. ""I mean, you can walk by somebody and catch measles if they have it. It's one of the most infectious diseases that we know about."" 

And when people who are not vaccinated or don't have prior immunity get exposed to it, up to 9 out of 10 will get measles, according to CDC.

State data shows that around 8% of kindergartners in Broward County are not vaccinated for measles. 

""If you've been vaccinated, if your children are vaccinated, you don't have to worry about it. [The risk] is really for a small proportion of people whose children are not vaccinated,"" Plescia says, ""But 8% is [still] a lot of children, and the risk is that we could see many of those children getting sick."" 

Measles has been around for a very long time – it's been studied for well over a century. And there are clear steps to take to contain an outbreak, says Dr. Scott Rivkees, a public health professor at Brown University: ""If you have an outbreak, try to get [unvaccinated] people vaccinated within three days of exposure,"" he says. 

And because people can spread the virus even if they don't have symptoms, he says, people who are not vaccinated that have been exposed need to quarantine for 21 days.

Rivkees is the former surgeon general in Florida. And that's the advice Florida would be getting, if he was still in the role. 

But Rivkees left in 2021 and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis appointed Ladapo to the role. Ladapo was part of a group that pushed unproven COVID treatments before he took the post. And as surgeon general, he refused to wear masks and discouraged people from getting COVID vaccines.

Rivkees is concerned that skepticism over vaccines for COVID may be spreading to another potentially deadly disease.  

""We have seen an incredible attack on vaccines over the past couple of years,"" he says. ""[Now] we're seeing parents who are not getting their children vaccinated, parents who believe that getting the vaccine, for example, will actually cause measles, when it doesn't.""

And when it comes to measles, that vaccine reluctance could lead to unnecessary suffering and even risk of death. While measles is rare in the U.S. because of high vaccination rates, it can be serious. 

A mild case of measles can involve getting a rash, diarrhea and dehydration. In some cases, it can turn into pneumonia. In rare cases it can lead to brain swelling, which can cause kids to lose their sight or hearing.

In late 2022, there was an outbreak in Columbus, Ohio, where 85 people got sick from measles – and 40% of them ended up in the hospital. 

It can also be deadly. Before the vaccine, the U.S. was seeing 500 deaths from measles each year. 

Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in the year 2000. There are still cases, but those usually come when people travel to other countries and bring it back. The U.S. should be able to keep that ""elimination"" status — so long as each measles outbreak gets contained within a year, according to CDC.

So far this year, there have been at least 35 cases in 15 states. Those numbers will likely continue to grow, especially in parts of the country with low vaccination rates. And experts say that, when state and local authorities flout longstanding public health advice, it could lead to more disease in more communities.

""This is a very, very serious disease and it's completely vaccine preventable,"" says Khan.

While 80-85% of sepsis cases present within the first 48 hours of admission, they have lower mortality (5-10%) compared with 15-20% of cases that present later and have higher mortality (15-30%).

To better – and earlier – identify sepsis cases not present on admission, at a large safety-net hospital, an end-to-end early sepsis prediction and response workflow was created in the inpatient setting. First, a machine learning model was built to predict the risk of a patient becoming septic in real time.

Next, the model was baked into clinical workflows through FHIR APIs to make it actionable at the point of care. The model accesses the EHR every 15 minutes and alerts care providers when the risk exceeds a certain threshold, which can be tailored to local populations.

Finally, an EHR-integrated decision support app, or ISLET, was added to enable clinicians to easily view and understand model output to improve actionability. Prediction, alerting, visualizing the root causes and acting on the case completes the workflow. This full workflow has been running for thousands of patients every 15 minutes in the last year.

Yusuf Tamer is principal data and applied scientist at the Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation. He will tell this story in great detail at HIMSS24 in an educational session titled, ""Closing the Loop in Sepsis Prediction With ML and ISLET Visualization.""

We interviewed Tamer to get a sneak preview of the session prior to the big show next month in Orlando.

Q. What is the overarching focus of your session? Why is it important to health IT leaders at hospitals and health systems today?

A. Sepsis is a severe condition triggered by an infection that can lead to multiple organ failure. It’s a medical emergency that requires swift identification and treatment. The primary focus of my session is to discuss the role of artificial intelligence in the early prediction of sepsis within hospital settings.

AI systems in healthcare are increasingly complementing healthcare providers by offering them reasons for suspicion. These suspicions are acted upon when the providers trust the reasons given to them. This trust is built on two key pillars: timeliness and explainability.

Timeliness is crucial in sepsis detection. The sooner sepsis is identified, the better the patient’s chances of recovery. If an AI system identifies sepsis and alerts the provider after they have already initiated treatment, it diminishes the system’s value. It could disrupt the clinical workflow and erode trust in the AI system. Therefore, the AI system must be designed to provide timely alerts that can genuinely assist in the treatment process.

Explainability is another critical aspect. In a patient care setting, every action taken by a provider is subject to auditing. While AI systems are not the final decision makers, they can significantly influence decision making.

Therefore, the decisions made by AI systems or machine learning models must be explainable. This transparency is crucial for auditing purposes and ensures accountability in AI-assisted healthcare.

Furthermore, the explainability of AI systems is not just important for auditing, but also for building trust with healthcare providers. If the AI system can provide clear, understandable reasons for its predictions, healthcare providers are more likely to trust and act on its recommendations.

The session will provide valuable insights into how AI can enhance the early prediction of sepsis, emphasizing the importance of timeliness and explainability in building trust and improving patient outcomes.

This topic is of utmost importance to health IT leaders as it touches on the intersection of technology and patient care, highlighting how AI can be leveraged to improve healthcare delivery.

Q. What is one main learning you would like session attendees to walk away with? And how is this vital to healthcare today?

A. The primary takeaway I want attendees to have from this session is that machine learning models do not have to be ""black boxes."" While performance is a critical factor for these models, an explainable model that is trusted by providers will be used more if it has comparable performance. This is a crucial understanding in the context of healthcare and health IT today.

Machine learning models are often perceived as complex and opaque, making it difficult for healthcare providers to trust and use them. However, it’s important to understand these models can be designed to be transparent and explainable.

A model that provides clear, understandable reasons for its predictions can build trust among healthcare providers, leading to increased utilization even if its performance is only comparable to less transparent models.

Moreover, visual representation of data can significantly enhance the value provided by these models. A picture is indeed worth a thousand words. A graphic that illustrates how a patient’s vitals or lab values have changed over time can provide more value than a simple numeric output.

It can help healthcare providers better understand the patient’s condition and the model’s predictions, leading to more informed decision making.

In this session, we will discuss how we created a report page with graphics about our machine learning model and how we integrated it into the EHR. This integration allows healthcare providers to access and understand the model’s predictions directly within the patient’s EHR, enhancing the usability of the model.

Furthermore, we will explore how Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources APIs are opening up new, fast and interactive ways for visualizing machine learning insights. These APIs allow for seamless integration of machine learning models with existing healthcare IT systems, enabling real-time, interactive visualization of model predictions.

The session aims to demystify machine learning models in healthcare and highlight the importance of explainability and visualization in building trust and enhancing the usability of these models. This understanding is vital for health IT leaders as they navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of AI in healthcare.

Q. What is one more learning you would like session attendees to walk away with? And how is this vital to healthcare and/or health IT today?

A. It is the importance of continuous feedback from active users, in this case, healthcare providers, in enhancing the value of AI systems in healthcare. This is a crucial aspect of healthcare and health IT today.

AI systems are not standalone entities; they are part of a larger ecosystem that includes healthcare providers, patients and other stakeholders. Therefore, the development and refinement of these systems should be a collaborative process.

When healthcare providers are included in the development of machine learning solutions, they gain a better understanding of how these systems work. This understanding fosters trust, which in turn enhances their usage of the tool in their decision-making process.

Moreover, healthcare providers often face alert fatigue due to the high number of alerts they receive from various systems. This can lead to important alerts being overlooked, potentially impacting patient care.

Therefore, it’s crucial to get providers’ opinions on what to alert and when to wait before alerting. This feedback can help in designing more effective alert systems, alleviating alert fatigue, and ultimately improving patient care.

Furthermore, continuous feedback from healthcare providers can help in identifying areas of improvement for the AI system. Providers, being the end users of these systems, can provide valuable insights into the system’s performance, usability and relevance in the clinical setting. This feedback can be used to refine the system, making it more effective and user-friendly.

The session aims to highlight the importance of user feedback in the development and refinement of AI systems in healthcare. This understanding is vital for health IT leaders as they strive to integrate AI in healthcare in a way that is effective, user-friendly and beneficial to patient care.

This collaborative approach to AI development not only enhances the value of the AI system but also fosters trust and understanding among its users.

The session, "" Closing the Loop in Sepsis Prediction With ML and ISLET Visualization,"" is scheduled for March 12, Noon-1 p.m. in room W304A at HIMSS24 in Orlando. Learn more and register.

Northwell Health, headquartered in New Hyde Park, has signed a strategic agreement to merge with Nuvance Health, whose hospitals and outpatient services cover the Hudson Valley and western Connecticut.
Upon receiving regulatory approval, the two nonprofit healthcare organizations plan to create an integrated regional health system that serves communities across two states.
“This partnership opens a new and exciting chapter for Northwell and Nuvance Health and provides an incredible opportunity to enhance both health systems and take patient care and services to an even higher level,” Michael Dowling, president and CEO of Northwell, said in a news release about the agreement. 



“We have similar missions in providing high-quality care for patients in the communities we serve,” Dowling added. “We look forward to building on the care that Nuvance Health’s 14,000 staff members and providers deliver each and every day.”
Dr. John Murphy, president and CEO of Nuvance, shared that sentiment.
“By joining forces with Northwell Health, we are taking a giant leap forward in our shared mission to enhance the quality, accessibility and equity of the health care we provide to our communities,” said Murphy said in the news release. 



“This agreement enables us to make significant improvements to health outcomes for community hospitals and to deliver unparalleled care and drive positive change in the health care landscape,” he added.
The two health organizations say that in forming an integrated health system, patients would have expanded access to advanced care. That includes access to a network of providers at more than 1,000 locations, including 28 hospitals. In addition, Northwell would make “significant investments” in the Nuvance sites, further fostering the health system.
“This agreement marks an important milestone for both Nuvance Health and Northwell, mission-driven organizations with similar values and an optimistic vision for the future of health care,” Margaret Crotty, chair of the Northwell board of trustees, said in a statement. “Together we can create something truly special – an integrated health system that is even better positioned to care for the communities we serve”
“Our collaboration with Northwell Health builds upon the strong foundation of our ongoing relationship,” Anne Roby, chair of the Nuvance Health board of directors, said in a statement. “Together, we will address the evolving needs of our communities more efficiently and effectively, ensuring the delivery of compassionate, high-quality care locally.”
Once Nuvance joins Northwell, patients would have access to coordinated care – including ambulatory, hospital and post-acute services – across western Connecticut, the Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island.
Through the merger, the two organizations aim to further meet the health needs of the communities they serve by addressing health disparities and improving health outcomes. As nonprofit organizations, Northwell and Nuvance Health would continue to provide care to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay, according to the news release.
The merger would also expand clinical, operating and financial resources to the locations served by Nuvance. It would combine purchasing power, clinical capabilities, and expertise from both organizations. It would also foster research and innovation in patient care.
The combined health system would serve to attract and retain top talent, and provide opportunities for professional career growth.

“By joining forces with Northwell Health, we are taking a giant leap forward in our shared mission to enhance the quality, accessibility and equity of the health care we provide to our communities,” said Murphy said in the news release. 



“This agreement enables us to make significant improvements to health outcomes for community hospitals and to deliver unparalleled care and drive positive change in the health care landscape,” he added.
The two health organizations say that in forming an integrated health system, patients would have expanded access to advanced care. That includes access to a network of providers at more than 1,000 locations, including 28 hospitals. In addition, Northwell would make “significant investments” in the Nuvance sites, further fostering the health system.
“This agreement marks an important milestone for both Nuvance Health and Northwell, mission-driven organizations with similar values and an optimistic vision for the future of health care,” Margaret Crotty, chair of the Northwell board of trustees, said in a statement. “Together we can create something truly special – an integrated health system that is even better positioned to care for the communities we serve”
“Our collaboration with Northwell Health builds upon the strong foundation of our ongoing relationship,” Anne Roby, chair of the Nuvance Health board of directors, said in a statement. “Together, we will address the evolving needs of our communities more efficiently and effectively, ensuring the delivery of compassionate, high-quality care locally.”
Once Nuvance joins Northwell, patients would have access to coordinated care – including ambulatory, hospital and post-acute services – across western Connecticut, the Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island.
Through the merger, the two organizations aim to further meet the health needs of the communities they serve by addressing health disparities and improving health outcomes. As nonprofit organizations, Northwell and Nuvance Health would continue to provide care to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay, according to the news release.
The merger would also expand clinical, operating and financial resources to the locations served by Nuvance. It would combine purchasing power, clinical capabilities, and expertise from both organizations. It would also foster research and innovation in patient care.
The combined health system would serve to attract and retain top talent, and provide opportunities for professional career growth.


“This partnership opens a new and exciting chapter for Northwell and Nuvance Health and provides an incredible opportunity to enhance both health systems and take patient care and services to an even higher level,” Michael Dowling, president and CEO of Northwell, said in a news release about the agreement. 



“We have similar missions in providing high-quality care for patients in the communities we serve,” Dowling added. “We look forward to building on the care that Nuvance Health’s 14,000 staff members and providers deliver each and every day.”

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A hack of one of the country’s largest healthcare technology companies is causing headaches and delays for local veterans trying to fill their prescriptions.

>>> STREAM ACTION NEWS JAX LIVE <<<

Currently, pharmacies have to manually process prescriptions while the company works to get its systems back online.

Last week, a cyber attack against Change Healthcare, one of the country’s largest healthcare technology companies, forced the payment processor to shut down its systems.

One of the biggest healthcare providers impacted by the attack is Tricare, which covers 9.5 million veterans and other beneficiaries.

Retired US Navy veteran. Jeffery Rutland told Action News Jax since the hack, he’s been hitting one roadblock after another trying to get prescriptions filled for him and his wife.

“It’s not up. It’s not up. Now, today they told me, well, you can go get an appointment to see your doctor, the doctor can give you a new prescription for you to go outside to a Walgreens, CVS. But then Tricare still can’t process,” said Rutland.

According to Naval Hospital Jacksonville, the pharmacy is still processing prescriptions for chronic pain, ADHD medications, and emergency refills for medically necessary medications.

“Each military hospital and clinic will continue to offer pharmacy operations based on their local manning and resources. Please be patient while pharmacies take longer than usual to safely fill prescription needs,” a hospital spokesperson told Action News Jax in an emailed statement.

“The company is saying it should be within a matter of days to get partial capability back,” said US Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL 6th District).

Waltz, a former Green Beret, told Action News Jax veterans can likely expect some delays for weeks as Change Healthcare works to get its systems fully restored.

In addition to the headaches for veterans, Waltz argued the cyber attack has exposed a key vulnerability in terms of national security, as there are only a few companies that provide these payment processing services for prescriptions.

“Yes, we have military strength, but really the strength of the United States of America is our economy. And whether it’s nukes in space that could take out our satellites or cyber attacks that could hit our critical infrastructure, we have to be prepared,” said Waltz.

Waltz said the cyber attack should be a wakeup call for federal lawmakers to start considering whether the number of health care payment processors should be expanded to ensure a future attack won’t have such widespread impacts.

For veterans like Rutland, they’re just hoping things get back to normal as soon as possible.

“Everything is not running the way it’s supposed to be running. And there has been a hack and they’re telling me there has been a hack. Okay, so I can understand that now. So, what can we do to expedite the situation?” said Rutland.

The Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation into UnitedHealth Group, according to The Wall Street Journal.

The WSJ report said investigators in recent weeks have been interviewing healthcare industry representatives in sectors in which UnitedHealth competes, including physician groups, according to people with knowledge of the meetings.

Optum includes about 90,000 physicians, according to the report.

Questions include the effect of Optum Health's physician group acquisitions on rivals and consumers. Investigators have also asked whether UnitedHealthcare favored Optum-owned groups in its contracting practices and whether Optum's ownership of providers presents challenges to health insurers that are rivals to UnitedHealthcare, the report said.

WHY THIS MATTERS

The report highlights the Biden administration's efforts to step up antitrust investigations in healthcare.

In July, President Biden issued an executive order aimed at cracking down on hospital and health insurance consolidations and other actions deemed to decrease competition and drive up prices. The four areas of healthcare targeted are: prescription drugs, hospital consolidation, health insurance consolidations and hearing aids.

THE LARGER TREND

In June, home health and hospice company Amedisys announced its intent to combine with Optum in a deal valued at $3.3 billion.

The acquisition is being scrutinized by the DOJ.

Empower Healthcare Know Your Numbers by Heart Event

Pahokee, Fla. February 28, 2024– On February 3, 2023, the Empower Healthcare clinic in Pahokee, FL, partnered with Healthier Glades, a Palm Health Foundation initiative, for “Know Your Numbers by Heart,” a special event to promote heart health during American Heart Month. Fifty attendees came to the Senior Resource Room in Pahokee for rapid A1C and cholesterol screenings, nutritional counseling, live CPR demonstrations, and education about preventing heart disease. Testing and information were provided by seventeen community partners, including the American Heart Association, Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, and the Diabetes Coalition of Palm Beach County.

According to the 2022 Palm Beach County, Florida Community Health Assessment, heart disease was the leading cause of death in Palm Beach County. What’s more, Black Americans—the majority in Pahokee—are 54% more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than White Americans, due to distinct risk factors like genetics and systemic disparities.

Empower Health, under the leadership of its founder Dr. Jinga Oglesby-Brihm, has been focused on comprehensive and innovative chronic disease management for the rural Glades community since the clinic opened on the campus of First United Methodist Church in 2022. The heart health event is one of many ways she integrates local and county partners to improve patient health education and access to care. “We are grateful for the opportunity to connect with the community to provide free potentially lifesaving screenings and educational sessions,” she said.

Healthier Glades and Palm Health Foundation have invested in Dr. Oglesby-Brihm to support her goal to “break the chains of healthcare disparity.” A Healthier Glades mini-grant provided funding to deliver healthcare services through churches in the Glades, and a Palm Health Foundation scholarship supported her doctoral studies at FAU College of Nursing, her first exposure to the Glades’ healthcare disparities.

Dr. Oglesby-Brihm’s comprehensive, innovative care for the rural Glades community has also captured national recognition. She placed second in the American Heart Association’s 2022 Empowered to Serve Business Accelerator, awarding her training and a grant of $25,000 to help her grow her health clinic.

“Dr. Oglesby-Brihm and Empower Healthcare are building a culture of health in the Glades by building trust,” said Annie Ifill, Healthier Glades project director. “Her love of the people of our region and her approach to delivering health and services through her clinic and out in the community through events like “Know Your Numbers by Heart,” are helping to overcome disparities and lead the way to a better quality of life.”

The BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware gang has officially claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (UHG), which led to an ongoing outage affecting the Change Healthcare platform.

Change Healthcare is the largest payment exchange platform used by more than 70,000 pharmacies across the United States. UHG is the world's largest healthcare company by revenue, employing 440,000 people worldwide and working with over 1.6 million physicians and care professionals in 8,000 hospitals and other care facilities.

In a statement published on their dark web leak site today, BlackCat said that they allegedly stole 6TB of data from Change Healthcare's network belonging to ""thousands of healthcare providers, insurance providers, pharmacies, etc.""

""Being inside a production network one can imagine the amount of critical and sensitive data that can be found. The data relates to all Change Health clients that have sensitive data being processed by the company,"" BlackCat said.

The ransomware gang claims that they stole source code for Change Healthcare solutions and sensitive information belonging to many partners, including the U.S. military's Tricare healthcare program, the Medicare federal health insurance program, CVS Caremark, MetLife, Health Net, and tens of other healthcare insurance providers.

Per BlackCat's claims, the sensitive data stolen from Change Healthcare contains a wide range of information on millions of people, including their:

On a dedicated status page, Optum warned hours before this article was published that they're still working on restoring impacted systems to bring them back online, adding that Optum, UnitedHealthcare, and UnitedHealth Group systems have not been affected.

While UnitedHealth Group VP Tyler Mason did not confirm that BlackCat was behind the incident, Mason told BleepingComputer earlier this week that 90% of the affected 70,000+ pharmacies have switched to new electronic claim procedures to address the Change Healthcare issues.

Today, BlackCat also denied that affiliates who breached Change Healthcare's network used a critical ScreenConnect auth bypass flaw (CVE-2024-1709), as BleepingComputer was told earlier this week by sources familiar with the investigation.

On Tuesday, the FBI, CISA, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) warned that Blackcat ransomware affiliates primarily target organizations in the U.S. healthcare sector.

""Since mid-December 2023, of the nearly 70 leaked victims, the healthcare sector has been the most commonly victimized,"" the three federal agencies said.

""This is likely in response to the ALPHV Blackcat administrator's post encouraging its affiliates to target hospitals after operational action against the group and its infrastructure in early December 2023.""

The FBI previously linked BlackCat to over 60 breaches during its first four months of activity (between November 2021 and March 2022) and said the gang raked in at least $300 million in ransoms from over 1,000 victims until September 2023.

The U.S. State Department now offers up to $15 million for tips that help identify or locate BlackCat gang leaders and individuals linked to the group's ransomware attacks.

The U.S. government is warning about the resurgence of BlackCat (aka ALPHV) ransomware attacks targeting the healthcare sector as recently as this month.

""Since mid-December 2023, of the nearly 70 leaked victims, the healthcare sector has been the most commonly victimized,"" the government said in an updated advisory.

""This is likely in response to the ALPHV/BlackCat administrator's post encouraging its affiliates to target hospitals after operational action against the group and its infrastructure in early December 2023.""

The alert comes courtesy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The BlackCat ransomware operation suffered a major blow late last year after a coordinated law enforcement operation led to the seizure of its dark leak sites. But the takedown turned out to be a failure after the group managed to regain control of the sites and switched to a new TOR data leak portal that continues to remain active to date.

It has also ramped up assaults against critical infrastructure organizations in recent weeks, having claimed responsibility for attacks on Prudential Financial, LoanDepot, Trans-Northern Pipelines, and UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Optum.

The development has prompted the U.S. government to announce financial rewards of up to $15 million for information leading to the identification of key members as well as affiliates of the e-crime group.

BlackCat's ransomware spree coincides with the return of LockBit after similar disruption efforts led by the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) last week. Zscaler ThreatLabz said the ransomware gang has updated its encryptor's ransom notes with TOR URLs pointing to the new infrastructure.

According to a report from SC Magazine, the threat actors breached Optum's network by leveraging the recently disclosed critical security flaws in ConnectWise's ScreenConnect remote desktop and access software.

BlackCat, however, has refuted that it used ConnectWise flaws in its attack against Optum. ""For all those cyber intelligence so called expert dumbasses we did not use ConnectWise exploit as our initial access so you should base your reports you tell people on actual facts not kiddi speculations,"" it claimed.

The flaws, which allow for remote code execution on susceptible systems, have been weaponized by the Black Basta and Bl00dy ransomware gangs as well as by other threat actors to deliver Cobalt Strike Beacons, XWorm, and remote management tools like Atera, Syncro, and even another ScreenConnect client.

The mass exploitation of the two vulnerabilities has also been complemented by adversaries exploiting ScreenConnect and deploying a new Windows variant of KrustyLoader, which was previously spotted as part of a campaign targeting critical vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure appliances.

Attack surface management firm Censys said, as of February 27, 2024, it observed no less than 3,400 exposed potentially vulnerable ScreenConnect hosts online, with a majority of them located in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, Germany, France, India, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Ireland.

""It's clear that remote access software like ScreenConnect continues to be a prime target for threat actors,"" Censys security researcher Himaja Motheram said.

The findings come as ransomware groups like RansomHouse, Rhysida, and a Phobos variant called Backmydata have continued to compromise various organizations in the U.S., U.K., Europe, and the Middle East. 

In a sign that these cybercrime groups are shifting to more nuanced and sophisticated tactics, RansomHouse has been found utilizing a custom tool dubbed MrAgent to deploy the file-encrypting malware at scale.

""MrAgent is a binary designed to run on [VMware ESXi] hypervisors, with the sole purpose of automating and tracking the deployment of ransomware across large environments with a high number of hypervisor systems,"" Trellix said. Details of MrAgent first came to light in September 2023.

Another significant tactic adopted by some ransomware groups is the sale of direct network access as a new monetization method via their own blogs, on Telegram channels, or data leak websites, KELA said.

It also follows the public release of a Linux-specific, C-based ransomware threat known as Kryptina, which surfaced in December 2023 on underground forums and has since been made available for free on BreachForums by its creator.

""The release of the RaaS source code, complete with extensive documentation, could have significant implications for the spread and impact of ransomware attacks against Linux systems,"" SentinelOne researcher Jim Walter said.

""It is likely to increase the ransomware builder's attractiveness and usability, drawing in yet more low-skilled participants to the cybercrime ecosystem. There is also significant risk that it will lead to the development of multiple spin-offs and an increase in attacks.""

(The story was updated after publication to include additional information about the exploitation of ConnectWise ScreenConnect flaws.)

In comparison to their traditional Medicare counterparts, Medicare Advantage patients are more likely to experience delays in care (22% vs. 13% for original Medicare). The delays in care for MA patients were largely due to the need to get prior approval, or authorization, according to a Commonwealth Fund survey.

MA beneficiaries are also less able to afford care due to copayments or deductibles (12% vs. 7% for original Medicare beneficiaries).  

The survey asked a nationally representative sample of 3,280 Medicare beneficiaries aged 18 and older about the value of their care as measured by access to benefits, services, providers, care coordination and satisfaction.

Among beneficiaries reporting a challenge in getting care, about a third in MA plans (33%) and a third in traditional Medicare (32%) said the problem occurred when trying to access primary care. Smaller shares said the challenge occurred when trying to get surgery (13% for MA plans and 15% for traditional Medicare), physical therapy or rehabilitative care (13% for both), or cardiology care (13% vs. 10%).

About one in six beneficiaries said they were told to go to urgent care because their provider had no appointments available, with no significant difference between people with MA or traditional Medicare (16% vs. 18%).

WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

By most measures, the federal government has always paid MA plans more than what it would cost to cover similar people in traditional Medicare, authors said. Although estimates vary, one study finds that plans were overpaid by more than $27 billion in 2023. These overpayments have raised questions about whether MA enrollees receive greater value that merits the extra cost to Medicare.

MA plans typically provide benefits not covered by traditional Medicare, such as some coverage for vision, hearing, or dental services, and they can help to coordinate enrollees' care, as well as limit their out-of-pocket costs for Medicare-covered benefits. Traditional Medicare, meanwhile, allows beneficiaries to see any provider without the need to obtain prior authorization or a referral – which MA plans often require – and offers a larger selection of Part D plans for prescription drug coverage.

Whether enrolled in Medicare Advantage or traditional Medicare, about two in three beneficiaries overall said their coverage has fully met their expectations, the survey found. Those who said it fell short of expectations pointed to a lack of coverage for needed services, high costs or uncertainty about what benefits are covered.

Three in five beneficiaries in MA plans and one-quarter in traditional Medicare said they were asked to undergo a health assessment, which most frequently resulted in a discussion with their doctor. Few said it resulted in any changes to their care plan or in more services or benefits being offered.

Seven in 10 beneficiaries in MA said they used some of their plan's supplemental benefits in the past year; three in 10 did not use any. Four in 10 reported using their dental or vision benefits or an allowance for over-the-counter medications.

Whether enrolled in Medicare Advantage or traditional Medicare, beneficiaries reported similar access to benefits, services and providers, as well as similar challenges and experiences. Overall, one-third of beneficiaries indicated their coverage fell short of their expectations.

THE LARGER TREND

While Medicare Advantage remains attractive to the healthcare industry due to strong growth, high revenue and earnings per member, profitability is on the decline, a Moody's analysis found this month.

MA performance has remained under pressure in 2023 because of a significant spike in utilization for most of the companies, which Moody's expects will result in lower full-year MA earnings for insurers. Adding to that is lower reimbursement rates for the first time in years that are likely to remain weaker in 2025 and 2026, which is credit negative.

Moody's analysts contend that MA may have ""lost its luster,"" citing as evidence Cigna's efforts to sell its MA business, even after a failed merger with Humana. Cigna recently announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Medicare Advantage, Supplemental Benefits, Medicare Part D and CareAllies businesses to Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) for about $3.7 billion.

Despite the challenges, MA remains popular with seniors, boasting lower out-of-pocket costs and premiums than traditional Medicare. Analysts cited a 2023 Milliman report showing annual estimated healthcare costs per beneficiary are $3,138 compared to $5,000 for traditional Medicare fee-for-service, and over $5,700 if a traditional Medicare beneficiary also buys a Medigap plan. Besides the lower cost, MA also offers additional benefits such as dental, vision and hearing, which are not covered by traditional Medicare.

MA membership has grown nationally at an annual rate of 8% to approximately 32 million, while traditional Medicare has declined at an average annual rate of 1%. Over that time, the percentage of people choosing MA has grown to 49% from 28%.

Last fall, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the Medicare Advantage, Part C and Medicare Part D Star Ratings that rank MA plans by the quality of health and drug services received by consumers. Thirty-one contracts for both Medicare Advantage and the Part D drug plan earned 5 stars, compared to 57 in 2023. Four contracts received the low overall ranking of 2 stars, the same number as in 2023.

She continued, ""Through the years I learned who Richard really was and the gifts he gave. Yes, he was the comedian I fell in love with, but he was also one of the most loving people I know. He would take time to tell the people he loved what they meant to him — especially in recent years. In between takes on ‘Curb,' he would tell me how special I was to him and how much he loved me.""

Hines concluded, ""To be loved by Richard Lewis. A true gift. I love you Richard.""

In 1989, he delivered a memorable performance at Carnegie Hall, appearing on stage with taped-together yellow legal pad papers for a two and a half hour set that led to two standing ovations.

The ""Howard Stern"" regular also produced comedy specials for HBO and Showtime, including ""I’m in Pain,"" ""I’m Exhausted, I’m Doomed,"" and ""Richard Lewis: The Magical Misery Tour.""

In addition to stand-up, Lewis acted regularly. He co-starred on the ABC series ""Anything But Love"" with Jamie Lee Curtis, and appeared in films like Mel Brooks' ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" as a deeply neurotic Prince John. Lewis also dabbled in dramatic roles, with a cameo in the Nicolas Cage drama ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" which led to his own indie film, ""Drunks,"" a picture that dealt with alcoholism.

Lewis was also open in his comedy about his addiction, alcohol and mental health struggles, something he detailed in his 2008 memoir ""The Other Great Depression"" and a follow-up, ""Reflections From Hell: Richard Lewis' Guide on How Not to Live,"" released in 2015.

Lewis wrote two memoirs that dealt with his mental health and addiction struggles, as well as his comedic style. (Timothy Norris)

The comedian sought treatment in 1994 for drugs and alcohol after a cocaine overdose and had been sober since.

In 2000, Lewis joined the recurring cast of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" created and written by and starring his friend David. Lewis played a fictionalized version of himself across the show's 12 seasons.

He also addressed his Parkinson's diagnosis and decision to retire from stand-up on X, saying in a video, ""I'm finished with stand-up, I'm focusing on writing and acting.""

Lewis added, ""I have Parkinson's disease, but I'm under a doctor's care and everything is cool, and I love my wife, I love my little puppy dog, and I love all my friends and my fans, and now you know where it's been at the last three and a half years.""

Former Boyzone star Shane Lynch has accused popstar Taylor Swift of engaging in demonic practices and satanic rituals during her sold-out shows and warned of the damaging effects such music has on children. 

“I think when you’re looking at a lot of the artists out there, a lot of their stage shows are satanic rituals live in front of 20,000 people without them realizing and recognizing,” Lynch recently told Ireland’s Sunday World.

“You’ll see a lot of hoods up and masks on and fire ceremonies. Even down to Taylor Swift — one of the biggest artists in the world — you watch one of her shows and she has two or three different demonic rituals to do with the pentagrams on the ground, to do with all sorts of stuff on her stage. … But to a lot of people it’s just art and that’s how people are seeing it, unfortunately."" 

The 47-year-old Irish singer said there’s a “lot of hidden satanic” messaging in music today, yet most listeners are oblivious to it. 

“When it comes to a lot of the music that’s out there at the moment — more of the hip-hop side of things — there is a lot of hidden satanic and a lot of evil within them, including down to the beats. It’s very real,” he said.

“Music attaches to your emotions,” Lynch added, “It has a connection to your spirit and how you feel. That’s why I’ve stopped listening to those types of music myself because it doesn’t suit my spirit.”

Lynch, a father of two and a professing Christian, warned that certain music is damaging to society in general and especially children. 

“It 100 percent has an effect on society. I think our society has never been worse in many areas, and it starts from our children,” he said. 

“It’s coming in right at our children from the very beginning to get them to sway away from anything Godly, anything controlled or disciplined. It’s getting wilder and wilder out there for a reason. … Music is dangerous.”

Swift, 34, has previously been accused of promoting demonic activity through her music; in her 2020 “Willow” music video, she is shown observing an occult ritual and previously said the song “sounds like casting a spell to make someone fall in love with you.”

In one remix of the song, she posted a photo of herself on social media with the caption, “Witches be like ‘Sometimes I just want to listen to music while pining away/sulking/staring out a window.’ It’s me. I’m witches.”

She also referenced witch hunts in her 2017 album Reputation.

""They’re burning all the witches, even if you aren’t one,"" she sings in the song “I Did Something Bad.”

A 2023 nationwide survey of 1,011 adults found that 74% of respondents said they believe in God, 69% said they believe in angels, 67% expressed belief in Heaven, and 58% said they believe in the devil.

Kira Fontana, who worked as a vocal coach to major labels and shows such as ""Glee"" and ""The Voice"" before embracing Christianity, told The Christian Post that the longer she spent in the music industry, the more disillusioned she became by the darkness she witnessed all around her. 

“It’s darker than most people could ever imagine,” Fontana said. “If you look at the content of the lyrics of the songs that are played on the radio, it’s unbelievably immoral and dark and anti-Jesus. When I started to see the sheer percentage of songs and videos that were leaning heavily in that direction, I came to recognize that it could not be an accident. People in very powerful positions are backing it; there are gatekeepers who are wanting this content that we hear now to be prevalent in our society.”

“It’s akin to poisoning our community, and our kids are drinking from a very, very, very destructive cup,” she said. “I saw the effect on kids as I worked in the city, and that effect is spreading. LA is the communication center for this planet; when you go to other countries, you still see content made in Los Angeles. It became a really heavy responsibility.”

“People can try to minimize what comes out of Hollywood and say, ‘Oh, it’s just entertainment,’ but it has a tremendous effect on the psyches and souls of our young people,” she said. “The Church needs to stand up against this darkness because it’s truly having a devastating effect on the next generation.”

TV's ""Wonder Woman"" has high hopes for the upcoming film adaptation starring Gal Gadot. Learn why in our exclusive interview above, then stay tuned for Carter's thoughts on STILL being recognized as Wonder Woman after all these years.

It's been just over three years since Lynda Carter's husband, Robert Altman, passed away from a rare form of leukemia. The original ""Wonder Woman"" is still navigating her grief, and finding new ways to honor her late love.

While she's best known for her time on the small screen, Carter is also a singer, and has written a new song as a tribute to Altman. 

""The soul of the song is about how you miss a person so much, because they're such a presence in your life that it's almost impossible to imagine that you won't physically see them again in this life,"" she told People magazine.

""You wonder, 'How can I communicate with you? Where are you? You didn't just die — there's too much of you left on this earth, too many people that love you.'""

On Valentine's Day, Carter announced her new single, ""Letters from Earth,"" on her social media.

""I've been singing for over 50 years,"" she told the outlet. ""I started singing in clubs when I was 14, and was writing music before I became an actor.""

To this day, she has a hard time resolving that Altman isn't just off somewhere else. 

""He was the great love of my life,"" she prefaced to People. ""I think of him every day. There's so much of my day to day where I find myself thinking, 'Oh Robert will know.' Or if I'm on a flight, I still expect him to text to ask, ‘Did you land safely? Was everything alright?’""

""He was this very calm, great, kind of an even-keeled person, and he liked my personality and the things I'd come up with. It was an interesting life together,"" she said of the couple's nearly three-decade relationship. ""We did fun things and we laughed and laughed. We had children, wonderful friends.

Las Vegas will be without one of its resident performers next month. 

In a statement shared on social media, Adele regretfully informed her followers that she has to postpone her ""Weekends with Adele"" residency for the entirety of March, due to ongoing health issues.

""Sadly I have to take a beat and pause my Vegas residency,"" she wrote. ""I was sick at the end of the last leg and all the way through my break. I hadn't quite gotten the chance to get back to full health before shows resumed and now I'm sick again.""

She noted in the caption that she'd miss her fans ""like mad"" and that she's ""sorry for the inconvenience.""

A representative for the ""Rolling In The Deep"" singer did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for further comment.

Adele initially announced this residency in 2021, only to stun and disappoint fans months later by postponing the tour in its entirety. In an emotional video shared by the British star, Adele told fans that the caliber of her show was not up to par and that she and her crew wouldn't be ready to begin on time.

Adele's revamped residency finally began in November 2022, with the singer announcing the first extension of her stay in March 2023. In October, she announced her final stint would run from January through June 2024.

Just last month, Adele informed her fans that when her residency concludes in Vegas, she's off to Munich, Germany, to perform a series of shows. 

""I haven’t played in Europe since 2016! I couldn’t think of a more wonderful way to spend my summer and end this beautiful phase of my life and career with shows closer to home during such an exciting summer,"" she wrote of the opportunity.

Even Adam Sandler sometimes gets nervous when meeting A-list celebrities.

Most notably, Taylor Swift. The ""Spaceman"" actor revealed he gets a ""little f---ing jumpy"" around the pop star in a new interview.

""Taylor Swift because of what she means to my kids, I get a little f---ing jumpy, because I don't want to blow it for my kids,"" Sandler said during an appearance on SiriusXM's ""Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend."" ""I talk a little too loud. I don't act as cool as I can.""

""I can see that,"" O'Brien responded, noting how famous Swift has become. ""I mean, she's this whole other level now.""

Sandler compared Swift to The Beatles, specifically how people knew all of their songs.

""People talk about The Beatles of it all and her. I mean, f---, so many smash hits. There's not a word my kids don't know.""

O'Brien admitted his daughter knows all of Swift's songs as well.

""I know them too, by the way,"" Sandler quipped, before adding, ""but they know them inside and out. But remember The Beatles… every single song on the record you knew — that's Taylor Swift too. There's not a song you skip. You go, ‘Oh that one's pretty cool.'""

Prince Harry has lost a High Court challenge against the British government concerning his level of security protection while in the UK. The Duke of Sussex attempted to overturn the ruling, which declared his security be downgraded as he is no longer a “working royal.” His lawyers argued there was an unfairness in the decision, while the Home Office previously stated that his security was determined on a case-by-case basis. The challenge was made in December 2023 when the Home Office told Prince Harry that he would still be eligible for publicly funded police security. However, these would be ""bespoke arrangements, specifically tailored to him."" According to the court documents, Judge Sir Peter Lane stated that the Prince’s lawyers had taken ""an inappropriate, formalist interpretation."" The ruling also found that the ""'bespoke' process devised"" for Prince Harry by the Royal and VIP Executive Committee ""was, and is, legally sound.""

A significant majority of media consumers around the world want more accurate and respectful portrayals of faith and religion in entertainment and believe Hollywood often promotes negative “stereotypes,” a new study has found. 

A global study conducted by HarrisX in collaboration with the Faith and Media Initiative, which surveyed nearly 10,000 entertainment consumers across 11 countries, found that 68% of viewers worldwide believe it’s important to showcase diverse religious perspectives in TV and movies.

However, religious identity is seen as the least represented yet most sensationalized aspect of identity in entertainment. Eighty percent of respondents said they want to see the entertainment industry work to improve portrayals of faith to ensure accuracy and authenticity.

Among Americans, a staggering 69% of consumers feel that television and movies perpetuate religious stereotypes, a sentiment also felt by 63% of viewers globally.

Consumers also expressed a keen interest in seeing their religious identity portrayed on screen in ways that go beyond stereotypes and sensationalism. The study indicates a strong desire for content that fosters understanding and dialogue, with 61% believing that TV and movies can serve as platforms for conversations between different faiths. 

Furthermore, 59% report learning something new about another religion through entertainment, underscoring the medium's educational potential.

Respondents suggested three key approaches for the entertainment industry to address these concerns: Developing more diverse characters and storylines that include a range of religious experiences, employing writers and creatives who share the religious backgrounds of the characters they portray, ensuring authenticity and consulting with religious experts to enhance the accuracy of faith-based content.

Brooke Zaugg, executive director of the Faith & Media Initiative, highlighted the global demand for accurate portrayals of faith and spirituality and called on the industry to embrace the audience. 

""This research shows there is an untapped market in entertainment media,"" she said. ""Across the globe, consumers are looking for more accurate portrayals of faith and spirituality. This isn't about creating faith content, [but] rather adding faith fluency and diverse storylines to all types of TV and movies. We urge the entertainment industry to take notice of this enormous global audience; it's not just good business but also a priceless opportunity to unify people when the world feels increasingly divided.""

In a 2023 interview with The Christian Post, author and pastor Voddie Baucham noted that Hollywood often portrays Christians in a manner that reflects the narrative it wants to promote, from the Bible-thumping evangelist to the cartoonish televangelist — stereotypes he outlined in his 2004 book, The Ever-Loving Truth: Can Faith Survive in a Post-Christian Culture?.

“Nothing has changed since then,” he said. “There are certain versions of Christianity that are seen as acceptable, and they are watered down, social gospel, food bank,  liberal political activist kind of versions of Christianity. These things have always been OK because they remove the offense of the Gospel. Once the offense of the Gospel is there, then all of a sudden, we're outside the camp. These stereotypes are still there, and these stereotypes speak volumes as to the way that culture not only views us but wants to view us.”

In a recent interview with CP, Andy Erwin, the producer behind “Ordinary Angels” and “Jesus Revolution,” said the success of these films and the star power they attract are evidence of Hollywood's awakening to the underserved faith community and desire to respectfully depict Christians in media.

“I think it's really a moment in time where there's been a group of individuals that have all been trying to work behind the scenes to tell stories of faith. But collectively, whether it's through ‘The Chosen’ or ‘Sound of Freedom,’ or what we did with ‘Jesus Revolution,’ all of a sudden, it's been legitimized,” he said. 

“We're so grateful to have a partner in Lionsgate that has really invested so many resources into this community to tell stories that are mainstream relatable. So to have a two-time Oscar winner like Hillary Swank, to have Alan Ritchson, who's one of the hottest actors on the planet right now, both telling a story of faith and doing it unapologetically — that's what we've worked for, and it’s being heard by the industry. As we support these films in the theaters, there's an opportunity for the movies to get bigger and bigger.”

Great news for former CNN host, Don Lemon after being fired from CNN in April of last year. Reportedly, CNN and Lemon have settled on a separation deal that would pay Lemon approximately $24.5 million, which is the amount that was left on Lemon’s contract at CNN when he was fired. That’s three and a half years’ worth of salary, which equals to $24.5 million. Lemon recently announced plans to launch “The Don Lemon Show” podcast on the X platform and promises that his podcast will allow him to be “bigger, bolder, freer.” His podcast starts on March 11th.

In sad news, our condolences and prayers are going out to the family of City Councilman Eric Mays of Flint, Michigan. Mays died over the weekend at age 65 of natural causes stemming from an illness, according to his family. Flint’s Mayor Sheldon Neeley said Councilman Eric Mays’ bold and courageous service made him beloved among his constituents and his strong presence will be missed at City Hall. Mays’ older sister said Mays leaves behind a legacy in Flint for being funny, generous and outspoken. She said she will miss her brother’s loud voice and laugh, along with the craziness he brought to the family.

And finally… Probably the most flashy Bishop of all time had his first day in court this week… Bishop Lamor Whitehead’s federal court trial started on Monday in New York. Almost two years ago, Whitehead was indicted for wire fraud, attempted extortion, and for making false statements to fund his opulent lifestyle.

Jon and Andy Erwin, the producers behind ""Ordinary Angels,"" wanted the Lionsgate/Kingdom Story film to serve as a follow-up to their 2023 hit film ""Jesus Revolution,"" a tangible example of what Christian service should look like after spiritual transformation.

And without being too heavy-handed or overly preachy, ""Ordinary Angels,"" starring Hilary Swank and Alan Ritchson, does exactly that. 

Based on a true story, ""Ordinary Angels"" opens in 1990s Louisville, Kentucky, where Ed Schmitt (Ritchson) is saying goodbye to his wife, Theresa, who is dying due to a rare liver disease. It's the same disease the younger of their two daughters, Michelle, has, and the only cure is a liver transplant. Unfortunately, the medical bills are overwhelming, and Ed, a roofer, can't keep up. 

Viewers are then introduced to Sharon Stevens (Swank), a hairdresser battling alcoholism who has a fractured relationship with her son. She encounters the Schmitt family's ordeal in the local newspaper at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. She quickly discovers her new purpose: aiding the Schmitt family in getting Michelle the life-saving treatment she needs. 

Michelle's plight becomes the catalyst for Sharon's journey toward purpose and self-discovery. Her initial gesture of organizing a fundraiser at her hair salon is just the beginning of her relentless efforts to support the family despite Ed's resistance (he doesn't understand why Sharon would meddle in the lives of people she barely knows). 

Taking on roles far beyond those of a hairdresser, she becomes an indispensable source of hope and assistance to the Schmitts, raising significant funds, advocating for their cause and managing their finances, though sometimes her tactics aren't the most scrupulous.

In one scene, she tells Ed that some bills are worth ignoring. They're ""like wine,"" she says. ""They get better with age.""

Yet, this journey is not without its challenges. Sharon's compulsion to help mirrors her struggles with addiction — a fact she's soon confronted with — and avoidance of her own fragile familial relationships, suggesting a complex path toward redemption and healing.

Ed, meanwhile, embodies the tireless love and dedication of a father facing the worst fears imaginable. He works tirelessly to provide for his daughters and to maintain a semblance of normalcy in their lives despite experiencing his own grief. It's his crisis of faith  — how can a good God allow such terrible things to happen — and the local church's efforts to support the Schmitts that highlight the profound questions of suffering and divine presence in times of hardship.

""My faith? You know how many prayer lists Theresa was on?"" he says in one scene. ""Seventeen. And now, they got Michelle on those same lists. Lots of good faith's doing me.""

Though a family-friendly movie, ""Ordinary Angels"" does explore serious themes like addiction, grief, illness and despair. Sharon is shown drunk on several occasions, and in one particularly heartbreaking scene, Michelle vomits blood. Filmmakers don't shy away from portraying people realistically — messy, broken and in need of redemption. 

Yet, the film ultimately celebrates the extraordinary impact of compassion and action, highlighting the reality that anyone — even those battling their own demons — can make a difference in the lives of others. Sharon's journey from self-destruction to self-improvement, paralleled by her unwavering commitment to the Schmitt family, offers a message of hope amid brokenness and the transformative power of kindness.

Also central to the film's message is the theme of communal support, showcased in Sharon's initiative to host a fundraiser, which bridges the gap between her and Ed's family and rallies the broader community in a collective effort to uplift one of their own.

Ultimately, the helicopter equipped to bring Michelle to her life-saving treatment in the middle of a blizzard lands at the local church, thanks to the efforts of congregants who brave freezing weather to dig out a landing strip. 

Directed by Jon Gunn (""Case for Christ""), ""Ordinary Angels"" invites audiences to find beauty in imperfection and strength in adversity without feeling overly preachy, a rare feat in the world of historically neatly packaged faith-based films. 

The goal of ""Ordinary Angel,"" filmmakers told The Christian Post, is to encourage those who profess Christ to turn their faith into action, as ""faith without works is dead."" They said that even the most unlikely heroes can be an ""ordinary angel"" in their community. It's a powerful and timely message, yet one rarely made in film and media. 

""What makes a cheesy Christian film is the fact that, as Christians, sometimes we're scared to embrace struggle and tension, and all those things of being flawed individuals, to get to that place of hope or that place of redemption,"" Andy Erwin said.

""What we try to do with all of our movies is embrace the struggle. In this case, Sharon is a hot mess of a person, but she's also an 'ordinary angel' in Ed's life who finds her purpose in saving a little girl. I think it gives hope to the ordinary, everyday person that is flawed and struggling their way through life to find their calling and their purpose.""

""Ordinary Angels"" is now playing in theaters.

A slew of stars declined Jennifer Lopez' invitation to be featured in her new Amazon Original film This Is Me…Now: A Love Story, released earlier this month. According to Entertainment Weekly, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, and Snoop Dog, are just a few artists who turned down the cameo opportunity. The film, encompassing a multi-decade healing journey towards self-love, was released in tandem with the ""On The Floor"" hitmaker's ninth studio album on February 16th.

Lopez revealed that she believed the role would have been a ""big leap of faith"" for some of the artists who declined to be featured in the film. 

Lizzo, Jason Momoa, Jennifer Coolidge, Vanessa Hudgens, and Khloe Kardashian were also asked to be apart of the project and were either uninterested or ""unavailable."" Despite a handful of standouts turning down the invitation, many entertainment greats said yes to the opportunity. 

Entertainment Weekly mentioned that Jane Fonda, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Post Malone, Kim Petras, Keke Palmer, and Jenifer Lewis, all graciously accepted cameos in This Is Me…Now: A Love Story. 

The world-renowned actress gave fans an exclusive look behind the making of the film in a documentary titled The Greatest Love Story Never Told, available Amazon Prime Video as of Tuesday (February 27). During the documentary, Lopez revealed the names of the stars that chose to be apart of the film, and those who declined. The dazzling entertainer ""broke down in tears"" as she discussed the role that husband Ben Affleck played in boosting her confidence over the years. Despite their breakup in the early 2000's Affleck continued to positively influence Lopez' journey all the way through their rekindled romance in 2021 and their marriage in 2022. 

Fans can check out This Is Me…Now: A Love Story, currently streaming on Amazon Prime, for deeper look into JLo's journey. ","{'href': 'https://litefm.iheart.com', 'title': 'iHeart'}"

Charlie Health analyzes data that highlights how virtual mental health care has grown since the pandemic, plus offers tips on how to find a behavioral telehealth option.

Since the onset of the pandemic, telehealth has become ubiquitous within the health care landscape, including in mental health care. In some parts of the United States, the proportion of mental health treatment facilities providing telehealth services more than doubled between 2019 and 2022, data shows.

While many policies increasing the availability of telehealth services were temporary, expiring with the COVID-19 public health emergency last May, virtual mental health care has staying power. Telehealth utilization has remained above pre-pandemic levels in recent years, and most U.S. senators backed a bill in June 2023 that would expand telehealth services nationwide.

Though telehealth services have expanded over time, disparities still exist. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly four in 10 American adults used telehealth services in 2021, but usage was significantly higher among white adults compared to Asian, Black, and Hispanic adults. Also, telemedicine use was highest among those living in the Northeast and West, and usage typically increased with education level and family income.

Below, Charlie Health culled five statistics that shed light on the rise and state of virtual mental health care. We also offer some tips for finding accessible, virtual mental health services. Whether you're a virtual care novice or expert, it's important to stay informed about the state of telehealth and know how to get needed mental health services. 

1. Up to 20% more people got help for common mental health conditions during the first year of the pandemic 

Throughout 2020, more people sought help for anxiety, depression, and adjustment disorders, with a 10 to 20% increase by the year's end, data shows. According to the researchers, this increase is primarily due to a surge in behavioral telehealth services, as more than half of people sought mental health care virtually (compared to the less than 4% of Americans who had a telehealth visit in 2019). The biggest jump in care (20%) was among those with anxiety, which aligns with earlier data showing anxiety as the most common mental health effect of the pandemic. 

2. Insurance and race-based disparities exist in virtual mental health care 

Although telehealth expanded access to behavioral health services during the pandemic, disparities still exist, particularly on the basis of insurance type and race. According to the study above, mental health facilities that accepted Medicaid were less likely to offer telehealth services over the study period than those that accepted private insurance. Also, mental health facilities in counties with a higher proportion (>20%) of Black residents were less likely to offer telehealth services than those with fewer Black residents. 

3. 8 in 10 clients find telehealth as effective as in-person mental health care

A study of patients in a telehealth treatment program for substance use disorder (SUD) found that eight in 10 participants (82%) said telehealth visits met their needs ""equally well"" or ""better"" than in-person visits. Even more participants (86.2%) said they were ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with the quality of their virtual mental health care program. 

4. Nearly half of clinicians think virtual behavioral health treatment is as effective as in-person care

A study following nearly 400 behavioral health clinicians from June 2020 to May 2021 found in the final survey that nearly half believed virtual and in-person treatments were equally effective. This marked a major shift in the perception of virtual treatment efficacy over time. Only about one in 10 (13%) saw telehealth as more effective than traditional care in June 2020, but by May 2021, that number had risen to three in 10 (30%). 

5. 8 in 10 mental health clinicians plan to continue with virtual treatment

In that same study, the vast majority of clinicians (88.3%) said they were ""somewhat"" or ""very"" likely to continue providing mental health care virtually as of May 2021. This data highlights an increase of nearly half in the likelihood of providing virtual care during the course of the study. 

Virtual mental health care is here to stay and can be an accessible alternative to in-person care. If you're interested in starting therapy or another kind of mental health care option virtually, here are three tips for how to get started: 

1. Do some research 

You can search online, ask for recommendations from friends or family, or consult your primary care physician and insurance company to find a virtual mental health provider or platform that offers teletherapy services. 

2. Choose a provider and schedule an appointment

Once you find potential providers, consider factors like their qualifications, experience, cost, and the types of therapy they offer. Make sure they accept your insurance if you have it. Then, contact the provider or platform to schedule an appointment. Many offer online scheduling tools or phone lines for booking. 

3. Make sure your tech is ready to go 

Ensure you have the necessary technology for virtual sessions, such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet with a reliable internet connection. You may also need to download specific software or apps for video calls.

Wendy Williams' family are hoping to remove her from the treatment facility where she is currently living because they want to ""take care of her"".

The 59-year-old TV star is under the care of a court-appointed guardian as she battles health conditions including primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia, but her brother Tommy Williams claims she's ""stuck"" in the system and being kept apart from her relatives who only get minimal contact with her.

Tommy has now declared they are trying to ""unstick"" her, telling UsWeekly: ""I know that she is stuck and we are trying to unstick her. Her family is here and she doesn’t need a facility. We are here to take care of her. All I want for her is freedom. We have a father who would love to see her ...

""We’re dealing with unknowns. We just want to be able to check in with her. I would fly up there [to see her] , but where do I go? No one knows anything.""

He added of the communication issues: ""We can’t communicate unless someone patches us through. We wait for calls. I wait for calls from Wendy or my sister or whoever she can get to first and we can all hop on. When she makes that phone call [to us], we’re committed to listening and sharing for the moment.""

Wendy, 59, was diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia - a rare condition that affects the nervous system and inhibits the ability to communicate - and frontotemporal dementia - which affects personality, behaviour and language - last year but the diagnosis was only recently made public.

She broke her silence on her health battle in a statement released on Friday (23.02.24) in which she thanked fans for the well wishes and insisted she needs ""personal space and peace"".

The statement read: ""I want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Let me say, wow! Your response has been overwhelming.

""The messages shared with me have touched me, reminding me of the power of unity and the need for compassion. I hope that others with FTD may benefit from my story.

""I want to also thank the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration for their kind words of support and their extraordinary efforts to raise awareness of FTD. I continue to need personal space and peace to thrive. Please just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.""

Buddy Duress has died aged 38.

The actor - who was known for his roles in the likes of 'Heaven Knows What' and 'Good Times' - passed away in November 2023 of a ""cardiac arrest from a drug cocktail"".

His brother Christopher Stathis has confirmed the tragic news to People magazine.

Duress' first acting role came in Benny and Josh Safdie's 2014 film 'Heaven Known What', having met Josh the previous year after being released from New York City's Rikers Island prison after serving time on drug charges.

He had gone on the run rather than attending a drug in-patient programme, and met Josh through a mutual friend before landing the role.

After the movie was finished, he was caught by police and taken back to Rikers Island.

He previously told SSense: ""You know, I still look back at it. If I had went to that programme, I wouldn’t have been in Heaven Knows What, and I probably wouldn’t be an actor right now. That’s the honest truth. I wouldn’t.""

After he was released from prison, the Safdie brothers asked him to write a journal about his time behind bars, and they adapted his stories into 'Good Times', in which he starred with Robert Pattinson.

He continued to appear in more films - including 'The Mountain' and 'The Great Darkened Days' - before being arrested in 2019 on charges of grand larceny in the third degree, and he would

return to Rikers Prison.

In the same year, while Cameron Van Hoy's film 'Flinch' - he was arrested for threatening to burn down his mother Jo-Anne's home.

He was bailed out by his mother and Van Hoy, but not long after he was arrested and taken back to Rivers on charges of menacing and criminal posession of brass knuckles and a controlled substance.

Van Hoy admitted he was ""heartbroken"" to hear of Duress' death.

He told People: ""Buddy was pure electricity on screen. Working with him was one of the great adventures of my life.

""He was a kind person who loved making films. Despite any troubles he was going through in life he somehow managed to put them aside when it came time to work.

""We grew quite close after the production of our film Flinch. I’m heartbroken that his life came to an end as it did.""

He is set to appear in upcoming feature film 'Mass State Lottery', which will be released later in 2024.

The movie's director Jay Karales hailed him as a ""once in a lifetime charismatic actor and a genuinely humble man"".

He added to the outlet: ""What happened is a tragic and frustrating loss of visceral talent. He lived like a cowboy and carrying the weight of that kind of life informed his skills and performances in a way that made him irreplaceable as an actor.

""He has unfortunately become the John Cazale of our generation.""

Sportswashing claims 'very shallow' - Saudi minister speaks to BBC sports editor Dan Roan 

The ATP has announced a ""multi-year strategic partnership"" with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund as the state increases its involvement in professional tennis.

The ATP rankings, plus the year-end world number one award, will be named after Saudi's Public Investment Fund.

PIF on-court branding will be seen at some of the ATP Tour's biggest events, starting at Indian Wells next month.

The value of PIF's investment in the men's tour has not been revealed.

""Our strategic partnership with PIF marks a major moment for tennis,"" said ATP chief executive Massimo Calvelli. 

""It's a shared commitment to propel the future of the sport.""

PIF will also sponsor Tour events in Miami, Madrid and Beijing - part of the ATP 1000 circuit, the highest level beneath the Grand Slam events - as well as the season-ending ATP Finals.

Grass-court events held in the UK - including Queen's and Eastbourne - were also offered an on-court sponsorship deal with PIF, but the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) turned the opportunity down in January.

Saudi Arabia has invested huge amounts of money into football, golf, Formula 1 and boxing in recent years.

But the nation has long been criticised for its poor human rights record, particularly about its treatment of women and criminalisation of homosexuality.

Watch on iPlayer: Inside the Saudi Sporting Machine

Why is Saudi Arabia spending so much on sport?

The ATP already holds a professional event in Saudi Arabia after signing a five-year deal to host the Next Gen ATP Finals there last year, with the first edition held in Jeddah in November.

Several big-name stars have already played in lucrative exhibitions there, while a new event featuring Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and three other Grand Slam winners will take place in October.

Last month, 22-time major champion Nadal signed up as an ambassador for the Saudi Arabian Tennis Federation.

The partnership with the ATP could signal the start of further Saudi influence and investment, with PIF saying the move will be a ""catalyst for growth of the global tennis landscape"".

Mohamed al-Sayyad, PIF's head of corporate brand, believes it will also led to ""developing talent, fostering inclusivity and driving sustainable innovation"".

The WTA, which is the governing body of the women's tour, has drawn criticism for considering moving its season-ending finals to Saudi.

In January, tennis greats Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert wrote an opinion piece outlining their opposition to the WTA Finals being held in Riyadh.

Saudi's ambassador to the United States, Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, responded by saying the pair have ""turned their backs on women"" by opposing WTA events in the Gulf state.

Princess Reema told the pair to ""get your facts straight"" on matters of Saudi law affecting women, adding their arguments were ""based on outdated stereotypes and western-centric views of our culture"".

She did not address the pair's criticism of laws which criminalise the LGBTQ community.

Andy Murray says he is ""likely not going to play past this summer"" with the three-time Grand Slam champion in line to play at the French Open, Wimbledon and this summer's Olympics in Paris

Andy Murray says he's ""likely not going to play past this summer"" with the two-time Olympic gold medallist eyeing another run at Paris 2024.

Speaking after his defeat to Frenchman Ugo Humbert in the second round of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, he said: ""I'm likely not going to play past this summer. I get asked about it after every single match that I play, every single tournament that I play. I'm bored of the question, to be honest.""

The 36-year-old also confirmed he plans to play at this year's French Open where he was runner-up to Novak Djokovic eight years ago.

""I've had experiences through my career where I didn't play the French Open in 2013 and I won Wimbledon. I also played the French Open and did really well in 2016. I don't think it makes a huge difference if you get an extra week's practice or so on the grass. So yeah, I would like to play one more time,"" he confirmed.

Murray sparked speculation over his potential retirement on Monday when, after beating Denis Shapovalov in Dubai, he said: ""I probably don't have too long left, but I'll do as best as I can these last few months.""

The Scot has said previously he has an idea of when he would like to bow out, and he told Radio 4's Today programme he is likely to make that information public at some point.

""When the time is right I will probably say something before I play my last match and my last tournament,"" he said. ""Whether I say anything months ahead of the time, I don't know.""

Murray is also the only tennis player to have won back-to-back singles gold medals at the Olympics, at London 2012 and Rio 2016.

""Hopefully I can get the chance to compete at another one,"" he added.

The Paris Olympics start on Saturday July 27, less than two weeks after the end of Wimbledon, which runs from July 1 to July 14.

Murray has endured a difficult start to 2024, losing his opening four matches to see him slip down to 67th in the rankings. If he failed to qualify outright for the Olympics, he could seek a spot in the draw as a previous champion.

I don’t. But it seems to work for her.""And as the agent, we can only try to recommend and say, ‘Hey, this one did it this way.’ But they [the family] seem to be very comfortable in the way they are doing it and I have to respect that.""Maybe that changes and maybe it doesn’t. But she really is a hard worker. And tennis is her priority.""Yes, people want to see that she does other things.

Raducanu has suffered with form and fitness since she stunned the tennis world by winning the US Open at the age of 18.

She missed much of 2023 after undergoing surgery on both wrists as well as her ankle, not returning to action until early this January.

Emma Raducanu's agent admits he doesn't agree with her regular change of coaches

Raducanu has earned a reputation for not having a coach for an extended period of time in the first few years of her professional career.

Nigel Sears was the first coach she had between June and July 2021, with Andrew Richardson taking the role for three months between July and September that year.

Richardson was coach at Raducanu's US Open win and he was replaced by Torben Beltz, who lasted five months until April 2022.

Childhood coach Jane O’Donoghue returned to help Raducanu at Wimbledon in 2022 before Dmitry Tursunov took on the reigns between August and October.

Sebastian Sachs was next to be appointed and he lasted six months before they parted ways in June 2023.

Another of Raducanu's childhood coaches, Nick Cavaday, is now in the role having been reunited in January.

Eisenbud doesn't agree with Raducanu's approach but believes it works for her and is backing her for more Grand Slam glory.

Speaking on Andy Roddick's Served podcast, Eisenbud said: ""As the agent, do I necessarily agree with it? I don’t. But it seems to work for her.

""And as the agent, we can only try to recommend and say, ‘Hey, this one did it this way.’ But they [the family] seem to be very comfortable in the way they are doing it and I have to respect that.

""Maybe that changes and maybe it doesn’t. But she really is a hard worker. And tennis is her priority.

""Yes, people want to see that she does other things. But the way I see her work and how smart she is, I believe she’ll win more slams.""

Raducanu has struggled upon her return to playing, failing to get past the second round in any of the four tournaments she has played.

She crashed out of the Australian Open to China's Wang Yafan and is currently taking a short break after losing at the Qatar Open earlier this month.

The spotlight has been on Raducanu since her record-breaking win in New York two-and-a-half years ago.

But Eisenbud believes critics have been unfair to the Canada-born star and says she is still very inexperienced.

He added: ""The girl did everything backward. She skipped every step!

""She won the US Open, she went to the next tournament, she didn’t even know where the player lounge was, she didn’t know where the practice courts were.

""I don’t think just being tough on her or critical on her like any other player [is wrong].

""But she is still figuring it out. I just think that people should not be malicious.""

People say that crises bring opportunities. Many imagined a new-look Acapulco following the devastation of Hurricane Otis, an apocalypse that would usher in peace through the reconstruction of the city, or so the most optimistic people thought. However, the calm has not followed the storm, at least not yet. During these days, in which the battered pearl of the Pacific is staging the Mexican Tennis Open as a symbol of the yearned-for normality, all is still not well in the region. There are still long queues in supermarkets to exchange the vouchers issued by the government for food before they expire and many of those affected are waiting to be censused to receive the expected aid. Violence has resulted in various deaths in the last week alone, with the customary scenario of bodies shot to death or severed heads accompanied by narco-messages. Public and private transportation has ceased to operate on several occasions in protest against the attacks perpetrated by organized criminal groups. In the meantime, the governors have hailed the big Latin American tennis event with grandiose phrases: “The port lives, shines and will shine stronger than ever. We want a new Acapulco,” recently exclaimed the governor, Evelyn Salgado.

Hoteliers still estimate that it will take two years before they can run at full capacity, given the extent of the destruction caused by the hurricane that swept in from the sea in the early hours of October 26. Health officials are working tirelessly to bring to an end as soon as possible the dengue epidemic that caused the collapse of the health services. Acapulco is still struggling to get back on its feet, which is why the tennis tournament, hosted in the city since 2001, represents two sides of the coin. On the one hand, it is an opportunity to stimulate tourism and employment. On the other, it is evidence that basic needs and outbreaks of violence cannot be camouflaged with a sporting showcase.

“The Open only provides Acapulco with publicity. This year, the state government has earmarked 20 million pesos for its organization, but in reality it only benefits the people who are in its immediate environment,” says Óscar Ricardo Muñoz Cano, journalist of El Sur de Guerrero newspaper, over the phone. He says that there are around 11,000 families who benefit from the tennis, those who work in hotels, transportation, and so forth, but that the attendees are foreigners because there is not enough wealth in Acapulco for residents to afford the cost of the tickets. “In addition, practically everything is consumed indoors, in the enclosure, they do not usually go outside, they do not coexist,” by that he means the money they spend does not go far beyond the tennis courts in the enclosure. However, the players have had kind words of good fortune for Acapulco, and Stefanos Tsitsipas has promised to donate $1,000 for every ace he racks up. We can only wish him luck.

Days after the houses were swept away, the palm trees lay on the beach and the streets, the hotels were left with the bare skeleton of their structure and 56 lives were lost in the catastrophe (there are still many missing that may have been dragged down by the sea), there was still solidarity in the midst of the looting and plundering. The first weeks of devastation subsided and last Sunday, the navy announced that it was closing its collection centers from which it had supplied the population with basic goods and food, but the supply has not yet returned to normal and the reconstruction aid is not getting to everyone. Some of those affected attempted to block roads in protest because they were not being censused, and therefore did not receive what they were entitled to, they protested.

Around 10,000 national guards were assigned to the area at the time. Acapulco was already a barbaric region where organized crime had been gaining influence over the juicy profits from tourism, including drugs and prostitution, for years. The city lost its past splendor and the celebrities secluded themselves in certain privileged areas along the coast. The others left for other vacation destinations. Violence was becoming visible every afternoon, in full daylight. Hundreds of tourists, many arriving from the Mexican capital, looked on in astonishment as gunmen entered a local restaurant and killed a waiter, as an example. The deployment of the military on the beaches, uniformed and armed, had little effect, as they provided an unusual photo opportunity for beachgoers.

Perhaps nothing can stop crime. People thought at first, the hurricane that devastated the city would drive the corrupt narcos out of Acapulco and the community could rebuild itself with other social parameters. But this was not the case. The assassinations have been ongoing and there are many who believe that the economic gains from the reconstruction will provide a lifeline for the gang members and their diverse circle, which sometimes involves politics and the business sector. The crisis of violence in the transport sector certainly includes some of this. “We thought that with Otis’ battering they would have no one to extort money from, all the businesses closed, but they have targeted the transport sector,” says the journalist Muñoz Cano. Indeed, the mafias that fight over transportation have triggered numerous crises in Acapulco and the whole state of Guerrero, causing deaths and placing the state government in a complex situation. Burned taxis, murdered drivers. The state responds to each crisis by pledging to provide more police to reinforce the routes, but nothing can deter crime.

“We are still in trouble. Here we are doing what we can for the reconstruction, but private and public resources are not enough, they want to make out that we are fine, that they are opening hotels, but the most emblematic ones, such as the Princess or the Mundo Imperial are at 50%. The statistics include the very old, small guesthouses where groups of young people stay,” says Muñoz Cano. And he goes on to mention intermittent transport stoppages, violence and food aid. On a scale of 0 to 10? “Acapulco has always been a six or seven. What we have is resilience.”

In the last few days, the local news reported that the stolen mariachi frogs were recovered and were singing again. This news and the Tennis Open are the things to be most optimistic about in the area at present.

ATP, the men’s professional tennis tour, and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund agreed to a five-year partnership Wednesday that will make the country a major sponsor of the league, the latest in a series of moves by the kingdom to invest in professional sports.

Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has invested heavily in golf, soccer, and Formula 1 racing. 

As part of the deal, the PIF, the Saudi wealth fund, will have naming rights for the ATP rankings which were previously sponsored by Pepperstone, an Australian online trading firm, ATP said Wednesday.

PIF will partner with ATP for other events in Beijing, Indian Wells, Madrid and Miami, ATP said in a statement.

Before Wednesday’s announcement, Saudi Arabia had a deal to host the Next Generation ATP finals—a tournament for younger players—in Jeddah from 2023 to 2027.

Women’s tennis is also exploring the possibility of partnering with the Saudis. The WTA women’s tennis tour has reportedly been in negotiations with Saudi Arabia to play its WTA Finals in the country.

This is the latest in a series of investments the Saudi’s have made in professional sports in recent years. Most notably, the PIF made major investments in professional golf when they allocated billions of dollars to start LIV Golf, in 2022 as a direct competitor to the PGA Tour. With that money, LIV recruited some of the PGA Tour’s best known golfers and challenged PGA’s control of professional golf. Then competing golf tours surprised the world last year when they suddenly announced they were merging. The Saudis have made investments to host major soccer tournaments in their country including the 2027 Asian Cup and 2023 Club World Cup.The Saudi’s also appear interested in investing in Formula 1 after they signed a 10-year contract in 2020 to host a race in the country each year beginning in 2021. Bloomberg reported the PIF considered making a $20 billion bid for Formula 1 in 2022. This heavy investment in sports is part of Crown Prince Muhammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030, a government program aimed at diversifying the oil-rich country’s economy.

Some athletes have been critical of the growing relationship between professional sports and Saudi Arabia. The country has been accused of “sportswashing” or involving itself in sports in an attempt to distract from the country’s human rights violations. The United Nations Human Rights Council last month criticized Saudi Arabia’s restrictions on LGBTQ+ people—same-sex relations are punishable by death in Saudi Arabia and all forms of LGBTQ+ advocacy are banned in the country. The Saudis’ also faced criticism, including from President Joe Biden, over the purported role of bin Salman in the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
