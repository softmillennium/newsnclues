A week ago on Sunday, US President Trump made a mess of the crypto market but tweeting about a crypto reserve including Solana, Ripple and Cardano.

Shortly afterwards he added Ethereum and Bitcoin to the list. Throughout the week, everyone was looking for clarity but the White House later said that he just named the five largest-volume cryptos and that a plan was in the works. That led to a week of announcements that culminated in a long-rumored plan to hold cryptos that were already seized by the government rather than selling them.

Late on Friday, Trump signed the executive order and it's been a 'sell-the-fact' trade since, with bitcoin down about $3000 in the aftermath and carving out fresh lows at the moment.

The  order kept open the possibility of the government buying bitcoin in future but that may be difficult because it would likely require money from Congress.

The US Commerce and Treasury secretaries "are authorized to develop 
budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided 
that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American 
taxpayers," a factsheet on the White House website said.

Similarly, cardano has given back nearly all its post-tweet gains and has just fallen below the retracement low on March 4. Solana is at the lowest since late February and XRP is below pre-tweet levels.  Ethereum had given back Trump-pump gains the day after the announcement and is threatening the lowest levels since 2023.

The lesson here: The government is exit liquidity not entry liquidity.

Bitcoin and crypto prices—including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, solana’s SOL and cardano’s ADA—have flat-lined over the last week after Donald Trump revealed the cryptocurrencies that the U.S. was betting on, sparking market mayhem.

The bitcoin price has fallen back to around $85,000 per bitcoin, exactly where it was at the beginning of March (despite China quietly priming the bitcoin price for a major earthquake).

Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, Donald Trump’s crypto czar has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile.

“We’re going to move the [cryptocurrency owned by the U.S. government] to the digital stockpile,” David Sacks, a technology investor and entrepreneur who has joined the Trump administration as artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the job.

“The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship, it’s a place for safekeeping, it’s a centralized account under the direction of the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the value of these holdings.”

This week, after Trump’s surprise announcement that Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House has shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, cardano and solana.

"The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge
 fund manager so he’s going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and
 we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management," Sacks said.

Speaking at the much-hyped White House crypto summit this week, alongside Sacks and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin—placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve.

“I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said, it was reported by the New York Times. “We’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.”

In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

During Friday’s White House summit, Trump also called it "foolish" of the government to have previously sold so much of its seized bitcoin, while Sacks, speaking on the podcast, claimed the U.S. might have lost as much as $16 billion by selling off its bitcoin.

"At one point in time, we had about 400,000 bitcoin on the federal balance sheet. We sold roughly half of that for something like $360 million total," Sacks said during the podcast. "If we had held all of that, just that the portion we sold would be worth over $17 billion."

Ahead of the summit, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of the bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile using existing government holdings, disappointing traders with a lack of commitment to new bitcoin and crypto purchases though leaving the door open to acquiring more bitcoin though “budget neutral” methods that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers."

Sacks added during a press conference that the Treasury and Commerce department, led by bitcoin price bull Howard Lutnick, are only “allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.”

“The subpar strategic bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market,” Agne Linge, head of growth at crypto platform WeFi, said in emailed comments.

“With the executive order directing agencies to consolidate seized bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new bitcoin purchase was announced. Despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the fact is that the bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of bitcoin through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. The available options in this regard include bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves.”

Some have speculated that China is weighing the creation of its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race."

“The U.S. bitcoin reserve raises the likelihood of other nations adopting similar reserves and accelerates their consideration of such initiatives,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note.

“With the U.S. planning to adopt bitcoin reserves, this is likely to drive broader global adoption, with more nations integrating bitcoin into their reserves—potentially shifting from gold to digital assets, much like how some economies have embraced the U.S. dollar alongside or instead of their own currencies.”</p>

Michael Saylor took his Bitcoin evangelism to the White House on Friday, presenting his roadmap to an $81 trillion digital asset strategy at the administration’s first-ever crypto summit. 

His plan calls for the US to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic national asset, which he claims will help bolster the dollar, reduce national debt, and establish economic dominance.

Saylor’s proposal aligns with President Donald Trump’s executive order signed Thursday, which converts $17 billion in seized Bitcoin holdings into a strategic reserve and bans federal agencies from selling these Bitcoins. 

“From this day on, America will follow the rule that every Bitcoiner knows very well: never sell your Bitcoin,” Trump said.

Saylor argues that Bitcoin should be the foundation of a revamped US financial system that integrates digital tokens, securities, and currencies. 

He sees Bitcoin’s role as a digital commodity, attracting global capital flows and establishing the US as the financial epicenter of the 21st century. 

His vision includes programmatic government Bitcoin purchases, potentially securing up to 25% of the network by 2035.

To reach his $81 trillion projection, Bitcoin would need to surpass $15 million per coin, a valuation exponentially higher than today’s prices. 

In December, Saylor predicted that in this scenario, the digital asset market would expand to $280 trillion — around 100 times its current size — but provided no specifics on how he arrived at these figures.

Despite growing support, some investors expected more aggressive policy changes from the summit. 

Still, Saylor remains steadfast in saying that the United States has a chance to “dominate cyberspace and own the future.”
