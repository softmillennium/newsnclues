Potential Medicaid cuts could devastate America’s teetering rural health-care system and jeopardize Republicans’ political power among rural voters.

HONDO, Tex. — Jaylee Williams needed to find somewhere to deliver her son.

The 19-year-old knew more about barrel racing on her horse Bet-n-pep than the complicated metrics of who takes what health insurance. But relief for Williams and her boyfriend, Xander Lopez, came when they realized Medina Regional Hospital — just 15 minutes from their home — accepted Medicaid, the federal-state program that covers medical costs for lower-income Americans. Provider groups an hour away in San Antonio had refused to take the insurance, she recalled while cradling little Ryker.

“You never know when something could happen,” Williams said, with Lopez adding, “I have no idea where we would have gone” without Medina Regional Hospital.

But the lifeline that the 25-bed critical-access hospital offered to Williams and Lopez could disappear in Hondo and other communities like it.

Rural hospitals across the United States fear that massive Medicaid cuts Republicans would have to consider under the current House budget proposal could decimate maternity services or shutter already struggling medical facilities in communities that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump.

Nearly half of all rural hospitals nationwide operate at a deficit, with Medicaid barely keeping them afloat. Already, almost 200 rural hospitals have closed in the past two decades, according to the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, part of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Rural hospital leaders in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas who spoke to The Washington Post warned that the enormous cuts congressional Republicans are weighing could further destroy limited health-care access in rural America. Proposals to slash up to $880 billion over 10 years — which is expected to be accomplished largely by scaling back on Medicaid — would also affect those who do not rely on the program but do rely on the medical facilities that are financially dependent on the program’s reimbursements.

While Republicans are reluctant to acknowledge potential entitlement cuts due to possible political backlash, the House-passed budget proposal would almost certainly require Medicaid cuts, health-care analysts say.

“Every nickel matters,” said Benjamin Anderson, chief executive of Hutchinson Regional Healthcare System, which runs a rural hospital in Kansas. “It will cripple and close the health-care delivery systems that serve everyone.”

Heart attack and stroke victims may lose crucial time being ferried by ambulance to big-city hospitals, health-care experts say. Rural nursing homes may vanish, straining families in the poorest of regions. Those who are pregnant may have no choice but to drive long distances for prenatal checkups and to give birth.

Public perception often associates the health-care safety net used by more than 1 in 5 Americans with the urban poor. But rural children and non-elderly adults are more likely to rely on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) than those in metro areas, according to the Center for Children and Families at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.

The possible cuts are an “existential issue” for rural hospitals, said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association.

“Medicaid cuts are going to result in rural hospital closures,” he said. “It’s just a question of how many.”

Medina Regional Hospital sits in an 8,000-person agricultural town roughly an hour west of San Antonio, the drive between the two dotted with taxidermy signs, John Deere tractors and cattle. Per capita income comes in under $20,000 annually, according to the economic development director for the town.

The facility’s chief executive, Billie Bell, had considered closing the unit serving expectant mothers a few years ago. It’s a service the hospital already loses money on, Bell said, as the vast majority of obstetrics patients are on Medicaid, which does not reimburse the facility dollar for dollar for care. She managed to keep the unit open because she feared adding to the maternity health-care deserts in a state that far outpaces the nation in rising rates of maternal deaths.

More than 35 percent of U.S. counties don’t have birthing facilities or obstetric clinicians, according to a March of Dimes report. In Texas, that figure is even worse: Nearly half of the state’s counties are considered maternity-care deserts. Bell warned that cuts to Medicaid could shutter her unit completely.

“We’d lose a big heart of our community,” Bell said. “We provide care from the time someone is born until they die.”

Even if rural facilities manage to stay open but are forced to cut Medicaid-heavy services such as nursing homes or obstetrics care, more rural Americans — and Republican voters — will be left to deal with the consequences.

Some Republicans, such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) and Trump ally Stephen K. Bannon, have warned against gutting Medicaid, pointing to the vast number of Trump supporters who qualify for the program amid the populist wave that has transformed the GOP. The president has repeatedly said he will not touch Medicaid.

But he has also endorsed the House’s plan to find ways to cut spending across federal programs, which are expected to come out of the Medicaid program if lawmakers avoid cutting Medicare or Social Security. All three programs make up more than 40 percent of the federal budget. The House and Senate will work to reconcile their visions for cutting the federal budget in coming weeks.

The Republican Party suffered large congressional losses in 2018, the last time it tried Medicaid cuts, said KFF’s executive vice president for health policy, Larry Levitt, whose nonpartisan health-care research group surveyed Trump voters on Medicaid. Similar political reprisals could happen again, he warned.

“Rural America is Trump country,” Levitt said. “When they voted for Trump, I don’t think they expected cuts to their health care.”

In rural Hondo, whose slogan is “This is God’s country,” that kind of reaction wouldn’t be a surprise, said Mayor John McAnelly.

Hondo is the county seat of Medina County, where almost three-quarters of the presidential vote went to Trump. But if Medicaid cuts hurt Medina Regional Hospital, the answer would be pretty clear, the mayor said.

“Regardless of which party is in power, anytime you start doing those cuts, there’s going to be backlash,” McAnelly said.

Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas), who represents Hondo, has spoken with Bell about the plight rural hospitals face.

When asked to comment, his office pointed to a letter he had sent to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) urging him to support a budget that tackles waste without harming critical programs that support Americans.

“Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing homes are already struggling to keep their doors open,” Gonzales and other representatives wrote.

About three in four rural residents said Medicaid funding should increase or stay the same, KFF found in a poll released Friday.

With broad support for rural hospitals, there are likely to be carve-outs to protect them in a Republican reconciliation bill, said Brian Blase, an influential voice in the Medicaid debate. He served as a White House economic official in the first Trump administration and is now president of Paragon Health Institute, a right-leaning think tank, that is pushing for states to cover more Medicaid costs.

That support comes in part because when a rural hospital closes, communities don’t just lose their access to care — they often lose their economic lifeblood. Medina Regional Hospital is the largest employer in town and key to attracting businesses and young families essential to making Hondo thrive.

But items Republicans are proposing, such as work requirements, which often take people off Medicaid’s rolls, could impact its financial stability. During the coronavirus pandemic, states were required to keep people enrolled continuously in Medicaid to access enhanced federal funds. So when the public health emergency ended, millions were removed from Medicaid rolls, including many — particularly children — who probably remained eligible.

The Medicaid unwinding hit Medina Regional Hospital’s bottom line, said Kevin Frosch, the hospital’s chief financial officer. As people in his area came off the Medicaid rolls, they often got junk plans and were unable to pay for care, Frosch said.

Inside Medina Regional Hospital’s health clinic offices at the end of February, Chelsey Sullaway had her 37-week pregnancy checkup for her second baby, with her first daughter in tow.

Sullaway, who used to work at the hospital before becoming a stay-at-home mom, drives to Medina Regional Hospital for maternity care even though she lives in the San Antonio area. Sullaway isn’t on Medicaid, but she knows the hospital relies on its payments.

She voted red in the last election, but if the rural hospital she loved cut services, she would reconsider.

“It would impact votes for sure,” she said, as her daughter Vivian tried to climb on her.

As the sun set on a high school track meet in Hondo, two grandmothers watching their grandchildren race toward a chance at state glory laid out their opposing views on potential Medicaid cuts.

Leticia Garza said her mother told her never to talk about politics, because identifying herself as a Democrat wasn’t going to help her make any friends. Garza said she worries constantly about the cuts the Trump administration has made to federal services. She’s heard about women who are denied treatment for miscarriages and thinks about the future for her granddaughter.

When asked whether she thought this conservative small town would respond if Medicaid cuts impacted its health care, Garza said, “I’m hopeful that would change their votes.”

But her daughter, Nicole Garza, laughed, saying those voters have been “drinking the Kool-Aid too long.”

Across from the bleachers on the other side of the track, 66-year-old Sylvia Flores, an Air Force veteran who voted for Trump, said she trusted he would root out waste, fraud and abuse — rhetoric Republican leaders have often repeated when talking about potential Medicaid cuts.

Flores also noted that she had received quick care after a stroke at Medina Regional Hospital and hoped lawmakers “read before they sign” so cuts don’t affect “our little hospital.”

To Trump, she said, “Keep it up!”

Flores wasn’t alone in her concerns about waste, fraud and abuse — something the health-care community has experienced. Two administrators of the county’s local emergency medical service pleaded guilty in 2013 to fraudulently billing the government hundreds of thousands of dollars through Medicare and Medicaid for ambulance rides, including some that never happened.

However, health policy experts warn that even though there is waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, it doesn’t reach $880 billion. So while it’s important to go after bad actors, McAnelly said, the bigger picture matters.

“Go after the fraud, don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater,” the mayor added. “Everybody gets hurt on that. The leaders get hurt on it, the followers get hurt on it. The politicians, if you will, get hurt on it. The country gets hurt on it.”

Michael Haynie, who heads the local EMS company following the fraud fallout and works weekend shifts with his wife to keep the ambulances running, said he wasn’t sure that voters would connect the dots between Medicaid cuts and a decrease in access to hospital services. Even if they did, he said, people who qualify for Medicaid often have more pressing problems.

“Your typical Medicaid enrollee is not interested in what the news is saying about Medicaid,” Haynie said. “They’ve got more important things to worry about, like eating.”</p>

The majority of official documents signed by President Joe Biden allegedly used the same autopen signature, reinvigorating concerns over the former president’s mental acuity and if he "actually ordered the signature of relevant legal documents," a report published by an arm of the Heritage Foundation found.

"WHOEVER CONTROLLED THE AUTOPEN CONTROLLED THE PRESIDENCY," the Oversight Project, which is an initiative within the conservative Heritage Foundation that investigates the government to bolster transparency, posted to X on Thursday.

"We gathered every document we could find with Biden's signature over the course of his presidency. All used the same autopen signature except for the announcement that the former President was dropping out of the race last year. Here is the autopen signature," the group claimed on X, accompanied by photo examples.

Autopen signatures are ones that are automatically produced by a machine, as opposed to an authentic, handwritten signature.

'Embarrassingly Wrong': Liberal Media Figures Admit Being In Denial About Biden's Mental Decline

The Oversight Project posted three examples showing Biden’s signature, including two executive orders and the president’s announcement he was bowing out of the 2024 presidential race. The signature on the two executive orders, one of which was signed in 2022 and the other in 2024, showed the same signature that included what appeared to be a line, followed by "R. Biden Jr."

Biden’s signature on the document announcing his departure from the 2024 race varied from the other two posted by the Oversight Project, showing a signature that wasn’t as clear as the one on the executive orders.

Fox News Digital, at random, examined more than 20 Biden-era executive orders documented on the Federal Register’s office between 2021 and 2024 and found each had the same signature.

Lies About Biden's Age, Health During His Presidency Is A 'Scandal Of Epic Proportions,' Scott Jennings Says

Fox News Digital reached out to Biden’s office for comment on the Oversight Project’s findings on the autopen investigation, but did not immediately receive a reply on Sunday.

Fox News Digital also examined the signatures on President Donald Trump’s executive orders, which are often signed in public or in front of the media, during his first administration and second administration and found the signatures were also the same.

Biden and his administration, however, came under fierce concern and scrutiny over his mental acuity last year.

The year 2024 kicked off with Biden in the driver’s seat of the Democratic Party as he keyed up a re-election effort in what was shaping up to be a rematch against Trump. In February of that year, however, Biden’s 81 years of age and mental acuity fell under public scrutiny after years of conservatives questioning the commander in chief’s mental fitness.

Special counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents as vice president, announced he would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, calling Biden "a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."

The report renewed scrutiny over Biden’s mental fitness, which rose to a fever pitch in June 2024 after the president’s first and only presidential debate against Trump.

Biden Insider Exposes How White House 'Gaslit' The Public About Former President's Decline

Biden faced backlash for a handful of gaffes and miscues in the days leading up to his ill-fated debate against Trump, including former President Barack Obama taking Biden’s wrist and appearing to lead him off a stage during a swank fundraiser, and also abroad when Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni guided Biden back to a group of world leaders when he appeared to wander off to give a thumbs-up to a parachutist during the G-7 summit.

When the big debate day arrived, Biden missed his marks repeatedly, tripping over his responses and appearing to lose his train of thought as he squared off against Trump. The disastrous debate performance led to an outpouring from both conservatives and traditional Democrat allies calling on the president to bow out of the race in favor of a younger generation.

Biden dropped out of the race in July, with the signature on that official document showing it was noticeably different from the signature on his EOs.

Republican Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey sent a letter to the Department of Justice on Wednesday of last week demanding an investigation be opened into whether Biden’s "cognitive decline allowed unelected staff to push through radical policy without his knowing approval."

"There are profound reasons to suspect that Biden's staff and political allies exploited his mental decline to issue purported presidential orders without his knowing approval," the letter read.

"Speaker Johnson, for example, reported that staff and elected officials – including former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer – tried to prevent Johnson from meeting with Biden," it continued.

Biden Ripped For ‘Old’ Appearance, ‘Weak’ Voice During First Presidential Debate: ‘Deeply Alarming’

"Though presidents always have gatekeepers, in Biden's case, the walls around him were higher and the controls greater, according to Democratic lawmakers, donors and aides who worked for Biden and other administrations. Staff limited Biden's ability to speak with others and limited the sources of information he consumed."

The Oversight Project shared Bailey’s letter in its thread investigating Biden’s signature on official documents, in addition to an interview with Speaker Johnson, R-La., when he recounted that Biden didn’t remember signing an order freezing new liquid natural gas exports in 2024.

"I didn’t do that," the president said, Johnson recounted during an interview with the Free Press’ Bari Weiss in January.

"Sir, you paused it, I know. I have the export terminals in my state. I talked to those people in my state, I’ve talked to those people this morning, this is doing massive damage to our economy, national security," Johnson said he told the president at the time.

"I walked out of that meeting with fear and loathing because I thought, ‘We are in serious trouble – who is running the country?’" Johnson said of the 2024 meeting.

"Like, I don’t know who put the paper in front of him, but he didn’t know," he added.

The Oversight Project continued in its findings that investigators should determine "who controlled the autopen" during the Biden administration.

"For investigators to determine whether then-President Biden actually ordered the signature of relevant legal documents, or if he even had the mental capacity to, they must first determine who controlled the autopen and what checks there were in place. Given President Biden's decision to revoke Executive Privilege for individuals advising Trump during his first Presidency, this is a knowable fact that can be determined with the correct legal process?" the Oversight Project posted to X.

Biden Had No Idea He Signed Natural Gas Export Pause, Johnson Says

Concerns over Biden’s mental acuity when he was in office, combined with the Oversight Project’s findings, have sparked outrage among conservative social media users as they question if Biden personally signed the executive orders.

In 2024, I was disinvited from presenting a lecture on the health and human rights consequences of the Israeli assault on Gaza, by unnamed administrators at Harvard University, who (I was told) accused me of being an antisemite. At Geisel, the medical school affiliated with Dartmouth, I was also invited and then met with an “indefinite postponement” for a similar presentation. It is clear these have not been isolated events.

Two recent pieces provide an illustration of the current ideological battle taking place with in the U.S. healthcare community. First, a recent report on the suppression of speech at UCLA’s medical school shows the real-world harm antisemitism witch hunts are creating on medical campuses across the country. And then an error-riddled article from the Journal of Religion and Health provides a perfect illustration of how false charges of antisemitism are constructed and gives us a perfect case study in how to debunk the smears.

A January 2025 report prepared by the UCLA Task Force on Anti-Palestinian, Anti-Arab, and Anti-Muslim Racism offers a sobering picture of the growing suppression of speech and actions in medical schools and hospitals where there is support for Palestinian human rights and criticism of the genocidal assault on Gaza and the West Bank. The report reviews data from UCLA where over 24 medical students, residents, and faculty in the David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM) experienced intense targeting, gaslighting, harassment, doxxing, death threats, and job loss from both inside and outside the medical school in well-organized campaigns to suppress freedom of speech and to uphold the IHRA definition of antisemitism. The IHRA definition, which is highly contested in academic and progressive circles, defines antisemitism with the usual anti-Jewish tropes but then lists examples that are various forms of criticism of Israel and Israeli policies. These social media attacks quickly rose to the attention of high-level administrators, the media, and ultimately the U.S. Congress, threatening the targets’ mental and physical safety. 

UCLA courses on Structural Racism and Health Equity (SRHE) and Global Health, as well as classes on race and health inequities, were all vulnerable to attacks, particularly if they focused on Palestinian human rights. This repression and retaliation extended to other academic inquiries on racial justice, health inequities, and DEI initiatives and often targeted women of color. People were confronted in response to social media posts as well as for curricula, protests, statements, and buttons, and lectures were illegally recorded and weaponized. 

The administration from DGSOM and UCLA initially responded to the October 7 attack with a full-throated statement in support of Israel and subsequently refused to support academic freedom for students and faculty critical of Israeli policies. They also refused to condemn those who were making the attacks, reducing the ability of students to learn and understand health inequities and the social determinants of health, the impacts of race and class, etc. The repression often took the form of increased levels of surveillance and weaponized accusations of antisemitism, particularly when students described the assault on Gaza as a genocide.  

This pattern of behavior pre-dated the events of October 7. In 2021, a vigilante group titled the Jewish Faculty Resilience Group (JFRG) targeted instructors working in the Structural Racism and Health Equity course (SRHE) with accusations of antisemitism.  They were joined by a group called Do No Harm, a group self-described as “a national association of medical professionals combating the attack on our healthcare system from woke activists” and “protecting healthcare from the disastrous consequences of identity politics.” Much of this occurred under the pretense of preventing students from feeling “uncomfortable.”

The DGSOM administration repeatedly responded sympathetically to the antisemitism accusations while ignoring credible evidence of racism against Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims, and people supportive of Palestinian rights, as well as the well-documented violations of international law, statements from the UN, International Criminal Court, and the International Court of Justice. The Task Force noted that this behavior violates the faculty codes of conduct for both institutions. 

This is all particularly consequential because the repression and retaliation are not only designed to threaten and punish the targets immediately but also to impact their training and professional employment options in the future. This also creates a hostile learning environment that includes anti-Palestinian racism and hostility towards other races and social justice activities. As the Task Force stated: “UCLA DGSOM continues to maintain a toxic, discriminatory and psychologically unsafe work environment,” which creates an “inability for students to discuss their positionality when exploring racial justice…[and] leads to harassment and self censorship and loss of critical discussion.”

It was thus with particular curiosity that I read an opinion piece titled “Social Media, Survey, and Medical Literature Data Reveal Escalating Antisemitism Within the United States Healthcare Community,” in a somewhat obscure publication, Journal of Religion and Health. What I found was profoundly disturbing, but not unexpected. And provides a perfect illustration of the framing and definitions, of both antisemitism and Jewishness, that provide fodder for ideological battles and weaponization of the charge of antisemitism. 

The authors in the Journal of Religion and Health reported that antisemitism has been rising for decades in the US and has dramatically increased in the medical community as well. “Most surveyed US medical students [19 responses] and healthcare professionals [138 plus 6 residents or fellows] experienced Jew-hatred and reported a marked increase following October 7, 2023…nearly 90% of Jewish healthcare professionals and students reported exposure to antisemitism within their work or school environment after October 7, 2023. Similar results were seen in independent surveys of Jewish high school students, 71% of whom reported experiencing antisemitism.”

The investigators reviewed quantitated publications about antisemitism, social media posts, and disseminated a survey to members of Jewish medical organizations to which they received 170 responses. They found a two to more than five-fold increase in antisemitic postings and tropes. 75.4 % of Jewish-identifying students and professionals reported exposure to antisemitism, up from 49.3% pre-October 7, 2023. Jewish students and faculty reported feeling frightened, threatened, and silenced at work 

Antisemitism is a serious form of bigotry that has repeatedly been found to be rising in this country, mostly in the context of the explosion of rightwing fascism and hatred of Jews, women, LGBTQI folks, and people of color. Nonetheless, there are several serious flaws in this paper.

Who did they survey? The authors surveyed Jewish-identified health care providers, and in particular, named three groups: JPN, (Jewish Physicians Network), JOWMA, (Jewish Orthodox Women’s Medical Association), and Orthodocs, (Orthodox/Shomer Shabbos Jewish physicians and medical students). Half of these people reported experiencing antisemitic incidents in their lives pre-October 2023, which seems unusually high for the general Jewish population, in my personal experience working in a variety of health care environments.  While these folks represent a segment of Jews in the US, (approximately 10% of the Jewish population are Orthodox), it cannot be assumed that they represent all Jews. It seems the authors deliberately omitted Reconstructionist, Reform, and Conservative Jews, cultural Jews, unaffiliated Jews, and politically progressive, left-of-center Jews, such as members of Jewish Voice for Peace and If Not Now.  By failing to include less religiously inclined Jews who are still strongly identified with their Jewish heritage and prophetic traditions, Israeli Jews studying in the US, and anti-Zionist Jews, the authors have not reflected the diverse, complex, and sometimes contradictory Jewish community in the US and their perceptions of antisemitism.   

What definition of antisemitism did they use? The authors used the IHRA definition of antisemitism. This definition fails to situate antisemitism in right wing fascist ideology where it is currently exploding. 

The consequence of this is that anyone who criticizes the genocidal behaviors of the Israeli government and military since October 7, who places the Hamas attacks within the context of decades of severe Israeli oppression, occupation, and siege, who calls out the Israeli destruction of Gazan hospitals, universities, housing, water and sanitation infrastructure, the imprisonment and torture of Gazan health care providers, the weaponization of food aid and rising levels of starvation, the enormous numbers of injured and dead, 2/3 women and children, the highest number of child amputees per capita in the world… all of these folks are, by the IHRA definition, antisemites.

What experts did they quote? The authors used the FBI and ADL who in turn use the IHRA definition of antisemitism. As an example, they stated: “ADL Based on FBI crime statistics, the Anti-Defamation League has reported a more than 300% increase in antisemitic incidents between October–December 2023.” None of this has validity because the initial definition is deeply flawed. The ADL has also repeatedly been found to be an apologist for Israel masquerading as an anti-hate, civil rights organization.

What assumptions did they make?  The authors stated there has been a “Dramatic increase in campus antisemitism since the Hamas assault,” echoing the analysis from pro-Israel groups, Israeli hasbara organizations, and folks from Jewish organizations to college presidents to congresspeople who are all using the IHRA definition of antisemitism. 

Once again, the college students living in tent encampments calling attention to extremely disturbing Israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity reaching the level of genocide as defined by international human rights law and organizations, and the International Criminal Court, and International Court of Justice, were not engaged in antisemitic speech.  They were exercising their first amendment rights condemning a horrific bombing and killing campaign in Gaza with US-made planes, drones, weapons, and surveillance equipment. They were criticizing the politics and behavior of a country, not a people with a particular religious affiliation or attachment. Their calls for boycott, divestment, and sanction of Israel or US war-related industries were also not reflective of Jew hatred, but a desire to put pressure on Israel to stop destroying Palestinian lives and livelihood with total impunity, supported militarily and politically by the US government and our taxes. To dismiss voices of protest as “Hamas supporters” is highly inaccurate and misleading.

Who was left out of this analysis?  This focus on rising levels of supposed Jew hatred and Jewish fear is particularly concerning in the face of all the not-so-Jewish folks who were left out, who suffered verbal and physical assaults, doxxing, school expulsion, job suspension and loss, including medical students and faculty. The Institute for the Understanding of anti-Palestinian Racism has also documented high levels of racism against Palestinians, people perceived to be Palestinian, other Arabs, and allies who support Palestinian human rights and self-determination. This racism is layered onto the pervasive Islamophobia that is part of the US psyche and inflamed by the rhetoric of the current government. 

There will obviously be real antisemitic incidents, mostly from the extreme right as well as MAGA Republicans, less often from the left, as antisemitism persists in the brew of bigotries that flourish in the US.  But the distrust, discrimination, and hatred of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims is a far greater issue for our society. Accurately identifying these kinds of hatreds and separating antisemitism from principled criticism of Israel, will produce a more knowledgeable and tolerant society that will make lives for Palestinians as well as Jews safer in the future.  

What finally destroys this paper? The authors include this extraordinary sentence:

“Between 2014 and 2023, conflicts between Israel and Hamas have sparked false claims including accusations that Israeli and/or Jewish health professionals practice organ harvesting, withhold medical care from Palestinian Arabs, and deliberately target Palestinian healthcare workers and/or ambulances.” 

Newsweek, NBC, and other mainstream outlets reported that the Israeli military admitted to harvesting Palestinian organs from dead Palestinians without consent in the 1990s. The withholding of medical care from Palestinians and the deliberate targeting of Palestinian health workers and ambulances has been widely documented for years by many international and local human rights and health care organizations and became a defining characteristic of the latest attacks on Gaza and the West Bank.  If the authors question these established, factually well-documented pieces of information, then the credibility of the entire opinion piece is seriously called into question as anything beyond a piece of right wing Jewish and Israeli propaganda. 

Ultimately, I am inspired that despite the severe repression that folks in the healthcare world are facing from those using the accusation of antisemitism to silence critics of Israeli policy, health workers are still speaking up. They are using their experience and credibility to reject those accusations and to speak out against the blatant and internationally recognized violations of human rights that Israel is imposing on the Palestinian people. They are protesting in their white coats, advising and protecting students, challenging academic pushback, and living up to their obligation to heal not only patients but also the societies in which they live. 

Critiquing Israeli policies that have been condemned internationally, and the naming of war crimes and genocide where it exists, is part of our work and obligation as healers. It is also grounded in the teachings of prophetic Judaism and the work to create a more just world for everyone. Jewish exceptionalism is not a Jewish value. It bears repeating that never again means never again for everyone.

As part of the US President Donald Trumpʼs government cutbacks, most of the 80 000 federal workers responsible for disease research, food inspection, and the administration of Medicare and Medicaid received a letter offering to resign in exchange for $25 000.

This is reported by the Associated Press news agency.

Workers must respond to the so-called voluntary redundancy offer by the evening of March 14. The email was sent to employees of the department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration in Maryland.

The mass mailing comes days before agency leaders at the US Department of Health and Human Services are set to propose plans for workforce cuts. The department is one of the most expensive federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion, most of which goes to providing health care to millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr. has hinted at plans for major staff cuts and last year promised to immediately lay off all 600 employees at the National Biomedical Research Office. But he has yet to do so.

“I have a list in my head,” Kennedy said of potential layoffs, adding that some employees “made very poor decisions” regarding food policies.

The Trump administration, with the support of billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is trying to reduce the number of civil servants in order to reduce costs. In January, most civil servants were offered resignations with eight months of salary. Thousands of employees who were on probation were fired from various institutions. The other day, the NYT newspaper wrote that the US Central Intelligence Agency began to lay off recently hired employees.

Providing affordable point-of-care diagnostic tools can be instrumental in quickly and efficiently assessing the well-being of all people, especially pregnant mothers. This can empower healthcare providers to be better diagnosticians and improve overall patient care, particularly for those at risk.

For two years, an ambitious initiative in sub-Saharan Africa has demonstrated how pocket-sized ultrasound technology can help bridge the gap in maternal care access. The implementation of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) across hundreds of healthcare facilities offers new insights into how the innovative deployment of technology, combined with comprehensive training, can transform maternal health outcomes in resource-limited settings. This initiative has resulted in over 1,000 healthcare workers trained, and over one million pregnancy scans and counting.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an ultrasound scan before 24 weeks gestation for all pregnancies, yet the stark reality of access to high-quality global maternal healthcare presents an immense challenge. Nearly 95% of maternal deaths occur in low and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC). And in low-resource settings like parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, the high cost of equipment and the need for trained sonographers means that very few women have access to ultrasound. UNICEF’s 2021 report on child mortality trends and the WHO’s 2024 report on maternal mortality show that, in sub-Saharan Africa alone, approximately 202,000 mothers and 27 of every 1,000 infants die due to childbirth complications annually. While multiple factors contribute to these statistics, one significant barrier has been limited access to antenatal diagnostic imaging – a critical tool for identifying life-threatening complications during pregnancy. 

Many regions of the world, especially LMICs, are essentially diagnostic deserts. The lack of equitable, accessible primary healthcare for women, combined with higher disease burdens entering pregnancy, creates a perfect storm of risk factors that demands innovative solutions.


					Mayo Clinic has developed a new tool that could speed up the time it takes for digital health companies to validate their tech to hospitals.				

Breaking new ground in Kenya

The project began in Kenya in late 2022 and has resulted in deployment of 500 single-probe, whole-body portable ultrasound devices across 224 healthcare facilities in Kenya. This was combined with ultrasound training by Global Ultrasound Institute (GUSI) to over 500 frontline healthcare workers who provide care in counties in Kenya with disproportionately high rates of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. Recruitment of the participants and evaluation of the implementation was conducted by Kenyatta University.

Initial results from the evaluation conducted by Kenyatta University suggests that 90% of healthcare workers reported identifying high-risk conditions such as placenta previa or multiple gestations using their devices within one month of training. 

The findings from the research represent the largest impact study in Africa on point-of-care ultrasound to date and show that:


					This on-demand webinar will offer insights and share tips on helping practices run more efficiently.				

The training program, developed in partnership with GUSI, takes a comprehensive approach. It begins with creating a foundation of local expertise by training over 50 Kenyan clinicians and sonographers in International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG)-standard techniques, who become trainers. The curriculum covers operation, image acquisition and medical decision-making, with a specific focus on identifying high-risk conditions during pregnancy. 

Phase Two of the Kenya program included a curriculum from GUSI, which included pre-tests and required participants to log at least 20 of five different types of scans over the course of the week. On the final day of the program, a post-test and final Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) were administered. Participants who passed all training and tests were given a certificate at a closing ceremony. 

As of December 2024, research outcomes from Phase Two were significant. Over the 24-month period from the start of training, Kenyan clinicians have performed over 496,000 scans, with more than 95% of the equipment continuing to function as a vital part of the care workflow for midwives in these facilities. These data demonstrate the sustainability of POCUS when the approach pairs easy-to-use equipment with focused training for midwives.

Expanding impact: South Africa implementation 

Building on the success in Kenya, the program has expanded to South Africa, where maternal mortality rates and stillbirth rates remain disproportionately high, particularly in rural areas. The initiative rolled out across multiple provinces, starting in the Eastern Cape province in April 2024. In this phase of the training, learners received additional instruction in fetal biometry – an ultrasound test that provides rich detail on the health and growth of the fetus, in addition to confirming gestational age and an estimated due date for the pregnancy. Implementation and evaluation of this phase was led by the Clinton Health Access Initiative and University of Pretoria.

While formal evaluation results are forthcoming, preliminary results are extremely promising. South African learners have performed more than 573,000 scans and completed over 41,000 instances of fetal biometry. Taken together, these scans represent thousands of opportunities for mothers to be educated on the status of their pregnancies, as well as for providers to make informed decisions about additional testing or referral if complications were suspected. 

Healthcare users need easier access to antenatal imaging, and clinicians need better capabilities for screening high-risk conditions that lead to disproportionately worse pregnancy outcomes, particularly in rural areas. When ultrasound becomes more accessible, high-risk conditions may be identified earlier, leading to improved outcomes. 

The technology and training equation

What sets this initiative apart is its comprehensive approach to implementation. The program provides valuable insights into how to scale medical technology deployment in resource-limited settings effectively. But rather than simply distributing services, the program emphasizes sustainable integration into existing healthcare systems. This includes:

Looking ahead: implications for global health 

The collaboration among multiple stakeholders — including the Clinton Health Access Initiative, GUSI, Kenyatta University and local healthcare institutions – offers a model for future health technology implementations. It demonstrates how public-private partnerships can work together to address complex healthcare challenges while ensuring sustainability and local ownership. 

As the program continues to expand, (Kenyatta University’s College of Nursing in Kenya, CHAI and University of Pretoria in South Africa) researchers are evaluating its impact on broader health system metrics, including referral patterns and population-level maternal health outcomes. This data will be necessary for understanding how POCUS technology can be most effectively deployed to improve maternal health outcomes in similar settings around the world. 

The initiative extends beyond technology. It represents a comprehensive approach to addressing maternal health disparities through innovation, education and systematic support. We must advocate for earlier, better maternal and primary care for all, especially for mothers who reside in resource-limited settings as they enter pregnancy. We also need to address racial and socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access and improve the quality of healthcare across the entire continuum — and ultrasound plays a role in that every step of the way. Providing affordable point-of-care diagnostic tools can be instrumental in quickly and efficiently assessing the well-being of all people, especially pregnant mothers. This can empower healthcare providers to be better diagnosticians and improve overall patient care, particularly for those at risk.

As global health leaders continue to seek solutions for reducing maternal mortality, this program offers valuable lessons on how to effectively bridge the healthcare access gap in resource-limited settings. 

The initiative described above was supported by a $5 million grant to Butterfly Network.

LAS VEGAS, March 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- C-suite leaders from Houston Methodist and Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) will be speaking at HumanX, discussing how AI can play a pivotal role in addressing the looming hospital capacity crisis and out of control healthcare expenses, while also improving quality and reducing epidemic levels of clinician burnout.  

The panel titled, "Delivering on the promise of AI to improve health outcomes," occurs on Wednesday, March 12 at 11:45am Pacific Time. Roberta Schwartz, EVP and Chief Innovation Officer at Houston Methodist, an organization committed to the responsible use of AI to improve the health of patients, will join with Nassib Chamoun, Founder and CEO of HDAI. Mr. Chamoun will discuss the tangible benefits of identifying high risk patients before, during, after hospitalization, and in the community and the use of AI-generated summaries that replace clinician time spent searching the EHR with time spent caring for the patient. Health systems and value-based care organizations, like Houston Methodist and Buena Vida y Salud, are driving down unplanned admissions, post-discharge mortality, and reducing adverse events. The HDAI platform enables precise care planning, optimizing scarce healthcare resources to have the greatest impact on patients with the most pressing needs.  

"It is striking that in the US, 6% of patients account for almost 40% of adverse events, but also excess length of stay, readmissions, mortalities, and costs. By stratifying populations by risk and identifying those patients proactively, HDAI is helping clinicians to prevent unnecessary admissions with timely, personalized care plans to help patients stay healthy at home, where possible," adds Nassib Chamoun of HDAI. "And, at the patient level, our LLM-powered HDAIAssist tools, sift and summarize the mountains of data in these highly complex patients' charts, saving time while improving care."  

Other speakers on the panel include Dina Katabi, Professor of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Lynda Chin, Founder & CEO - Apricity Health and the panel moderator, Ian Krietzberg, Editor-in-Chief, The Deep View.

A giant wave of undulating gas and dust appears, per new research, to have engulfed our Solar System millions of years ago.

As New Scientist reports, astrophysicists have discovered that the Radcliffe wave — a 9,000 light-year-long structure full of stars and the gas and dust needed to form new ones — seems to have swept over our entire Solar System around 14 million years ago.

Previous research into this fantastic galactic wave suggested that Earth passed through it some 13 million years ago, plunging our planet into "a festival of supernovae going off," as Harvard astrophysicist Catherine Zucker told the Washington Post last year.

Now, University of Vienna doctoral student Efrem Maconi thinks that our whole Solar System may have passed through this incredible structure.

Using data from the European Space Agency's Gaia telescope, Maconi and his team identified recently-formed stars and the gases surrounding them within the Radcliffe wave to see how the structure itself appears to be moving.

Comparing that data to estimates about our Solar System's trajectory, the Vienna researchers found that the Sun and the Radcliffe wave were near each other between 12 and 15 million years ago. Ultimately, the scientists estimated that we moved through the wave roughly 14 million years ago. On a geological and even evolutionary scale, that's incredibly recent; the dinosaurs are believed to have gone exstinct around 66 million years ago.

Along with the finding, Maconi also told New Scientist that the sky would have looked very different to anyone looking out from Earth when our Solar System passed through the Radcliffe wave.

"If we are in a denser region of the interstellar medium, that would mean that the light coming from the stars to you would be dimmed," he explained. "It’s like being in a foggy day."

Extrapolating this finding even further, the scientists behind this discovery also think there's a chance that the Radcliffe wave played a role in the climate cooling that occurred in the Middle Miocene epoch, when temperatures plunged and permanent ice sheets were established. According to Ralph Schoenrich, an associate climate and physics professor at University College London, that may be a stretch.

"A rule of thumb is that geology trumps any cosmic influence," Schoenrich, who was not involved in the research, told New Scientist. "If you shift continents or interrupt ocean currents, you get climate shifts from that, so I’m very skeptical you need anything in addition."
