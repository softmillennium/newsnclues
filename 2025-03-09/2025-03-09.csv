German policymakers are growing increasingly concerned over the possibility that the US could remotely disable F-35 fighter jets being delivered to Berlin in the event of a crisis, mirroring its recent decision to freeze intelligence and military support to Ukraine, Bild reported on Saturday.

The German Air Force is set to receive 35 American-made F-35A Lightning II jets starting in 2026 as part of an €8.3 billion ($9 billion) deal. However, some German policymakers fear that US President Donald Trump, who has been at odds with the EU over a number of issues, could use a ‘kill switch’ to ground the aircraft if Washington and European capitals diverge in their approach to a potential conflict with Russia, the article said.

”The ‘kill switch’ in the F-35 is more than just a rumor,” Joachim Schranzhofer, the head of communications at German defense company Hensoldt, told Bild. “But it’s much easier to use the mission planning system – then the plane stays on the ground.”

Wolfgang Ischinger, the former president of the Munich Security Conference Foundation, questioned the fate of the contract. “If we have to fear that the US could do with future German F-35s what they are currently doing with Ukraine, we could consider terminating the contract,” he said, as quoted by the tabloid.

Similar fears about a kill switch on American jets were echoed by experts interviewed by the Financial Times. Defense analyst Richard Aboulafia remarked that while the existence of a kill switch has never been confirmed, “If you postulate the existence of something that can be done with a little bit of software code, it exists.”

Others, meanwhile, suggested that a kill switch would essentially be redundant due to the sophistication of modern fighter jets and dependence on the vendor. “Most European militaries depend heavily on the US for communications support, for electronic warfare support, and for ammunition resupply in any serious conflict,” Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told the FT.

The concerns about F-35s surfaced after the US froze military and intelligence support for Kiev following a spat between Trump and Vladimir Zelensky, during which the US president accused the Ukrainian leader of not wanting peace with Russia.

The F-35 program has been described as the most expensive military project in history, with total projected costs exceeding $1.7 trillion over its lifetime. Since the first F-35 made its maiden flight in 2006, the program has been plagued by cost overruns, delays, and reliability issues. So far, more than 1,100 have been produced, with many supplied to US allies.

The Slovak National Party (SNS), a member of the ruling coalition, has announced plans to introduce a parliamentary resolution rejecting further sanctions against Russia, arguing the restrictions are negatively affecting Slovakia’s own economy.

The party, which holds 10 out of the 150 seats in the national parliament, stated that the sanctions against Russia were negatively impacting the standard of living in Slovakia. “Sanctions take more from us than they give,” party leader Andrej Danko has said, as cited by the local media. “The result is rising energy prices, loss of competitiveness of our businesses, and deepening economic uncertainty.”

The SNS called the restrictions ineffective, adding that the new EU sanctions package introduced in February is already pushing the prices of gas and aluminum higher. “It is unacceptable that Slovak households and businesses bear the economic consequences of decisions that were taken without a thorough assessment of their impact on the national economy,” Danko said.

“We cannot stand idly by while someone makes decisions for us, while weakening us economically,” he added.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has repeatedly voiced skepticism over Western support for Ukraine, declaring that Bratislava wouldn't provide military or financial assistance to Kiev and advocating for an immediate ceasefire.

Fico has also criticized Kiev’s Western backers for pursuing “peace through force,” arguing that “Ukraine will never be strong enough to negotiate from a position of military power.” 

Tensions between Slovakia and Ukraine were exacerbated after Kiev declined to renew a gas transit agreement with Moscow that expired at the beginning of this year. The move significantly affected Slovakia, which remains highly dependent on Russian energy.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Art.com,Musk calls for sanctions on Ukrainian oligarchs,https://www.rt.com/news/613929-musk-ukraine-oligarchs-conflict/,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 12:32:00 GMT","





Elon Musk has suggested that sanctioning Ukraine’s top ten oligarchs could bring about a swift resolution to the conflict with Russia. He offered the unusual proposal in a post on X on Saturday.

Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), was responding to a discussion on US financial aid to Ukraine. He has frequently criticized US support for Kiev, while in general advocating reducing federal spending on foreign assistance.

“Place sanctions on the top 10 Ukrainian oligarchs, especially the ones with mansions in Monaco, and this will stop immediately. That is the key to the puzzle,” Musk wrote in response to a post by Senator Mike Lee, who called for the US to halt financial aid to Kiev. Musk did not elaborate on how exactly such a move would impact the conflict.

According to the news outlet Ukrainian Focus, as of September 2024, topping the list of the country’s wealthiest people was Rinat Akhmetov, owner of industrial conglomerate SCM Group. He was followed by Interpipe Group owner Viktor Pinchuk, former President Petro Poroshenko, Dneprazot owner Igor Kolomoisky, and Ferrexpo owner Konstantin Zhevago.

Most of the above-listed individuals have contributed to Kiev’s war effort. Poroshenko and Pinchuk are known to have supplied the Ukrainian army with drones and other equipment, while Akhmetov is behind a project that provides the military ammunition, transport, medical equipment and drones. He has reportedly spent the equivalent of some $274 million on the war effort in the past three years.

Musk’s suggestion sparked mixed reactions online. Some users questioned whether sanctioning Ukraine’s business elite would actually pressure Kiev to negotiate, noting that Ukraine mostly relies on Western funding. Others pointed out that just last month Kiev itself sanctioned several prominent businessmen, including Poroshenko, Kolomoisky, and Zhevago, which suggests a rift between them and the regime. While no reasons were given for the sanctions, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky had called for “blocking billions that were earned by essentially selling out Ukraine, Ukrainian interests, Ukrainian security” just a day before the sanctions announcement.

Musk’s remarks came amid a growing rift between Kiev and Washington following Zelensky’s recent trip to Washington during which a meeting he had with US President Donald Trump at the White House turned heated and the planned signing of a minerals deal was put on hold. Shortly thereafter, the US suspended military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine.

According to The Washington Post, Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, now fear Trump may impose sanctions on Ukraine following the Ukrainian leader’s recent ill-fated trip.

“All politicians in this country were discussing potential sanctions from the US side… A lot of people were very nervous, and the president was very nervous,” an unnamed official told the newspaper. He added that Washington could impose sanctions by linking individuals in Zelensky’s inner circle to corruption, which would weaken Ukraine’s war effort and jeopardize its EU backing. The official did not specify whether Ukrainian oligarchs would be targeted.

Germany will not develop or acquire nuclear weapons, incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said, while calling for deeper cooperation with France and the UK on deterrence.

In an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio broadcaster on Sunday, Merz stressed that “Germany will not be able or allowed to possess nuclear weapons itself,” noting that Berlin is banned by law from doing so.

“The most recent [document] is the 2+4 Treaty of 1990, in which Germany explicitly renounced possessing nuclear weapons. And that will remain the case.”

Formally known as the ‘Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany’, which laid the legal base for the reunification of West and East Germany, the document also stipulates that no foreign armed forces, nuclear weapons, or their carriers would be deployed in the area of Berlin and the former East Germany.

However, Merz has signaled his willingness to explore greater nuclear cooperation with NATO allies, calling for discussions with Britain and France. “We must also become stronger together in nuclear coverage in Europe,” he said.

Last month, he suggested that the UK and France could extend their nuclear protection to Germany, citing the tensions between Russia and NATO over Ukraine. In response to these remarks, French President Emmanuel Macron signaled that he ”decided to open a strategic debate on protecting our allies on the European continent through a nuclear deterrent.”

His remarks came amid tensions between European NATO members and the administration of US President Donald Trump over Ukraine. Trump has also repeatedly insisted that European NATO members should do more to protect themselves, rather than relying on the US.

Macron has also urged EU member states to significantly boost their defense spending while declaring Russia a “threat.”

Moscow has denounced Macron’s speech, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov comparing him to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, noting that both tried to defeat Russia but failed.

Thousands of protesters marched through Paris on Saturday to oppose what they see as French President Emmanuel Macron’s militaristic approach to foreign policy and his lack of interest in achieving peace in the Ukraine conflict.

The demonstration was organized by Florian Philippot and his party, The Patriots. Chanting slogans and carrying signs such as “We don’t want to die for Ukraine,” and “Macron, we don’t want your war,” the crowd moved from the Place du Palais Royal to the Place Pierre Laroque.

Macron on Wednesday proposed expanding France’s nuclear deterrent to protect EU nations and urged European members of NATO to take more responsibility for their own defense. He cited uncertainty over Washington’s commitment to Ukraine, especially as relations between Kiev and US President Donald Trump’s administration experienced a setback after Vladimir Zelensky rejected calls to negotiate peace with Russia.

Macron has argued that continued aid to Ukraine was crucial, warning that if Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeded in Ukraine, he wouldn’t stop there – a claim that Moscow has repeatedly dismissed as nonsense. Russia has identified NATO’s expansion toward its borders and the US-led bloc’s promise of eventual membership for Ukraine as being among the key reasons for the conflict.

Many demonstrators at the Paris rally criticized Macron for prioritizing military matters over domestic issues. “When you declare war, it’s to erase all the other failures,” one protester said. Another accused Macron of pursuing conflict while leaders such as Trump and Putin are talking about peace.

Addressing the crowd, Philippot condemned Macron’s approach, declaring that the president “absolutely does not want peace.” Philippot, formerly a member of the National Front, has been a vocal critic of Macron’s administration and EU’s policies. His party opposes what it perceives as unnecessary military interventions and advocates for a more independent French foreign policy.

Macron’s push for increased defense spending faces hurdles as France grapples with a budget deficit and pressure to rein in spending. Approval of the 2025 budget has been delayed due to a divided parliament. In January, Budget Minister Amelie de Montchalin announced plans to cut €32 billion ($34.6 billion) in public spending while raising taxes by €21 billion.

Critics argue that these measures would burden middle-class families, small business owners, and retirees already struggling with rising costs. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has rejected calls for public consultation on major defense policies, insisting such decisions are the government’s responsibility. When asked on Friday whether the French people should have a say in increased military spending and a shift toward a “war economy,” Bayrou was firm: “The government’s responsibility is to say, no, we can’t let the country be disarmed. It’s vital.”

The recent suspension of US intelligence sharing with Ukraine has critically weakened Kiev’s defense capabilities, leading to substantial casualties, territorial losses – particularly in the occupied part of Russia’s Kursk Region – and plummeting morale, Time reported on Friday, citing Western and Ukrainian officials familiar with the situation.

One unnamed official claimed that the lack of US intel directly resulted in “hundreds of dead Ukrainians,” adding that “the biggest problem is morale,” as Kiev is unable to effectively use some of its most powerful Western-supplied weapons.

According to Time, the abrupt halt in intelligence sharing has affected the Ukrainian foothold in the Russian border region of Kursk, which Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky regards as a bargaining chip in potential peace talks with Russia. The magazine said, citing sources, that Russia has made swift advances in the area, aiming to cut off Ukrainian supply lines into the region.

According to Ukrainian media reports citing the Deep State monitoring website, Russian forces have nearly cut off Kiev’s foothold in Kursk Region from the border.

The New York Post reported, citing sources, that Ukrainian forces in the region could wrap up their incursion within as little as two weeks due to supply shortages and deteriorating battlefield conditions. On Saturday, the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed gains in the region, saying Russian troops had liberated three villages.

Ukraine invaded Kursk Region last August, and while it initially made some gains, the advance was soon halted.

A source in Zelensky’s government told Time that the loss of US intel has had major consequences beyond Kursk. The magazine noted that Ukraine has lost its ability to track Russian bombers and fighter jets, leaving the country vulnerable to surprise attacks. “It’s very dangerous for our people,” the source said. “It has to be immediately changed.”

The halt in intelligence sharing has also weakened Ukraine’s ability to launch long-range and intermediate-range strikes against Russian military positions, as these operations rely heavily on precise targeting information from US reconnaissance data, Time added.

The US froze military aid and intelligence support for Ukraine following a heated exchange between Zelensky and US President Donald Trump on February 28 at the White House.

During the televised meeting, Zelensky cast doubt on the possibility of diplomacy with Russia and told Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance that the US “will feel” the impact of the conflict. Trump accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and ungrateful for the US aid to Kiev, as well as being reluctant to seek peace with Russia while “gambling with World War III.”

US officials have said the suspension of aid will remain in place until Kiev shows a commitment to holding peace talks.

        An armed man, believed to have come from Indiana, was shot by U.S. Secret Service agents near the White House after a confrontation early on Sunday.
    

An armed man believed to be traveling from Indiana was shot by U.S. Secret Service agents near the White House after a confrontation early on Sunday, according to authorities.

No one else was injured in the shooting that happened around midnight about a block from the White House, according to a Secret Service statement. President Donald Trump was in Florida at the time of the shooting.

 The Secret Service received information from local police about an alleged “suicidal individual” who was traveling from Indiana and found the man's car and a person matching his description nearby.

 “As officers approached, the individual brandished a firearm and an armed confrontation ensued, during which shots were fired by our personnel,” the Secret Service said in a statement.

 The man was hospitalised. The Secret Service said his condition was “unknown.”

 The Metropolitan Police Department will investigate because the shooting involved law enforcement officers. A message left Sunday for the police department wasn't immediately returned. 

Our journalists are working on this story and will update it as soon as more information becomes available.

        Greenlanders now find their voices greatly amplified on the world stage after President Donald Trump's claim that the US might take over their island.
    

Greenland is the world's largest island -  it's larger even than France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, and Belgium combined.

But despite its size, Greenland remains a self-governing territory of Denmark and its foreign, defence and monetary policies are all decided in Copenhagen.

Since 80 percent of it is permanently covered in ice, much of it remains inhabitable. It has a tiny population of just 56,000 people, most of them indigenous Inuits.

They've long taken pride in a culture and traditions that's helped them survive for centuries in some of the most rugged conditions. They have a close link to nature and belong to one of the most beautiful, remote, untouched places on Earth.

But Greenlanders now find their voices greatly amplified on the world stage after President Donald Trump's outlandish claimed that the US would take over their island.

Most say they don’t want to be American, and many are both worried and overwhelmed by the comments and the attention Trump's comments have brought. 

But many also see the global spotlight on them as an opportunity to promote their longstanding push for independence from Denmark, which is a key issue in Tuesday's legislative elections. 

Since 1979, Greenland has had its own prime minister who is able to govern at a local level. He or she has to come from the party with the most seats, which is currently the left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit party. Currently the prime minister is Múte Egede, who coincidentally will celebrate his 38th birthday on the day of the election.

The parliament - the Inatsisartut - has just 31 MPs who will be chosen from six political parties, two of whom are in the governing coalition of the Inuit Ataqatigiit and the Simiut parties.

Since few opinion polls  take place on the Arctic island, it is less clear than in other European elections as to what the outcome might be. 

But one poll conducted by Verian in January asked 497 Greenlanders who they would vote for. It suggested the Inuit Ataqatigiit party could gain about 31% and beat the Siumut party by about 9%.

The Simiut party has promised a vote on independence after the election, which may help it attract more voters, and perhaps allow it to choose the next prime minister.

But Naleraq is the largest opposition party, and it's been growing in popularity with its pro-independence policy and its apparent willingness to collaborate with the United States.

Qupanuk Olsen, who is Greenland's most popular influencer, is running for Naleraq, and with more than 500,000 followers on TikTok and 300,000 on Instagram, she has the best online platform to campaign from.

Unsurprisingly, Greenlanders are not keen for the US to take them over. Just hours after Trump declared in his speech to a joint session of Congress that he intends to gain control of the island “one way or the other,"" Greenland’s prime minister  Múte Bourup Egedeposted a simple message on Facebook : “Greenland is ours.”

“Kalaallit Nunaat is ours,” Egede said in the post, using the Greenlandic name for his country.

“We don’t want to be Americans, nor Danes; We are Kalaallit. The Americans and their leader must understand that. We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,” he said. The post ended with a clenched fist emoji and a Greenlandic flag.

Since taking office six weeks ago, Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in mineral-rich Greenland, that sits along strategic sea lanes in the North Atlantic. Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark with a population of about 56,000 people, lies off the northeastern coast of Canada, closer to Washington, D.C., than to Copenhagen.

Trump made a direct appeal to Greenlanders in his speech to Congress, just a week before the country’s voters cast their ballots in parliamentary elections.

“We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America,” Trump said.

“We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before,” he added.

Greenlanders voted overwhelmingly in favour of self-government in a 2009 referendum that also established a pathway to independence whenever the people of the island support such a move. Under the terms of that referendum, Denmark remains responsible for Greenland’s defence and foreign affairs, with the local government controlling other matters.

Asked about Trump’s comments, Denmark’s foreign minister said he doesn’t think Greenlanders want to separate from Denmark only to become “an integrated part of America.”

Lars Løkke Rasmussen said he believed Trump’s reference to respecting Greenlanders’ right to self-determination was the most important part of his speech.

“I’m very optimistic about what will be a Greenlandic decision about this,” he said during a trip to Finland. “They want to loosen their ties to Denmark. We’re working on that, to have a more equal relationship.”

Løkke added that it was important for next week’s elections to be free and fair “without any kind of international intervention.”

Greenland is vital to the world, though much of the world may not realise it. The U.S and other global powers covet its strategic location in the Arctic; its valuable rare earth minerals trapped under the ice needed for telecommunications; its billions of barrels of untapped oil. 

There’s also potential for shipping and trade routes as the ice that covers most of Greenland keeps retreating because of climate change. If that ice melts, it would reshape coastlines across the globe and potentially shift weather patterns.

Denmark colonised Greenland 300 years ago and still exercises control over foreign and defence policy, though Greenland won self-rule in 1979 and runs itself through its parliament.

Trump’s comments about Greenland also set off a political crisis in Denmark. The prime minister went on a tour of European capitals to garner support, saying the continent faced “a more uncertain reality,” while her country moved to strengthen its military presence around Greenland.

Greenland’s economy depends on fisheries and other industries as well as on an annual grant of about 554 million euros from Denmark.

Aka Hansen, an Inuk filmmaker and writer, is suspicious of Trump’s intentions - but still thanks him for turning the world’s attention to her homeland.

Like many other Greenlanders, she wants her homeland and people to be respected and she doesn’t want to be ruled by another colonial power. But she feels Trump’s rhetoric has increased the momentum for independence from Denmark.

Denmark has been accused of committing abuses against Greenland’s Inuit people, including removing children from their families in the 1950s with the excuse of integrating them into Danish society and fitting women with intrauterine contraceptive devices in the 1960s and 1970s — allegedly to limit population growth in Greenland.

        Turkey’s interior minister has pledged to fully apply a law to remove millions of stray dogs from the streets after the death a two-year-old girl.
    

Turkey’s interior minister has pledged to fully apply a law to remove millions of stray dogs from the streets in the wake of the death of a two-year-old girl.  

The legislation – labelled the “massacre law” by animal welfare groups – was passed by parliament last summer but has been only partially implemented, if at all, by municipal authorities. 

It requires municipalities to collect stray dogs and house them in shelters to be vaccinated, neutered or spayed before making them available for adoption. Dogs that are in pain, terminally ill, or pose a health risk to humans will be euthanised.  

“Either they will do this job or I will use whatever authority the law gives me to the fullest,” Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said in a video message posted on social media. 

Rana El Selci died after being attacked by a pack of stray dogs in Konya, central Turkey, on Friday. Her death sparked fresh outcry about the four million stray dogs that the government estimates roam Turkey’s streets and rural areas. 

A criminal investigation was launched following her death as municipal workers began rounding up dogs in Konya. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that the government was “taking determined steps to ensure the implementation of the law.” 

A report released by the Safe Streets and Defence of the Right to Life Association, an organisation campaigning for the removal of all stray dogs from the streets, says that 65 people have died in street dog attacks since 2022, not including Rana El Selci.

Animal lovers fear the legislation will lead to dogs being killed or ending up in neglected, overcrowded shelters. When the law was passed, the main opposition party pledged that its municipalities would not implement the round-up of strays. 

The issue divides Turks at all levels of society, with at least one former government minister having professed his admiration for ""man's best friend"".

During the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago the former Minister of Justice Adbulhamit Gul posted a photo of himself on X stroking a dog, saying: ''we should not abandon our animal friends during these tough days.''

The post came as the government was publicly promoting feeding stray animals whilst Covid restrictions were in force.

Demonstrations in cities across Turkey, meanwhile, have seen thousands call for the law to be scrapped. There have also been protests across Europe, as people warned the law could dissuade tourists from visiting Turkey.  

Some critics have blamed the growth in the stray canine population on a failure to implement previous regulations, which required stray dogs to be caught, neutered or spayed and returned to where they were found. 

Turkey’s Animal Rights Federation, HAYTAP, posted a video on X showing stray dogs - and stray cats - peacefully coexisting with people in the street, in shops and even on the metro network.

On HAYTAP's website the organisation recalls a previous attempt to get rid of stray dogs in 1910:

""In an effort to ""westernise"" Istanbul just before the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan ordered tens of thousands stray dogs from Istanbul to be sent to a nearby island.

– The island did not have food or water for the dogs, so this ended horribly with cannibalisation, starvation, and many dogs drowning trying to swim back.  Records show reports of people on the mainland being haunted by hearing the howls of the starving dogs on the island.""

Animal rights activists are concerned that some municipalities might kill dogs on the pretext that they are ill rather than allocate resources to shelter them.

Videos showing dead cats and dogs buried in ditches have been circulating on social media. Animal rights activists say the animals were indiscriminately killed after the passage of the law.

A year after Iran launched an unprecedented barrage of ballistic missiles and drones at Israel, the country’s defense industry is seizing the moment to pitch its battle-tested technologies to the Trump administration for its newly announced missile defense initiative.US President Donald Trump unveiled the plan in January 2025, calling for a US-built “Golden Dome,” a play on the Iron Dome but designed for a wider range of threats.“I will direct our military to begin construction of the great Iron Dome missile defense shield, which will be made all in the US,” Trump stated at the time. The initiative has since been rebranded as “Golden Dome” to reflect its unique scope and ambition.  Israeli defense officials see an opportunity to strengthen their long-standing missile defense collaboration with the United States. Boaz Levy, CEO of Israel Aerospace Industries, says his company is well-positioned to contribute.“We’ve been cooperating with the United States on missile defense for three decades. The Arrow system, which we developed together, has been phenomenal in recent conflicts. It makes sense to expand this collaboration as Washington considers its next-generation missile defense,” Levy told The Jerusalem Post.The Iranian wake-up callOn April 13, 2024, Iran launched an unprecedented large-scale drone and missile attack on Israel, marking the first direct strike by Iran on Israeli territory. The assault, involving over 300 drones and missiles, was retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus earlier that month.Israeli defense systems, including the Iron Dome, intercepted 99% of the incoming projectiles, minimizing damage and casualties. However, the sheer scale and coordination of the attack served as a significant escalation in the region. “That event proved to world leaders that long-range ballistic missiles aren’t just an Israeli concern,” Levy said. “Iran demonstrated that it can launch large, coordinated missile barrages. Other nations are realizing they need defenses against this kind of threat.”In response, demand for the IAI’s missile defense technology has surged.“Before the war, we had already signed a major contract for Arrow 3 with an allied country,” Levy revealed. “Since then, interest has grown significantly, and more countries are looking to integrate these solutions.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The Trump administration’s Golden Dome plan is in its early stages, with the Pentagon currently gathering proposals from US defense firms. However, Israel hopes its expertise in missile interception – specifically the Arrow 3 and Arrow 2 systems – will be part of the discussion.“There are multiple ways to defend against missiles, including emerging laser technologies,” Levy explained. “But when it comes to ballistic missiles, you want to intercept them as early as possible – ideally outside the atmosphere. That’s where Arrow excels.”Levy acknowledged that Jerusalem’s proposal may not be chosen as Washington prioritizes American-made defense systems. But he emphasized the broader importance of US-Israel defense ties. “Even if our technology isn’t selected, we are committed to working with the US to develop the best possible solution. The United States is our closest ally, and this partnership will only grow stronger.”Missile defense cooperation between the US and Israel dates back to the 1980s when concerns over missile threats in the Middle East prompted collaborative defense initiatives. The Arrow program, backed by the US and jointly developed by Israel and America, eventually led to the modern Arrow 3 system, which was first deployed in 2017.Now, history may be repeating itself. Just as past missile threats served as a wake-up call, Iran’s attack on Israel has underscored the urgency of robust missile defenses. The US Missile Defense Agency has already issued a request for information on potential systems, and the IAI has responded, though the details remain classified.“We don’t need to send the US much new data,” Levy said. “They already have it because we built the Arrow system together.”

The Trump administration’s Golden Dome plan is in its early stages, with the Pentagon currently gathering proposals from US defense firms. However, Israel hopes its expertise in missile interception – specifically the Arrow 3 and Arrow 2 systems – will be part of the discussion.“There are multiple ways to defend against missiles, including emerging laser technologies,” Levy explained. “But when it comes to ballistic missiles, you want to intercept them as early as possible – ideally outside the atmosphere. That’s where Arrow excels.”Levy acknowledged that Jerusalem’s proposal may not be chosen as Washington prioritizes American-made defense systems. But he emphasized the broader importance of US-Israel defense ties. “Even if our technology isn’t selected, we are committed to working with the US to develop the best possible solution. The United States is our closest ally, and this partnership will only grow stronger.”Missile defense cooperation between the US and Israel dates back to the 1980s when concerns over missile threats in the Middle East prompted collaborative defense initiatives. The Arrow program, backed by the US and jointly developed by Israel and America, eventually led to the modern Arrow 3 system, which was first deployed in 2017.Now, history may be repeating itself. Just as past missile threats served as a wake-up call, Iran’s attack on Israel has underscored the urgency of robust missile defenses. The US Missile Defense Agency has already issued a request for information on potential systems, and the IAI has responded, though the details remain classified.“We don’t need to send the US much new data,” Levy said. “They already have it because we built the Arrow system together.”

Iran’s senior religious leaders and their families lead a lavish lifestyle while the living conditions of a significant part of the population are those of relative poverty, young Iranians revealed in footage sent to Israel.“They live there in homes worth millions of dollars,” one Iranian could be heard saying in the videos published by Channel 12 on Saturday. “We are only allowed to pass by, but we will never be able to become tenants.”  A 44-year-old Iranian named Ali noted that the regime gives money to Hamas, Hezbollah, Iraq, Afghanistan – “everyone in the world gets their share from Iran.”“Why should we live in such extreme poverty? Why should I be unemployed now? Why am I not married? Why shouldn’t I have a wife and children?” he said. Advertisement“They constantly say ‘Death to America, Death to England’ from all directions, while their children have American, British, and Canadian passports. People are angry at them and troubled by this,” Ali added. A man rides past a banner with an image of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in central Tehran. September 29, 2024.

I have no profession,” he said. “People are tired – Iranian citizens who are exhausted by the Islamic Republic feel uneasy, bored, and submissive.” AdvertisementAli then brought the viewer to a shopping arcade on Tehran’s exclusive Fereshteh Street, where women are reportedly allowed to walk in public without a hijab.“I had to film in a way that wouldn’t be noticed. If the image quality isn’t good, I apologize to the honorable people of Israel,” Ali said.“Of all the products, not a single one is under $200 or at least $300,” with only 1% of Iran’s population being able to afford such products, according to Ali.  “But why? A country rich in oil, with the second-largest oil reserves in the world, [and] the second-largest gas reserves in the world,” he asked. “This is oil that belongs to everyone, this is gas that belongs to everyone, these are mines that belong to everyone.”One Iranian who filmed a restaurant affirmed, “If I go in there to have just one meal, it would cost me half of my monthly salary.“I would need to work 15 days to afford a meal at this restaurant on this street. Only the men – the children of the country’s leaders, the children of politicians, the members of the Revolutionary Guards, their children, and they themselves – only they can come to a place like this to shop.”Differents between the 'haves' and 'have not'sALI SAID the country’s leaders brought in brand-new European cars, importing them through Dubai.“Only members of the Revolutionary Guards and the children of the country’s leaders can get into these cars,” he said. “They drive the latest car models in the world. They drive Porsches, Maseratis, Benzes, and BMWs with zero mileage, but we can’t even afford to buy low-quality locally made cars.”In contrast to such a lavish lifestyle, Ali said he had electricity for only one hour per day.“God knows where the electricity goes. All the stores you see are open, but since there is no electricity, they can’t close them, and they can’t sell anything. Life is completely disrupted.“For me, everything is over. I hope to die a thousand times a day,” Ali said, adding he was aware of the danger of speaking with an Israeli news outlet. “I know that maybe one day they will arrest me, but that’s okay. I am ready to go to prison.”According to Ali, most of the citizens feel similarly to him.“Know this, [Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei: This is your end. You are old; you are dying. No one will replace you. We, the ordinary people, will not allow it. If the working class decides to rise up, bullets and tanks will not be able to stop them. The people will overthrow this regime. A workers’ uprising is coming. They will not let Mojtaba Khamenei become Iran’s heir.”He further noted, “Later, history books will write that there was once a country, the richest in the world, but its people were the poorest in the world.”Maryam, an Iranian woman of the Baha’i faith who lives in Iran’s southern Khuzestan province, shared her experience of having to wear a hijab even though it isn’t promulgated by her religion.“Since we generally do not have a hijab at all in our religion... their approach to the hijab has become much more lenient, and what mainly troubles women today is the fine imposed on cars.“They issue it if you are caught behind the wheel without a hijab three times. You will receive three SMS warnings to comply with the hijab mandate, and if you do not adhere to it, they will issue an order to confiscate your car.”She recounted how, when visiting a bank, “A woman wearing a hijab approached me and said, ‘Ma’am, put on your head covering.’ She said, ‘You live here in Iran. You must wear your head covering. The bank manager can refuse to serve you right now because you are not wearing a hijab.’”She responded, “It’s none of your business that I am not wearing a head covering.”She addressed the case of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman whose death in the custody of the morality police sparked widespread protests.“After Mahsa’s case, I found the courage to remove the head covering in the street. Before that, I couldn’t,” Maryam said.“They have made people very angry, especially women, especially when they confiscate cars. Everyone says this is just their way of putting some money in their pockets,” she added.According to Maryam, the regime will not survive, considering the pressures it is under and the mistakes it has made against its own people.“It will destroy itself with its own hands,” she noted.All want to have good relations with IsraelWith regard to Israel, Maryam said they all want to have very good relations with Israel, and they all love Israel – even the men.“It’s funny – many Iranian women have fallen in love with Israeli soldiers because they are so handsome. They hoped that Israel would attack Iran,” she said.“I hope that one day something will happen that will pave the way for Israelis to come to our country and for us to be able to do the same with ease,” Maryam said. “Especially for us, as Baha’is, because one of my dreams is to go there, to visit Haifa and see the great gardens... I have always prayed to God for this.”

They will not let Mojtaba Khamenei become Iran’s heir.”He further noted, “Later, history books will write that there was once a country, the richest in the world, but its people were the poorest in the world.”Maryam, an Iranian woman of the Baha’i faith who lives in Iran’s southern Khuzestan province, shared her experience of having to wear a hijab even though it isn’t promulgated by her religion.“Since we generally do not have a hijab at all in our religion... their approach to the hijab has become much more lenient, and what mainly troubles women today is the fine imposed on cars.“They issue it if you are caught behind the wheel without a hijab three times. You will receive three SMS warnings to comply with the hijab mandate, and if you do not adhere to it, they will issue an order to confiscate your car.”She recounted how, when visiting a bank, “A woman wearing a hijab approached me and said, ‘Ma’am, put on your head covering.’ She said, ‘You live here in Iran. You must wear your head covering. The bank manager can refuse to serve you right now because you are not wearing a hijab.’”She responded, “It’s none of your business that I am not wearing a head covering.”She addressed the case of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman whose death in the custody of the morality police sparked widespread protests.“After Mahsa’s case, I found the courage to remove the head covering in the street. Before that, I couldn’t,” Maryam said.“They have made people very angry, especially women, especially when they confiscate cars. Everyone says this is just their way of putting some money in their pockets,” she added.According to Maryam, the regime will not survive, considering the pressures it is under and the mistakes it has made against its own people.“It will destroy itself with its own hands,” she noted.All want to have good relations with IsraelWith regard to Israel, Maryam said they all want to have very good relations with Israel, and they all love Israel – even the men.“It’s funny – many Iranian women have fallen in love with Israeli soldiers because they are so handsome. They hoped that Israel would attack Iran,” she said.“I hope that one day something will happen that will pave the way for Israelis to come to our country and for us to be able to do the same with ease,” Maryam said. “Especially for us, as Baha’is, because one of my dreams is to go there, to visit Haifa and see the great gardens... I have always prayed to God for this.”
            



The Iranian who sent the footage greeted Israeli viewers, noting, “It’s not every day that viewers get to see such images of Tehran,” adding they had filmed it with “great difficulty and fear.” 'If you talk to Israelis, you become a spy.'Ali, who filmed his underground ride to Tehran’s District 1, where senior officials reside, said he committed a very dangerous act.If you just talk to Israelis, you become a spy, and they will execute you,” he said.

I have no profession,” he said. “People are tired – Iranian citizens who are exhausted by the Islamic Republic feel uneasy, bored, and submissive.” AdvertisementAli then brought the viewer to a shopping arcade on Tehran’s exclusive Fereshteh Street, where women are reportedly allowed to walk in public without a hijab.“I had to film in a way that wouldn’t be noticed. If the image quality isn’t good, I apologize to the honorable people of Israel,” Ali said.“Of all the products, not a single one is under $200 or at least $300,” with only 1% of Iran’s population being able to afford such products, according to Ali.  “But why? A country rich in oil, with the second-largest oil reserves in the world, [and] the second-largest gas reserves in the world,” he asked. “This is oil that belongs to everyone, this is gas that belongs to everyone, these are mines that belong to everyone.”One Iranian who filmed a restaurant affirmed, “If I go in there to have just one meal, it would cost me half of my monthly salary.“I would need to work 15 days to afford a meal at this restaurant on this street. Only the men – the children of the country’s leaders, the children of politicians, the members of the Revolutionary Guards, their children, and they themselves – only they can come to a place like this to shop.”Differents between the 'haves' and 'have not'sALI SAID the country’s leaders brought in brand-new European cars, importing them through Dubai.“Only members of the Revolutionary Guards and the children of the country’s leaders can get into these cars,” he said. “They drive the latest car models in the world. They drive Porsches, Maseratis, Benzes, and BMWs with zero mileage, but we can’t even afford to buy low-quality locally made cars.”In contrast to such a lavish lifestyle, Ali said he had electricity for only one hour per day.“God knows where the electricity goes. All the stores you see are open, but since there is no electricity, they can’t close them, and they can’t sell anything. Life is completely disrupted.“For me, everything is over. I hope to die a thousand times a day,” Ali said, adding he was aware of the danger of speaking with an Israeli news outlet. “I know that maybe one day they will arrest me, but that’s okay. I am ready to go to prison.”According to Ali, most of the citizens feel similarly to him.“Know this, [Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei: This is your end. You are old; you are dying. No one will replace you. We, the ordinary people, will not allow it. If the working class decides to rise up, bullets and tanks will not be able to stop them. The people will overthrow this regime.

A US bipartisan bill calling for the banning and dismantling of Hezbollah and its operations in Latin America was introduced by Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis and Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen.The No Hezbollah in Our Hemisphere Act proposes a series of measures for US federal agencies to counter the Lebanese terrorist group’s influence in the region and to pressure states to expel its networks from within their borders.The act notes that the only Latin American countries that designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization were Argentina, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Paraguay. The bill called for the persuasion of other allies to proscribe the group by following the Argentinian designation model.  The US would engage with other governments to ensure they had legislative tools to investigate terrorism activities and financial operations.Friday’s legislation would see the US demand that Latin American states “put an end to the impunity enjoyed by designated individuals and entities or face consequences,” which could include the blacklisting of government entities cooperating with Hezbollah and the ineligibility for visas and admission to the US for government officials of terrorist sanctuary.A state would be categorized as a terrorist sanctuary based on a multi-federal agency assessment formulated on the extent to which Hezbollah or other terrorist organizations operated in the country with the knowledge and tolerance of the host government.

(credit: GETTY IMAGES) Growing infrastructure for terrorist networks in South AmericaThe preamble explained that Hezbollah was growing its infrastructure in Peru, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, with a focus on infiltrating criminal networks.The legislation accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s regime of serving as a forward operating base for the Iranian proxy group.“Iran-backed Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that has operated in the Western Hemisphere for decades to raise funds for its destabilizing activities around the globe,” Rosen said. “This is a threat to US national security and cannot be tolerated. That’s why I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan bill to make clear that we will not accept countries turning a blind eye to Hezbollah’s harmful actions.”   Stay updated with the latest news!

Rosen directs the United States to take action on Hezbollah’s alarming presence in Latin America to help keep us and our allies, including Israel, safe from their terrorist ambitions,” said Curtis.The American Jewish Committee commended Rosen and Curtis for introducing the legislation, adding, “Hezbollah’s terrorist activities in Latin America pose a serious threat not only to the safety of Jewish communities in the region but also to the stability of the entire hemisphere.”

The US vetoed a proposal by Canada aimed at curbing the ""shadow fleet"" of Russian oil tankers, which are used to evade sanctions placed on the embattled country during its war with Ukraine, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.The proposal to create a task force that would monitor Russia's violations of sanctions, released ahead of a planned meeting of foreign ministers of G7 countries in Quebec, was rejected by the US in favor of watered-down language on Russia and stronger language on China, sources told Bloomberg.  For example, the US looked to remove the word ""sanctions"" from the proposal and replace language on Russia's “ability to maintain its war” with ""earn revenue.""

Many major Jewish organizations, have failed the hostages and the Jewish people by not taking an unequivocal stand for the hostages, Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was released from Hamas captivity in the most recent hostage deal, told The Jerusalem Post.“History will also not look kindly on some, not all, of the leaderships of major Jewish organizations, in North America certainly,” he said, calling out their “inability, unwillingness, or fear” to advocate for the Jewish people if it meant going against Israel’s government.  “All of these organizations, all of them, were created for the betterment of the people of Israel; the people of Israel, not this or that politician of Israel,” he stressed.The organizations should have understood the historical importance of solidarity and pidyon shvuyim (the commandment to bring hostages back), looked at the present to see what is important for Israelis and the Jewish people, and looked forward to what it would mean to abandon the hostages, Dekel-Chen said.He touched on what it would mean to “allow hostages to die in captivity or a terrorist organization,” saying, “The damage could be irreparable to the basic values of Jews everywhere.” Jonathan Dekel-Chen. (credit: RAQUEL GUERTZENSTEIN FROHLICH)These organizations should have “put the force, such as it is, of the Jewish organizational world behind prioritizing getting these hostages home above all else.” They should have said in a clear voice that pidyon shvuyim “is an irrefutable Jewish value” that has “been a practice in Jewish history for over 1,000 years.”“The abandonment of that principle in favor of anything – turf wars, fear of anger from within their own communities, and their own positions in leadership, I think is an embarrassment,” he added in the Wednesday interview.This practice has never been done under perfect circumstances, Dekel-Chen highlighted.

Obviously, it’s going to be with problematic parties.“I am sure history will not judge them well,” he said, adding, “There is still time for course correction.”Irony and a betrayalAsked about his and other hostages’ families’ efforts for the captives and how the families and the kidnapped themselves have been forced to advocate for the remaining hostages, Dekel-Chen said it is ironic and a betrayal. “In a perfect world, the biggest single advocate for the hostages, in action and not just lip service, would be the government of Israel. That simply hasn’t happened,” he said.“As a result, hostage families themselves have had to take it on.“Speaking as a historian of the Jewish people, history will not judge these leaders well for what they have already done and for what I fear they might continue to do,” he added.When discussing the unique difficulties of those evacuated from Israel’s destroyed southern kibbutzim, Dekel-Chen asserted that the government “has made a point of kind of erasing the destruction of the kibbutzim in the public eye.”“The prime minister has yet to visit Kibbutz Nir Oz or to speak with us directly despite [us] inviting him many, many times.”Feeling of abandonment before October 7He emphasized that many community members felt abandoned long before October 7, 2023.“There are two Israels,” he explained. “There is the Israel of a portion of the coastal strip and Jerusalem that receives a disproportionate amount of funding and government attention, and then there’s everything else.”“This is a long-term problem,” he added, saying, “Benjamin Netanyahu or this government didn’t invent this gap, but it’s built and become much more serious as a result of the specific coalitions that he has put together over time since 1996, and their priorities vs the needs of the country as a whole.“We felt pretty much abandoned, certainly since 2008 [and Hamas’s rise to power] when we had to fend for ourselves for the most part in figuring out how to deal with ever-present daily danger from Gaza.”Part of the “colossal failure” of October 7 was not just because of Hamas’s extensive planning but because of government neglect and a lack of government and army recognition of the real needs of the periphery, he said.“I suppose it’s only natural that the neglect continues after October 7, lip service and political posturing aside,” he added.“Actual engagement and actual solutions simply aren’t there because the government has different priorities.”Dekel-Chen highlighted that the public has been a bright spot since October 7.“The vast majority of Israelis, whatever their background, whatever their political orientation, whatever their religious orientation, have been embracing of the hostage families and, generally speaking, our communities,” he said.“I feel it in Kiryat Gat; I feel it wherever I go in the country.”There is a sense of “ground-up” reconciliation among Israelis, he said, highlighting that this has been especially true between national-religious communities and the kibbutzim.It’s “horrific” that it took the crisis of October 7 to bring the recognition of how much the communities have in common, but it’s happening, he said.“It’s ground-up,” he stressed. “All of our politicians, all of them, do not do us proper service in terms of finding common ground.”

Asked about his and other hostages’ families’ efforts for the captives and how the families and the kidnapped themselves have been forced to advocate for the remaining hostages, Dekel-Chen said it is ironic and a betrayal. “In a perfect world, the biggest single advocate for the hostages, in action and not just lip service, would be the government of Israel. That simply hasn’t happened,” he said.“As a result, hostage families themselves have had to take it on.“Speaking as a historian of the Jewish people, history will not judge these leaders well for what they have already done and for what I fear they might continue to do,” he added.When discussing the unique difficulties of those evacuated from Israel’s destroyed southern kibbutzim, Dekel-Chen asserted that the government “has made a point of kind of erasing the destruction of the kibbutzim in the public eye.”“The prime minister has yet to visit Kibbutz Nir Oz or to speak with us directly despite [us] inviting him many, many times.”Feeling of abandonment before October 7He emphasized that many community members felt abandoned long before October 7, 2023.“There are two Israels,” he explained. “There is the Israel of a portion of the coastal strip and Jerusalem that receives a disproportionate amount of funding and government attention, and then there’s everything else.”“This is a long-term problem,” he added, saying, “Benjamin Netanyahu or this government didn’t invent this gap, but it’s built and become much more serious as a result of the specific coalitions that he has put together over time since 1996, and their priorities vs the needs of the country as a whole.“We felt pretty much abandoned, certainly since 2008 [and Hamas’s rise to power] when we had to fend for ourselves for the most part in figuring out how to deal with ever-present daily danger from Gaza.”Part of the “colossal failure” of October 7 was not just because of Hamas’s extensive planning but because of government neglect and a lack of government and army recognition of the real needs of the periphery, he said.“I suppose it’s only natural that the neglect continues after October 7, lip service and political posturing aside,” he added.“Actual engagement and actual solutions simply aren’t there because the government has different priorities.”Dekel-Chen highlighted that the public has been a bright spot since October 7.“The vast majority of Israelis, whatever their background, whatever their political orientation, whatever their religious orientation, have been embracing of the hostage families and, generally speaking, our communities,” he said.“I feel it in Kiryat Gat; I feel it wherever I go in the country.”There is a sense of “ground-up” reconciliation among Israelis, he said, highlighting that this has been especially true between national-religious communities and the kibbutzim.It’s “horrific” that it took the crisis of October 7 to bring the recognition of how much the communities have in common, but it’s happening, he said.“It’s ground-up,” he stressed. “All of our politicians, all of them, do not do us proper service in terms of finding common ground.”

Defense Minister Israel Katz on Sunday publicly confirmed recent reports that Israel will undertake the radical move of allowing Syrian Druze and Circassians to cross into the Israeli side of the Golan for work purposes.The unusual move of allowing foreign citizens of a hostile state like Syria to work in Israel could have geopolitical ripples across the region and is a testament to how radically the Middle East has changed even just in the last few months.  Until December 7-8, Syria was run by the Assad regime, which while it kept a ceasefire with Israel since 1974, was formally in a state of war with the Jewish state and which was a critical link in the chain of Iranian efforts to smuggle weapons to Hezbollah.Assad's Syria also presented a direct threat to Syria from Iranian militias who might invade and from the Syrian military's air force, long-range missiles, and chemical weapons.

Not trusting al-Sharaa due to his jihadist background, Israel moved quickly to create a buffer zone in southern Syria to prevent even the possibility of a new invasion by the new Syrian regime, and included in the zone were large segments of the Syrian Druze population.IDF in SyriaThroughout the three months that IDF Division 210 has been in southern Syria, there have been efforts to build stronger relations with the Syrian Druze to keep them calm about Israel's presence there and to avoid friction.

The administration of US President Donald Trump is laying out a new Iran doctrine. It blends some elements of his first administration’s maximum pressure, with more carrots for Iran in the form of hints at a possible new deal.Iranian officials are saying they didn’t receive any correspondence from Trump, however, and this may be two sides talking at each other while bluffing.  Iran has not received any letter from the United States, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqhchi said over the weekend. This came after Iranian state media said Trump had “claimed to have sent a letter to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution on negotiations with the Islamic Republic.”It wasn’t clear if there was a physical letter involved or merely messaging. Advertisement“There’ll be some interesting days ahead,” Trump said recently. “That’s all I can tell you. You know, we’re down to final strokes with Iran… [we] can’t let them have a nuclear weapon... They have a lot of nice oil wells, right? So anyway, it’s going to be a big thing. It’s an interesting time in the history of the world, but we have a situation with Iran, and something’s going to happen very soon.” People wave flags next to an Iranian missile on display during the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Tehran, Iran, February 10, 2025.  (credit: Majid Asgaripour/WANA via Reuters)Araqhchi said he learned about the letter, which is “on its way.” This seems to imply it’s literally a physical letter. “We have heard the same, [but] we haven’t got anything yet,” Araqhchi said in a television interview. “It hasn’t arrived yet.” He was attending a meeting in Tehran at the time, where Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei was receiving local officials.Khamenei has slammed the US and encouraged Iran not to begin new talks with Washington.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad-Baqer Qalibaf said: “We do not wait for any letter from the US, and we believe that by using internal capacities and opportunities for developing foreign relations, we can achieve a position that the enemy has no choice but to lift the sanctions within the framework of negotiations with the remaining parties to the JCPOA.” AdvertisementQalibaf made the remark at the start of an open session of parliament on Sunday, Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Iran’s official news agency, reported.It is clear that Iranian officials have message discipline on this “letter” issue.Condemning new sanctionsMeanwhile, Iran has condemned new sanctions from Canada, which followed sanctions from the US. The US wants to cut off Iran’s oil exports and also target its trade in components for drones and other products.  On Friday, Canada announced new sanctions on Iran, “targeting seven individuals and entities over their alleged links to networks involved in the production of weapons, which Ottawa claims have been sent to Russia for use in the Ukraine war,” IRNA reported.The reports come as Iran is flexing its naval muscles this week. Iran, Russia, and China are beginning drills called “Security Belt,” IRNA reported.“The drill will take place in the Indian Ocean. Iran, Russia, and China have increased cooperation in recent years,” the report said. “The navies of Iran, China, and Russia will kick off joint drills in the northern Indian Ocean with the aim of promoting security in the area and enhancing trilateral naval cooperation.”Iran said observer countries would include Azerbaijan, South Africa, Oman, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Qatar, Iraq, the UAE, and Sri Lanka. Iraq is a friend of Iran, and Oman and Iran have drilled land forces together before. Qatar also backs Iran.

Elon Musk has pushed for the United States' exit from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), saying that it “doesn’t make sense for America to pay for the defense of Europe.”

The billionaire, who co-chairs the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), was responding to an X post that called for US to “Exit NATO *now*!”

“We really should,” Musk said.

On March 2, Musk had responded a post on X which said,""It’s time to leave NATO and the UN"".

“I agree,” the Tesla chief executive officer said. 

Musk’s comments comes at a time when the future of the 32-member NATO, which will mark its 76th anniversary in April, hangs in the balance.

According to NBC, US President Donald Trump on March 6 discussed with aides calibrating US engagement with NATO in a way that favours members of the alliance that spend a certain percentage of their GDP on defense.

ALSO READ: Trump casts doubt on NATO solidarity, despite it aiding the US after Sept. 11

Trump said he told NATO allies that if they’re not going to pay their bills, he won’t defend them.

“It’s common sense, right. If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them. No, I’m not going to defend them,"" Bloomberg quoted Trump as saying at the Oval Office. 

Within NATO, Europe — which largely disarmed after the Cold War — is reliant on the US for communications, intelligence and logistics as well as strategic military leadership and firepower.

European Union leaders met in Brussels for an emergency summit last week to massively increase defense spending.

The officials discussed a European Commission proposal that includes as much as €150 billion ($162.5 billion) in loans to member states for defense, as well as plans to allow countries to use their national budgets to potentially spend €650 billion on defense over four years without triggering budgetary penalties.

“In the last weeks, we’ve seen what I would call quite a turbulent development. It’s still not perhaps very clear what finally will be the American strategy,"" EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius told Bloomberg.

Under a 2023 law, a president can’t unilaterally withdraw from the alliance without a two-thirds supermajority in the Senate or an act of Congress.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Sunday that recent advances by Russian forces against Ukraine in the Kursk region suggest that Kyiv's soldiers were almost surrounded, reported Reuters.

“The lid of the smoking cauldron is almost closed. The offensive continues,” the former Russian president wrote on Telegram.

According to Ukraine’s military and Russian war bloggers, Russian special forces walked miles inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in the Kursk region.

Moscow had used the pipeline until recently to send gas to Europe. According to the Associated Press, some Russian troops had spent several days in the pipe before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near the town of Sudzha.

Russian Telegram channels showed pictures of special forces in gas masks and lights, some using colourful Russian curses, along the inside of what looked like a large pipe, according to Reuters.

Ukraine Ukraine’s General Staff had also confirmed on Saturday that Russian “sabotage and assault groups” used the pipeline in a bid to gain a foothold outside the town of Sudzha.

“At present, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. The enemy’s losses in Sudzha are very high,” the General Staff had claimed.

Last year, Ukraine launched a daring cross-border incursion into Kursk in August. It was the largest attack on Russian territory since World War II.

Within days, Ukrainian units had captured 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of territory, including the strategic border town of Sudzha, and taken hundreds of Russian prisoners of war.

Kyiv was hoping the Russian city would act as a bargaining chip in future peace talks and force Russia to divert troops away from its offensive in eastern Ukraine.

But Ukraine's troops in Kursk have seen their position worsen in recent weeks as Russian forces pushed back, according to AFP.

Russian special forces infiltrated deep into a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in the Kursk region, Ukraine's military and Russian war bloggers reported.

Moscow's attack comes as it intensifies efforts to recapture parts of its border province that Ukraine seized in a shock offensive.

According to Telegram posts by a Ukrainian-born, pro-Kremlin blogger, Russian operatives walked about 15 kilometres (9 miles) inside the pipeline, which Moscow had until recently used to send gas to Europe, AP reported.

Another war blogger, who uses the alias 'Two Majors', said fierce fighting took place in Sudzha, and that Russian forces managed to enter the town using a gas pipeline.

Several Russian Telegram channels showed photos of special forces soldiers wearing gas masks and moving along what looked like the inside of a large pipe.

The development was later confirmed by Ukraine's General Staff on Saturday who said that the Russian “sabotage and assault groups” used the pipeline for the strike.

“At present, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. The enemy's losses in Sudzha are very high,” the General Staff reported.

Some Russian troops had spent several days in the pipe before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near the town of Sudzha, blogger Yuri Podolyaka claimed.

Within days, Ukrainian units had captured 1,000 square kilometres (386 square miles) of territory, including the strategic border town of Sudzha, and taken hundreds of Russian prisoners of war.

According to Kyiv, the operation aimed to gain a bargaining chip in future peace talks, and force Russia to divert troops away from its grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine.

Sudzha had some 5,000 residents before the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and is house to some major gas transfer and measuring stations along the pipeline.

NASA's Sunita Williams formally transferred command of the ISS to the Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin, days before her departure for Earth. The historic event highlighted mutual cooperation between Roscosmos and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Notably, the modification comes ahead of Williams's scheduled plan to board the SpaceX Dragon in a bid to return to Earth after nine months.

Speaking at the command handover ceremony, Williams thanked everyone who assisted her with the mission, including trainers, friends, family and control centers.

The Indian-American astronaut's leadership has been crucial to keeping the station running during her tenure.

“We will miss you,” she said as she handed over the command to Ovchinin, USA Today reported.

Williams' leadership ensured seamless operations with Crew-10 en route, demonstrating the continued international cooperation on board the space station. With the two space agencies taking turns in charge, this change of command marks a major shift in the way the station operates.

Williams is preparing to return to Earth with NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Nick Hague, Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, and others.

The SpaceX Crew-10 mission, which is scheduled to launch on March 12 and 13, will determine when they depart from space. Williams will head out with her fellow crew members on March 19 following a week-long handover procedure with Crew-10.

The team of Crew-10 includes NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Takuya Onishi.

Ovchinin will remain in orbit until the middle of April, collaborating with NASA Flight Engineer Don Pettit and Roscosmos Flight Engineer Ivan Vagner.

On June 5, 2024, Williams and Butch Wilmore set out on their voyage aboard Boeing's Starliner spaceship, which was originally planned to last eight days. However, their return was delayed due to technical issues.

The 59-year-old Williams already achieved space exploration milestones. She set a new record of 62 hours and 6 minutes of spacewalking time in the woman category in January of this year.

 WARSAW, - Poland, which pays for Ukraine's Starlink internet services, may seek an alternative if Elon Musk's company proves to be ""unreliable"", the foreign minister said on Sunday after the billionaire speculated about turning off access to the system. 

 Starlink provides crucial internet connectivity to Ukraine and its military. U.S. negotiators pressing Kyiv for access to Ukraine's critical minerals have raised the possibility of cutting the country's access to the service, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters in February. 

 Musk, a high-profile figure in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, said in a post on his X social media platform on Sunday, that Ukraine's ""entire front line would collapse if I turned it off"". 

 He said he was ""sickened by ... years of slaughter in a stalemate that Ukraine will inevitably lose"". 

 The U.S. government has already revoked some access to satellite imagery for Ukraine and paused intelligence sharing, piling pressure on Kyiv as Trump seeks a swift end to the war, now in its fourth year after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. 

 ""Starlinks for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year,"" Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski wrote on X. 

 ""The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers."" 

 Starlink's parent company SpaceX did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment outside normal business hours. 

 Shares in Franco-British satellite operator Eutelsat soared as much as 650% during the week ending March 7, due to speculation the company could replace Starlink in providing internet access to Ukraine. 

 The shares pulled back on Friday to end the week up around 380%. 

 Poland said in February that it would continue to cover Ukraine's Starlink subscription despite sources saying the U.S. could consider cutting it.

Israel on Sunday said it was cutting off its electricity supply to Gaza, Associated Press reported. The effects of the move are not immediately clear. However, the conflict-hit territory's desalination plants receive power for producing drinking water.

The announcement comes a week after Israel cut off all supplies of goods to the territory to over 2 million people. It has sought to press Palestinian militant group Hamas to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend.

Hamas has pressed to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase instead.

Gaza has been largely devastated by the war, and generators and solar panels are used for some of the power supply.

Israel on Sunday carried out an airstrike in northern Gaza, as it prepared for fresh talks in Doha on the future of its truce with Hamas, AFP reported.

Despite the end of the truce's initial phase a week ago, both sides have refrained from returning to all-out war, though there have been sporadic episodes of violence. Sunday's air strike was the latest of daily strikes reported by Israel since Thursday.

The Palestinian militant group has repeatedly called for an immediate start to negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase, which was negotiated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt aiming to bring a permanent end to the war.

Israel says it prefers an extension of phase one until mid-April, and cut off aid to Gaza over the impasse.

Hamas representatives met mediators in Cairo over the weekend, emphasising the urgent need to resume humanitarian aid deliveries to the territory ""without restrictions or conditions"", a Hamas statement said.

""We call on mediators in Egypt and Qatar, as well as the guarantors in the US administration, to ensure that the occupation complies with the agreement... and proceeds with the second phase according to the agreed-upon terms,"" Hamas spokesman, Hazem Qassem, told AFP.

The US Secret Service shot an unidentified person near the White House in Washington, DC, on Sunday following an ""armed confrontation.""

“An adult male was shot by US Secret Service personnel following an armed confrontation with law enforcement in Washington, DC,” a statement issued by the Secret Service said.

The Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting the US president and vice president, said local police had shared information about a “suicidal individual” who could be travelling to Washington DC from Indiana.

“Around midnight, members of the Secret Service encountered the individual’s parked vehicle near 17th and F Streets, NW. They also saw an individual on foot matching the description nearby,” the federal agency said.

“As officers approached, the individual brandished a firearm and an armed confrontation ensued, during which shots were fired by our personnel,” it added.

President Donald Trump was not in the residence at the time, reported Reuters. Trump is spending the weekend at his Florida residence.

According to the Secret Service, the suspect was taken to a local hospital and his condition is unknown. No Secret Service agent sustained injuries in the incident.

Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that the DC police department will lead the investigation into the incident, as it is the primary agency responsible for use-of-force incidents within the District of Columbia.

“The incident is under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department Internal Affairs Division’s Force Investigations Team, which investigates all law enforcement officer-involved shootings in the District of Columbia,” the Secret Service said.

Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh on Sunday stated that US President Trump had made tariffs a household name across the world.

Donald Trump recently claimed that India had agreed to reduce tariffs levied against US imports after slamming the country for having high duties.

Jairam Ramesh in a post on X, said, “Till the mid-1910s tariffs were the main source of revenue for the US government. In 1913, the US Constitution was amended to introduce a federal income tax for the first time.”

He added, “One of the most influential economists who championed and campaigned for the federal income tax was Edwin Seligman, a Professor of Public Finance at Columbia University.”

Jairam Ramesh stated that Seligman was also Babasaheb Ambedkar's mentor in economics, and the two stayed in touch with Ambedkar after his graduation from Columbia.

Earlier, on Saturday, the Congress leader had questioned prime minister Modi about Trump's claims tat India would be reducing duties levied on US imports.

Are the interests of Indian farmers and of Indian manufacturing being compromised? The PM must take Parliament into confidence when it resumes on March 10th,"" Ramesh wrote on in a post on X.

Ramesh had also criticised Donald Trump for announcing retaliatory tariffs against several countries and indulging in a trade war.

""'You tariff, I tariff', that is not the way international trade functions. These rules have been negotiated. The WTO is World Trade Organisation not World Trump Organisation,"" he said.

Authorities in the Dominican Republic are searching for a 20-year-old Indian-origin student who went missing while on her spring break trip with classmates. According to the New York Post, Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student, was reported missing on Thursday, while travelling with a group in the resort town of Punta Cana. Authorities in the Dominican Republic said Ms Konanki went missing while ""walking the beach"" and has not been seen or heard from since.

""Our office was contacted on Thursday evening about a missing female from Loudoun County who was with a group of other people traveling in the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana specifically,"" a Loudoun County Sheriff's Office spokesperson said Saturday, per the Post.  

The 20-year-old is said to have vanished while walking on the beach wearing a bikini, local officials said. A missing person's poster describes her as 5 feet 3 inches, with black hair and brown eyes.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made an ironic quip on Sunday about his choice not to wear a suit to the White House, where he faced a dressing-down from Donald Trump.

In a video released by the presidency, Zelensky, a former actor and comedian, thanked the audience at the end of his speech at an awards ceremony, adding: ""Sorry I'm not in a suit"", to smiles and applause.

The president was dressed in a black outfit with Ukraine's trident symbol similar to what he wore during his acrimonious exchange with the US president last month.

Since Russia invaded in February 2022, Zelensky has swapped suits for casual military-style gear such as T-shirts and fleeces in khaki or black.



This makes him stand out at any gathering of leaders and emphasises that his country is fighting a war. His team has followed his example.

But at the Oval Office meeting, a reporter for a right-wing broadcaster, Brian Glenn, mockingly asked Zelensky why he was not wearing a suit.

""I will wear (a suit) after this war finishes,"" Zelensky answered wearily in an exchange widely shared online.

Media outlet Axios reported, citing sources, that Trump was irritated Zelensky did not wear a suit at the meeting after US advisers told him it would be more ""respectful"" to wear a suit.

Trump remarked sarcastically when Zelensky appeared that ""he is all dressed up today"", before virulently laying into the Ukrainian leader.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov gave a lengthy commentary on the Oval Office talks to state television on Sunday, expressing horror at the exchange.

""Being a diplomat by profession, I could not believe my eyes, nor my ears,"" he said, claiming that rulers have not resorted to such brutal tactics since ""ancient times"".

""It used to happen in ancient times, that they would chop off the head of a state who went somewhere on a visit or put him in prison. But I think that even by the mediaeval era, that did not happen,"" he said.

With Bashar al-Assad's departure, the fate of Syria's Alawite community remains precarious. Once empowered by the regime, many Alawites now face reprisals from rebel factions and displaced Sunni populations who suffered under Assad's rule. Revenge attacks have already killed over 1,000 people, including hundreds of Alawites, as power dynamics in Syria shift violently. The violence is among the deadliest since Syria's conflict began 14 years ago.

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), 745 civilians-mostly shot at close range-were among the dead. Another 125 government security personnel and 148 militants linked to Assad-affiliated armed groups were also killed. The fighting has left large parts of Latakia without electricity and drinking water.

SOHR reported that Syrian security forces executed at least 162 Alawites in ""field executions"" in Latakia province, a stronghold of Assad, who belongs to the sect. The Syrian Interior Ministry acknowledged ""individual violations"" along the coast and vowed to take action.

The clashes, which erupted Thursday, are a major challenge to Syria's new rulers, who took power three months ago after removing Assad. The government claims it was responding to attacks from remnants of Assad's forces and downplayed the killings as isolated incidents.

Who Are The Alawites?

The Alawites are a religious minority in Syria, constituting about 12 per cent of the population. Originating from Shia Islam, they have distinct beliefs and rituals. Historically, the Alawites have been concentrated in Syria's coastal regions, especially in Latakia and Tartus provinces.

The Assad family, which ruled Syria for over five decades until December 2024, belongs to the Alawite sect. During their rule, Alawites held significant positions in the military and government, leading to perceptions of preferential treatment.

Why Are They Being Killed?

After Assad's ousting, armed Sunni factions, reportedly loyal to the new government, launched revenge killings against Alawites, further deepening Syria's sectarian divide. This escalation threatens the authority of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the hardline Sunni faction that played a central role in removing Assad from power.

For decades, Alawites formed the backbone of Assad's support base. Now, they are facing deadly reprisals. Eyewitnesses described harrowing scenes in Alawite villages, where gunmen executed civilians, most of them men, either in the streets or at their doorsteps. Homes were looted and torched, forcing thousands to flee to the nearby mountains.

Baniyas, one of the worst-hit towns, has witnessed some of the most brutal attacks. Residents reported seeing bodies strewn on the streets and abandoned on rooftops. In some cases, gunmen prevented locals from collecting the bodies of their neighbours for hours.

Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident who fled with his family, described a massacre in his neighborhood, where at least 20 Alawites were killed. Some were executed in their shops, others inside their homes.

""It was very very bad. Bodies were on the streets,"" Sheha recounted via phone from a nearby town. The gunmen were firing at random people, asking for IDs to check people's sect before killing them, Sheha said.

International Reactions

France has expressed ""deep concern"" over the ongoing violence, strongly condemning atrocities committed on religious grounds. In a statement on Saturday, the French Foreign Ministry urged Syria's interim government to ensure independent investigations into the mass killings.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, who recently completed nine months at the International Space Station (ISS) with follow astronaut Butch Wilmore, recently revealed the hardest part of being stranded in space. For Williams, whose eight-day mission extended to over 270-day stay in space, the most challenging part wasn't lack of gravity or the confined quarters, but the uncertainty over the timeline of her return--for her and her family waiting for her back home on Earth.

Addressing the press from the International Space Station (ISS) on Thursday, Williams said, ""The hardest part is having the folks on the ground not know exactly when we're coming back. It's been a rollercoaster for them - probably more so than for us.""

Long-time NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams embarked for the ISS on the Boeing Starliner on June 5, 2024, for an eight-day stay. However, their spacecraft suffered multiple technical issues en route to space. resulting in NASA declaring the Starliner too risky to carry astronauts back home. The spacecraft returned to Earth without its crew in September, leaving the two astronauts without a ride home. 



Now, the American space agency is planning to bring both its astronauts back to Earth on March 19 or 20, but they will make their return with the help of billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX, aboard its Crew-9 return flight.

The astronaut's prolonged stay has also sparked controversy on the ground, with Musk claiming the astronauts were being left in space ""for political reasons."" US President Donald Trump also echoed the sentiment, suggesting that the former Biden administration was deliberately delaying their return. 

However, both Williams and Wilmore gracefully sidestepped the political drama. When asked to comment on the matter, Williams on Thursday said, ""We know what we've lived up here.""

 ""We have the utmost respect for everyone trying to get us home,' she added. 

Wilmore, meanwhile, said that he and Williams were left in the dark with ""no information whatsoever"" on what the Biden administration was doing to bring them back and therefore he believes Musk's claim 

""That's information that we simply don't have, so I believe him,"" Wilmore said.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

For two days, Rihab Kamel and her family hid terrified in their bathroom in the city of Baniyas as armed men stormed the neighbourhood, pursuing members of Syria's Alawite minority.

The coastal city is part of Syria's Alawite heartland that has been gripped by the fiercest violence since former president Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December.

""We turned off the lights and hid. When we were able to flee our neighbourhood of Al-Qusour, we found the roads full of corpses,"" Kamel, a 35-year-old mother, told AFP.

A Christian family sheltered them and then helped them reach the frontier with Lebanon, she said, adding that they planned to flee across the border.

""What crime did the children commit? Are they also supporters of the (toppled) regime?"" she said. ""We as Alawites are innocent.""

The violence erupted on Thursday after gunmen loyal to Assad attacked Syria's new security forces. The ensuing clashes resulted in dozens of deaths on both sides.

War monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights later reported that security forces and allied groups killed at least 745 Alawite civilians in Latakia and Tartus provinces.

Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that spearheaded the lightning offensive that toppled Assad, on Sunday called for ""national unity (and) civil peace"" to be preserved.

""God willing, we will be able to live together in this country,"" he said at a mosque in Damascus.

But in villages and towns on the coast, people spoke of systematic killings.

'Minutes' from death

Assad, himself an Alawite, sought to present himself as protector of Syria's minorities.

The new authorities have repeatedly promised an inclusive transition that protects the rights of religious minorities.

The Alawite heartland has nonetheless been gripped by a fear of reprisals over the Assad clan's decades of brutal rule.

Baniyas resident Samir Haidar, 67, told AFP two of his brothers and his nephew were killed by ""armed groups"" that entered people's homes.

Though an Alawite himself, Haidar belonged to the leftist opposition under the Assads and was imprisoned for more than a decade.

He said he began hearing explosions and gunfire on Friday morning with the arrival of forces deployed to the city, adding that there were ""foreigners among them"".

""They entered the building and killed my only neighbour,"" he said.

He managed to escape with his wife and two children to a Sunni neighbourhood, but said: ""If I had been five minutes late, I would have been killed.""

That same day, armed men entered his brother's building 100 metres (yards) away.

""They gathered all the men on the roof and opened fire on them,"" Haidar said.

""My nephew survived because he hid, but my brother was killed along with all the men in the building.""

He added that another brother, who was 74, and nephew were killed along with all the men in their building.

""There are houses with four or five dead bodies in them,"" Haidar said.

""We have appealed to be able to bury our dead,"" he said, adding that he has so far been unable to bury his brothers.

'Bodies in the sea'

In the port city of Latakia, AFP heard testimonies from residents who said armed groups abducted a number of Alawites who were killed.

Among them was the head of a state-run cultural centre, Yasser Sabbouh, who was kidnapped and whose corpse was dumped outside his home, an AFP reporter said.

In Jableh further south, a resident spoke to AFP in tears, saying they were being terrorised by armed groups who had taken control of the town.

""There are six of us in the house, with my parents and my brothers. There's been no electricity for four days, no water. We have nothing to eat and we do not dare go out,"" he said on condition of anonymity, fearing for his safety.

""More than 50 people from among my family and friends have been killed,"" he added. ""They gathered bodies with bulldozers and buried them in mass graves.""

Jaafar Ali, a 32-year-old Alawite from the region, fled to neighbouring Lebanon with his brother.

""I don't think I'm going back soon,"" he said. ""We are refugees without a homeland. We want countries to open up (channels for) humanitarian migration for Alawites.""

Frequent sleep disruptions, and confusing clock resets- daylight saving time has long been a source of frustration for several Americans. Many leaders and policymakers have called for an end to this biannual ritual. 

The debate over daylight saving time has been ongoing for decades. Recently, US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk voiced their opinions on the matter. Meanwhile, legislation is under consideration in the US Congress to permanently eliminate the practice of switching clocks twice a year.

While some support the idea of longer daylight hours in summer and the return to standard time in winter, others argue that the practice is outdated and disruptive. However, despite strong opinions on both sides, making a permanent change has proven to be a challenge.

Here's a look at the ongoing debate and why it's so difficult to do away with daylight saving time.

Trump's Stance on Daylight Saving Time

Trump initially appeared to support ending daylight saving time, but his recent remarks suggest he may not be fully committed to the idea.

In a December social media post, Trump criticised the biannual clock change, stating, ""The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't! Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation.""

However, just months later, his stance seemed less definitive. While signing executive orders on Thursday, Trump acknowledged the ongoing debate, calling it a ""fifty-fifty issue."" He added, ""It's something I can do, but a lot of people like it one way, a lot of people like it the other way.""

Daylight saving time shifts sunrise and sunset an hour later, affecting daily routines. Trump pointed out the divided opinions, saying, ""I assume people would like to have more light later, but some want more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark.""

Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk stirred the debate by conducting a poll on X, asking users whether they preferred an earlier or later time adjustment if the practice were abolished. Over 1.3 million people participated, with 58% voting for a later shift and 42% favouring an earlier one.

While the debate over daylight saving time continues, Trump's evolving stance suggests that any potential change remains uncertain.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Actor Shah Rukh Khan has secured a big victory in a dispute with the Income Tax authorities, with the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal or ITAT delivering a verdict in his favour. 

The dispute was related to the tax of his movie RA One, which was released in 2011.

The IT department had disputed Mr Khan's declared income of Rs 83.42 crore for 2011-2012, rejecting his claims for foreign tax credit for taxes paid in the UK. 

The department calculated his tax as Rs 84.17 crore, more than four years later.

The ITAT ruled that reassessment of the case by the IT department was not legally justified.

The assessing officer had failed to demonstrate ""any fresh tangible material warranting a reassessment beyond the four-year statutory period,"" ITAT said.

With the issue already been examined during the initial scrutiny, the re-assessment proceedings were bad in law on more than one count, ITAT said. 

Under Mr Khan's agreement with the Red Chillies Entertainment, 70 per cent of the film's shooting was to take place in UK and so an equal percentage of his income would be subject to UK taxes.

The IT Department contended that such an arrangement caused revenue loss to India and the officials refused his claim for foreign tax credit.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel announced Sunday it is cutting off its electricity supply to Gaza. The full effects were not immediately clear, but the arid territory’s desalination plants receive power for producing drinking water. Hamas called it part of Israel’s “starvation policy.”

Israel last week cut off all supplies of goods to the territory of over 2 million Palestinians, in an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of its war with Hamas. It seeks to press the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.

Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.

The militant group — which has warned that cutting off supplies to Gaza would affect the hostages as well — said Sunday it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position, calling for an immediate start of the ceasefire’s second phase.

Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday “in an effort to advance the negotiations” around the ceasefire.




Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The new letter from Israel’s energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza.

The coastal territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated by the war, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. The electricity cut could affect water pumps and sanitation. A spokesperson for the Israel Electric Corporation said as far as they know, the cutoff affected only a wastewater treatment plant.

Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam called it part of Israel’s “starvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.” He said Israel has ”practically” cut off electricity since the start of the war.

Israel has faced sharp criticism over cutting off supplies to Gaza. “Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,” the United Nations human rights office said Friday.

The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used “starvation as a method of warfare” when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is also central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide.

Israel has denied the accusations. It says it has allowed in enough aid and blamed shortages on what it called the U.N.’s inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid.

The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza for the first time since early in the war and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies.

The White House on Wednesday made the surprise confirmation of direct U.S. talks with Hamas.

On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told CNN that “I think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they’re not part of the political party going forward. I think that’s a reality. It’s real close.”

When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, “You never know.”

He added: “I think something could come together within weeks,” and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only the American ones.

Hamas on Sunday didn’t mention its talks with the U.S., but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections.

That committee would work “under the umbrella” of the Palestinian Authority, based in the occupied West Bank. Israel has rejected the PA having any role in Gaza, but hasn’t put forward an alternative for postwar rule.

Hamas’ attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements.

Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t say how many of the dead were militants.

Now, with the cutoff of all supplies to Gaza, Palestinians are reporting sharp price increases for dwindling items as fears grow again, in the middle of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

“Since the ceasefire began, the situation has improved a little. But before that, the situation was very bad,” said Fares al-Qeisi in the southern city of Khan Younis. “I swear to God, one could not satisfy their hunger.”

MAE SOT, Thailand (AP) — Thousands of sick, exhausted and terrified young men and women, from countries all over the world squat in rows, packed shoulder to shoulder, surgical masks covering their mouths and eyes. 

Their nightmare was supposed to be over.

Last month, a dramatic and highly publicized operation by Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities led to the release of more than 7,000 people from locked compounds in Myanmar where they were forced to trick Americans and others out of their life savings. But survivors have found themselves trapped once again, this time in overcrowded facilities with no medical care, limited food and no idea when they’ll be sent home.

One young man from India said about 800 people were being held in the same facility as him, sharing 10 dirty toilets. He said many of the people there were feverish and coughing. Like all former enslaved scammers who talked to The Associated Press, he spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety.

“If we die here with health issues, who is responsible for that?” he asked.

The armed groups who are holding the survivors, as well as Thai officials across the border, say they are awaiting action from the detainees’ home governments.

It’s one of the largest potential rescues of forced laborers in modern history, but advocates say the first major effort to crack down on the cyber scam industry has turned into a growing humanitarian crisis. 




The people released are just a small fraction of what could be 300,000 people working in similar scam operations across the region, according to an estimate from the United States Institute of Peace. Human rights groups and analysts add that the networks that run these illegal scams will continue to operate unless much broader action is taken against them. 

The trapped people, some of whom are highly educated and fluent in English, were initially lured to Thailand with promises of lucrative office jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.

“Your passport is confiscated, you cannot go outside and everything is like hell, a living hell,” a trapped Pakistani man told The Associated Press. 

Cyber scams run from compounds have flourished during the pandemic, targeting people around the world. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes estimates that between $18 billion and $37 billion was lost in Asia alone in 2023, with minimal government action against the criminal industry’s spread.

Beijing began pushing the region’s governments to crack down this year after a young Chinese actor was trafficked to Myanmar by people who promised him an acting job in Thailand. His girlfriend spearheaded a viral social media campaign that led to his release. 

Following that rescue, a senior Chinese government official visited Thailand and Myanmar demanding an end to the scams. In response, Thailand cut electricity, internet and gas supplies to five border towns in Myanmar.

Shortly after, the ethnic militia groups that rule this part of Myanmar — the Kayin Border Guard Force and the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Army — asked some of the trapped scammers if they wanted to leave, and then escorted them out of their compounds.

As the number of people released grew into the thousands, formerly enslaved scammers found themselves caught in indefinite detention just across a narrow, slow-moving river’s width from freedom.

Most are being held either in army camps controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force, or repurposed scam compounds, where many have been since early February. 

For weeks, men and women have shared unsanitary conditions, sleeping on the floor and eating what their captors provide. At one point, the Border Guard Force said that over 7,000 people were crammed into these facilities, as China began busing citizens across the border for flights.

Exclusive photos obtained by AP underscore the detainees’ desperation: Surgical masks, often two per face, cover their eyes, noses and mouths as they huddle under the watchful eyes of armed guards.

“It felt like a blessing that we came out of that trap, but the actual thing is that every person just wants to go back home,” said another Indian man, 24, speaking softly on a contraband phone from inside a makeshift detention center. He asked to not publish his name out of concern for his safety and because the militias guarding them had confiscated their phones.

Last week, fights broke out between Chinese citizens waiting to go home and the security forces guarding them, two detainees told the AP.

An unconfirmed list provided by authorities in Myanmar says they’re holding citizens from 29 countries including Philippines, Kenya and the Czech Republic.

Authorities in Thailand say they cannot allow foreigners to cross the border from Myanmar unless they can be sent home immediately, leaving many to wait for help from embassies that has been long in coming. 

China sent a chartered flight Thursday to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up a group of its citizens, but few other governments have matched that. There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting in a Thai military base, stuck for want of a $600 plane ticket. Dozens of Indonesians were bused out one morning last week, pushing suitcases and carrying plastic bags with their meager possessions as they headed to Bangkok for a flight home.

Thai officials held a meeting this week with representatives from foreign embassies, promising to move “as quickly as possible” to allow them to rescue their trapped citizens. But they warned that Thailand can only manage to receive 300 people per day, down from 500 previously, Monday through Fridays. It also announced it would let embassy staff cross over into Myanmar.

“The ministry attaches very high importance to this and is aware that there are sick people, and that they need to be repatriated,” Nikorndej Balankura, spokesman for Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.

The Indian Embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment. The Czech Foreign Ministry says it cannot confirm a Czech citizen is among those repatriated. It says it is in touch with the embassies in Bangkok and Yangon over the issue and that the embassies have not been asked for assistance.

Amy Miller, the Southeast Asia director of Acts of Mercy International who is based at the Thai-Myanmar border, says it’s hard for the world to understand why all of the released workers aren’t free.

“You can literally, with your naked eye, stand at the border and see people inside, on their balconies, in these compounds, and yet we cannot reach them,” she said. Pausing a moment, she gestured out a nearby window toward the Friendship Bridge to Myanmar just blocks away. “I think what people don’t understand is that to enter into another country is an act of war. You cannot just go in and receive these people out.”

Aiding the work on the front lines, especially for those countries with fewer resources, are a handful of small nonprofit groups with very limited funds.

In a nondescript Mae Sot home, Miller’s organization receives escapees and a trickle of survivors who have made it across the river with comfortable couches, clean water, food and working phones to reach their families. She said today’s unprecedented numbers are overwhelming the aid available across the river.

“When we’re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,” said Miller. “It really does require a kind of a global response.”

The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.

The United Nations’ International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration’s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.

“It’s really heartbreaking to see that there’s such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,” said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM.

In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high pressure impasse.

“The United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,” said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP. 

While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in “slavery-like” conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.

“What we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,” said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.

Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. “However, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.”

It’s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.

February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.

“The resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they’ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,” said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.

The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA’s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.

“There is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,” Hoffman said. “That said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved — and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.”

It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.

In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.

“This doesn’t affect anything,” said a 23-year-old Pakistani man who had hoped to be freed only to be trapped in an army camp. The bosses, he said, are “rich as hell” and can buy anything they need to keep the lucrative operations going. Meanwhile, he said, conditions are worsening.

“My friends are in really bad condition, we can’t survive here,” he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that’s been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: “Is anyone coming for us?”

LONDON (AP) — Russian special forces walked inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in the Kursk region, Ukraine’s military and Russian war bloggers reported, as Moscow claimed fresh gains in its push to recapture parts of the border province that Kyiv seized in a shock offensive.



Ukraine launched a daring cross-border incursion into Kursk in August, marking the largest attack on Russian territory since World War II. Within days, Ukrainian units had captured 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of territory, including the strategic border town of Sudzha, and taken hundreds of Russian prisoners of war.



According to Kyiv, the operation aimed to gain a bargaining chip in future peace talks and to force Russia to divert troops away from its grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine.



But months after Ukraine’s thunder run, its soldiers in Kursk are weary and bloodied by relentless assaults of more than 50,000 troops, including some from Russian ally North Korea. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are at risk of being encircled, open-source maps of the battlefield show.



According to Telegram posts late Saturday by a Ukrainian-born, pro-Kremlin blogger, Russian operatives walked about 15 kilometers (9 miles) inside the pipeline, which Moscow had until recently used to send gas to Europe. Some Russian troops spent several days in the pipe before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near Sudzha, blogger Yuri Podolyaka claimed.






The town had some 5,000 residents before the full-scale February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and it houses major gas transfer and measuring stations along the pipeline, which was once a major outlet for Russian natural gas exports through Ukrainian territory.



Another war blogger, who uses the alias Two Majors, said fierce fighting was underway for Sudzha, and that Russian forces managed to enter the town through a gas pipeline. Russian Telegram channels showed photos of what they said were special forces operatives, wearing gas masks and moving along what looked like the inside of a large pipe.



Ukraine’s General Staff confirmed Saturday evening that Russian “sabotage and assault groups” used the pipeline in a bid to gain a foothold outside Sudzha. In a Telegram post, it said Russian troops were “detected in a timely manner” and that Ukraine responded with rockets and artillery.



“At present, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. The enemy’s losses in Sudzha are very high,” the General Staff reported.



A third Russian war blogger argued that the attacking force lacked the logistical backup to succeed.



“Food, water, ammunition, communications, charging electrical devices, power banks, the approach of the main forces, evacuating the wounded … Two or three groups in the rear without all this — that’s a disaster,” the blogger, who describes himself as a soldier with the call sign Thirteenth, wrote on Telegram.



The Associated Press could not independently verify the accounts.



The Russian Defense Ministry reported Sunday that its troops had taken four villages north and northwest of Sudzha, with the closest lying some 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from the center of the town. The claim came a day after the ministry reported the capture of three more villages near Sudzha. 



Ukraine did not immediately comment on the Russian claims.







Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday that Ukraine “may not survive” as he continued to withhold American arms and intelligence in an effort to force Kyiv into peace negotiations with its invader.



In an interview with Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump was asked about a warning from Polish President Andrzej Duda “that without American support, Ukraine will not survive” and whether he was “comfortable” with that outcome.



He replied, “Well, it may not survive anyway.” He added, “But we have some weaknesses with Russia. You know, it takes two.”



In other developments, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu said Sunday that France will use profits from frozen Russian assets to finance an additional 195 million euros ($211 million) in arms for Ukraine, the latest in a series of military aid deliveries funded through the assets.



In an interview with the La Tribune Dimanche newspaper, Lecornu said Paris will send new 155 mm artillery shells and glide bombs for Mirage 2000 fighter jets it previously gave to Ukraine.







Elsewhere, Russian officials and Telegram channels reported that Ukrainian drones targeted oil infrastructure in southern and central Russia overnight into early Sunday. One drone struck an oil depot in Cheboksary, a Russian city on the Volga River about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the border, the local governor reported. According to Oleg Nikolaev, nobody was hurt, but the depot needed reconstruction work.



Footage circulated on Russian Telegram channels of what appeared to be a fire at or near one of Russia’s largest oil refineries, in the southern city of Ryazan. Shot, a news channel on Telegram, cited local residents as saying they heard several nighttime blasts near the refinery. The local governor, Pavel Malkov, said Ukrainian drones had been shot down nearby. He claimed there had been no casualties or damage.



Ukraine did not immediately comment on either incident.

Panama has released dozens of migrants deported from the United States who were held for weeks in a remote camp on the condition that they would leave the Central American nation in 30 days. It comes after weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism. It thrust many into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward.

PANAMA CITY (AP) — After weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism, Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after being deported from the United States, telling them they have 30 days to leave the Central American nation.



It thrust many like Hayatullah Omagh, a 29-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban took control, into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward.



“We are refugees. We do not have money. We cannot pay for a hotel in Panama City, we do not have relatives,” Omagh told the Associated Press in an interview. “I can’t go back to Afghanistan under any circumstances ... It is under the control of the Taliban, and they want to kill me. How can I go back?”



Authorities have said deportees will have the option of extending their stay by 60 days if they need it, but after that many like Omagh don’t know what they will do.

Omagh climbed off a bus in Panama City alongside 65 migrants from China, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal and other nations after spending weeks detained in poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration “to send a signal of deterrence” to people hoping to migrate. 



Human rights groups and lawyers advocating for the migrants were waiting at the bus terminal, and scrambled to find the released migrants shelter and other resources. Dozens of other people remained in the camp.






Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border, but not allowed to make an asylum claim.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)





“Once I get off the bus, I’ll be sleeping on the ground tonight,” Gaponov said.



Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S.



The deportees, largely from Asian countries, were part of a deal stuck between the Trump administration and Panama and Costa Rica as the U.S. government attempts to speed up deportations. The administration sent hundreds of people, many families with children, to the two Central American countries as a stopover while authorities organize a way to send them back to their countries of origin. 



Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process.



The agreement fueled human rights concerns when hundreds of deportees detained in a hotel in Panama City held up notes to their windows pleading for help and saying they were scared to return to their own countries. 



Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution.



Those that refused to return home were later sent to a remote camp near Panama’s border with Colombia, where they spent weeks in poor conditions, were stripped of their phones, unable to access legal council and were not told where they were going next.



Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into “black holes” for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism. 



Upon being released Saturday night, human rights lawyers identified at least three people who required medical attention. One has been vomiting for over a week, another deportee had diabetes and hadn’t had access to insulin in the camp and another person had HIV and also didn’t have access to medicine in detention.



Those who were released, like Omagh, said they could not return home.

As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban — which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country — would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas.



Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied. 



“My hope was freedom. Just freedom,” he said. “They didn’t give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me ‘No, no, no, no, no.’”



Still, he said that leaving the camp was a relief. Omagh and other migrants who spoke to the AP detailed scarce food, sweltering heat with little relief and aggressive Panamanian authorities. 



In one case, Omagh and others said, a Chinese man went on a week-long hunger strike. In another, a small riot broke out because guards refused to give a migrant their phone. The riot, they said, was suppressed by armed guards.



Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and cancelled a planned press visit last week.



While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn’t want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help.



Omagh said he was told in the camp he could be sent to a third country if it gives people from Afghanistan visas. He said that would be incredibly difficult because few nations open their doors to people with a Afghan passport.

He said he asked authorities in the camp multiple times if he could seek asylum in Panama, and said he was told that “we do not accept asylum.”



“None of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,” said Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama’s deputy foreign minister, in an interview with the AP last month.



That was the case for some, like one Chinese woman who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions from Panamanian authorities. 



Upon getting off the bus, the first thing she wanted to do was find a Coca-Cola. Then, she’d find a way back to the U.S.



“I still want to continue to go to the United States and fulfill my American dream,” she said.

KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Thousands of supporters greeted Nepal’s former king in capital Kathmandu on Sunday and demanded his abolished monarchy be reinstated and Hinduism brought back as a state religion. 

An estimated 10,000 supporters of Gyanendra Shah blocked the main entrance to Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport as he arrived from a tour of western Nepal. 

“Vacate the royal palace for the king. Come back king, save the country. Long live our beloved king. We want monarchy,” the crowds chanted. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport.

Hundreds of riot police blocked the protesters from entering the airport and there was no violence. 

Massive street protests in 2006 forced Gyanendra to give up his authoritarian rule, and two years later the parliament voted to abolish the monarchy as Gyanendra left the Royal Palace to live the life of a commoner.

But many Nepalis have grown frustrated with the republic, saying it has failed to bring about political stability and blaming it for a struggling economy and widespread corruption. Nepal has had 13 governments since the monarchy was abolished in 2008.

Rally participants said they were hoping for a change in the political system to stop the country from further deteriorating.

“We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,” said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, 72.




Among the thousands was 50-year-old carpenter Kulraj Shrestha, who had taken part in the 2006 protests against the king but has changed his mind and now supports the monarchy.

“The worst thing that is happening to the country is massive corruption and all politicians in power are not doing anything for the country,” Shrestha said. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken and the nation has further plunged so I have changed my mind.”

Gyanendra has not commented on the calls for the return of monarchy. Despite growing support for the former king, Gyanendra has slim chances of immediately returning to power. 

He became the king in 2002, after his brother and family were massacred in the palace. He ruled as the constitutional head of state without executive or political powers until 2005, when he seized absolute power. He disbanded the government and parliament, jailed politicians and journalists and cut off communications, declaring a state of emergency and using the army to rule the country.

HONG KONG (AP) — An unannounced trip by former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to Hong Kong set off speculations on Sunday that he may be trying to evade a possible arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court over his bloody crackdown on drugs while in power.

Duterte and his daughter — the incumbent Philippine vice president — were the main speakers in a campaign rally at the Southorn Stadium in the busy Wan Chai commercial district for the senatorial candidates of his political party ahead of the May 12 midterm elections in the Philippines. Thousands of cheering and flag-waving Filipino expatriates packed the stadium to watch Duterte speak. 

In his expletives-laden speech, Duterte touched on news reports about the ICC possibly issuing a warrant for his arrest and repeated that he was ready to be jailed.

The ICC has been investigating the large number of killings by police and gunmen under the former president’s crackdown against illegal drugs, which left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead.

Duterte has denied he authorized extrajudicial killings but he openly and repeatedly threatened to kill suspected drug dealers while in office 2016-2022.

“What was my sin?” Duterte asked in his speech in Hong Kong. “I did everything in my time so Filipinos can have a little peace and tranquility.”

“If this is my fate in life, it’s OK, I’ll accept it. I can’t do anything if I get arrested and jailed,” said the former populist president, now 79 and in poor health.




He told the crowd in jest to make small contributions for the construction of his monument, which he said should show him holding a gun.

Associated Press journalists were initially allowed to go into the stadium to cover Duterte, but they were later forced out by unidentified organizers of the event.

A senior Philippine official said the former president was scheduled to fly back to Manila on Tuesday but another senior Philippine official said Duterte has the option of extending his stay in Hong Kong. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the sensitive issue.

In the Philippine capital, Manila, Communications Secretary Jay Ruiz said President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration was ready to handle any situation arising from the issuance of an ICC arrest warrant.

“We’ve heard that an arrest warrant has been issued by the International Criminal Court against former President Rodrigo Duterte for crimes against humanity,” Ruiz said in a statement to reporters. “The government is prepared for any eventuality.

In the southern Philippine city of Davao, Duterte’s home region, additional police forces were deployed to beef up the security at the international airport and man new checkpoints. Philippine police told reporters the move was part of an exercise to ensure law enforcers would be able to handle any contingency. 

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has said that Philippine law enforcement agencies would be bound to fully cooperate if the ICC seeks the custody of his predecessor.

The Hague-based ICC was created in 2002 to serve as a court of last resort for the most serious international crimes: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression. The ICC becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute crimes on their territory. 

About 125 countries have signed the court’s foundational treaty, the Rome Statute, but China, which has control over Hong Kong, has not.

Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the ICC in 2019 in a move activists said was an attempt to evade accountability and prevent an international probe into the drug killings. However, the ICC still has jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed when the Philippines was a member.

CIUDAD DE PANAMÁ (AP) — Después de semanas de demandas y críticas relacionadas con los derechos humanos, Panamá liberó el sábado a decenas de migrantes que llevaban semanas detenidos en un campamento remoto tras ser deportados de Estados Unidos, y les dijo que tenían 30 días para abandonar la nación centroamericana. 

Esto sumió a muchos, como Hayatullah Omagh, un afgano de 29 años que huyó de Afganistán en 2022 tras la toma Talibán del país, en un limbo legal y sin un camino claro a seguir. 

“Somos refugiados. No tenemos dinero. No podemos pagar un hotel en Ciudad de Panamá, no tenemos familiares”, dijo Omagh a la Associated Press en una entrevista. “No puedo volver a Afganistán bajo ninguna circunstancia... Está bajo el control del Talibán, y quieren matarme. ¿Cómo puedo regresar?”.

Las autoridades han dicho que los deportados tendrán la opción de extender su estancia por 60 días si lo necesitan, pero después de eso muchos, como Omagh, no saben qué harán. 

Omagh bajó de un autobús en Ciudad de Panamá junto a 65 migrantes de China, Rusia, Pakistán, Afganistán, Irán, Nepal y otras naciones, después de pasar semanas detenidos en malas condiciones por el gobierno panameño, que ha dicho que quiere trabajar con el gobierno de Donald Trump “para enviar una señal de disuasión” a las personas que esperan migrar. 

Grupos de derechos humanos y abogados que abogan por los migrantes estaban esperando en la terminal de autobuses y se apresuraron a encontrar refugio y otros recursos para los migrantes liberados. Decenas de otras personas permanecieron en el campamento. 




Entre los que bajaban de los autobuses había migrantes que huían de la violencia y la represión en Pakistán e Irán. También estaba Nikita Gaponov, de 27 años, que huyó de Rusia debido a la represión por ser parte de la comunidad LGBTQ+ y dijo que fue detenido en la frontera de EEUU, pero no se le permitió presentar una solicitud de asilo. 

“Una vez que baje del autobús, dormiré en el suelo esta noche”, dijo Gaponov. 

Otros volvieron a mirar hacia el norte, diciendo que aunque ya habían sido deportados, no tenían otra opción que continuar después de cruzar el mundo para llegar a EEUU.

Los deportados, en su mayoría de países asiáticos, formaban parte de un acuerdo entre el gobierno de Trump, Panamá y Costa Rica mientras la Casa Blanca intenta acelerar las deportaciones. El gobierno estadounidense envió cientos de personas, muchas familias con niños, a los dos países centroamericanos a modo de escala mientras las autoridades organizan una forma de enviarlos de regreso a sus países de origen. 

Los críticos lo describieron como una forma de que EEUU externalice su proceso de deportación. 

El acuerdo alimentó preocupaciones sobre derechos humanos cuando cientos de deportados detenidos en un hotel en Ciudad de Panamá colocaron notas en sus ventanas pidiendo ayuda y diciendo que tenían miedo de regresar a sus propios países. 

Según la ley internacional de refugiados, las personas tienen derecho a solicitar asilo cuando huyen de conflictos o persecuciones. 

Aquellos que se negaron a regresar a casa fueron enviados más tarde a un campamento remoto cerca de la frontera de Panamá con Colombia donde pasaron semanas en malas condiciones, fueron despojados de sus celulares, no podían acceder a asesoría legal y no se les informó a dónde irían después. 

Abogados y defensores de derechos humanos advirtieron que Panamá y Costa Rica se estaban convirtiendo en “agujeros negros” para los deportados, y dijeron que su liberación era una forma para que las autoridades panameñas se lavaran las manos de los deportados en medio de crecientes críticas por violaciones de los derechos humanos. 

Tras la liberación del sábado por la noche, abogados de derechos humanos identificaron al menos a tres personas que requirieron atención médica. Una llevaba una semana vomitando, otra tenía diabetes y no había tenido acceso a insulina en el campamento, y una tercera persona estaba infectada de VIH y tampoco había tenido acceso a medicamentos durante su detención.

Aquellos que fueron liberados la noche del sábado, como Omagh, dijeron que no podían regresar a casa. 

Como ateo y miembro de un grupo étnico en Afganistán conocido como los hazara, dijo que regresar a casa bajo el gobierno Talibán —que volvió al poder tras la retirada de las fuerzas estadounidenses y de la OTAN durante el gobierno de Joe Biden— haría que lo mataran. Solo fue a EEUU después de intentar durante años vivir en Pakistán, Irán y otros países, pero se le negaron las visas. 

Omagh fue deportado después de presentarse a las autoridades estadounidenses y pedir asilo en EEUU, lo cual se le negó. 

“Mi esperanza era la libertad. Solo libertad”, dijo. “No me dieron la oportunidad. Pedí muchas veces hablar con un funcionario de asilo y me dijeron ‘No, no, no, no, no’”. 

Aun así, dijo que salir del campamento fue un alivio. Omagh y otros migrantes que hablaron con la AP detallaron la escasez de alimentos, el calor sofocante con poco alivio y la agresividad de las autoridades panameñas. 

En un caso, Omagh y otros dijeron que un hombre chino realizó una huelga de hambre durante una semana. En otro, estalló un pequeño disturbio porque los guardias se negaron a darle su celular a un migrante. La protesta, dijeron, fue reprimida por guardias armados. 

Las autoridades panameñas negaron las acusaciones sobre las condiciones del campamento, pero bloquearon el acceso de los periodistas al lugar y cancelaron una visita de prensa planificada la semana pasada. 

Aunque las organizaciones internacionales de ayuda dijeron que organizarían viajes a un tercer país para las personas que no querían regresar a casa, las autoridades panameñas dijeron que las personas liberadas ya habían rechazado ayuda. 

Omagh dijo que en el campamento le dijeron que podría ser enviado a un tercer país si este otorga visas a personas de Afganistán. Dijo que eso sería increíblemente difícil porque pocas naciones abren sus puertas a personas con pasaporte afgano. 

Dijo que preguntó varias veces a las autoridades en el campamento si podía solicitar asilo en Panamá, y dijo que le dijeron que “no aceptamos asilo”. 

“Ninguno de ellos quiere quedarse en Panamá. Quieren ir a Estados Unidos”, dijo Carlos Ruiz-Hernández, viceministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Panamá, en una entrevista con la AP el mes pasado. 

Ese era el caso de algunos, como una mujer china que habló con la AP bajo condición de anonimato, temiendo represalias de las autoridades panameñas. 

Al bajar del autobús, lo primero que quería hacer era encontrar una Coca-Cola. Luego, encontraría una forma de regresar a EEUU.

“Todavía sigo queriendo ir a Estados Unidos y cumplir mi sueño americano”, dijo.

Mahmoud Khalil’s arrest comes as Trump vows to deport foreign students involved in protests against Israel’s war

A prominent Palestinian activist who helped lead Columbia University’s student encampment movement was arrested on Saturday night by federal immigration authorities who claimed they were acting on a state department order to revoke his green card, according to his attorney.

Mahmoud Khalil was at his university-owned apartment, blocks from the private Ivy League university’s main campus in New York when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents entered the building and took him into custody, his attorney, Amy Greer, told the Associated Press.

One of the agents told Greer by phone that they were executing a state department order to revoke Khalil’s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil, who graduated last December, was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.

The arrest comes as Donald Trump vows to deport foreign students and imprison “agitators” involved in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza.

The administration has placed particular scrutiny on Columbia, announcing Friday that it would be cutting $400m in grants and contracts because of what the government describes as the elite school’s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus.

The authorities declined to tell Khalil’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, why he was being detained, Greer said. Khalil has since been transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

“We have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,” Greer told the AP. “This is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.”

A spokesperson for Columbia said law enforcement agents must produce a warrant before entering university property. The spokesperson declined to say if the school had received a warrant for Khalil’s arrest.

Messages seeking comment were left with the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security and Ice.

Khalil had become one of the most visible faces of the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia. As students erected tents on campus last spring, Khalil was picked to serve as a negotiator on behalf of students and met frequently with university administrators.

When classes resumed in September, he told the Associated Press that the protests would continue: “As long as Columbia continues to invest and to benefit from Israeli apartheid, the students will continue to resist.”

An immigration court can revoke a green card but government departments do not have that power.

Last week it was reported by Axios that Secretary of State Marco Rubio intends to revoke visas from foreign nationals who are deemed to support Hamas or other terrorist groups, using artificial intelligence (AI) to pick out individuals.

Khalil was among several investigated by a newly-created university disciplinary committee – the Office of Institutional Equity – looking into students at the institution who have expressed criticism of Israel, according to records shared with the AP.

In recent weeks, the committee has sent notices to dozens of students for activities ranging from sharing social media posts in support of Palestinian people to joining “unauthorized” protests.

“I have around 13 allegations against me, most of them are social media posts that I had nothing to do with,” Khalil said last week.

After refusing to sign a non-disclosure agreement, Khalil said the university threatened to block him from graduating. But when he appealed the decision through a lawyer, they eventually backed down, Khalil said.

“They just want to show Congress and rightwing politicians that they’re doing something, regardless of the stakes for students,” Khalil said. “It’s mainly an office to chill pro-Palestine speech.”

Columbia students kick-started the tent encampment protests at their Manhattan campus last spring, with the idea catching on at dozens of campuses across the US. At Columbia and many other colleges, their academic administrations called in the relevant local police department and hundreds of students were arrested.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Three of the fires are contained, while one is still burning in Westhampton, officials say

Firefighters in New York were continuing to battle at least one brush fire in a wooded stretch of Long Island on Sunday with the wealthy coastal enclave of the Hamptons vulnerable and officials warning that high wind gusts threatened to ignite further blazes.

The state’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, declared a state of emergency on Saturday after four separate fires broke out. The flames were spreading across large swaths of the narrow strip of barrier land that stretches for more than 100 miles east from New York City out towards the Atlantic Ocean.

A huge fire in Long Island’s Pine Barrens region prompted road closures and evacuations of a military base.

As of Sunday morning, three of the fires had been contained, while one was still burning in the hamlet of Westhampton, according to Michael Martino, a spokesperson for Suffolk county executive Ed Romaine.

Local fire crews, as well as the air national guard, worked through the night, containing roughly 80% of the blaze, according to Martino.

He said the Suffolk county police department’s arson squad had initiated an investigation into the blaze, though there was no immediate evidence to suggest arson.

At least two commercial structures had been damaged. One firefighter was flown to a hospital to be treated for burns to the face on Saturday.

Massive clouds of smoke billowed and flames towered over the Sunrise highway that leads to the Hamptons, the string of historic seaside communities flanked by magnificent sandy beaches with rolling waves and dotted with summer mansions of the rich and famous.

According to the National Weather Service, wind gusts of up to 30mph were expected on Sunday, making it more difficult to extinguish parts that were still burning.

“Our biggest problem is the wind,” Romaine said at an earlier news conference. “It is driving this fire.”

Roughly 15 miles west, officials were monitoring a small brush fire along Sunrise highway early on Sunday, Brookhaven town supervisor Daniel Panico said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

While it might save some politicians from public humiliation, it could also deprive Americans of opportunities to interact with their elected officials

After Roger Marshall, a senator from Kansas, was hounded out of his own town hall event last week, Republican party leaders had had enough. Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, and Richard Hudson, the chair of the GOP’s fundraising body, decided the embarrassment had to end, and they told Republicans to stop holding the public events.

But while that might save some Republican politicians from public humiliation, it could also deprive Americans of opportunities to interact with their elected officials, experts said, and prevent people from letting their representatives they are not happy with the increasingly divisive direction of the Trump administration.

“It’s certainly a unique view of representation that representatives should hear only from constituents who agree with them,” said Marjorie Hershey, professor emeritus of political science at Indiana University Bloomington.

“But it’s entirely in keeping with the recent direction of the Republican party: to become more and more extreme because they listen only to their far-right base.”

Johnson and Hudson’s edict came after several Republican town halls were interrupted in recent weeks. Scott Fitzgerald, a four-year congressman, faced an angry crowd at an event in West Bend, Wisconsin, in late February. Fitzgerald was repeatedly booed as he defended the role of Elon Musk, in particular.

Apparently misjudging his audience, Fitzgerald said Musk is “getting rid of the DEI”, to loud jeers, before receiving a similar reaction when he praised “the fraud and abuse that has been discovered” by the department of government efficiency.

A video from TMJ4 showed attendees carrying signs including “Presidents are not kings” and “No cuts to Medicaid”. Glenn Grothman, also from Wisconsin, received similar treatment at a town hall a couple of days later, being loudly booed as he claimed that “across the board [Trump] has done some very good things”, including birthright citizenship and – using the same phrasing as Fitzgerald – “getting rid of the DEI”.

Marshall fared even worse. He left a public meeting after 40 minutes, the 64-year-old senator telling a hostile audience: “If you’re rude, which you’re being, I’m going to leave,” as he defended Trump’s extraordinary row with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy a day earlier.

That was apparently the straw that broke the camel’s back, as Johnson and Hudson rushed to their party members’ aid. While some Republicans, including Fitzgerald, have suggested they may buck party leadership, plenty will likely be relieved to use the screen provided by their leadership. But there are concerns about how this will affect Americans’ democratic rights, especially as the cancelling of town halls comes after Trump began to deny highly regarded news organizations access to the White House.

“President Trump’s insistence on choosing which reporters get to travel with him and attend press conferences is in keeping with [this] effort,” Hershey said.

“I think the people who wrote the constitution would argue that this is exactly the kind of behavior the American revolution was fought to stop.”

She added: “Town halls are not the only way that constituents can express their views to representatives. But they are a meaningful way: not every citizen can access Zoom, and expressing our views in person is an important way of conveying a depth of feeling that isn’t as easily expressed in a letter, an email, or a visit to a representative’s staff member.”

In issuing his town hall order, in a closed-door meeting, Hudson compared the atmosphere to town halls during Trump’s first term in 2017. Then Republican town halls repeatedly turned contentious as the Trump-led party sought to strip down the Affordable Care Act. There is a neat earlier precedent in the anger that erupted at Democrats’ town halls in 2012, as the Tea Party movement, seen as precursor to Trump’s Make America great again movement, disrupted Democrats’ public events in protest against the Affordable Care Act, which, according to the department of the treasury, has helped nearly 50m Americans access health care.

Daniel B Markovits, a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Columbia, has published research on congressional town halls with fellow academic Andrew J Clarke. Markovits said that while there is no legal obligation for members of congress to hold town halls, people could lose out if Republicans follow through with their threat to limit in-district appearances.

“A huge amount of what members of Congress do is non-partisan case work. It could be like: ‘There’s a problem with my social security check’, or: ‘I have trouble with whatever government agency,’” Markovits said.

“A lot of this is done through staff, but sometimes it happens at town hall. So in common times, a lot of town hall questions are: ‘Here’s this problem, I want your help. I want you to interfere on my behalf.’ Or: ‘There’s a road broken in town.’ So there’s a lot of very clearly non-partisan business that happens at these things.”

A poll in 2013 found that Congress was less popular than hemorrhoids, cockroaches and toenail fungus, and there is little to suggest the law-making body has gone up in people’s estimations since then. That could become worse if politicians are seen as becoming more out of touch with their constituents – something a lack of public interaction could exacerbate.

“There’s a lot of research saying that voters live in a bubble, which I think is true. But I think we shouldn’t understate the extent to which politicians can live in a bubble too,” Markowits said.

“And there’s some good work showing that politicians don’t have the best understanding of their constituents’ beliefs. So I think one of the things you might see if these [town halls] stop happening, you might expect members of Congress to overstate, maybe even more than they already do, the extent to which their voters are agreeing with them.”

Trump and Johnson have claimed, without evidence, that “paid troublemakers” are responsible for their members’ poor reception at town halls, something Democrats, including Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, have denied.

“We don’t need paid protestors,” Jeffries said in a post on BlueSky. “The American people are with us.”

Some local Democratic parties have encouraged members to attend town halls and air concerns, while Indivisible, a progressive activist organization formed during Trump’s first term, has listed events and sought to highlight some of the more contentious aspects of both the Trump presidency and the Democratic response.

The organization, and others, are now planning to hold “empty chair town halls” in Republican districts – where they invite members of Congress to attend public forums, and hold a discussion anyway if they do not.

“People who choose to go into public service, and have as your job that you are paid to represent other people, part of that job is talking to those people that you represent. And if you don’t like to do that, that’s okay. You can go become a lobbyist, you can go and do something else. Nobody is forcing you to represent other human beings in the United States Congress,” said Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible.

“But if you want to have that job, you’ve got two choices. You can show up and defend your positions, or you can hide and we’ll make sure people know you’re a coward.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

The president, who derided Barack Obama for golfing while in office, even makes money off his Mar-a-Lago weekends

It has become a familiar routine for the Palm Beach county sheriff, Ric Bradshaw, and his deputies. Almost every Tuesday in recent weeks, the Federal Aviation Administration has posted to its website a formal “notice to airmen” advising of upcoming flight restrictions over south Florida, signaling once again to those who must protect him that Donald Trump is on his way to Mar-a-Lago for another weekend of golf.

The president is at his waterfront mansion again this weekend, his sixth visit to Florida and the beloved golf courses he owns since his 20 January inauguration.

His increasingly frequent and disruptive trips home are fast becoming a drain on county resources, obligating Bradshaw to put helicopters in the air, extra manpower on the ground, and boats on both sides of Trump’s opulent mansion sandwiched between the Atlantic and the Intracoastal Waterway almost continuously.

The demands from the Secret Service to help them protect Trump, and the president’s family and entourage, are “substantial”, the sheriff told county commissioners last month, just before the president flew in for an extended six-day visit.

“They request it, and then we provide it. It’s expensive, but we don’t really have a choice,” Bradshaw said.

The sheriff’s office declined to immediately provide the Guardian with a detailed breakdown of its expenditure, but the daily overtime bill alone has previously been reported to be $240,000.

Commissioners approved Bradshaw’s “urgent request” of $45m to provide security for Trump’s visits through November, an invoice he said was certain to rise.

“We’ve already heard some information where he may be spending more time here than in Washington,” Bradshaw said.

“Definitely you’re going to see him bringing in leaders from the world. That is a significant shift in the cost for security.”

The Palm Beach bill, high as it is, pales against the federal costs of indulging the commander-in-chief’s wanderlust. That’s included his multimillion-dollar trip to the Super Bowl in New Orleans last month, and an appearance at Nascar’s Daytona 500 weeks later, which critics saw as little more than an extravagant and expensive photo op.

Whenever he wishes to roam, the presidential airliner Air Force One is fueled up and fully staffed, racking up an hourly operational cost approaching $200,000, according to a 2022 air force assessment.

With a roughly two-hour flight time from Washington DC, each visit to and from Palm Beach international airport costs taxpayers about a million dollars just in travel, once an additional cargo flight carrying the presidential motorcade is factored in, as well as ferrying Trump from the White House to Joint Base Andrews on the Marine One helicopter.

The most recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, meanwhile, calculated in 2019 that federal agencies spent an average of $13.6m on each of four Trump odysseys to Mar-a-Lago that it audited during his first term in office, with a chunk of that money going straight into Trump’s pocket.

In 2017, he spent four of the first seven weekends immediately after his inauguration golfing in Florida; this year the tally is already at six.

Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which tallied more than 500 first-term visits by Trump to properties he owned, said the pattern was already repeating itself.

“We start with the clear principle that presidents are entitled to Secret Service protection wherever they go, and have their transportation covered. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that when he does any of the things he does,” he said.

“However, there are serious issues. One is that he maintained ownership of his businesses, so this is not a question of going to the president’s house; it’s going to the president’s business where payment is made directly to a business that benefits the president.”

“We want the presidency to be the main focus of the president. That’s not to say presidents don’t have time to recharge and take a break like everybody else, but when you go to your own business property it moves the focus, at least potentially, from your official duties to promoting and attending to your business.

“And that is a different kind of problem than taking more weekends off than we’d like, or how often a president plays golf, or anything like that.”

Robert Weissman, co-president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said he had similar concerns, pointing to evidence of Trump excessively overcharging the Secret Service to stay at his properties during his first administration.

“As much as the waste of taxpayer resources for excessive vacationing is, there’s the self-enrichment from the payments made to Mar-a-Lago by agents who were there to provide security,” he said.

“Of course, Trump famously ran the first time complaining about the amount of golf that Barack Obama played, which was more or less local and didn’t require plane travel. Our strong preference is that Trump flies to Florida, and stays there for full-time retirement.”

Ultimately, Palm Beach county expects to be reimbursed with federal funds for what it spends protecting the president. But that is little consolation to residents who are now footing the bill while enduring numerous road closures and other inconveniences every weekend.

Trump’s constant visits to Mar-a-Lago, which he calls his “winter White House”, were examined by journalist Victoria De Cardenas last month during a news segment titled Wa$te Watch on Palm Beach television station CBS12.

“We do think it’s worth considering whether, for the benefit of taxpayers and commuters who have been caught up in the freeway shutdowns during Friday night rush hour more than once lately, maybe he could spend the weekend in the real White House a little more often,” she said.

Since becoming president, Trump has upended the US approach to Ukraine and treated Moscow more as an ally

In just seven weeks since returning to the White House for a second term, Donald Trump has upended the US approach to the invasion of Ukraine and treated Russia increasingly not as an adversary, but an ally.

After tossing aside decades of alignment with Europe against Russian aggression, the US president suspended military assistance and intelligence to Kyiv and said on Friday he finds it “easier” to work with Russia than Ukraine.

Here’s a timeline of the Trump administration’s moves towards an apparent new alliance.

Moscow political circles were jubilant after Trump held a direct call with Putin, during which the two leaders agreed bilaterally to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.

The 90-minute call marked Putin’s most significant diplomatic breakthrough in years, and dealt a blow to the west’s three-year effort to isolate the Russian president.

Trump spoke to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy only after the Putin call – in effect imposing the terms of the conversation on the Ukrainian president.

Russian officials have said that preparations are under way for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin. Putin has also invited Trump to visit Moscow, which if accepted would be the first visit by an American president to Russia since 2009.

On the same day as the Putin-Trump call, US defence secretary Pete Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine.

Hegseth, speaking at a summit in Brussels, said it was “unrealistic” for Ukraine to expect to return to its pre-2014 borders, and insisted that any peace agreement would have to be secured by “capable European and non-European troops”, whom he stressed would not come from the US.

European leaders were stunned when US vice-president JD Vance launched a blistering ideological attack on Washington’s allies and questioned whether the US and Europe any longer had a shared agenda.

Vance had been expected to address the critical question of the Ukraine war in his speech at this year’s Munich security conference, but instead he barely mentioned the conflict and instead argued that the true threat to Europe came not from Russia or China, but from what he called a retreat from its “most fundamental values” of protecting free speech.

Top US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia to hold their most extensive high-level talks since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, during which they agreed to work towards ending the war and improving US-Russian diplomatic and economic ties.

The talks in Riyadh, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, marked a tectonic shift in Washington’s approach to Moscow and a dramatic break with Joe Biden’s efforts to isolate Russia.

No Ukrainian or European officials were present at the meeting.

Trump appeared to blame Kyiv for Moscow’s invasion and said he was “disappointed” that Zelenskyy complained about being left out of US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia.

Trump also pressured Zelenskyy to hold elections – echoing one of Moscow’s key demands. Under Ukraine’s constitution, elections are suspended while martial law is in force.

Later that day, Trump escalated his attacks on Zelenskyy by calling him a “dictator” warning that he “better move fast” or he “won’t have a country left”.

In a dramatic shift in transatlantic relations, the US split with its European allies and sided with Russia in votes at the United Nations to mark the third anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The US joined Russia, Belarus and North Korea in voting against a European-drafted UN general assembly resolution condemning Russia’s actions and supporting Ukraine’s territorial integrity. It was the first time since the Russian invasion that the US voted against a resolution backed by Ukraine.

The US then drafted and voted for a resolution in the UN security council which called for a “swift end to the conflict”, but contained no criticism of Russia. The Kremlin praised Washington for its “much more balanced” stance and backed the resolution.

In an Oval Office meeting that will surely remembered as one of the greatest diplomatic disasters in modern history, Trump and Vance teamed up to openly berate and humiliate Zelenskyy in front of the world’s cameras.

Zelenskyy had travelled to Washington to discuss a minerals deal with the US that was meant to pave the way towards a ceasefire with Russia. Instead, the meeting devolved into acrimony and chaos and a joint press conference to announce the deal was cancelled.

Russian officials reacted with glee to the extraordinary scenes.

The Guardian reported that the Trump administration has publicly and privately signaled that it does not believe Russia represents a cyber threat against US national security or critical infrastructure, marking a radical departure from longstanding intelligence assessments.

Analysts at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have been instructed not to follow or report on Russian threats, even though this had previously been a main focus for the agency.

Shortly after the Oval Office blow-up, the Trump administration suspended delivery of all US military aid and stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine, part of a pressure campaign to force Kyiv to cooperate with the White House’s plans to negotiate a peace deal with Russia.

US national security adviser Mike Waltz confirmed the US had “taken a step back” and was reviewing “all aspects” of its relationship with Ukraine. He suggested that military assistance could resume if Kyiv agrees to participate in US-led negotiations.

The Trump administration was also reported to be drawing up a plan to restore ties with Russia and lift sanctions on the Kremlin, as part of the administration’s broad talks with Moscow on improving diplomatic and economic relations.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after a massive missile and drone strike on Ukraine, Trump said he finds it “easier” to work with Russia than Ukraine and that Putin “wants to end the war”.

“I believe him,” Trump said when asked if he believed Putin still wanted peace. “I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine. They don’t have the cards.” He added that he has “always had a good relationship” with Putin.

Asked if the Russian leader was taking advantage of the pause in US intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine, Trump replied: “I think he’s doing what anyone else would do.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Jean-Michel Aphatie stands by comments he made on broadcaster RTL

A prominent French journalist has said he is stepping down from his role as an expert analyst for broadcaster RTL after provoking an uproar by comparing French actions during colonial rule in Algeria to a second world war massacre committed by Nazi forces in France.

Jean-Michel Aphatie, a veteran reporter and broadcaster, insisted that while he would not be returning to RTL, he wholly stood by his comments made on the radio station in February equating atrocities committed by France in Algeria with those of Nazi Germany in occupied France.

“I will not return to RTL. It is my decision,” the journalist wrote on X, after the radio station suspended him from air for a week.

On 25 February he said on air: “Every year in France, we commemorate what happened in Oradour-sur-Glane – the massacre of an entire village. But we have committed hundreds of these, in Algeria. Are we aware of this?”

He was referring to the village where an SS unit returning to the front in Normandy massacred 642 residents on 10 June 1944. Leaving a chilling memorial for future generations, the village was never rebuilt.

Challenged by the anchor over whether “we [the French] behaved like the Nazis”, Aphatie said: “The Nazis behaved like us.”

On X, he acknowledged his comments had created a “debate” but said it was of great importance to understand the full story over France’s 1830-1962 presence in Algeria, saying he was “horrified” by what he had read in history books.

After being suspended for a week by the channel it means that “if I come back to RTL I validate this and admit to making a mistake”.

“This is a line that cannot be crossed.”

His comments had prompted a flurry of complaints to audio-visual regulator Arcom, which has opened an investigation.

France’s conduct in Algeria during the 1954-62 war that led to independence and previous decades remain the subject of often painful debate in both countries.

Historians from both sides have over the last years documented numerous violations including arbitrary killings and detention carried out by French forces and the history still burdens French-Algerian relations to this day.

The far right in France has long defended French policies in those years with Algeria War veteran Jean-Marie Le Pen, who co-founded the National Front (FN) party and died earlier this year, drawing much support from French settlers who had to return after independence.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Leak reportedly confirms next Bond will be a man, as actor says it was ‘right decision’ to pass franchise to Amazon

The next James Bond should be British, Pierce Brosnan has said, as a leaked memo reportedly confirmed the character will remain a man.

The Irish actor, who played the spy from 1995 to 2002, also said it was the “right decision” for creative control of the franchise to be handed to Amazon-MGM, in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph.

“It takes great courage for them to let go,” said Brosnan.

“I hope that [Amazon] handles the work and the character with dignity and imagination and respect.”

The film series was sold to the streaming giant for £770m, with a deal being struck in February for Bond’s custodians Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson to take a step back, after reported tensions over the spy saga’s future.

The pair, who oversaw the franchise for decades as the children of its original producer, Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, will continue as co-owners but will have no creative control, following fierce rows over 007’s future.

These included Barbara Broccoli branding Amazon executives “fucking idiots”, according to the Wall Street Journal, over ideas to expand the franchise with spin-offs and a TV series.

After the deal was agreed, Wilson said he and Broccoli had been “very reluctant to delegate” the intellectual property to a television series, with Broccoli adding: “It’s not something we’ve ever wanted to do.”

It may be a sign that there is set to be movement on a new Bond film, four years on from Daniel Craig’s final appearance.

While there is no script, director or lead actor in place, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James and James Norton are all favourites for the role.

Mail Online reported a source from Amazon had said the actor “has to be British or from the Commonwealth – and he has to be male”.

The news of the takeover received mixed reactions from fans online, with some fearing that the US brand would choose a non-white actor to play the secret agent or write him as gay in a future film.

Despite Bond being arguably the campest spy franchise – an attribute triumphantly parodied in the Austin Powers movies – Brosnan previously said Broccoli would not allow a gay 007 in the franchise during her lifetime, though he welcomed the idea.

Others, meanwhile, were optimistic about the potential for progress, hoping Amazon would sanitise the famously misogynist character once referred to as a “boring, tasteless rapist” by Esquire magazine, in an effort to appeal to younger audiences who might be more likely to label the character “cringe” rather than “cool”.

There have only been five Bond films in the last 23 years, and the series has faced competition from more modern, fast-paced action characters such as John Wick and Jason Bourne.

Brosnan said: “History has been passed on and I’m very proud to have been part of the history and the legacy of Bond and the movies that I made with Barbara and Michael.

“That we moved the needle, that we brought it back to life. It had been dormant [for] six years and GoldenEye was such a success that it continued and went from strength to strength … You know, everything changes, everything falls apart, and I wish them well.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Commission president says ‘something fundamental’ has shifted and democracy and rule of law are under threat

“Nothing is off the table” when it comes to raising money for defence, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said, as she warned European values such as democracy and the rule of law were under threat in a increasingly “transactional” world.

Without mentioning Donald Trump by name, the head of the EU executive told reporters there was a new sense of urgency in the geopolitical sphere and that “something fundamental” had shifted since she began her second term in office on 1 December, nearly 100 days ago.

“Our European values, democracy, freedom, the rule of law are under threat,” von der Leyen told reporters at a press conference on Sunday. “We see that sovereignty, but also ironclad commitments are called into question. Everything has become transactional.”

After being asked about the matter repeatedly, von der Leyen said the US was still an ally, although “we have our discussion points without any question”. She said: “From the viewpoint of the European Union, I think it’s a very strong wake-up call.”

EU leaders last week pledged to dramatically increase military spending after von der Leyen presented a €800bn (£670bn) plan to allow member states to take out loans and increase national debts without incurring penalties under the the bloc’s strict fiscal rules.

Many member states would like to go further, however, with common borrowing to fund direct grants, rather than loans, to boost defence spending.

Asked on Sunday about such proposals, von der Leyen said: “Nothing is off the table. I am open to whatever is necessary.” Such a move would require backing from Germany, which has been opposed to joint defence borrowing under the outgoing coalition government led by Olaf Scholz.

The incoming centre-right chancellor, Friedrich Merz, however, has raised hopes of a change of heart in Berlin, after he made a speedy agreement with his Social Democrat coalition partners to change Germany’s constitution to embark on a spending plan for defence and infrastructure.

While von der Leyen described the US repeatedly as an ally, EU officials are concerned about Trump, who has suspended US military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, derided Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and appeared tolerant of Vladimir Putin’s deadly bombardment of Ukrainian homes and civilian infrastructure.

While von der Leyen spoke of support for Kyiv so Ukraine “can keep on fighting” she did not refer directly to a proposal for short-term military aid from the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas. The former Estonian prime minister has called on member states to accelerate efforts to aid Ukraine in 2025, including by delivering “as soon as possible” 1.5m rounds of ammunition, air defence systems and drones among other support.

After the latest devastating attacks on Ukraine this weekend that killed at least 14 and injured many more, Kallas stepped up her calls for the EU to increase military support “otherwise, even more Ukrainian civilians will pay the highest price”.

Asked about the Kallas proposal and military aid for Ukraine in 2025, von der Leyen said “we will have to step up without any question” and referred to how Kyiv could benefit from the €800bn plan – loans and fiscal flexibilities that have yet to be finalised.

The EU has supplied €52bn military aid to Ukraine, on a par with the US, according to the commission.

Von der Leyen said her €800bn plan could be “the foundation of a European defence union” and raised the possibility of “team[ing] up with other like-minded countries such as the UK or Norway or Canada”. One open question is whether these non-EU European countries could be involved in billion-euro defence contracts. Macron is leading a “buy European” policy, but Germany and Poland have signalled greater openness to procuring costly defence equipment from countries outside the bloc.

Without giving a definitive answer, von der Leyen appeared to lean to a more open approach. Companies already had strong cross-border ties, she said. “We do not have to reinvent the wheel, we have to think about a smart mechanism, how we can use this cooperation that is already established at a high level of quality.”

She stressed that the EU remained wedded to phasing out Russian gas, despite two delays to a plan on achieving this goal. “I commit very clearly to phasing out the Russian gas,” she said. “This is an absolute must.”

Europe bought a record 18.8m tonnes of Russian liquefied natural gas in 2024, despite a steep decline in imported pipeline gas, coal and oil.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A giant of political drama, Fugard captured the injustices of apartheid in works such as Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island

The South African playwright and director Athol Fugard, whose works included the play Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and the novel Tsotsi, has died at the age of 92. The actor John Kani paid tribute on X on Sunday, saying “I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend”. The mayor’s office in Cape Town said: “Athol Fugard was not just a luminary in the world of theatre; he was a teller of profound stories of hope and resilience about South Africa.”

A major political dissident playwright of the 20th century, Fugard wrote more than 30 dramas including Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act (in 1972) and “Master Harold” … and the Boys (1982). Both of those drew upon the time in the 1950s when he could only find employment as a clerk in one of the courts where black South Africans were charged (and inevitably convicted) of breaches of the “pass laws”, designed to control the movements of a racially segregated population under the apartheid system. There, he witnessed hourly the dehumanisation of those who had chosen the “wrong” streets or people.

Fugard’s cultural and political impact was rivalled elsewhere only by the dramas of Václav Havel in what was then Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia. Havel was jailed and, when released, abandoned theatre to become the first president of the Czech Republic. Fugard – despite setting up two theatre companies in the segregated black townships and courageously refusing to play to the state-mandated “whites only” audiences – avoided prison, due to being white and therefore not a primary target of the racist government. The worst direct personal persecutions Fugard suffered were the removal of his passport and the occasional banning of plays and burning of books. He was always conscious, though, of benefiting from the immoral hierarchy his writing decried.

The writer’s race would also have made him an impossible political leader in the new Republic of South Africa: its dissident turned president in the Havel manner was Nelson Mandela, who had a strong background presence in Fugard’s plays, especially The Island (1972), set on Robben Island, the penitentiary for political prisoners where Mandela had spent some of his 27 years of incarceration.

Born in 1932, Fugard was the only child of Harold, from an immigrant family of Irish descent, and Elizabeth, whose Potgieter clan were among the early Afrikaans settlers of Dutch stock. A jazz pianist turned shopkeeper, Harold moved his family in 1935 to Port Elizabeth, an urban industrial town that remained Fugard’s main home and most regular dramatic setting for the next nine decades.

During his childhood, the family ran a hotel and cafe in Port Elizabeth where “Hally” (as the young Athol was known) grew up. There, as a teenager in the late 1940s, an incident occurred that would lie at the heart of his psychology and creativity. In published extracts from his notebooks, Fugard explained how Sam Semela, a black employee in the family businesses, became “the most significant – the only – friend of my boyhood years”. But, after a “rare quarrel”, Hally pulled racial rank and spat in Semela’s face.

While confiding to his journal that he would never be able to “deal with the shame that overwhelmed me the second after”, Fugard made literary recompense with “Master Harold” … and the Boys, its title acknowledging a racist hierarchy between white people and their servants that is overturned by a devastatingly apologetic depiction of how the demon of superiority can rise even in the mind of someone who defines as a liberal: the spitting scene is its climax. One of the dedicatees of the published play is “Sam”, with whom Fugard had been reconciled.

Public admission of this shaming story was typical of Fugard’s personal honesty, but can also be seen as an attempt to forestall any “saint” or “saviour” interpretation of his work. The contemporary pejorative term “white saviour”, with its implication of credit stolen and virtue claimed, was not yet widely used, but, once it was, Fugard faced retrospective accusation.

A complication arose with the working methods of the African Theatre Workshop and Serpent Players, two multi-racial companies Fugard and his wife, Shiela (also a writer) formed either side of 1960, first in Johannesburg and then Port Elizabeth. Early Fugard plays such as No-Good Friday (1958), Nongogo (1959) and The Coat (1966) improvised scenes with actors based on their own experiences and then created a fixed text for performance.

As a major Fugard scholar, Professor Dennis Walder, has pointed out, it was yet another horror of the system that the writer could only work with colleagues of colour at his home by registering them, for bureaucratic purposes, as his domestic staff.

Fugard’s desire to collaborate with the wronged community, rather than writing anti-apartheid stories from an isolated study in a white area (a criticism of some contemporaries), can reasonably be seen as another compensating response to the Sam shame. But a majority black co-operative run by a white man subsequently raised issues of “appropriation” to which Fugard was alert: editions of The Island and its companion play, Sizwe Banzi Is Dead (1972), in which someone takes on the identity of a dead man in order to use his “pass book” (ID papers), have the credit “devised by Athol Fugard, John Kani and Winston Ntshona”, with royalties split three ways.

The circumstances in which Fugard’s early plays were made now sound like something from dystopian fiction. The South African police would raid rehearsals, check scripts and take the names of actors; it became standard for performers to be listed in programmes and on posters under the identities of fictional characters they had previously played.

The end of apartheid and Mandela’s presidency removed, from 1994, what the novelist Nadine Gordimer had called “the only subject” for white liberal writers in South Africa. Fugard, though, wrote plays that effectively reflected the country’s “truth and reconciliation” phase of attempted restorative justice.

In The Train Driver (2010), his strongest late work, the white title character seeks out the family of a black mother and child who died when they stepped in front of his train; in Sorrows And Rejoicing (2001), the family of a dead, white anti-apartheid writer reflect on the evasions of his life.

That Fugard continued as a dramatist even when the driving cause of his first plays was achieved was due to the incompleteness of the victory. Whereas anti-Soviet dramas now have only historical interest – as relative democracy has continued in Russia’s former bloc – the 2021 revival of Fugard’s Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act, at the Orange Tree theatre in Richmond, remained disconcertingly relevant.

While the specific evil it dramatised – the ban on interracial sex in South Africa from 1927 to 1985 – was gone, the play now served a new purpose: a metaphor for the continuing inequalities of opportunity and security suffered by people of colour around the world. The unexpected longevity of Statements continued a paradox that ran through Fugard’s career: situations that he detested as a citizen were his dramatic fuel.

Parents leaving the London production of Statements could be heard explaining to appalled children that the immorality laws had existed in a Commonwealth country during the lifetime of anyone older than 36. That duty of education will keep Fugard’s plays in the theatrical canon, as will the broader lessons of Statements, “Master Harold” … and the Boys and The Island in how racism roots and grows.

Fugard would have been the first to acknowledge that others, such as Kani and Ntshona, were the theatrical Mandelas of free South Africa, but the man who called himself “a classic example of the impotent, white liberal” was an epitome of the good people who, in Hannah Arendt’s formulation, must act if evil is not to prevail.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

But Friedrich Merz cautions such a move could not replace the US’s existing protective shield over Europe

Germany’s chancellor-to-be, Friedrich Merz, has said he will reach out to France and Britain to discuss the sharing of nuclear weapons, but cautioned that such a move could not be a replacement for the US’s existing protective shield over Europe.

“The sharing of nuclear weapons is an issue we need to talk about,” Merz said in a wide-ranging interview on Sunday with the broadcaster Deutschlandfunk (DLF). “We have to be stronger together in nuclear deterrence.”

Merz, an erstwhile passionate transatlanticist who has spoken out in recent weeks on Donald Trump and Europe’s need to be “independent”, said he hoped the US nuclear shield would remain in place, and that a European shield should be viewed as a “complement” to it.

“We should talk with both countries [France and Britain] always, and in addition, from the perspective of supplementing the American nuclear shield, which we of course want to see maintained,” he said.

In a guarded reference to Trump, Merz said: “The changed global security situation now necessitates that we Europeans discuss this matter together.”

Owing to its second world war past as the aggressor, Germany has committed itself to non-nuclear defence in international treaties, according to which it is banned from acquiring nuclear weapons, at the same time as cooperating in Nato weapons-sharing agreements.

Merz’s comments came after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced on Wednesday he was open to a discussion on widening France’s nuclear deterrent programme to other European nations.

At an extraordinary meeting in Brussels on Thursday, EU leaders agreed on plans to boost spending on defence over the need to build an alternative model to military support from Washington and amid concerns that Russia, encouraged by its war on Ukraine and encouraging signs from the White House, could set its future sights on attacking an EU state.

Merz, the leader of the conservatives in Germany, has put his political reputation on the line by reneging on a pre-election promise to keep the country’s rigid debt rules intact, announcing proposals last week for a massive rise in spending for defence and infrastructure.

His plans, which involve altering the constitution, will come before the German parliament on Thursday. Merz is hoping for the backing of the Social Democrats and the Greens, with whom the necessary two-thirds parliamentary majority is still possible in the existing parliament, which remains in place until 25 March.

However, Merz acknowledged on Sunday he still had work to do in order to win over the Greens to his plans, whose support is needed if a two-thirds majority is to be reached. The Greens have signalled their strong objection to the fact that hardly any reference has been made to climate protection in Merz’s proposals.

Merz said in the Deutschlandfunk interview that “intensive” talks would take place with the Green party next week. “We will integrate climate protection measures [in the investment proposals],” he said.

Merz’s CDU/CSU came first in a federal election last month and is seeking to form a “mini-grand” coalition with the Social Democrats. The two parties announced on Saturday they had completed a round of “sounding talks” to establish whether there was sufficient common ground between them before the start of formal negotiations. Official talks could begin in the coming week.

Major sticking points are expected to be migration and security, with Merz having ridden on a pre-election ticket of considerably toughening up on rules over who can enter Germany and under what circumstances they could stay.

The new government is under huge pressure to take the wind out of the sails of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland, which soared to second place in the election, with almost 21%, promising among other policies a mass “remigration” of criminal foreigners and migrants with no legal right to stay in Germany, should it come to power.

Addressing concerns that his plans to tighten migration regulations would put Germany at odds with its neighbours, Merz said he intended to be fully compliant with EU rules and would seek pan-European consensus. “We want European solidarity … but Germany also of course has a right to defend its own security and order,” he said.

Merz has said he has hopes of forming a coalition by Easter, on 20 April.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Operation Nanook, carried out in conjunction with allies, aims to ‘project force’ in a region attracting growing interest from Russia and China

The winter sun hasn’t yet risen above Inuvik’s jagged horizon of black spruce trees, but already, more than 150 nervous soldiers have gathered in a community recreation centre.

Tables clear of their breakfast and fingers fiddle with pens, a giddiness akin to the first day of school settles over the room.

Few have traveled this far north before, more than 200 kilometres above the Arctic Circle in Canada’s Northwest Territories. For some, the trip here marked the first time they had ever been on an airplane.

“You are here to be exposed to the Arctic environment,” Lt Col Darren Turner, the land taskforce commander, tells the group, which snaps to attention when he enters. “You are here to demonstrate our sovereignty and that we can protect and defend our territory from all threats.”

Running from mid-February until 9 March, Operation Nanook was Canada’s sprawling military exercise in the hostile theatre of the Arctic. In aircraft and slogging on foot through the tundra, nearly 650 personnel simulate retaking key infrastructure, testing cutting-edge equipment – and, most importantly, learning to survive the cold.

The operation, conducted alongside allies from the United States, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden and Finland, reflects an aim to “project force” in the Arctic, but also to sustain that force amid frigid conditions.

The backdrop of the mission is a recognition that Russia and China – which now calls itself a “near-Arctic nation” – have a growing interest in a region that makes up nearly half of Canada’s land mass. Thinning sea ice has opened up the North-west Passage for a longer window of time and thawing permafrost holds the promise of immense fossil fuel and critical mineral wealth.

The national defence minister, Bill Blair, warned on Thursday that climate change was upending the region and providing “growing access to Arctic resources and shipping lanes that, unfortunately, is enticing other adversarial nations to engage in heightened competition”.

“Both nations are seeking to challenge the existing unipolar world and exert national spheres of influence in the Arctic region,” Maj Andrew Melvin, who oversaw the short-term land operations, told the reservists.

While a direct, armed confrontation with Russia or China is “highly unlikely”, he warned the two countries had sophisticated intelligence-gathering tools and could use the mission to gain new knowledge of Canada’s operations.

“We are out here. We are demonstrating our sovereignty and our ability and capability to operate in high Arctic conditions. They don’t like that. They want to demonstrate through messaging that we are not able to maintain our sovereignty in the Arctic,” said Melvin. “You are here to prove them wrong. You are here to show that what we do, we do the best in the high Arctic.”

But threats to Canada’s sovereignty have also come from a closer quarter.

In recent weeks, Donald Trump has threatened to make Canada the 51st US state, an idea roundly condemned by all Canadian political leaders. While the threats have frayed diplomatic relations, senior military figures say Operation Nanook reflects a “business-as-usual” approach by the two countries’ armed forces.

“We are working with our allies like we would. We don’t let politics get in the way of our professionalism,” said Turner. “We’re professional soldiers, doing our job and fulfilling our purpose. We’ll let the politicians worry about that.”

Most soldiers duck the issue of tension with a longtime military ally. But some are blunt in their rejection of the idea.

“We’re Canada. We’re not a state and we never will be,” says one.

Last year, Canada’s federal government paid C$8.6m (US$4.7m) to acquire a privately owned aircraft hangar – known as the Green Hangar – next to Inuvik’s Norad airbase, following interest from China and Russia.

In March, Blair promised Ottawa would invest more than C$2.5bn in northern military “hubs” – nearly 10 times the previously pledged amount – to build airstrips, logistics facilities and equipment to augment infrastructure already in place.

But hiccups during Operation Nanook highlighted a dire need for greater resources.

As teams moved to transport tens of thousand of pounds of gear to a remote frozen lake, one of the Chinook transport helicopters was grounded until spare parts could be found. But the only source for the parts was a military base near Ottawa and took three days to ship.

Last week, the Canadian Press reported that the country’s spy agency, CSIS, believes the Arctic is an “attractive, strategic and vulnerable destination” for foreign adversaries like China and Russia. CSIS warned that resources projects, shipping and possible militarization of the region could be used by other countries to push into territory already claimed by Canada.

Canada’s governing Liberals intend to revive the role of Arctic ambassadors, with postings in Nuuk, Greenland, and Anchorage, Alaska, to strengthen diplomatic relations.

Much of the focus on the Arctic centres around increasingly navigable waters and the vast quantities of critical minerals and fossil fuels beneath the permafrost.

“It’s about access and it’s about resources,” said Turner. “You can access the north more easily than you have ever been able to. And that’s going to change even more drastically over the next 10 years.”

While Canada has promised to purchase new ice breakers, Russia is developing more powerful ships that can outperform Canada’s current – and future – vessels.

“Once a route is opened, they will come. We need to have an interest in that,” he said. “We need to have the capabilities to interdict, to stop, to block that movement.”

While Canada has designated all Arctic Canadian waters as indefinitely off limits to future offshore Arctic oil and gas licensing, a recent agreement between the federal government, the Northwest Territories and Yukon governments and the Inuvialuit, looks to give greater autonomy to Indigenous groups to develop fossil fuel projects.

“We have so much stranded oil and so much stranded gas,” said Jackie Jacobsen, a former lawmaker in the Northwest Territories.

He said the Inuvialuit Petroleum Corporation’s M-18 project, which aims to convert an estimated 278bn cubic feet of gas into into usable natural gas and synthetic diesel, would help a people who have long seen their lands used by outsiders. The project recent received a C$100m loan from the Canada Infrastructure Bank, with the aim of creating a local supply of fuel for energy, heating and transportation for the next half-century.

“We’re finally the ones that are going to get something out of it. The Inuvialuit will get what’s theirs, not just the big oil companies,” he said.

Jacobsen, who also served as mayor for the hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk on the edge of the Beaufort Sea, said if a region was invested in resources, “it becomes an asset worth defending.”

For others, however, the promise of sustained, large-scale investment in the region rings hollow.

“We know we have massive oil and gas reserves, because they found them in the 1960s,” said Invuik resident Ryan Lennie who also works as a Canadian Ranger. “And so Inuvik has gone through the boom and bust. We were told we would have so much investment up here, and then soon, it goes back to nothing.”

The rangers, a unit of the army responsible for remote areas, serve as both scouts for the military and a lifeline for soldiers venturing into the north for the first time.

“It’s hard to know what to make about these claims. But at the end of the day, I’m more worried about the lack of infrastructure we have up here than running into a Russian when I’m out on my snowmobile.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

More governments seeking to keep millions of people offline amid conflicts, protests and political instability

Digital blackouts reached a record high in 2024 in Africa as more governments sought to keep millions of citizens off the internet than in any other period over the last decade.

A report released by the internet rights group Access Now and #KeepItOn, a coalition of hundreds of civil society organisations worldwide, found there were 21 shutdowns in 15 African countries, surpassing the existing record of 19 shutdowns in 2020 and 2021.

Authorities in Comoros, Guinea-Bissau and Mauritius joined repeat offenders such as Burundi, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea and Kenya. Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal and Tanzania were also on the list. But perpetrators also included militias and other non-state actors.

Telecommunication and internet service providers who shut services based on government orders are also complicit in violating people’s rights, said Felicia Anthonio, the #KeepItOn campaign manager at Access Now, citing the UN guiding principles on business and human rights.

The details showed that most of the shutdowns were imposed as a response to conflicts, protests and political instability. There were also restrictions during elections.

The trend was replicated across the world with more internet shutdowns and in more countries: 296 shutdowns across 54 countries, compared with 283 shutdowns in 39 countries the previous year.

Access Now said the figures were the worst since it started keeping records in 2016 and that the rise reflected “a world where internet access is consistently weaponised, restricted, and precarious”.

“Behind each of the 1,754 shutdowns since 2016 is a story of people and communities cut off from the world and each other, often during political upheaval, unrest, violence and war,” the report said.

At least five shutdowns in Africa had been imposed for more than a year by the end of 2024, according to Access Now. As of early 2025, the social network Meta was still restricted in Uganda, despite authorities engaging with its representatives. On the Equatorial Guinean island of Annobon, internet and cell services have been cut off since an August 2024 protest over environmental concerns and isolation from the rest of the country.

The increase in shutdowns led the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights to pass a landmark resolution in March 2024 to help reverse the trend.

But the regression had continued, said Anthonio. “It’s rather unfortunate we saw more election-related shutdowns in Africa and other places in 2024 despite the adoption of the ACHPR resolution last year,” she said.

“Despite this, the resolution is a positive step as it has served as a vital resource and reference for civil society’s advocacy against rights-harming shutdowns. It is difficult for us to tell if the resolution is yielding results already, but we did see authorities in countries like Mauritius and South Sudan [in January 2025] backtrack or reverse shutdown orders.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Diplomats gasp as Keith Kellogg claims Zelenskyy to blame for soured relations with America

There was an audible gasp in the room at the Council on Foreign Relations as Keith Kellogg, the White House’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, characterised the US decision to cut off intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv as like beating a farm animal with a piece of wood.

“Very candidly, they brought it on themselves, the Ukrainians,” Kellogg said as the veteran diplomats, academics, and journalists in the room recoiled in surprise. Several held their faces in their hands. “I think the best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,” he continued. “You got their attention, and it’s very significant, obviously, because of the support that we give.”

The collapse in US-Ukraine relations since the White House summit between Trump and Zelenskyy has been precipitous. Those around Trump viewed as the strongest supporters of Ukraine – including secretary of state Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, and Kellogg – have become vocal sceptics of continued US support or been sidelined entirely.

“We know that [the Maga wing] are just waiting for something they can use to pounce,” said a former senior US diplomat. “And I think that’s where you get the posturing by Rubio, Kellogg and also Waltz, which disturbs people who understand America’s interest in preventing a Putin win in Ukraine.”

It has been matched by a rise in the people around Trump who hold vocally Eurosceptic views: Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson, and JD Vance, the vice-president who seized his moment in the Oval Office and provoked a greater conflict between Trump and Zelenskyy.

Vance has made several key interventions meant to sow divisions with Europe. He appears to have planned ahead of time. His team briefed European media before he spoke up during Trump’s meeting with Keir Starmer to complain about “infringements on free speech” in the UK. And when Zelenskyy disregarded advice from Kellogg, Republican senators, and others, not to clash with Trump during the White House meeting, Vance once again poured petrol on the fire.

“First Zelenskyy needs to keep silent in public about concerns with Trump’s policy moves, even though those concerns are justified,” the former senior official said. “It would be good for him to send a team to the meeting in Riyadh which is not at his level. I think he needs to sign the mineral agreement in any form that the Trump administration wants.”

Fiona Hill, a former White House official during Trump’s first term, said the speculation on the part of many European officials was that “this was set up by Vance … that he wanted to sideline the Rubios, the Waltzes, the Kelloggs.”

These were supposed to be the adults in the room for this administration. Rubio was confirmed 99-0 by senators who believed he would help keep Trump’s foreign policy on track. Waltz was expected to be a centrist ally as national security adviser. And Kellogg, while sceptical of piecemeal support for Kyiv, was seen as a firm supporter of Ukraine.

Instead, they have followed Trump into putting pressure on Ukraine. Rubio last week said: “Frankly, it’s a proxy war between nuclear powers – the United States, helping Ukraine, and Russia – and it needs to come to an end.”

That was a vision closely aligned with the Kremlin’s. Dmitry Peskov reacted positively to Rubio’s words, saying: “We can and want to agree with it, and we agree with it. That’s the way it is. We have said this repeatedly. We have said that this is actually a conflict between Russia and the collective west. And the main country of the collective west is the United States of America.”

That’s not the only way in which the US is adopting Russia’s views on the war. In his speech, Kellogg broke ground in describing how Trump sees the conflict: the US wants to position itself as a neutral arbiter between Russia and Ukraine, and Trump recognises that the US needs to “reset relations with Russia” to secure US national security. “The continued isolation and lack of engagement with the Russians as the war in Ukraine continues is no longer a viable strategy,” he said.

That portrayal is a radical realignment of US policy interests in the conflict. For three years, Washington has provided considerable financial and military support to Kyiv to allow it to stay in the fight. But under a new Trump administration, those who supported the previous policy have quickly pivoted to back Trump as he seeks to end the war by putting pressure on Ukraine.

“Kellogg has some people around him who do know what they’re doing,” said Hill, who worked with him during the first Trump term. “He’s 80 years old. He fought in Vietnam. He knows his stuff. He’s no fan of Russia. He’s a total cold warrior. He’s trying to thread the needle there but he also works for the commander in chief, so he’s trying to interpret, in the best way that he can, what’s going on here? And he will not stray away from what Trump does or says, that’s why he is still there.”

Yet Kellogg was left off the list for a key summit between Ukrainian and US officials this week in Saudi Arabia in an attempt to repair the relationship. Waltz, Rubio, and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are set to travel for talks with Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak and his team. The path forward is unclear – although both pro-Ukraine Americans and European officials believe that there is no alternative to US support in the conflict.

European officials are hopeful that Zelenskyy and the Trump officials can manage to hold a meeting that won’t erupt into open conflict. That may lead to a quick renewal of intelligence support, which European officials have not lost hope for.

But there are broader discussions about whether or not the US remains a viable longterm partner for Ukraine. For now, the Ukrainian side has few options except to make amends.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Wingfield Manor is part-managed by English Heritage, but has fallen into a state of disrepair

At various points in history it has been a prison for Mary, Queen of Scots, a battleground in the English civil war, and the site of one the country’s first flushing toilets.

But despite its storied past, Wingfield Manor in Derbyshire has fallen into disrepair, and members of the public can no longer visit the magnificent ruins on a hilltop in Amber Valley.

“In the 19th century, the guidebooks to Derbyshire highlight the main tourist attractions, and they were Chatsworth [House], Hardwick Hall, Haddon Hall, and Wingfield Manor – it’s right up there,” said Barry Joyce, the former manager of the conservation and design team at Derbyshire county council.

Joyce, now the vice-chair of Derbyshire Historic Buildings Trust (DHBT), is one of a group of people fighting to save the building.

“In the 1950s the then Ministry of Works of the government decided that there was a problem,” he said, “because the owner was not repairing the building or making it, as a ruin, safe as he should be doing because it was a Grade I-[listed] building and a scheduled ancient monument.”

Management of part of the building was removed from the owner, a farmer whose son now owns the ruin and the land it sits on. Responsibility for looking after it passed to English Heritage, which in 2015 split into two, with Historic England responsible for the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation, while the English Heritage Trust charity operates its historic properties.

“Gradually they were not able to undertake their duty of maintaining [Wingfield Manor] in good order so the public could access it, and ultimately, that’s the duty of the government – English Heritage act as an agent of government,” Joyce said.

“In this case, the government took it off the owner because he wasn’t looking after it. Now the government isn’t looking after it. So it’s rather paradoxical, isn’t it?”

Joyce said the DHBT first began looking into saving the manor because of the strength of feeling about it.

“It’s such a shame,” said Vicky Parsons, 64, a retired teacher walking her dog past the ruins. “It was just such a lovely place … We once even had a barn dance in there; it used to have peacocks.

“It’s just a lovely, atmospheric historic place to be in with a lovely view. It’s just got a bit run down.”

Jonathan Clitheroe, 54, who runs a walking group for people with learning disabilities, said: “It would be lovely to see it open again to the public, because obviously it’s Mary, Queen of Scots and the associated history.”

When DHBT trustees heard the owner, Sam Critchlow, planned to sell the manor they floated the possibility of crowdfunding to buy t themselves, “but that’s kind of pie the sky thinking at the moment”, Joyce said.

A spokesperson for English Heritage said: “Wingfield Manor is significant as a late-medieval aristocratic house surviving in England and was influential in the development of such great palaces as Hampton Court Palace.

“The two edges of the site are in the guardianship of the state and managed by English Heritage, while the central section remains in private ownership.

“With it being originally conceived and built as a whole, this makes it a relatively complicated site on a number of levels, not least in terms of maintenance and conservation.”

The spokesperson said that while the organisation and owner had previously discussed options for reuniting the site, “unfortunately we were not able to arrive at a consensus”.

They said that since English Heritage became a charity, it has spent more than £100,000 on repairs and maintenance, and is developing a full conservation project for the parts it manages. “However, there are major challenges and costs involved with securing its future.”

A spokesperson for Historic England said: “We are concerned about its condition and are working with English Heritage to discuss the steps needed to ensure that it has a sustainable future,” adding that the organisation had not offered to buy the building.

Critchlow said he was prepared to sell the manor. “No reasonable offer refused, that’s it. Up to now I haven’t had an offer because it’s not really for sale.”

And if he received an offer? “I’d have to think about that one and have a word with my land agent, see what he said, see what it’s worth.”

Critchlow said he was not responsible for the poor condition of the building. “English Heritage has a guardianship order on it, anything that happens to it is down to them, end of story.

“It’s nothing to do with me. I only own it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Richard Branson’s group plans rail routes linking London to Paris and Brussels, and maybe Amsterdam 

Richard Branson’s Virgin Group is aiming to raise £700m to fund its plan to launch cross-Channel rail services that would compete with Eurostar.

Virgin, which previously operated intercity trains in Britain including between London and Glasgow, plans to start rail services connecting the UK capital with Paris and Brussels. It would also look to run trains to Amsterdam.

It is planning a high-frequency service, which could launch by the end of the decade. The company is seeking to become the first direct rival to Eurostar, which has run services across the Channel for 30 years.

Virgin Group said it intended to raise £300m in equity and £400m in debt, as first reported by the Financial Times.

The company founded by the British billionaire Branson said it also planned to be a “cornerstone” investor, helping to provide some of the initial capital required to get the project off the ground.

“The cross-Channel route is ripe for change and would benefit from competition,” a Virgin Group spokesperson said.

“While Virgin is not committing to launching a service just yet, we are seeking investment from like-minded partners to invest alongside Virgin and we are delighted with the progress made so far.”

Meanwhile, the Channel tunnel operator, Getlink, and London’s St Pancras railway station have agreed to work together on increasing the number of services between Britain and France, and opening up rail routes to Germany and Switzerland.

St Pancras is looking to triple the number of passengers who can travel through at peak times.

The partnership, which was announced last month, has been seen as a sign of growing momentum for increasing the frequency of rail links across the Channel between Britain and continental Europe.

In January, the rail regulator for Great Britain, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), forced London St Pancras Highspeed – the company formerly known as HS1 that runs the station – to cut the prices it charges rail companies for using its track between St Pancras and the Channel tunnel to try to encourage new entrants.

Virgin is not the only company considering the London-Paris route. The Spanish rail company Evolyn has previously announced plans to start a high-speed service linking the British and French capitals, which is called a “strategic and high-demand” route. Evolyn said in 2023 it had reached an agreement to buy 12 high-speed trains from the French manufacturer Alstom, with the option of acquiring four more.

However, both projects aiming to break Eurostar’s monopoly on the cross-Channel rail route have been set back by a dispute over access to the depot in Leyton, east London, where Eurostar stores and maintains its trains.

Any new cross-Channel rail operator would also be required to keep trains at the site, and Virgin and Evolyn have asked the ORR to intervene. The ORR has commissioned an independent study looking at capacity at the Temple Mills depot.

Eurostar is the only company that has carried foot passengers across the Channel during the 30 years of the tunnel’s operations, although Getlink’s Le Shuttle also takes cars with drivers and passengers.

Eurostar has faced criticism over high prices, and it has ditched international services from Ashford and Ebbsfleet in Kent.

Eurostar has been contacted for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Art lovers catch last glimpse of prestigious art collection before gallery shuts for five years for major revamp

Visitors from around the world have been flocking to the Pompidou Centre in Paris this weekend, seizing the last opportunity to enjoy Europe’s largest temple of modern and contemporary art before it closes its doors for a five-year overhaul.

In one of the most complex closures of its kind, the task of removing the museum’s 2,000-strong permanent collection will start on Monday. The Pompidou’s Chagalls, Giacomettis and myriad other treasures will be relocated to other sites in Paris and museums elsewhere in France and around the world.

The refit of the nearly 50-year-old building, constructed in the heart of Paris by architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, is expected to cost an estimated €262ms and will require the entire centre – including its huge library and music research unit – to be closed from late September.

The building, famous for its facade adorned with colourful pipes and ventilation shafts, will be given a top-to-toe renovation, with everything from its technology and accessibility to its energy efficiency due to be reconditioned. Most crucial is the removal of asbestos present everywhere from the museum’s ceilings to its pipes, a task so huge a complete demolition had been proposed.

Once complete, the cultural colossus, named after Georges Pompidou, France’s conservative president between 1969 and 1974, is to be reopened with a new exhibition space, offering what museum bosses have called a “multidisciplinary perspective” with new spaces for children and young people, as well as an enlarged library.

Art lovers have until 9pm on Monday to take a final stroll through the permanent collection. However, Laurent Le Bon, art historian and the museum’s head, said those who missed the deadline would have plenty of other chances to see the Pompidou’s works. Calling the renovation a “an unprecedented opportunity to reinvent the Centre Pompidou”, he has said: “We will use the time we have well.”

Some of the works will be brought out of storage for an exhibition in Paris’ Grand Palais – which itself was reopened last summer after a major renovation..

French visitors and foreign tourists were among those to take advantage of the last weekend, for which entrance was free, with workshops, art performances and DJ sets contributing to a lively atmosphere.

Alyssa, an 11-year-old French girl visiting with her 62-year-old grandfather, said she wanted to “see for real” the abstract paintings of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian, which she had been shown in school.

Paula Goulart, a 25-year-old from Brazil, told Agence France-Presse she was a fan not so much of the artworks as of the spectacular views of the Paris skyline from the building’s upper storeys. Her Portuguese friend Luis Fraga said he was a regular visitor to the museum and was keen to lap up and “enjoy as much as possible” the artworks “before they are no longer here”.

The Pompidou Centre, which attracted more than 3 million visitors last year, is one of the most popular museums in the world, ranking in Paris behind only the Louvre (8 million) and the Musée d’Orsay (3.7 million) in terms of popularity.

Its closure comes weeks after major renovation work was announced at the Louvre amid heavy criticism that the museum had become overcrowded and unmanageable. For that project, estimated to cost €700-800m, which involves creating a new, more accessible entrance and putting the Mona Lisa in a separate room with its own means of access, the museum will not be closed, though some individual rooms will be, temporarily. It is due to be completed in 2031.

Those who consider the Pompidou’s planned closure to be lengthy may take solace when looking to Berlin, where visitors wanting to visit the Pergamon Museum, which houses a collection of ancient Greek and Roman art as well as the Pergamon Altar, will have to wait up to 20 years for extensive renovation works to be completed. The museum closed in October 2023.

In his reckoning, there are not so much as sovereign states, but properties with tenants that can purchased

You ask if Donald Trump is “friend or foe?” (News). The answer is that if it is understood how Trump perceives himself, the US and others in the world, then there is a consistency about his utterances and policies.

He sees himself as global deal-maker and, in effect, a replacement for the United Nations. The statements he has made, and continues to make, about Gaza, Greenland, Panama and Canada should be taken literally. In Trump’s reckoning of the order of the world there are not so much as sovereign states, nations with economies and citizens, but properties with tenants that can be purchased – or, in the case of Gaza, tenants who can be “asked” to leave. In the case of Ukraine, he deals with the significant other potential property dealer, Russia, and that explains his treatment of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Dr George Hudson

As an American, I feel that it may be too late for us. Either out of ignorance or anger, half of us voted this man into power. All Americans now have to live with the terrifying consequences of living under the thumb of a capricious, revengeful individual and those who bow down to him or use him for their own purposes.

But Europeans do not have to appease Trump. Appeasement did not work with Hitler. It will not work now. Europe once was able to rely on the United States. Today, the world, including Americans, will have to rely on Europe to keep alive the ideals of the declaration of independence, the constitution, the Gettysburg address and Martin Luther King’s speech. I hope the British government will rescind the invitation of the king. Miriam Bartes

Andrew Rawnsley rightly deplores the slashing of the international aid budget (“In this dangerous age, Britain needs to exert soft power as well as the hard stuff”, Comment).

But please don’t pit the needs of people in poverty overseas against those of people in poverty in this country by suggesting that we could be less generous towards social security spending.

Social security has suffered massive cuts over the past decade and this has been a prime factor in the increase in and deepening of poverty. Rawnsley rightly concludes that we are an affluent country that can afford to wield both hard and soft power. We can also afford to provide a decent social security system. If the French government can be considering taxing the wealthy more in the face of current security demands, why can’t we?Baroness Lister of Burtersett

We write in support of Kim Leadbeater’s proposal for a judge-led assisted dying commission to appoint a panel of multidisciplinary specialists to examine and approve each individual request for assistance to die.

We believe this makes the bill the safest and strongest of its kind in the world, and a marked improvement on the status quo in this country, which fails to offer meaningful upfront protections.

When MPs voted to support the principle of assisted dying last year, questions were raised around the role of the High Court in assessing cases and the practicability of the proposal. Having considered those arguments,

Leadbeater has alighted on the most critical question: how to apply the right sets of eyes to cases to ensure objective external scrutiny and guard against any misuse. The proposal of multidisciplinary panels, each chaired by a judge or KC, assisted by the expertise of psychiatrists and social workers, is sensible and practical. Indeed, similar panels have been proven to work well already in Spain. The focus on retired judges, frequently deployed on to public inquiries or as highly skilled mediators, should settle any concerns about potential impact on the courts system.

It is welcome that with parliament having conclusively backed the principle of assisted dying, Leadbeater and others are strengthening the legislation further. The proposal of an assisted dying commission represents an important step on that journey, bringing end-of-life decisions out of the shadows and greatly increasing the support and protection available for terminally ill people who want this choice.

With this bill, MPs have an opportunity to bring about a sea-change in protections for dying people, and replace the meagre provisions of our current law with a stronger, safer settlement. They should grasp it.Sir Max Hill, former Director of Public Prosecutions; Dame Alison Saunders, former Director of Public Prosecutions; Lord Ken Macdonald, former Director of Public Prosecutions; Lord Charles Falconer, Former Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice; Lord David Pannick, Blackstone Chambers; Professor Emily Jackson, Professor of Law, London School of Economics; Professor Colin Gavaghan, Professor at the School of Law, University of Bristol; Professor Philippe Sands, Faculty of Laws, UCL and 11 King’s Bench Walk; Professor Hazel Biggs, Professor Emeritus, University of Southampton; Dr Nick Cartwright, Associate Professor, School of Law, University of Leeds; Tim Owen, Matrix Chambers; Stephen Cragg, Doughty Street Chambers; Michael Mansfield, Nexus Chambers; Joe Middleton, Doughty Street Chambers; David Wolfe, Matrix Chambers; Rebecca Hill, 5SAH Chambers; Maria Scotland, 5SAH Chambers; Louisa Collins, 5SAH Chambers; Saoirse Townshend, Temple Garden Chambers; Chris Bishop, Senior Partner, Slater Heelis; Rachel Fletcher, Partner, Slater Heelis; Richard Stein, Retired, Former Partner, Leigh Day; Yogi Amin, Solicitor; Martin Rackstraw, Solicitor and Oliver Studdert, Solicitor; Professor Laura Hoyano, Professor of Law, University of Oxford and Red Lion Chambers; Tony Vaughan, Doughty Street Chambers and MP for Folkestone and Hythe; Andrea Coomber KC (Hon)

Amen to Miriam Avery’s letter saying, “It is possible, with the right education and tools, to avoid pregnancy without hormonal birth control”. Scientific knowledge and clear teaching has moved natural methods on by many decades from that approach which did require luck, and for nearly 50 years natural family planning has been available, albeit small scale.

Sadly, many of the apps are not trustworthy or educational, but some are and along with initially being taught by a human being, fertility opens up to women, giving us options to choose, while not affecting our bodies.Ginny Eaton

Both supporters of Yoon Suk Yeol and those who backed his impeachment rallied in Seoul ahead of his release

South Korea’s impeached conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has been released from prison, a day after a Seoul court cancelled his arrest to allow him to stand trial for insurrection without being detained.

After walking out of a detention centre near Seoul on Saturday, Yoon waved, clenched his fists and bowed deeply to his supporters who were shouting his name and waving South Korean and US flags. Yoon climbed into a black van headed to his presidential residence in the capital.

In a statement distributed by his lawyers, Yoon said that he “appreciates the courage and decision by the Seoul central district court to correct illegality”, in an apparent reference to legal disputes over his arrest. He said he also thanked his supporters and asked those who were on hunger strike against his impeachment to end it.

On Saturday, about 55,000 Yoon supporters rallied in Seoul’s main districts, while 32,500 people demonstrated against him near the constitutional court, Yonhap news agency reported, citing unofficial police estimates.

The public, however, remains largely anti-Yoon, with 60% of respondents saying he should be removed from office and 35% opposing removal, according to a Gallup Korea poll on Friday.

Yoon was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January over his 3 December martial law decree, which plunged the country into political turmoil. The liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly separately voted to impeach him, leading to his suspension from office.

The constitutional court has been deliberating whether to formally dismiss or reinstate Yoon. If the court upholds his impeachment, a national election will be held to find his successor within two months.

The Seoul central district court said on Friday it accepted Yoon’s request to be released from prison, citing the need to address questions over the legality of the investigations of the president. Yoon’s lawyers have accused the investigative agency that detained him before his formal arrest of lacking legal authority to investigate rebellion charges.

The Seoul court also said the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted.

Yoon’s release came after prosecutors decided not to appeal against the decision by the Seoul court. South Korean law allows prosecutors to continue to hold a suspect while pursuing an appeal, even after his or her arrest is cancelled by a court.

The main liberal opposition Democratic party, which led Yoon’s 14 December impeachment, lashed out at the prosecutors’ decision, calling them “henchmen” of Yoon, a former prosecutor general. Party spokesperson Cho Seung-rae urged the constitutional court to dismiss Yoon as soon as possible to avoid further public unrest and anxiety.

Investigators have alleged Yoon’s martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he is convicted of that offence, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions but that does not cover grave charges like rebellion and treason.

Yoon has said he did not intend to maintain martial law for long as he only attempted to inform the public of the danger of the Democratic party, which obstructed his agenda and impeached many senior officials and prosecutors. In his martial law announcement, Yoon called the assembly “a den of criminals” and “anti-state forces”.

South Korea’s conservative-liberal divide is severe and rallies either supporting or denouncing Yoon’s impeachment have divided Seoul streets. Experts say whatever decision the constitutional court makes, the division is certain to worsen.

Members of Putin’s United Russia party in Murmansk said gifts were initiative of the women’s wing 

Local officials from Russia’s ruling party have caused controversy by presenting mothers of soldiers killed in Ukraine with gifts of meat grinders, an appliance widely used to describe Russia’s brutal tactics on the frontline.

The United Russia party in the northern Murmansk region posted photos on social media showing officials smiling as they visited bereaved mothers with gifts of flowers and boxed meat grinders for International Women’s Day on Saturday, which is widely celebrated in Russia.

The post included a message thanking the “dear mums” for their “strength of spirit and the love you put into bringing up your sons”. It said the gifts were the initiative of the women’s wing of the party.

Some online commentators called the gesture as “shameful” and “inappropriate”.

Russia is often accused of throwing its frontline soldiers into a “meat grinder” with scant regard for their lives.

The Russian word for meat grinder, myasorubka, has the same double meaning as in English.

It refers to a tactic in which small groups of soldiers are sent into attack, one after another, in waves, risking heavy losses, with the aim of eventually wearing out and overpowering Ukrainian troops.

The party’s local branch in the town of Polyarniye Zori defended itself against the online backlash, saying critics were making “callous and provocative interpretations” of its gifts.

The mayor, Maxim Chengayev, who took part in the handover of gifts, said that meat grinders were not originally intended to be included but “one woman asked for it and we of course could not say no”, United Russia said.

The local party later posted a video in which one of the soldiers’ mothers awkwardly thanked the party for the gifts and confirmed that she had asked for a meat grinder because she needed one.

Russia has rarely given any figures for its losses in Ukraine and the true toll is unknown, but independent media put it at many tens of thousands.

The Russian website Mediazona and the BBC’s Russian service said last month they had identified the names of 91,000 Russian soldiers killed, but added the actual toll was likely to be “considerably higher”.

At the end of 2024, the then US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke of 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded.

Ukraine has also suffered heavy losses, whose full extent is unclear.

The president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in February that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and about 380,000 wounded. Media reports based on western sources have given estimated Ukrainian military death tolls ranging from 50,000 to 100,000.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

After fears £11m would be diverted to Treasury, money will be spent on restoring polluted areas where penalties issued

Millions of pounds of fines imposed on water firms will fund environmental schemes to protect the country’s waterways after fears the money would be diverted to the Treasury.

The water restoration fund was set up by the Conservative government to ensure that polluting water firms paid for the damage they caused. The fund received £11m in fines and penalties from April 2022 to October 2023.

It was reported in January that the Treasury was looking to keep money earmarked for projects across the country. River trusts have submitted bids to improve and monitor the health of a number of rivers, including the River Derwent in Derbyshire and the River Waveney on the Norfolk-Suffolk border.

Successful applicants to the fund will be notified on Monday, with work due to start this year. Projects will focus on improving the water environment in the same regions where the water company fines and penalties were issued.

Environment secretary Steve Reed said: “After years of failure, our rivers, lakes and seas are awash with pollution. The sewage scandal ends now.

“This government has already placed failing water companies under tough special measures through the water act, with new powers to ban the payment of bonuses for polluting water bosses and bring criminal charges against lawbreakers. This week we’re going even further, investing millions of pounds of funding from water company fines into cleaning up our rivers, lakes and seas.”

The announcement of the money for the restoration schemes comes after the Water (Special Measures) Act was passed last month to ensure firms are held to account. New laws will strengthen regulation to ensure water bosses face personal criminal liability for law breaking. Water firms will also be required to install monitors at every sewage outlet, with data independently scrutinised by regulators.

Environmental campaigners wanted an amendment in the new bill to ensure all future fines imposed on water firms would be ringfenced for restoration projects. The amendment was not included in the new bill and ministers have been repeatedly challenged over how future criminal fines and civil penalties will be used.

Charles Watson, chair of the charity River Action, said any money for restoration was welcome but £11m was a small amount compared with the billions of pounds paid out in dividends. He said: “Every pound that is given to local communities to restore rivers is welcome and we are grateful for that, but the money in this fund is just a rounding error compared to how shareholders and lenders have been paid out by the water firms.”

An independent commission into the water sector is carrying out the largest review of the industry since privatisation. Ministers says this will help shape further laws to attract the investment needed to clean up our waterways and restore public confidence in the sector.

President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel to the Qatari capital of Doha on Tuesday for ceasefire talks, according to a U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. They would be the first Gaza ceasefire negotiations since Trump took office.

“Israel is responding to the mediators’ invitation, backed by the United States and will send a delegation to Doha on Monday in an effort to advance the negotiations,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement Saturday.

The first phase of the ceasefire ended March 1 without agreement on the next steps. Hamas insists on negotiations to reach the second phase, which would include a permanent end to the war. Israel has pushed for a temporary truce to secure the release of more hostages. Last week, Israel halted the entry of all humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave over the dispute.

U.S. negotiators have recently pursued separate, direct talks with Hamas in the hopes of winning the release of the remaining American hostage, Edan Alexander, and a number of other living captives.

BEIRUT — Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, called for peace and “national unity” Sunday after hundreds of people were killed in clashes between government and allied forces and gunmen from the country’s Alawite minority.

“We have to preserve national unity and domestic peace,” Sharaa said from a Damascus mosque, according to a video that circulated online. “We can live together,” he said.

Sharaa’s message, however, came amid the worst outbreak of violence since his rebel forces ousted the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, an Alawite, in December. From the outset, Sharaa promised his Islamist government would be inclusive of minorities.

But the assault on Alawites over the weekend, in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus, raised questions about the young government’s ability to keep Syria from descending into sectarian conflict.

“What is currently happening in Syria is within the expected challenges,” Sharaa said.

Government officials accused armed remnants of the Assad regime of carrying out a coordinated attack on government forces in the coastal region. On Sunday, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, Col. Hassan Abdul Ghani, told Syria’s state news agency that the cities where violence raged had been brought back under the government’s control.

But for Alawites — a minority Shiite sect in a majority-Sunni Muslim country — it was everything they feared could happen after Assad’s fall.

“Entire families were being wiped out,” said a doctor working in al-Qadmus in Tartus. The doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said she received bodies of the dead, as well as injured civilians and gunmen, as the clashes spiraled into sectarian executions.

Government forces “entered homes and carried out mass killings of all Alawites,” she said.

At least 624 people were killed, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which has documented rights violations in Syria since the popular uprising in 2011. The doctor said all of the casualties at her hospital arrived with either gunshot or shrapnel wounds.

The pace of the fighting appeared to have slowed by Sunday, but it was still continuing. The doctor and her colleagues had escaped the hospital in the early hours of the morning as drones and shelling surrounded it. Syrian state news showed a convoy of more fighters heading toward the south from Idlib overnight.

“My nerves are broken,” she said by phone Sunday after escaping the area on foot.

The office of the presidency said a committee was formed to investigate the violence, identify the perpetrators and refer those responsible for criminal prosecution.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Sunday, “The United States condemns the radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis, that murdered people in western Syria in recent days.”

Salim reported from Baghdad.

Iran’s mission to the United Nations said discussions with the United States on concerns about “any potential militarization” of Iran’s nuclear program could be considered in specific cases. The comments came after recent comments by President Donald Trump about wanting to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran rather than handling it “militarily.”

Trump said he wrote a letter to the Iranian government last week saying, “I hope you’re going to negotiate, because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing for them,” he told Fox’s Maria Bartiromo in an interview taped Thursday and aired Sunday.

Iran’s mission to the United Nations wrote on X on Sunday that if the negotiations’ objective “is to address concerns vis-à-vis any potential militarization of Iran’s nuclear program,” such discussions “may be subject to consideration.”

“However, should the aim be the dismantlement of Iran’s peaceful nuclear program to claim that what [former president Barack] Obama failed to achieve has now been accomplished, such negotiations will never take place,” Iran’s mission said.

The day before, Iranian state news quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader, as saying Iran would not be bullied into negotiations, without explicitly mentioning the United States.

“The insistence of some bullying governments on negotiations is not to resolve issues. … Talks for them is a pathway to have new demands; it is not only about Iran’s nuclear issue. … Iran will definitely not accept their expectations,” Khamenei told senior Iranian officials at a meeting Saturday, Reuters reported.

In his Fox interview, Trump said Iran can be handled two ways: “militarily, or you make a deal.” He said he wants the latter.

“I would prefer to make a deal, because I’m not looking to hurt Iran,” Trump said. “We can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily.”

Humanitarian groups and some Arab nations, including mediators Qatar and Egypt, condemned Israel’s decision Sunday to halt the entry of all aid into war-battered Gaza. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canadian goods and threatened to make Canada the 51st state, has loomed large over the contest.

OTTAWA — More than two months after Justin Trudeau said he intended to resign as Canada’s prime minister, the country’s Liberals on Sunday will announce his successor.

U.S. President Donald Trump has loomed large over the contest. Several top cabinet ministers declined to run, saying their focus was better placed on responding to Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canadian goods, questioned Canada’s viability as a country and threatened to use “economic coercion” to make it the 51st state.

For Liberal voters, the central question has been who can best stand up to Trump and safeguard Canada’s economy and sovereignty. But Sunday night’s winner may not be in power for long, as a federal election could be just around the corner.

Here are the key things to know about Canada’s race for a new leader.

Among the candidates vying to replace Trudeau as Liberal leader — and prime minister — two favorites have emerged: Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland. The pair have been friendly. He is godfather to one of Freeland’s children.

Carney is the presumed front-runner. He grew up dreaming of being an NHL player but ascended instead to the upper echelons of finance as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs in capitals around the world.

He earned acclaim for steering Canada through the 2008 financial crisis as governor of the Bank of Canada and navigating Brexit as Bank of England chief — the first non-Brit to lead the central bank since it was founded in the 17th century. He was a darling of the British press, who called him a “rock star” central banker.

Carney is pitching himself as a political outsider with the crisis-management experience needed as Canada faces a potentially crippling trade war with the United States, its largest trading partner. But he is untested as a politician and his French speaking skills have drawn criticism, which has traditionally been a liability in Quebec, a key battleground.

He has pledged to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, as Trudeau has done. But he has also sought to repudiate aspects of Trudeau’s economic record, including the consumer carbon tax. He has said the government spends too much and invests too little and promised to balance part of the budget within three years.

His main opponent is Chrystia Freeland, who was Trudeau’s deputy prime minister before she resigned from his cabinet in December, citing differences with the prime minister over fiscal policy and setting off the caucus mutiny that led to his resignation.

A Ukrainian Canadian, she drew the KGB’s attention as a student traveling through Ukraine in the 1980s. Its code name for her was Frida. As a journalist, she covered the fall of the Soviet Union and its aftermath.

When Trudeau recruited her to join politics, it was seen as a coup. She drew praise during Trump’s first term for the role that she played as foreign minister in renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trudeau put Freeland in charge of so many critical files, including the pandemic response, that she was nicknamed “the Minister of Everything.”

The United States under Trump, she said during this year’s campaign, has turned into a “predator” and represents the biggest threat to Canada since World War II. Trump, for his part, has labeled her “toxic” — an insult that she is wearing as a badge of honor.

“I want to let you in on a little secret,” she said in a campaign video. “Donald Trump doesn’t like me very much.”

She has pledged to impose dollar-for-dollar tariffs on U.S. goods and 100 percent tariffs on Teslas. But analysts say the former finance minister may struggle to differentiate herself from Trudeau and his unpopular economic record.

Some 400,000 registered Liberals are eligible to vote in Sunday’s contest, with the final result determined in part through a ranked ballot system.

The winner is expected to be sworn in as prime minister within the next week, officially replacing Trudeau. A federal election must be held by late October but could come sooner.

Opposition parties have vowed to bring down the government after a new session of Parliament begins on March 24. The winner could also call a snap election.

Before Trudeau announced on Jan. 6 that he intended to resign, his Liberals were headed for a wipeout, trailing the Conservatives for more than a year, amid concerns about inflation, the high cost of living and a housing shortage.

But Trudeau’s resignation and Trump’s return have upended Canadian politics and breathed new life into the Liberal Party. In a matter of months, the Liberals have mounted a comeback and significantly narrowed a 20-point polling deficit.

Canada’s Conservatives picked Pierre Poilievre to lead them in 2022 after three consecutive election losses. The 45-year-old is a right-wing populist who drew rare standing-room-only crowds during the Conservative leadership race and has a combative style.

Poilievre rose to the leadership by trafficking in grievance politics and railing against “wokeism,” the news media and “gatekeepers.” When the convoy demonstrators blockaded Ottawa and several border crossings in 2022, he supported them.

He planned to make this year’s election a referendum on Trudeau and the carbon tax, campaigning on the slogan “Ax the [carbon] tax, build the homes, fix the budget, stop the crime.”

But he has been forced to retool his campaign and his message. Trudeau has stepped aside, and his potential successors have said they’ll scrap the consumer carbon tax. As Trump’s attacks stir fury and flag-waving displays of patriotism here, Poilievre’s longtime message — that “Canada is broken” — does not match national sentiment.

He held a rally last month where he unveiled a new message — “Canada First” — and said that Canadians would “bear any burden and pay any price to protect the sovereignty and independence of our country.”

The Liberals in recent weeks rolled out ads linking Poilievre to Trump. One cuts between clips of Poilievre complaining that “everything is broken” and railing against a “woke censorship ideology” with clips of Trump using identical or nearly identical language.

Analysts said they’ve rarely seen the vote so volatile outside of an election, and whether the Liberal surge will continue is unknown.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

According to research by Olivia Mitchell, a Wharton professor and executive director of the Pension Research Council, a majority of the adults over the age of 50 that Mitchell surveyed expressed strong regret over insufficient savings.

""A majority of the respondents said they wished they saved more,"" Mitchell said on a recent episode of Decoding Retirement (see video above or listen below). ""Only 2% said they wished they had saved less.""

Retirees highlighted other regrets as well. Many regretted not working longer and not delaying their Social Security claims — both of which would have increased their retirement income.

Another notable finding was regret over not securing lifetime income, such as through an annuity. Annuities provide a steady income stream, making it easier to manage expenses, especially as cognitive abilities decline with age.

“Many people are financially not as literate as they were when they were younger,” Mitchell said. “And having that steady income stream is and can be a real boost. People regretted not having done that as well.”

In the podcast, Mitchell also addressed the increasing number of older adults who are retiring with mortgage debt, student loan debt, credit card debt, and the like.

According to Mitchell, older adults once took pride in being debt-free in retirement — so much so that mortgage-burning ceremonies were a common tradition in 20th century America.

“But that attitude is not true of retirees today,” she said.

More and more retirees are now entering retirement without paying off their mortgage — and in some cases, they even take on a larger mortgage when relocating to a sunnier climate or another state.

Credit card debt has also become a growing concern for retirees. And strangely, around 6% of retirees are now seeing their Social Security checks garnished due to unpaid student loans — either their own or those taken out for their children, Mitchell said.

“So debt is increasingly troubling the older population,” she said.

Furthermore, Mitchell noted that high inflation has led to increased interest rates on various types of debt, including mortgages, credit cards, and student loans.

""It becomes a very big challenge for people to meet that increase in debt payments, debt obligations in retirement,"" Mitchell said. ""So my advice is to try to really get your debt under control. Pay back everything you can. Destroy your credit cards if you find yourself unable to live within your means. Think about downsizing. Think about moving to a state with lower tax rates. All those things are ways to try to stretch your dollar a little bit farther in retirement.""

As for her current research, Mitchell is exploring financial advice and how financial advisers can better equip individuals with the information they need to make informed decisions.

“There's a lot of financial advice online,” she said. “Social media is full of influencers providing financial advice, but some of them are conflicted. Some of them are giving terrible advice. I would like to see a better way of evaluating financial advice where people are getting what they need throughout their lifetimes.”

Mitchell said she reviewed financial apps that provide advice a few years ago and concluded that they were getting better at helping you decide how much to save, where to save, how to allocate your portfolio, and so on.

However, those apps struggled with key retirement decisions, such as the optimal time to claim Social Security, how much to allocate to an annuity, and how to factor in family dynamics.

For example, if one spouse had a defined benefit plan and the other had a defined contribution plan, the apps fell short in helping users optimize their savings and payout strategies together.

 

“So I think that the whole financial advice field has to really be improved and supported,” she said. “Maybe the fintech and the large language models will help.”

She highlighted one fintech company, in particular, that is designing avatars to help individuals picture themselves in retirement should they follow one lifetime path versus another.

“And I think that's brilliant,” she said. “It really has the potential to help us picture our future selves, and that's exactly what we need in order to be able to look at the impact of our decisions on our future outcomes.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22business%20news%22%20site%3Afinance.yahoo.com,'Chaos creates opportunities': Wall Street pros weigh in on market sell-off under Trump's tariff war,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chaos-creates-opportunities-wall-street-pros-weigh-in-on-market-sell-off-under-trumps-tariff-war-150003507.html,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:00:03 GMT","

It's been a brutal start to March as markets reverse their Trump-driven euphoria following the president's recent tariff war escalation and fears over slower economic growth in the face of stubborn inflation.

Both the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) have each erased their post-election gains, with the latter entering correction territory on Thursday after falling 10% from its record closing high of 20,173.89 on Dec. 16.

February's jobs report, released Friday, offered some relief with the US economy adding 151,000 jobs, but it was still a brutal week for stocks. The S&P 500 capped off its worst week since September.

""It's an uncertain time,"" John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, told Yahoo Finance in an interview on Wednesday. ""But gosh, we had the great financial crisis, we had COVID-19, we had the supply chain disruptions [coming out of that], and we did remarkably well.""

In other words, the stock market has remained resilient in the face of significant disruptions. And despite recent sell-off action, most strategists believe it will stay that way: Stoltzfus expects the S&P 500 to finish the year at 7,100, which implies about 25% upside based on current trading levels.

""Chaos creates opportunities,"" added Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush. ""[Buying the dip] has been our playbook for decades. The macro scares you and then you look back and say, 'Why don't I own the winners? Why don't I own the dip?'""

But the dip has escalated quickly.

The S&P (^GSPC) has swung 2% over the past seven consecutive sessions after hitting a record high on Feb. 19. According to data compiled by Yahoo Finance, this was the longest such stretch in intraday moves for the benchmark index since August 2024 — the last time economists warned of a growth scare. 

Prior to August, volatility swings of that level also showed up in March 2023, around the time of Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.

Given these moves, some Wall Street watchers have said now is the time to take advantage of lower valuations, with the resiliency picture largely still intact.

""[Tariffs] add uncertainty,"" Wedbush's Ives said. ""But in my opinion it doesn't change the demand cycle. In other words, this is not going to end the tech bull market. It's a scare. But I believe it's more opportunities than the time to head for the hills.""

Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel, who has a year-end S&P 500 price target of 6,800, added in a note to clients on Tuesday that ""stocks suffer bear markets when complacency sets in.""

""The geopolitical headlines and the urgent selling of the past week in response to fears around tariffs, Ukraine/Russia and DOGE are the opposite of complacent and at odds with earnings that project 8.2% year-over-year growth with a Fed likely to cut twice to preserve the 'soft landing,'"" he said, adding market dips ""are buying opportunities in 2025’s volatile environment.""

And although growth fears are rising, Ed Yardeni from Yardeni Research believes the economy will ""turn out to be remarkably resilient,"" citing expectations of increased consumer and capital spending, along with a potential deescalation of tariff concerns.

For now, though, ""there's a lot of bargains to be had here with this very sharp sell-off in a very short period of time."" And with Trump's track record of monitoring his popularity with stock market gains, Yardeni said it's only a matter of time before the administration steps in, regardless of what the president may say.

In recent weeks, surveys and sentiment indicators — often referred to as ""soft"" economic data — have been the root cause of investor panic, marking the return of ""bad news for the economy is bad news for stocks.""

ISM's manufacturing prices paid came in at their highest since June 2022, while new orders fell into contraction, suggesting a ""stagflationary"" environment in which growth slows but price increases remain elevated. That data arrived on top of bleak survey results for the month of February, with declining consumer confidence and sentiment results weighing on markets.

Here's the concern: Rising inflation would squeeze consumers' purchasing power and weigh on demand at a time when the consumer is already feeling the pinch of higher prices. Less demand for goods means lower sales for companies, which would pressure profit margins and eventually force businesses to cut jobs and lay off employees.

If that happens, the Federal Reserve has already indicated it would step in to stop the bleeding, hence the market's latest recalibration of future rate cuts. Following Friday's jobs report, markets continued to price in three rate cuts this year.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22business%20news%22%20site%3Afinance.yahoo.com,Trump officials want to measure the economy's health in a way that may hide DOGE cuts,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-officials-want-to-measure-the-economys-health-in-a-way-that-may-hide-doge-cuts-140044377.html,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 14:00:44 GMT","

A series of comments from Trump officials in recent days raised concerns that the administration may try to look differently at a key economic measure of America's economic health: the quarterly reading of the gross domestic product (GDP).

It's an idea under consideration, but its exact form is unclear. Elon Musk is the idea's most vocal proponent, saying that a ""more accurate measure of GDP would exclude government spending.""

At issue is that the government already publishes precisely such a figure known as the Value Added by Private Industries (VAPI). But the fact that Musk is pushing it amid his DOGE work — another Trump official has gone further by suggesting that it might be possible to pick and choose government spending — has raised questions about whether this is primarily an attempt to minimize some of the negative effects from Musk's efforts.

""It seems like a strange place to start to say, hey, we're going to have the greatest economy in the history of the globe, but we're going to have to measure it differently because you can't see it,"" Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, said in a recent episode of Yahoo Finance's Capitol Gains podcast.

""That's not a great sales job,"" he added.

The push is also curious as, overall, in spite of widespread concerns about runaway government spending, the government's piece of America's gross domestic product has actually declined somewhat as private sector increases have outpaced government growth.

The quarterly GDP and VAPI are both gathered and released by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), an agency of the Department of Commerce. The GDP reading for the first quarter of 2025 — the first release that will include Trump's time in office — is due next month.

Concerns about a slowing GDP have also been on the rise after the start of the Trump presidency saw a variety of actions — from tariffs to DOGE to an immigration crackdown — that could provide a drag on economic output.

JPMorgan Chase recently revised its first quarter GDP prediction from 1.5% to 1% in part because of the trade tensions. Goldman Sachs is lowering its GDP projection as well, reducing its forecast for growth at the end of 2025 to 1.7% from 2.2% previously.

Musk's push for the idea is based on his oft-argued point that government spending can push GDP ""artificially high"" without helping the economy.

But it comes as Musk-led downsizing of federal agencies is beginning to be felt in government data with federal government employment falling by 10,000 in February.

Further firings of federal workers and an abrupt cutoff of government spending could impact the economy in a variety of negative ways.

Trump added to the private sector focused commentary when he spoke to reporters in the Oval Office Friday following the recent jobs report and said government jobs are ""not the jobs you want.""

""We're trying to shrink government and grow the private sector,"" he added.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick oversees the BEA and recently promised to separate out the data, but he also seemed to go further and said he wanted some government data to be counted and others excluded.

""It goes like this,"" he told Fox News, ""if the government buys a tank, that's GDP, but paying 1,000 people to think about buying a tank is not GDP. That's wasted money.""

Other Trump officials, like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week, have touted an overall Trump administration effort to ""reprivatize the economy"" but without weighing in on the data one way or another.

Officials at the BEA didn't respond to questions from Yahoo Finance on exactly what Lutnick meant and how such a partial measure might be calculated, but the comments have been widely noted in economic circles.

Trump's long and fraught relationship with economic data is also a factor. Trump aides held frequent discussions in his first term about calculating annual GDP growth, looking at the potentially more flattering measure of change between the fourth quarter of one year and the fourth quarter of the following year.

At other times Trump went further and simply called economic data he didn't like fake. Then-press secretary Sean Spicer somewhat infamously said in 2017, soon after Trump's first win, that jobs numbers ""may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now.""

Left-leaning economic observers have also been outspoken in their criticisms in recent days. Lindsay Owens, director of the Groundwork Collaborative, told Yahoo Finance this week that this idea was indicative of ""the phase of the Trump administration where they start cooking the books,"" pointing out Trump's history with economic data and saying the underlying concern in her mind is a Trump administration ""worrying about recession risk.""

Plenty of economists Yahoo Finance spoke with this week also underlined that it's absolutely fine for different administrations to highlight different slices of economic data — an example from the Biden years was a heavy focus from his aides on the Black unemployment rate — if that's the path Trump chooses.

""If you want to make the case to measure things differently, sure, that makes sense,"" noted Holtz-Eakin, ""but I see no reason to take anything out or somehow not collect data we are currently collecting. That's a valuable thing that the BEA does and should not be tinkered with.""

Concerns over valuations, tariffs, and slowing economic growth triggered an ugly week for stocks.

A sell-off in the Magnificent Seven trade pushed the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) into correction territory. The index closed the week down 3.6%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) recorded its worst weekly performance since September.

But before investors hightail it, strategists told me it’s not time to panic and pile into the recession trade just yet. Rather, they see the recent sell-off as a buying opportunity, as long as investors are willing to look past uncertainty out of Washington, D.C.

“We get a correction once every 12 months, and this time, it's spurred by the tariffs,” Nancy Tengler of Tengler Investments told me. “If they're short-lived, then this is just an opportunity to buy stocks for the long term.”

And according to Tengler, technology and financials are among the two trades that stand out.

“The defensive trade is just that, a trade,"" she remarked. ""We like financials ... And the use cases for AI are exploding. This is an industrial revolution like we haven't seen for 100 years ... Use the weakness to add to your holdings.""

Valuation corrections paired with strong earnings make the group more compelling too. Market cap losses from Nvidia's (NVDA) record high in January reached $1 trillion in value during Friday's trade. Recently, the chips giant announced fourth quarter earnings that included an 82% year-over-year jump in earnings per share.

“Tariffs add uncertainty but it doesn't change the demand cycle,” Wedbush's Dan Ives told me on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. “This is not going to end the tech bull market; it's a scare, but I see more opportunity than a reason to head for the hills.”

Ives reiterated his stance that Mag Seven stocks Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) remain companies to own, along with Palantir (PLTR) and Salesforce (CRM), arguing “any weakness is a buying opportunity given the fundamental demand picture.”

Another underperforming sector drawing attention this week is financials. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) erased its post-election rally, falling nearly 13% from its recent peak as concerns around a weakening economy and sluggish dealmaking weighed on the sector.

However, strategists argue that beyond the headline worry, key catalysts for the sector remain intact: deregulation, attractive valuations, and the prospect of lower interest rates.

Truist’s Keith Lerner, who recently downgraded equities from Attractive to Neutral, maintains his ""attractive"" outlook on Financials (XLF). In a note to clients, Lerner wrote the group “should benefit from pro-growth policies, deregulation and a pickup in mergers and acquisitions.”

Citigroup’s Stuart Kaiser echoed a cautiously optimistic view and emphasized the importance of staying selective. He told me on Catalysts to exercise patience and said he sees opportunity in large-cap, high-quality stocks in the financial and tech sectors.

But unlike others, Kaiser isn’t buying into the Mag Seven names just yet, arguing positioning in those stocks remains crowded.

“Be in large, safe, high-quality stocks … Hedge and be patient,” Kaiser advised. “We still like banks … and the Nasdaq Equal Weighted Index. It gives you exposure to large-cap tech space while reducing your concentration risk in the Mag Seven.”

The Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index (^NDXE) closed the week down 3.3%.

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Everyone wants to believe pain and anguish won't show up at their doorsteps.

Bad things happen to everyone else, right?

Well, that is the WRONG way to be thinking right now when putting money to work in the markets! If you believe Trump tariffs are bluffs that won't happen (or if they do to any extent, won't be a big deal), you need to wake up and smell the sauce cooking on the wide-open gas flame.

Expect pain! Model for pain in corporate cash-flow estimates and valuations. Do downside scenario valuation analysis. Don't look at the beat-up chart of Nvidia (NVDA) on Yahoo Finance and think an imaginary support level holds in this choppy market. Anticipate Nvidia's chart getting uglier until it doesn't anymore.

Watch: Trump tariffs may drill retailers

You are getting burned because you aren't taking Trump news seriously enough and still expect an amazing year of making easy money. Regulations are going to be cut by the administration. We are getting a bitcoin reserve. Here come tax cuts. Food prices are going to suddenly tank.

None of this grandiose stuff has happened yet, and it may not at all.

The market action is telling you this will not be the case, at least in the near term.

The week began with 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. The week ended with these tariffs being put on pause until Apr. 2, likely as the stock market came under siege. New 10% tariffs on China still went into effect on top of the 10% one already in place. Trading partners are retaliating.

""This is f*cking chaos,"" one source told me by text midweek. Yep.

Corporate America is also telling you this is all chaos — the same Corporate America that powers S&P 500 (^GSPC) earnings and the stock market.

Profit warnings have mounted as cautious consumers pulled back on spending after the holidays. And execs have issued below-consensus 2025 outlooks as they plan for a barrage of costly tariffs.

Walmart's (WMT) outlook was poorly received by investors in mid-February. Rival Target (TGT) didn't have much good to say either this week when it reported fourth quarter results and guidance.

Abercrombie & Fitch's (ANF) outlook was shy of estimates; ditto Best Buy (BBY) and Macy's (M).

""I think for the toy category it's probably months,"" Hasbro (HAS) CEO Chris Cocks told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above). Cocks — in NYC for the 2025 Toy Fair, where Hasbro showed off the latest for Monopoly, Play-Doh, and Nerf — was referencing when toy prices would go up as a result of fresh tariffs.

Nearly 80% of US toys are manufactured in China, according to industry trade group the Toy Association.

Cocks said toy prices would go up 50% in some cases if more production is brought back to the US. The cost increases reflect the intricate nature of making many toys and the difficulty of finding skilled labor.

If there is any savings grace, Wall Street is waking up to the short-term reality of living in Trump 2.0 — and that may make earnings warnings less shocking should they continue.

Listen: Trump tariffs may trigger stagflationary shock

During the months of January and February, analysts lowered EPS estimates by a larger margin than average. The first quarter bottom-up EPS estimate for the S&P 500 decreased by 3.5% from December 31 to February 27, according to data from FactSet.

FactSet said the drop in the bottom-up EPS estimate recorded during the first two months of the first quarter was larger than the five-year average, the 10-year average, the 15-year average, and the 20-year average.

""We remain wary of committing significant funds to the market until the wishy-washy tariff policy of the United States has a clear path forward. And even then, a trade war is not good for the economy, earnings or stock prices,"" said Birinyi Associates strategist Jeffrey Rubin.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22business%20news%22%20site%3Afinance.yahoo.com,Medicaid goes by many names. Will Americans realize if it gets cut?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medicaid-goes-by-many-names-will-americans-realize-if-it-gets-cut-100005873.html,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 17:07:39 GMT","

Apple Health, KanCare, ARHOME, Med-QUEST, and Medi-Cal: What do these have in common?

They're all Medicaid programs.

States, which administer Medicaid after receiving federal funds, often change the name of the program, sometimes even branding it to reflect state pride, such as Husky Health in Connecticut or SoonerCare in Oklahoma. They also change the name of the federally funded CHIP healthcare program for children, at times with cutesy names like PeachCare for Kids in Georgia and CubCare in Maine.

Some Medicaid programs even have a private insurer's name attached to it because many states farm out contracts to managed care organizations, or MCOs, to administer the programs.

Those changes, though, can cause confusion. A pair of recent studies noted that state-specific names and MCO plan designs can prevent people from realizing they are receiving a public benefit.

That disconnect adds to the larger confusion over Medicaid itself, who it covers, and why. It simply isn't a poor people's program, a stigma that motivates states to change the name in the first place. It covers our children, grandparents, and Americans with disabilities.

As cuts to government healthcare programs become a real possibility, experts say it's crucial for Americans to understand the scope and necessity of the Medicaid program.

""It's one of those situations where our best intentions can backfire,"" said Jessica Calarco, a sociologist and professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

""When we change the way these programs operate, when we refuse to use words like welfare, it makes it more difficult for people to understand who is and who isn't benefiting from these programs and to see the benefits that they themselves are getting as well.""

While Medicaid is a joint federal-state program, ""states administer Medicaid programs fairly independently,"" Melissa Hafner, a health policy researcher at the American Institutes for Research, told Yahoo Finance.

Certain groups must be eligible for the program, and specific core benefits must be included under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, which established Medicaid.

""But beyond that, states have a lot of flexibility in the scope of their Medicaid program,"" she said.

That includes who's eligible, what services enrollees can receive, what states will pay for Medicaid services, and how states pay — either directly to healthcare providers or through MCOs, which are often private health insurers.

The federal government provides a portion of the funding to a state’s Medicaid program. States with higher rates of poverty receive a higher federal match.

Nationally, 1 in 5 people are on Medicaid, according to KFF. That includes nearly 2 in 5 children, 1 in 6 adults, over 1 in 4 adults with disabilities, almost 1 in 2 children with special healthcare needs, and 5 in 8 nursing home residents.

In fact, Medicaid is the only federal program that offers Americans long-term care insurance. Medicare does not, and the need for this type of care is only becoming more acute as the baby boomers age and can no longer care for themselves.

Medicaid also covers 41% of all births in the US, 29% of non-elderly adults with mental illness, and 40% of non-elderly adults with HIV. One in 5 people on Medicare also receive extra coverage from Medicaid.

And yes, it covers our most financially vulnerable Americans — over 8 in 10 children in poverty, and almost half of adults in poverty are on Medicaid.

""This is likely something that helps someone you know or love actually make ends meet,"" said Lauren Rivera, a sociology professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University who started a discussion over Medicaid names on social media. ""I would say that every person in this country — if they're not already receiving Medicaid — is one step away from needing it.""

Most experts I spoke to think the reason many states drop the ""Medicaid"" from their program names is to reduce a stigma and encourage more people who are eligible for the assistance to sign up. While surveys show high support for Medicaid funding overall, enrolling in the program itself on a personal level can bring up mixed feelings.

Consider this account from Calarco, who interviewed 250 women from pregnancy through their first couple of years postpartum for her recent book ""Holding it Together: How Women Became America’s Safety Net.""

One mother, Erin, and her husband were struggling to afford childcare, both working split shifts to watch their children. Exhausted by that arrangement, Erin dropped out of the workforce to stay at home with their kids, but the couple was going broke trying to afford health insurance at the same time. When Medicaid was expanded in her state, Erin was reluctant to sign up.

""She felt like 'it's not for people like us,'"" Calarco recounted, saying that they weren't poor enough to need it.

There's also an othering factor around Medicaid, said Rivera. It's a program for this group or that group, one ""that is different from me. Attempts to rename the programs try to make them more friendly, more appealing, more palatable.""

Signing up for TennCare or Healthy Connections in South Carolina may not sting as much, and that's exactly the point. The drawback, according to a 2024 study, is the effort ""may muddle understanding of the program as a government-provided benefit.""

""The inner workings of how programs like Medicaid are funded is far too complex for the average person to understand,"" Calarco said. ""It's hard for people to parse out that when we talk about your state Medicaid program, that's connected to and deeply dependent on federal Medicaid funding.""

There's a similar concern for the 75% of Medicaid enrollees who sign up for a plan managed by an MCO.

For example in Georgia, those eligible for Medicaid register for the Georgia Families program, which then provides members a choice of three health plans managed by an MCO for adults. The three health plans are provided by Amerigroup Community Care, CareSource, or Peach State Health Plan. Absent from these plan names? Medicaid.

Another study published in 2018 found that Medicaid recipients are less likely to self-report that they are on the program when MCO plans are designed to obscure government involvement. Enrollees are less able to recognize how they personally benefit from Medicaid, the study found, making it more difficult for them ""to engage in the civic sphere as informed advocates for their self-interest.""

And that there is the rub.

Senate lawmakers are set later this month to vote on which parts of the government should be slashed to reach the $880 billion in spending reductions the House GOP advanced in its budget resolution last week.

The resolution itself didn't state those cuts must come from Medicaid, but the reductions must come from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the program and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

""When it comes to mobilizing for this much-needed part of our social safety net, it complicates things if people don't necessarily know that they're on it,"" Rivera said. “It is really important for people to have a clear understanding that programs like Medicaid are essential for a functioning society.""

No matter what it's called.

The US wants to get its hands on critical minerals — whether through a deal (now in limbo) with Ukraine or domestic production.

On Tuesday President Donald Trump teased efforts to produce more critical minerals required for everything from semiconductors to aerospace and defense.

""Later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA,"" Trump said on Tuesday during his speech in front of Congress.

Industry watchers point to more than 50 critical minerals identified by the US Geological Survey needed for nearly every type of modern technology, with a subset of those referred to as ""rare earth"" minerals — essential for magnets that go into everything from consumer electronics to EVs and even electrical grids and defense hardware.

""The entire power generation system in the United States and the expansion that is required for AI and data center buildout is extremely dependent on critical minerals,"" said Akshay Dubey, CEO of CVW CleanTech, which has developed a technology for the production of critical minerals, including titanium and rare earths, from oil sands waste.

While the US produces significant amounts of aluminum, zinc, and magnesium, other critical minerals like cobalt, nickel, and graphite are imported from abroad. China accounts for roughly 60% of global reserves and 85% of processing capacity and has been aggressively investing in critical minerals projects for the past 20 years.

In a retaliatory move against the Trump administration's recent tariffs on China, Beijing tightened controls over the exports of critical minerals.

""The Chinese understood very early that critical minerals, including rare earths, are going to be the building blocks for most advanced manufacturing going forward,"" said Pini Althaus, mining executive and founding partner of Cove Capital. ""The US is almost 100% reliant on China on critical minerals.""

In recent years, the US has increasingly focused on developing its own critical mineral access, with the Biden administration launching a review of US critical mineral supply chain vulnerabilities. That led to incentives offered in the Inflation Reduction Act to encourage domestic production.

Getting to domestic minerals is a challenge. It can take, on average, more than 15 years to turn a deposit into an operating mine where extractions are taking place. Dubey cites lengthy permitting processes as one of the main challenges.

""The frustration for industry and the challenge for industry has been no clear path to permitting,"" said Dubey.

""If you're sitting as a CEO of one of these [mining] companies and you have to make a decision of whether to start investing the capital, you don't want to be in the situation where halfway through construction you have a new administration come in and they challenge the permits,"" said Dubey.

Any announcement this week by Trump would come on the heels of a minerals deal with Ukraine that went sideways last Friday when a meeting between President Trump and Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, turned into a shouting match. The US wants to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.

On Tuesday in front of Congress, Trump said he received a letter from Zelensky saying Ukraine is ""ready to sign"" the minerals agreement.

Ukraine is estimated to hold roughly 5% of the world's critical mineral reserves, according to the UN.

The country's main critical minerals include graphite used in batteries, lithium commonly used for rechargeable batteries, titanium inside aircraft and weaponry, and uranium necessary for nuclear reactors. Ukraine is also the world’s fifth-largest producer of gallium, which is commonly found inside semiconductors.

In the agreement as it stood last Friday, the US would receive 50% of all future revenues from Ukraine's minerals, hydrocarbons, oil and gas, and other extractable materials.

Getting to all the minerals, though, may be a challenge. For example, a primary lithium resource is located in Donetsk, a region occupied by Russia.

Additionally, the extraction of rare earth minerals in Ukraine appears to be in the very early stages of development. Althaus said that it would take significant time and investment to see if the quantities available justify the costs of the extraction process.

While a deal involving Ukraine's critical minerals would be viewed as a big step, industry watchers are in a wait-and-see mode.

""This would weaken China’s monopoly over rare earths, but it would be a stretch to say that this would entirely offset China’s control,"" said Mark Temnycky, nonresident fellow at the think tank Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center.

""It would be a start to America’s involvement in the rare earths race, however,"" he added.

 “Not that long ago, even the idea of BTC Reserve held and supported by a federal government was a revolutionary idea,” a blockchain regulatory expert told Cointelegraph. 

The widespread disappointment surrounding the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — hailed as a historic step for Bitcoin adoption — suggests unrealistic investor expectations, according to regulatory experts.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 7, which will utilize Bitcoin (BTC) seized in government criminal cases rather than purchasing the asset directly from the market. The announcement triggered a more than 6% drop in Bitcoin’s price, falling from $90,400 to $84,979, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro data.

The reaction signals unrealistic industry expectations, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of Fideum, a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.

“It was very clear that the US government could utilize the existing BTC in their possession, aka seized funds,” she told Cointelegraph, adding:

The Bitcoin reserve is a “cautious” approach with taxpayer funds, which “make this decision well aligned with the messaging from this administration,” added the regulatory expert.

Although the current plan does not involve government Bitcoin purchases, the order does not rule them out in the future. The order authorizes the US Treasury and Commerce secretaries to develop “budget-neutral strategies” to buy more Bitcoin for the reserve, provided there are no additional costs to taxpayers.

Still, the short-term investor disappointment paired with ongoing macroeconomic concerns related to import tariffs may push Bitcoin to a weekly close below $82,000, risking more downside volatility, analysts told Cointelegraph.

Trump signed the historic Bitcoin reserve order a day ahead of hosting the first White House Crypto Summit, which also received mixed reactions from the crypto community.

Despite its divided reception, the summit marks a pivotal moment for the White House’s engagement with the crypto industry, according to Alexander Urbelis, general counsel and chief information security officer at Ethereum Name Service.

Urbelis told Cointelegraph:

“There are high hopes for the outcome of the Crypto Summit. One of those hopes is that engagement like this with the White House will continue long after the initial meeting,” he added.

 Bitcoin bears are stopping at nothing to seal some last-minute BTC price downside into the weekly close — but how much? 

Bitcoin (BTC) still risks a crash to $75,000 as BTC price weakness accelerates into the weekly close.

How low can BTC price action go before finding a bottom? Popular market participants weigh in as data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC/USD down over 3% on March 9.

Exchange order books are forming an area of intense interest among Bitcoin traders as the weekly candle close nears.

Liquidation levels on either side of the spot price look ripe for the taking, with longs already paying as BTC/USD sags to $83,000.

“Liquidation map says: Whales hunting stops!” popular trader TheKingfisher wrote in a warning to X followers on the day.

Data from monitoring resource CoinGlass currently puts aggregate 24-hour crypto liquidations at over $300 million.

The thickest bid liquidity across exchanges stood at just below $83,000 at the time of writing, with the spot price dangerously close to breaking lower.

Could February’s multimonth lows of $78,000 be just the start?

A bearish BTC price take suggests that the market is not done retesting levels not seen since November last year.

For popular trader Mikybull Crypto, there is a clear chance that Bitcoin will retest its 50-week simple moving average (SMA).

“$BTC likely heading for the MA support for a potential local bottom,” he predicted.

BTC/USD last interacted with the 50-week SMA in September but has avoided a weekly candle close below it since March 2023.

The 200-day SMA, meanwhile, is also back on the radar as price challenges it as support for the first time since October.

As Cointelegraph reported last week, a historically accurate BTC price mechanism suggests that the real floor now lies at around $69,000.

 The new SEC leadership has an opportunity to set a positive precedent for crypto regulation by providing clear guidelines for DePIN projects. 

Opinion by: Kai Wawrzinek, co-founder of Impossible Cloud Network

It seemed like the punitive US Securities Exchange Commission crypto enforcement era was over, but former Chair Gary Gensler left us some truffles to unearth. Even after his departure, Gensler’s “regulation by enforcement” approach continues reverberating.

We may be living under the first pro-crypto administration in US history, but there’s still a mountain of work to be done in clearing up the mess that’s been created by opaque, contradictory or absent regulations. One crypto sector, in particular, needs clarity on how it’s meant to operate without incurring the wrath of regulators: decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN).

DePIN projects, from decentralized cloud services to telecommunications and shared sensor grids, rely on real-world deployments and robust tokenomics. When regulators fail to articulate how these tokens and their governance structures should be categorized, projects are left guessing — and, occasionally, end up in court.

While most crypto sectors are wholly digital and never intersect with the physical world, DePIN differs. The clue is in the “physical” in DePIN. One of the most well-known DePIN projects incentivizes users to deploy wireless hotspots that create a decentralized Internet of Things network. Other DePIN projects include building decentralized cloud services, crowdsourcing environmental data, decentralized energy grids and more.

This intersection of blockchain, hardware and real-world services presents a unique set of regulatory challenges that require tailored solutions — solutions that are nowhere to be found in the SEC’s current approach. The unique interplay between the physical and digital worlds demands a regulatory framework that is both clear and forward-looking. Companies are left guessing at what constitutes compliance without clear rules governing token issuance, data privacy and infrastructure deployment.

This regulatory haze hampers investment and risks stunting the technological innovation that DePIN promises. Regulatory agencies must prioritize clear and transparent guidelines for crypto — with some real consideration given to DePIN. If we have explicit rules in place, DePIN startups will be free to build innovative infrastructure that solves critical, real-world problems, rather than frittering away resources on lawyers and litigation.

Recent: Crypto VCs are ‘especially bullish’ on DePIN, RWAs

Some will argue that operating in an industry with few rules is better than one burdened by too many. Yet history shows us that well-crafted regulation often paves the way for sustained growth, just as building codes enable skyscrapers to reach impressive heights while respecting the history and provenance of the cities they are located in. Thoughtful regulation doesn’t quash creativity. It anchors it and provides a stable foundation upon which original ideas can flourish.

As for how to regulate a crypto vertical that is evolving fast and spans multiple industries, from AI to telecommunications, there are three primary areas where greater clarity would benefit all participants.

Securities vs. utility: Clear rules around DePIN tokens’ issuance, distribution and utilization are vital. This clarity will protect investors and allow for predictable planning and scaling. Without it, projects are forced to tiptoe around vague guidelines, channeling their resources toward legal compliance instead of innovation.

Data privacy: DePIN platforms gather and process real-world data, from location signals to environmental information. Failing to address privacy concerns through well-defined laws risks a regulatory backlash and a loss of consumer trust. A forward-looking regulatory framework should detail how data can be collected, stored and monetized, and it should balance user privacy with the operational needs of these networks.

Global infrastructure deployment: Many DePIN solutions physically deploy devices or networks that cross national and regional borders and compliance regimes. A patchwork of state, federal and international rules can stifle the very essence of DePIN’s global promise. Policymakers must align these frameworks so that hardware deployment, spectrum usage and other logistical considerations don’t transform into prohibitively complex legal labyrinths.

While the primary beneficiaries of more precise guidelines will be DePIN projects, it will also help regulators — at least in their public image. The receipts are public when it comes to how much the SEC has made in fines by penalizing crypto projects retrospectively. This has, however, led to a mass exodus of the industry from the US. The new SEC leadership has a unique opportunity to set a precedent through sensible crypto regulation emphasizing guidance over punishment.

A long to-do list awaits the SEC chair, both for crypto and the broader financial markets Realistically, DePIN will not be at the top of that list. Yet, this remains the perfect time for the SEC to demonstrate how it intends to treat innovative industries like DePIN. This crypto enclave has clearly defined user groups, precise work being done and easily measurable outcomes. 

If the new SEC regime wants to signal to the crypto industry the treatment it can expect over the next four years, it could do much worse than start with DePIN.

DePIN is more than just another crypto trend. It’s a gateway to bridging our digital and physical worlds in ways we’re only beginning to envision. With thoughtful, proactive regulation, DePIN can fulfill its immense potential: solving vital, real-world infrastructure challenges that, with precise regulation, break no rules and improve our everyday lives.

""The Voyagers have been deep space rock stars since launch, and we want to keep it that way as long as possible!""

NASA engineers are turning off two instruments to ensure that the twin spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, can continue exploring space beyond the limits of the solar system.

To save energy for further interstellar exploration, mission engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) deactivated Voyager 1's cosmic ray subsystem experiment on Feb. 25. On March 24, they will shut down the low-energy charged particle instrument onboard Voyager 2.

Launched in 1977 and carrying the same suite of ten instruments, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 reached interstellar space in 2012 and 2018, respectively. It is little wonder that Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are operating on dwindling power supplies. After all, the two spacecraft have traveled a combined 29 billion miles to become the farthest human-built objects from Earth.

""The Voyagers have been deep space rock stars since launch, and we want to keep it that way as long as possible,"" Voyager project manager at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Suzanne Dodd said in a statement. ""But electrical power is running low. If we don’t turn off an instrument on each Voyager now, they would probably have only a few more months!""

Both Voyager spacecraft have a power system based on generating electricity from the heat emitted by the decay of a radioactive isotope of plutonium.

This radioisotopic power system loses around 4 watts of power from Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 each year. In the 1980s, several instruments aboard both spacecraft were turned off. This was because the Voyager twins had both completed their investigation of the solar system's giant planets, which boosted the longevity of both probes.

To conserve this power, NASA operators turned off Voyager 2's plasma science experiment in October 2024. The experiment aimed to measure how much plasma flows past it and in what direction. The Voyager 2 instrument had been collecting limited data in the years before its shutdown due to its orientation of Voyager 2 in relation to the flow of plasma beyond the solar system.

Voyager 1's own plasma science instrument stopped working correctly in 1980 and was turned off in 2007 to preserve power.



Most recently, NASA shut off Voyager 1's cosmic ray subsystem at the end of February. The data from the suite of three telescopes designed to study cosmic rays was integral in the Voyager science team's determination that Voyager 1 had exited the heliosphere, the sun's sphere of influence at the edge of the solar system.

Shutting down at the end of March is Voyager 2’s low-energy charged particle instrument, the role of which is to measure the various ions, electrons, and cosmic rays originating from the solar system and our galaxy.

""The Voyager spacecraft have far surpassed their original mission to study the outer planets,"" Voyager program scientist Patrick Koehn said. ""Every bit of additional data we have gathered since then is not only valuable bonus science for heliophysics, but also a testament to the exemplary engineering that has gone into the Voyagers — starting nearly 50 years ago and continuing to this day.""

The fact that the Voyager spacecraft are the only two human-made objects to make it to interstellar space means that the data they collect is unique. Thus, the decision to switch off any instruments on either Voyager 1 or Voyager 2 isn't taken lightly. Shutting down these two instruments should grant both spacecraft another year of exploration before more instruments have to be turned off.

Both spacecraft have three operational instruments, dropping to two in 2026. It is hoped that Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 will carry one operational instrument into the 2030s. Unforeseen circumstances could arise and change these plans, though.

""Every minute of every day, the Voyagers explore a region where no spacecraft has gone before,"" Voyager project scientist at JPL Linda Spilker said. ""That also means every day could be our last. But that day could also bring another interstellar revelation. ""So, we’re pulling out all the stops, doing what we can to make sure Voyagers 1 and 2 continue their trailblazing for the maximum time possible.""

Stories of vast graveyards where elephants go to die only scratch the surface of the fascinating death-related behaviors in these mammals.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.


According to legend, when an elephant knows it's nearing the end of its days, it will return to a specific place to die among the remains of its kin, and over time, these remains will form ""elephant graveyards"" that tower with tusks and skulls.

The idea is so powerful that it has made its way into popular culture, such as in Disney's ""The Lion King,"" where haunting images of an elephant cemetery seared themselves onto the minds of a generation of children. Such graveyards hint at the tantalizing prospect that elephants might understand and anticipate their own mortality. But do these places really exist, and do elephants know when they are about to die?

In Africa and elsewhere, there are rare instances when a large number of elephant carcasses are found in a relatively confined area, said Leanne Proops, an associate professor of animal behavior and welfare at the University of Portsmouth whose research looks at death-related behaviors in animals. But in these occasional cases, the pile of carcasses has been linked to drought, large-scale poaching, geological forces or toxic algal blooms in water holes, which have been found to poison hundreds of elephants in one go.

What researchers have been unable to show is that these graveyards form because elephants intentionally traveled there to die, Proops told Live Science. ""I can see where that myth or idea could have come into popular culture,"" she said, but that's exactly what it is: a myth, she said.

Akashdeep Roy, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, agreed. ""I'd be very cautious about using the term 'graveyard,'"" he said. ""The idea of a graveyard that persists is largely a myth fueled by locals and hunters.""

Related: Do elephants really 'never forget'?

That doesn't mean elephants have no understanding or emotional experience of death. In fact, Roy's own research opens up another angle on that question, with the possibility that elephants bury their kin. In a 2024 study, Roy and colleagues documented five cases in India's North Bengal region where baby Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) had been found almost completely buried in muddy drainage ditches at separate sites on tea estates, with only their legs protruding from the soil.

Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The burials seemed strategic, according to Roy. The trench environment would have enabled the adult elephants to place the infants into the ditch and then scoop earth over their bodies. ""The elephants buried the carcasses physically without using any tools,"" Roy said. ""I am as confident as an elephant is in locating water sources and paddy fields. There were elephant footprints all [around] the carcass, and … it's not very difficult for elephants to level the soil over a trench.""

Locals in North Bengal and neighboring Assam have found several other burial sites beyond the five Roy and colleagues documented in their paper, and village elders accept elephant burials as established knowledge, he noted. Similar scenarios have been observed in African elephants (Loxodonta), in which dead elephants have been found covered in branches and leaves.

Proops said there could be other explanations for why the calves ended up buried and cautioned that without firsthand observation of the elephants doing so, we can't be sure the burials were intentional.

""I guess the reason we're interested in it is because we want to know whether this shows they understand death,"" Proops said. ""It's very hard to interpret, particularly when it is a rare event. For me, I don't think we can really confirm whether it's a burial, in the sense that it has this sort of cognitive meaning to it.""



While questions may linger around this facet of elephant behavior, they show several other intriguing death-related practices. Asian elephants have been observed carrying dead infants for hours or days and are known to stand vigil around the bodies of deceased herd members. Studies also document elephants showing signs of distress when dealing with dead or dying elephants; in Roy's research, the elephants associated with the burials were recorded trumpeting for almost an hour when they were in the area.

""We felt that [they were mourning], but it's always difficult to anthropomorphize such behavior in a natural science journal,"" Roy said. ""Hindu people in India revere elephants as living gods — Shiva and Ganesha — and value elephant subjectivity.""

Related: Do animals grieve?

Scientists have also documented several cases in which elephants have turned up at the site of a carcass and interacted with it, curiously touching and sniffing its bones. In fact, this research showed that African elephants that were presented with the bones of several species showed more interest in the skulls and tusks of other elephants of their own species. The finding suggests that they recognize their own species in death, and that judging by the physical signs of excitement the elephants showed in the presence of the bones, that these remains elicit an emotional response, the study authors suggest.

—Do animals have friends?

—How many animals have ever existed on Earth?

—Do elephant tusks or rhino horns ever grow back?

This idea is especially tantalizing because it seems to echo the kind of reflection that humans would show in a graveyard, ""a place where the dead reside, and where we actually go out of our way to visit them as well,"" Proops said. However, the evidence for that conclusion comes up short; in general, the research shows that elephants don't make intentional pilgrimages to commune with these carcasses. Cases where elephants do encounter dead kin seem to occur when they randomly stumble upon a pile of bones; there is no evidence of planned behavior.

""What we really need is GPS data, where we look at normal patterns of movements in the elephants and we see them obviously deviating from those normal routes to go and visit a particular carcass,"" Proops said.

The truth is that we don't know if elephants understand that they're going to die one day. ""There really is no strong evidence that other species do understand that,"" Proops said.

Alabama's 93-91 overtime win over Auburn did not knock the Tigers out of their position as the overall No. 1 seed in the Bracketology updated NCAA Tournament bracket projection, but it did keep the Crimson Tide in the hunt for the fourth No. 1 seed.

Auburn and Duke are locks for the top line and it would take a bad loss of some sort to jeopardize Houston's place, but the Cougars should be in good shape.

The fourth No. 1 spot will come down to four teams: Florida, Tennessee and Alabama from the SEC and Michigan State. I believe that if one of the three SEC teams wins the conference tournament, that team will be the fourth No. 1 seed. If none of them win it, that opens the door for the Spartans to make a run at the top line.

Michigan State currently has 11 Quad 1 wins, tied with Alabama for second behind Auburn's 16. The Spartans would have to win the Big Ten Tournament, of course, and it would help to get the best teams they can play along the way. That could give Michigan State as many as 14 Quad 1 wins, the vast majority of which would be against NCAA Tournament teams. Certainly, the Spartans would get serious consideration for a No. 1 seed by the selection committee.

  

Check out Palm's bracket and full field of 68 at the Bracketology hub.   

Ohio State fell off the bottom of the bracket following a loss at Indiana in the regular season finale and are now just 17-14. The Buckeyes, the first team out as of Sunday, are likely at a place where it would take two wins in the Big Ten Tournament to end up with a good enough record to get selected.

Only two teams have been selected as an at-large team that were fewer than four games above .500. In 2001, Georgia played a schedule that would have had 27 of its 30 games in Quads 1 and 2 if the term ""quadrant"" was used by the committee back then. There have always been four groups of games on teams' tournament profiles, but they weren't called quadrants until the home-road-neutral component was added. Michigan got a berth in 2022 at 17-14, but only had three Quad 4 games. 

Ohio State has six wins vs. Quad 4, which puts it three games below .500 against the top three quadrants. No team with that mark has gotten an at-large bid, although the committee does not look at that number specifically. It makes sense that a team with a profile like that would always fall short.

HOUSTON -- Conner Weigman had to cut out the Frenchy's Chicken. It might be a Houston staple, but Weigman is trying to feel athletic this spring. He's down 10 pounds since transferring to Houston from Texas A&M, an effort to recapture the speed he had before suffering a foot fracture in 2023. 

Houston is home for Weigman. He grew up 40 minutes from the Cougars' campus and would go with his dad to watch Case Keenum break record after record at Robertson Stadium. 

There's a comfort in coming home. It's where the former five-star recruit and one-time next Aggies superstar to remind people that he's, well, still him after losing his starting job to Marcel Reed at Texas A&M. 

""I'm just getting back to the way I know I can play,"" Weigman said. ""That top quarterback in the class. I'm going to prove it this year."" 

To understand what went sideways for Weigman in College Station, you must understand the full extent of his injuries. 

Weigman is matter of fact about his injury. It happened in Week 4. Weigman, a sophomore, began the 2023 season averaging 300 yards a game and completing 70.5% of his passes. He had the fourth-highest PFF grade in the country through three games. 

Then his foot got stuck in the ground as he was hit by an Auburn defender. His talus bone broke in nine places and needed screws to piece it back together.

The injury cost him the rest of the year as the Aggies stumbled to a 7-6 record, resulting in Jimbo Fisher's firing late in the season. 

""Saturdays were the worst,"" Weigman said. ""I love being out with my guys. I just love it. Not being out there was tough."" 

That feeling influenced how Weigman handled his next injury. 

It took only three quarters for bad injury luck to strike again the next season. Weigman, who won the starting job under new coach Mike Elko, ran on the goal line against Notre Dame in a season-opening top 25-showdown. He got popped on his right throwing shoulder, injuring his AC joint. 

The Aggies' new coaching staff wanted Weigman to rest and recover ahead of SEC play, but he'd already sat for a whole year and was well aware of how the fan base criticized his performance (12 for 30, 100 yards, 2 INTs) against the Fighting Irish. 

Weigman wouldn't -- couldn't -- sit again. 

He took a Toradol shot that week to numb the pain, but throwing mechanics are a delicate thing. Weigman had to overcompensate for his injured shoulder, so he put extra pressure on his bicep. He had to exit at halftime against McNeese State because of a strain.  

Weigman didn't throw for three weeks after that. He needed a steroid shot in his shoulder just to get movement back. He returned a month later against Missouri and gritted out arguably the second-best performance of his career (18 for 22, 276 yards against a top-10 team). The rest of the season would be just a series of Toradol shots to stay available. 

Ultimately, his throwing mechanics out of whack, Weigman found himself benched in favor Reed. 

Reed then took the status Weigman had held for three years: the future of Texas A&M football. 

Weigman, who's still working to get his shoulder back to 100%, opted to enter the transfer portal at the end of the season in hopes of reminding people he's still the same player who ranked as the No. 3 overall QB in the 2022 class, just behind current superstars Drew Allar (Penn State) and Cade Klubnik (Clemson) 

Syracuse wanted him in the portal. Weigman knew Orange associate head coach Elijah Robinson, who was Texas A&M's interim head coach in 2023. But New York felt far from home for a Texan. 

Houston, though? That could work.  

It helped the Weigman family had some insight into Cougars coach Willie Fritz, who had coached Weigman's dad, Chad, at Sam Houston in 1991. 

Said the now 64-year-old Fritz of Chad Weigman: ""He was just a really nice young man. Obviously, he's a bit older now."" 

That connection bred comfort, as did the presence of Houston QB coach Shawn Bell, who began recruiting Weigman as a member of Baylor's staff when Weigman was in ninth grade. 

Weigman only needed one visit -- an unofficial visit at that -- to shut down his process. He met with Bell for four hours, discussing what Bell wanted in a quarterback and how Weigman wanted to be coached. Weigman loved that Bell, a former Baylor signal-caller, understood everything that goes into playing the position. 

""I was ecstatic when I walked out the building,"" Weigman said. 

When thinking back on his time at Texas A&M -- 13 starts over three seasons that included top-25 wins, injuries and a benching – Weigman learned that difference between elite production and fan scorn is small. A tweak in mechanics to compensate for an injury can be the difference between shredding Missouri and being benched against LSU two weeks later. 

""It's minute,"" Weigman said. ""Millimeters."" 

Back home in Houston, Weigman hopes to show people how different his career can be with slightly different circumstances. It's why he's cut down 10 pounds. It's why he chose a program that went 4-8 last season over a flashier fit. He knows people are doubting him. He knows his five-star status may seem like a decade ago. But one healthy season can change perception in an instant.

""He's been through it as far as complex offenses and playing complex defenses,"" Fritz said. ""He just needs to be healthy.""

When I wrote last Sunday that Auburn could lose its final two regular-season games and still be projected as the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, I didn't actually expect Auburn to lose its final two regular-season games.

But now look!

The Tigers backed Tuesday's 83-72 loss at Texas A&M with Saturday's 93-91 overtime loss to Alabama at home, which means Bruce Pearl's team will take a two-game losing streak into the SEC Tournament. That's not ideal. True to my word, though, I kept Auburn No. 1 in Sunday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings for what is the 60th consecutive day.

But why, Parrish?

I know some of you are asking that question right now -- so let me answer it directly. As I've explained many times, Auburn spent November, December, January and February building a body of work so superior to the rest of the sport that we reached a point where the Tigers could literally lose their final two regular-season games and still have college basketball's best resume, which is what they did and what they still have. Auburn is now 27-4 overall with a 16-4 mark in Quadrant 1. That gives the Tigers at least five more Q1 wins than everybody else and zero losses to anybody ranked outside of the top 20 of the NET.

If you prefer Duke to Auburn, just know that Duke has nine fewer Q1 wins and one more loss to a team ranked outside of the top 20 of the NET. If you prefer Houston to Auburn, just know that Houston has six fewer Q1 wins and one more loss to a team ranked outside of the top 20 of the NET. If you prefer Florida to Auburn, just know that Florida has seven fewer Q1 wins and two more losses to teams ranked outside of the top 20 of the NET.

Do I need to keep going?

Now, if you'll allow me to backpedal a bit, consistent readers of this space might know that I've written multiple times recently that Auburn is a lock to be the No. 1 overall seed on Selection Sunday -- and I still believe that's what the Tigers will be. I'd bet significantly on it. But, in the spirit of transparency, I'm no longer certain the Tigers could lose their first game in the SEC Tournament and hold on to the No. 1 overall seed if Duke or Houston win-out.

Is it possible? Yes, it's possible.

But I'm no longer certain it's certain.

Either way, no matter how you chop it up, the data still supports Auburn as the team with the sport's best body of work. A week from today, we'll find out for sure whether the Tigers were able to hold on to it. But, for now, in my mind, they still have it.

(PS: You might notice below that there's no movement in the top eight of the Top 25 And 1. This might go without saying, but that's because nothing that happened Saturday, good or bad, compelled me to change the order of the top eight. Before you ask, yes, I'm obviously aware of all of the results. I just don't think any of the results should change the order of the top eight.)

The Los Angeles Lakers entered Saturday's marquee battle with the Boston Celtics riding an eight-game winning streak, but they walked away having lost more than just the game. With 6:44 remaining in the fourth quarter, LeBron James exited the game while the Lakers made progress on their attempted 22-point comeback, but he did not return. He was ruled out for the game with a left groin strain, and now, according to ESPN, he is expected to miss at least the next one to two weeks. He will be re-evaluated in 24 hours when the injury calms down.

James took an optimistic tone when asked about his level of concern in his postgame media availability. ""Not much concern,"" he said after the game. ""Obviously I'm day-to-day. I'll look at it each day and see if it gets better. We'll take the proper measures to see what we need to do moving forward."" If James can indeed return in a week or two, that should be treated as a win for the Lakers given how much more destructive a worse strain could have been.

The injury came as James drove to the basket against Jaylen Brown. He attempted a spin move and followed that up with two head fakes, eventually converting the layup. James had a slight limp after the score, but attempted to play defense on the next possession.

This is the play that LeBron seemed to be injured on. He left after the next possession Based on the overstretch on the pivot I’m worried about his left adductor (groin) pic.twitter.com/p7fG0Twr10

On the ensuing trip down the floor, Brown drove for a quick layup and James visibly pointed to the bench to ask to be removed from the game.

""The last score I had on Jaylen Brown, probably extended it a little bit too much,"" James said after the game. ""A couple pivots and then when I landed I felt it.""

Groin strains can be tricky injuries. James, notably, suffered a tear in his left groin on Christmas of 2018 in a game against the Golden State Warriors which wound up derailing his season, but he said that one felt much worse than the one on Saturday night. In November of 2022, he exited a game against the Los Angeles Clippers with another groin injury, and he ultimately missed five games as he recovered. The severity of the strain will go a long way in determining how much time this injury potentially costs James.

The Lakers have thrived lately, and while the Luka Dončić acquisition has been a significant part of that, James has been the team's catalyst. The Lakers had gone 18-3 in their previous 21 games entering Saturday, and James averaged 27.4 points, 9.4 rebounds and 7.9 assists in that span on very strong efficiency while playing excellent defense. Now the Lakers will have to adjust to life without him for the time being.

Tennessee State's Eddie George has agreed to become Bowling Green's next head coach, sources confirmed to CBS Sports/247Sports' Matt Zenitz. This will be George's first coaching opportunity at the FBS level after four years at Tennessee State.

George is set to replace former Bowling Green coach Scot Loeffler, who recently left to become the quarterbacks coach with the Philadelphia Eagles. Loeffler posted a 27-41 overall record in six seasons at Bowling Green and led the program to three straight bowl appearances from 2022-24. 

George just finished his fourth season at Tennessee State, leading the Tigers to a career-best 9-4 record capped by a Big South-Ohio Valley Conference co-championship and an appearance in the FCS playoffs. Tennessee State has upped its win total each year since 2022 under George. 

George had a losing record in his first two years with the program, but Tennessee State improved to 6-5 in 2023. Fifteen of George's 24 career wins as a coach have come in the last two seasons, including six of 13 conference victories. 

Tennessee State gave George his first career coaching appointment in 2021. Prior to that, he was a legendary running back at Ohio State and with the Tennessee Titans in the NFL. A member of the 2011 College Football Hall of Fame, George rushed for 3,768 yards and 44 touchdowns with the Buckeyes. 

In 1995, George won the Heisman Trophy and several other awards, including the Doak Walker Award and the Maxwell Award. He was selected by the Titans -- then the Houston Oilers -- with the 14th overall pick in the 1996 NFL Draft. George was a four-time Pro Bowl and a two-time All-Pro during his eight-year NFL career.

Anthony Davis is in a rare and nearly impossible position. If almost any team acquired him, he would arrive in his new city with extreme fanfare. The New Orleans Pelicans treated him as a savior. To the Los Angeles Lakers, he and LeBron James represented a once-great franchise's return to glory. But Davis no longer plays for the Pelicans or the Lakers. He plays for the Dallas Mavericks. And, in case you've been living under a rock, things aren't going well in Dallas right now.

The fans are practically in an open revolt against the franchise after general manager Nico Harrison decided to trade franchise player Luka Dončić to the Lakers for a package headlined by Davis. Those fans have protested outside of the arena and been kicked out of games. Things have only gotten worse in the weeks since the deal was consummated. Another traded player, Quentin Grimes, has thrived in his new home of Philadelphia. Kyrie Irving tore an ACL, knocking him out not only for this season, but at least part of next year as well. And while Davis was stellar in his Dallas debut, he hasn't played since because of an abdominal injury. The outlook for the Mavericks is getting bleak.

Davis gave an extended interview to Dana Larson of Mavericks TV on Saturday, and in it, he tried to calm Mavericks fans down by reminding them of what he can bring to the team. 

""I know who I am as a player,"" Davis said. ""I'm top-75 of all time. I just wanted to let Dallas fans know -- I've got y'all, I'm here, I'm here now. I know you lost a superstar in Luka, but you also gained a superstar in myself.""

Davis is technically correct. While the consensus surrounding the trade was the Mavericks received far too little for Dončić, Davis is still a superstar. Perhaps if he and the Mavericks eventually turn things around, he might be able to win the fan support that is currently lacking.

But he's fighting an uphill battle because fandom is more complex than that. Dončić isn't just a basketball player to fans in Dallas. He's someone they watched grow a teenager adjusting to life in a new country into one of the very best basketball players in the world, someone who could occupy a similar place in their community to Dirk Nowitzki, who famously played 21 years for the Mavericks without ever wearing another NBA uniform. Davis is a superstar, but through no fault of his, he is also ""the player we have instead of Luka Dončić"" to a lot of fans in Dallas.

It might take a championship for him to change that. Irving's injury makes winning one far more difficult. Davis has a lengthy history of injuries as well, and while the Mavericks are expected to be aggressive in seeking short-term upgrades over the summer, their asset base is ironically limited because of all of the picks they spent in the past trying to upgrade around Dončić. Superstar-level play is going to be the bare minimum for Davis if he hopes to win over the fans in Dallas. He's also going to need close to impeccable health, a nearly perfect offseason from a front office that seemingly just whiffed the trade deadline, and a whole lot of luck when it comes to the roster he's given moving forward.

Maxx Crosby reset the market for players who aren't quarterbacks when the Las Vegas Raiders rewarded the star pass rusher with a contract that made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history on Thursday. The three-year, $106.5 million contract puts Crosby at a $35.5 million average annual salary, changing the game for pass rushers and non-quarterbacks everywhere. The Raiders got Crosby's deal done at $91.5 million guaranteed. 

Crosby's time as the league's highest-paid, non-QB lasted three days. Myles Garrett now owns that title with the Cleveland Browns re-signing the 2023 NFL Defensive Player of the Year to a four-year extension on Sunday that runs his average per year salary up to $40 million with a historic $122.8 million guaranteed. This deal will certainly impact other non-quarterbacks whose agents are popping bottles while negotiating extensions for their superstar clients. Micah Parsons, Ja'Marr Chase, Aidan Hutchinson and Trey Hendrickson are awaiting new contracts and stand to benefit the most from Garrett's new deal. 

This list will certainly change over the course of the offseason, but here are the 10 highest-paid non-quarterbacks in the NFL at this very moment.

Maxx Crosby

Las Vegas Raiders

$35,500,000

Justin Jefferson

Minnesota Vikings

$35,000,000

CeeDee Lamb

Dallas Cowboys

$34,000,000

Nick Bosa

San Francisco 49ers

$34,000,000

A.J. Brown

Philadelphia Eagles

$32,000,000

Amon-Ra St. Brown

Detroit Lions

$30,002,500

Tyreek Hill

Miami Dolphins

$30,000,000

Brandon Aiyuk

San Francisco 49ers

$30,000,000

Wide receivers still dominate the highest-paid non-quarterbacks list based on average per year salary, as six of them are in the top 10 with Hill and Aiyuk tied for 10th. Pass rushers take up three positions on the list with Garrett, Crosby and Bosa as the three edge rushers who make $30+ million a year. Jones is the outlier as an interior defensive lineman, the only one to make $30+ million a year.

Now, let's take a look at the highest-paid, non-QBs in terms of guaranteed salary, a list that many would argue is even more important than a contract's average per year salary because APY can sometimes be artificially inflated by backloading a deal with money teams intended to never actually pay out. All the money below is cash each respective player will see.

Maxx Crosby

Las Vegas Raiders

$91,500,000

Players who line up in the trenches along the line of scrimmage dominate the guaranteed money top 10 list for non-QBs. Six pass rushers, five of whom are edge rushers (Garrett, Bosa, Crosby, Hines-Allen and Burns) and one interior defensive lineman (Jones), lead the way. The offensive tackle position (Wirfs and Sewell) and the wide receiver position (Jefferson and Lamb) are equally represented.

These two charts hammer home why Garrett's deal will set the barometer for Watt, Parsons, Hendrickson, and other pass rushers seeking extensions. Of the wide receivers set for contract extensions, Chase is the player set to get paid -- and may join Garrett as the second $40 million non-quarterback. 

All these contracts were signed over the last two years, with Bosa setting the standard with his five-year, $170 million extension with $122.5 million guaranteed in 2023. These numbers will certainly go up with the rising salary cap and the ballooning wide receiver market.

Garrett's extension could be the dynamite that ushers in a wave of record-setting spending this offseason.

Von MIller, one of the NFL's best pass rushers of his generation, is now on the open market after being released by the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported.  The move, officially announced by the Bills, saves Buffalo $8.4 million in cap space.

Miller, who turns 36-years-old on March 26, has just six sacks across the last two seasons, but he and the Bills are open to a return on a new deal ahead of his 14th NFL season, per NFL Media. He signed a six-year, $120 million deal with Buffalo in the 2022 offseason after helping lead the Los Angeles Rams to a Super Bowl LVI title to conclude the 2021 season. Miller, the second overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, leads the entire NFL in sacks since 2010 with 129.5, a figure that also ranks as the 16th-most since sacks became an officially tracked individual statistic in 1982.

Thank you, @VonMiller. ❤️💙https://t.co/6D0cAXogkl | #BillsMafia pic.twitter.com/siN7wXP0tE

That production -- along with eight Pro Bowl selections, three first-team All-Pro nods, a Super Bowl 50 MVP award and a 2011 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award -- is why Miller is a member of the 2010's All-Decade team and why he could have a number of contenders to choose from outside of the AFC runner-ups with the NFL's legal tampering period beginning on Monday. 

Where will Miller be playing in 2025? Let's take a look at a five possible landing spots. 

At this stage of Miller's career, he's only looking to play for teams in the mix to win it all, so the AFC runner-ups led by 2024 NFL MVP quarterback Josh Allen check that box. Plus, he's reportedly interested in returning to his NFL home of the last three seasons despite them releasing him. Buffalo is knocking on the door of a Super Bowl trip: their 61 wins since 2020 are the most in league history in a five-season span without a Super Bowl trip, per CBS Sports Research. Odds are their time is coming soon. All they have to do is get past the three-time defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs, who have knocked them out in four of the last five postseasons. 

As the Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles showed, pressuring and sacking Patrick Mahomes is the key to victory. Miller and the recently re-signed Gregory Rousseau could use a little more help to get Buffalo over the top, but they're right there.

Miller, who played his college football at Texas A&M, could be right at home in Houston on a young Texans squad looking to break through after consecutive AFC divisional round appearances. He wouldn't even have a ton on his plate playing behind five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Danielle Hunter and 2023 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson Jr. That would be an ideal role Miller, one where he could be the veteran mentor while subbing in predominantly on clear passing downs. 

The Ravens, like the Bills, are on the cusp of reaching a Super Bowl. Their 78 regular season wins in the last seven seasons are the most without a Super Bowl trip all-time, per CBS Sports Research. Offensively, their duo of two-time NFL MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson and 2020 NFL Offensive Player of the Year running back Derrick Henry combined for the most total yards (7,201) and rushing yards (2,836) in a single season in NFL history in 2024, per CBS Sports Research.

Defensively, Baltimore finished as a top 10 scoring defense (21.2 points per game allowed, ninth in the NFL) after leading the league in nearly every key defensive metric from Weeks 11-18. Miller would make sense for a Ravens squad looking to win now. 

A return to the home of Miller's second Super Bowl win could make some sense. They came the closest to knocking off the Eagles this past postseason, falling 28-22 in the NFC divisional round. All of the Rams' defensive line's top contributors -- 2024 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Jared Verse, Braden Fiske, Kobie Turner and Byron Young -- have been drafted in the past two years, so Miller could come in as a mentor for an ascending Los Angeles defensive line on the verge of leveling up. 

The Chiefs are the first time ever to reach five Super Bowls in a six-season, and they've come away with three titles in that span. Miller could be a nice veteran addition to an edge rusher group led by 2022 first-round pick George Karlaftis III.

Magomed Ankalaev didn't exactly wrestle the UFC light heavyweight title away from Alex Pereira, but he did manage to beat ""Poatan"" at his own game. Ankalaev is now the 205-pound champion after a surprising unanimous decision from the judges in Las Vegas following a very close five-round fight. The loss ends Pereira's five-fight win streak, which included three title defenses.

How Pereira would handle Ankalaev's wrestling was a leading narrative heading into UFC 313. Few predicted Ankalaev would land the more effective strikes. While Pereira invested in calf kicks, Ankalaev focused on pressuring his opponent backward. Ankalaev didn't find great success at first, but his forward movement allowed him to land critical punches. Ankalaev landed several clean strikes in Round 2 and rocked him at the buzzer. It was the most decisive blow of the fight.

Oddsmakers correctly identified that Ankalaev's well-roundedness could trouble Pereira. Ankalaev didn't land a single of his 11 attempted takedowns, but his ability to mix in grappling fatigued Pereira and muted his offense. The fight was very close with people online split between 48-47 scores in either direction. The judges were more convinced, ruling a unanimous decision for Ankalaev (48-47, 48-47, 49-46).

""I can't even put it into words,"" Ankalaev said post-fight through a  Russian interpreter. ""This is my dream and it's right here around my  waist.""

Ankalaev's victory was both validation and redemption. The new champion previously fought Jan Blachowicz for the vacant UFC light heavyweight title in 2022. The critically panned fight ended in a split draw, and UFC CEO Dana White opted to move on without granting either man a subsequent title shot. It took three fights for Ankalaev to earn another title shot despite being undefeated since September 2018.

""We followed our strategy,"" Pereira said after his loss. ""We know that he puts people against the fence and plays that game. But winning with that gameplan incentivizes people to do that. People might say it's a boring style, but when a guy wins doing that it makes people want to do that.""

Elsewhere on the card, Justin Gaethje got back in the win column with an impressive showing against Rafael Fiziev. The two previously duked it out in 2023 with Gaethje earning the majority decision. This time, it was a bit more clear as Gaethje earned the unanimous decision against an opponent making his return from injury on 12 days' notice. Plus, Ignacio Bahamondes made waves with his first-round submission of Jalin Turner, who promptly told reporters he planned to retire after his fourth loss in five fights.

CBS Sports was with you the entire way on Saturday bringing you all the results and highlights from the UFC 313 below. 

It was not a great night for either fighter but Ankalaev's forward pressure was rewarded, even if the live crowd (and our scorecard) did not agree.

Pereira landed a good leg kick before an Ankalaev body kick. A big left hand landed for Ankalaev. Pereira came forward with a few good strikes as Ankalaev was backing up for one of the few times in the fight. Pereira connected with a good jab and then an inside leg kick. Another hard Pereira jab landed and a head kick was blocked. Ankalaev tried for a takedown but was stuffed. In the clinch, Ankalaev took the back trying for a takedown but Pereira continued to fight the hands and fend off being put on his back. Pereira spun around and got out of the worst danger before Ankalaev landed a few knees to the thighs. Ankalaev didn't do much of anything in the final round and that might cost him the title.

Ankalaev shot in immediately for a takedown but couldn't get it. He then clinched Pereira along the cage and tried to land a sweep but Pereira continued to defend well. Ankalaev continued to try to dip down in the clinch and put Pereira on his back but still hadn't managed to secure a takedown in the fight. Pereira spun free before Ankalaev clinched up again. The referee eventually separated the fighters and restarted them as nothing of significance happened in the clinch. Pereira landed to the leg again as Ankalaev continued to pressure forward. Ankalaev again shot in, again was denied the takedown but grabbed the clinch. Pereira fought off more takedown attempts but remained pinned against the cage in an Ankalaev clinch. 

Pereira tried to open the round by pressing forward and ripping more calf kicks. Pereira ripped a kick to the body. Ankalaev continued to work some kicks to the body. Ankalaev shot for a takedown, Pereira slipped it and landed a short inside elbow. Pereira landed a pair of inside leg kicks and Ankalaev clinched and landed a knee to the body before Pereira slipped away. Another Ankalaev takedown attempt missed before Pereira landed a two-punch combination and a pair of leg kicks. Ankalaev landed a hard jab to Pereira's chin. Pereira is moving backward but he's landing more clean shots.

Ankalaev opened the round more aggressively, throwing punches and putting Pereira on the back foot. Pereira tried to get the leg kicks going again as Ankalaev started to look like he was going for a takedown before a good front kick to Pereira's stomach. Ankalaev landed a pair of good leg kicks that marked up Pereira's lead leg. Pereira landed a good jab and Ankalaev threw an overhand right in return. Ankalaev connected with a left hand to the body. Ankalaev blocked a Pereira head kick and then landed a good overhand left hand. Ankalaev threw a nice punch combination and landed two of those shots cleanly. Pereira responded with a nice jab. Pereira tried to get the leg kicks going again and Ankalaev threw a flurry of punches in return, continuing to switch stance as it suited him. Ankalaev landed a hard left late that stung Pereira and seemed to take his legs before the horn sounded.

Both fighters came out relatively cautious until Pereira started to throw leg kicks. Those leg kicks continued to land solidly for Pereira, eventually causing Ankalaev to move backward and hop a few times to get his leg loose again. Pereira also slipped out of the way of Ankalaev's power punches. Ankalaev eventually fired back with a few leg kicks of his own. Pereira missed a head kick and then a spinning head kick but kept the threat level high with those strikes. Ankalaev continued to land a few of his own leg kicks before Pereira landed a few more of his own. Pereira landed another leg kick and Ankalaev drove forward looking for a takedown but Pereira defended well in the clinch until the end of the round. In a frame that was mostly dictated by leg kicks, Pereira did the better work.

After Gaethje's big win, we move along to the main event. Five rounds between UFC light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira and top challenger Magomed Ankalaev. Can Pereira survive arguably the most dangerous threat to his 205-pound crown?

Fiziev picked up the pace in Round 3 but his energy waned under Gaethje's relentless pressure. Likely tied one apiece, the third round was critical for both fighters. Fiziev took the early lead with his kicking game. Fiziev landed multiple hard kicks to the body and legs. Similar to their first fight, however, Fiziev's stamina tanked. Gaethje took over as Fiziev -- who took the fight on 10 days' notice -- slowed. Gaethje landed tremendous strikes in the clinch. Gaethje showed unbelievable dexterity to land a head kick from the clinch. ""The Highlight"" landed an even harder head kick down the stretch. The significant striking totals were razor thin in Round 3, but Gaethje pulled away late and took 29-28 scorecards.

""I'm pretty sure my hand is broken. That is one tough son of a b--ch,"" Gaethje said in his post-fight interview, praising Fiziev's performance on late notice.

Gaethje will likely hold firm at No. 3 in the UFC's official lightweight rankings. The only contenders ahead of him are Arman Tsarukyan and Charles Oliveira.

Gaethje pressured Fiziev early but couldn't build much momentum after eating a groin strike. The fight resumed after a brief pause. Gaethje landed a hard two-punch combo. Gaethje didn't overcommit to his strikes but kept moving forward as Fiziev's pace waned. Gaethje landed a blitzing combo in close. Fiziev whiffed on a head kick but followed through with a punch that snapped Gaethje's head back. Gaethje's best strike continued to be a sneaky right hook he'd throw over Fiziev's shoulder. A right uppercut dropped Fiziev! Fiziev got to his knees as Gaethje settled for a front head lock position. 

Chaos was advertised but no one expected how the round would begin. Muay Thai specialist Fiziev landed a takedown early in Round 1 against the collegiate wrestler. Fiziev couldn't hold Gaethje but landed a knee on the way up. Fiziev's second attempt sparked a fascinating scramble. Gaethje somersaulted through the takedown attempt. The American nearly landed on top but Fiziev scrambled into a reverse mounted triangle choke. Fiziev sat on Gaethje's face, delivering hard punches and elbows to the body. Trapped underneath and absorbing blows, Gaethje exploded to his feet. Fiziev succeeded repeatedly with a crisp switch left body kick. Gaethje returned fire with a thudding overhand right. Both men made good accounts of themselves, but Fiziev nearly tripled his opponent in significant strikes.

Buckle up for this one. Justin Gaethje and Rafael Fiziev make the co-main event walk shortly. Gaethje and Fiziev produced one of 2023's best fights. Gaethje took a majority decision win that night. Gaethje and Fiziev run it back on short notice after Dan Hooker pulled out of tonight's fight with a hand injury.

Turner and Bahamondes did not shy from striking, but an early submission prevented the action duo from producing fireworks. Turner and Bahamondes wasted no time once the bell rang. The lightweights met in the center of the Octagon before launching various punch and kick combos. Turner punctuated his combo with a hard body kick before taking down Bahamondes. Not content with inactivity, Bahamondes launched a barrage of elbows from the bottom. Turner threw an elbow from the top but suddenly found himself trapped in a triangle choke. Turner tried to remain calm but Bahamondes adjusted the angle and forced the submission at 2:29 of Round 1.

Jalin Turner and Ignacio Bahamondes  are up next! These are two explosive lightweights with a serious appetite for finishing fights. Bahamondes spinning wheel kick knockout of Roosevelt Roberts was one of 2021's most memorable finishes. Turner has finished all 14 of his professional fights.

Before Amanda Lemos and Iasmin Lucindo made their walkouts, the UFC announced another inductee into the 2025 UFC Hall of Fame. Former UFC welterweight champion ""Ruthless"" Robbie Lawler will enter the modern wing of the UFC Hall of Fame.

Lucindo's team demanded activity from her and she answered accordingly. Lucindo shot out of a cannon in Round 3 after a lifeless first two rounds. Lucindo got her arms around Lemos and planted her 30 seconds into the round. Lucindo was never close to a finish but showed refreshing tenacity. Lucindo attempted to improve position, giving Lemos enough space to initiate a scramble. The women returned to their feet briefly before Lemos hit another bodylock takedown. Neither woman did much on the ground, but Lucindo got the most control time. The fight seemingly ended prematurely after the horn was blown five seconds early. I don't think anyone will complain about cutting that fight short. All three judges awarded Lemos 29-28 scores.

Lucindo attempted to channel her inner Mauricio Ruffy to no avail. Lucindo uncorked a messy wheel kick that nearly took the aggressor off her feet. Lemos responded with a thumping leg kick that spurred a grappling exchange. Lemos continued to outperform her foe in close. Lemos earned superior leverage against the fence, landed a hard elbow and foot swept Lucindo to the mat. From there, the one-time title challenger repeated her efforts in Round 1 by controlling her grounded opponent with very little offense. Lemos closed the round with a solid hammer fist to cap off an uneventful round.

Lemos' success controlling Lucindo was the biggest takeaway from the opening round. Both fighters were patient on the feet, arguably too patient. Neither woman stood out until Lemos secured a takedown halfway through the round. While Lemos didn't score much offense on the ground, she was busy enough to prevent the referee from standing them up. Lucindo offered little resistance on her back, content to stay grounded. A post-round replay showed a grazing elbow that cut Lucindo under her left eye.

The sophomore main card fight takes place in the women's strawweight division. Former title challenger Amanda Lemos takes on Iasmin Lucindo. Lemos hopes to bounce back from a loss to Virna Jandiroba by snapping Lucindo's four-fight winning streak.

Ruffy did not waste a single motion on Saturday. Ruffy was patient in his approach but committed to its execution. The Fighting Nerds representative slowly corralled King Green to the fence before uncorking a picture perfect wheel kick. Green took the heel directly to his cheek and hit the mat face first. The official finish came officially at 2:07 of Round 1.

""Las Vegas, good night!"" Ruffy said in his post-fight interview before calling out Beneil Dariush for a UFC Fight Night main event.

UFC 313's pay-per-view main card is officially underway! We open tonight's five fight main card with Mauricio Ruffy vs. King Green. This should be a striker's delight between two fighters trending in different directions. Ruffy represents the Fighting Nerds team running roughshod in various divisions. Green is determined to turn things around after being submitted by Paddy Pimblett at UFC 304.

Van and Tsuruya standout entered UFC 313 as two of the most compelling flyweight prospects. Their combined record before Saturday's fight was 22-2. Once the cage door closed, Van soared by his fellow flyweight. Van rendered Tsuruya's offense ineffective for 15 minutes. Tsuruya, who was undefeated before tonight, was significantly outstruck in all three rounds. Tsuruya found brief success with takedowns but couldn't generate enough offense to swing the rounds in his favor. Van was on the hunt from start to finish and it rewarded him with a clean sweep on the scorecards.

Next up to bat are flyweights Joshua Van and Rei Tsuruya. Van is a -190 favorite in this battle between compelling prospects.

If Ferreira is beating you, he's stopping you. ""The Hulk"" kept his finishing streak intact on Saturday, stopping his 13th opponent in as many wins. Petrosyan experienced disaster after disaster from the start. In Round 1, Ferreira rocked Petrosyan with an overhand left. Petrosyan recovered but put himself well behind by landing two consecutive groin kicks. Petrosyan's second infraction earned a point deduction, likely putting him at a 10-8 deficit. Petrosyan's questionable tactics continued in Round 2. The referee briefly halted the action for a potential groin strike to Petrosyan, but the blow clearly landed to the body. Later, Petrosyan grabbed the fence repeatedly while underneath Ferreira. Petrosyan's shady efforts were fruitless as Ferreira scored an armbar submission at 4:27 of Round 2.

Next we move to the middleweight division. Armen Petrosyan is desperate for a win after consecutive losses. Petrosyan most recently suffered a Knockout of the Year contender when Shara Bullet dropped him with a double spinning back fist. Ferreira has finished all 12 of his professional wins but his KO power couldn't save him from Abus Magomedov's submission game last time out.

Morono's heart is unquestionable but grit wasn't enough on Saturday. Leal lived up to expectations as a -700 betting favorite. Leal overloaded Morono with relentless strikes to the head and body. He rocked Morono halfway through Round 1 and never let up. Leal cracked Morono repeatedly with punches and inside elbows to the head, switching to body punches and knees whenever Morono got his guard up. Morono, looking increasingly punch drunk, continued to swing ineffective Hail Mary punches. The referee mercifully intervened at 4:16 of Round 1.

Welcome to CBS Sports' live coverage of UFC 313: Alex Pereira vs. Magomed Ankalaev. We'll have fight recaps from this point forward with round-by-round play-by-play for the main card. No need to refresh, just keep your eyes glued here. 

Ozzy Diaz and Mairon Santos won their fights against Djorden Santos and Francis Marshall, respectively. Next up is Carlos Leal vs. Alex Morono on the preliminary card. Leal is tonight's biggest betting favorite, clocking in at -700.

Mauricio Ruffy may have locked up Knockout of the Year just two minutes into the UFC 313 main card. Ruffy scored a highlight-reel spinning kick to the head of King Green, sending him down and out to kick off Saturday's pay-per-view from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

Ruffy was the sharper striker from the opening bell, but Green is a dangerous veteran who was capable to striking back at any moment. Unfortunately for Green, he never got that opportunity as Ruffy backed him up with strikes before feinting with a left hook and letting the momentum carry him through the spinning hook kick, which landed high on Green's head and sent him spilling to the canvas to end the fight at the 2:07 mark of the opening frame.

Ruffy fights out of the surging Fighting Nerds camp from Brazil. He captured a UFC contract on Dana White's Contender Series in 2023. His UFC debut announced his real arrival, knocking out Jamie Mullarkey with a flying knee into a flurry of punches. After defeating Green, he's now riding a three-fight winning streak in the Octagon.

Green debuted in the UFC in February 2013 and has been a staple of the division ever since. He was coming off of a submission loss to Paddy Pimblett this past July and now holds a 1-3 record in his three most recent outings.

Florida State has hired Sacramento Kings assistant Luke Loucks as its next coach, the school announced on Sunday. The deal is for five years, sources told CBS Sports.

Loucks is an alumnus of the university, having played for outgoing coach Leonard Hamilton from 2008-12. He got into coaching in 2016 with the Golden State Warriors, where he worked until 2021. He's been with the Kings since 2022. CBS Sports previously reported Loucks was tagged as the front-runner for the job in late February. In recent days he has been working on building a staff, sources said, including searching for a general manager to help manage the portal immediately.

""I am incredibly honored and excited for the opportunity to become the head coach for the Florida State men's basketball team,"" Loucks said in a statement. ""FSU has a rich basketball tradition, and I look forward to building on the legacy of our previous coaches, especially Coach Hamilton. I'd like to thank the Sacramento Kings, Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors for providing me with a strong coaching foundation. I'm eager to build our coaching staff with the best and brightest basketball coaches in America. They will have characteristics that support and push me while helping me build and develop a competitive team year after year. We will have a standard that we stick to on and off the court that will help build a championship-level culture. I am privileged to have seen firsthand what winning feels like at Florida State, and I am hungry for more.""

The news dovetails with Hamilton's 23-year run with the program coming to an end. On Saturday, the school honored him with a ceremony, including bringing back many of Hamilton's college teammates from UT Martin. FSU finished the regular season 17-14 after Saturday's home finale against SMU. The win was Hamilton's 200th regular-season victory in the ACC, putting him alongside Mike Krzyzewski, Dean Smith and Roy Williams as the only coaches to reach that threshold. 

The program hasn't made the NCAA Tournament since 2021. The Seminoles will also play in next week's ACC Tournament. 

""I'm excited to announce that Luke Loucks has accepted our offer to become the next head men's basketball coach at Florida State,"" Florida State athletic director Michael Alford said. ""Luke will bring a unique combination of qualities to our program, and I'm excited to begin the next chapter of our basketball history under his leadership. Throughout basketball at both the professional and collegiate levels, Luke has earned a reputation as one of the rising stars in coaching. Having been a key part of some of the best of what FSU basketball has been as a player, he also brings proven ability to develop players at the highest level of the sport.""

Loucks joins Alex Jensen at Utah and Kevin Young at BYU as NBA assistants to take high-major jobs in the past 11 months. Jensen (previously with the Dallas Mavericks) was just hired at Utah on Thursday, while Young left the Phoenix Suns last year.

Napheesa Collier and Arike Ogunbowale gifted Unrivaled trainers $10,000 a piece, thanks to a partnership with Icy Hot. 





On International Women’s Day, Unrivaled stars Napheesa Collier and Arike Ogunbowale surprised training staff in the Icy Hot Training Room with $10,000 bonuses. Collier honored trainer Terri Acosta, while Ogunbowale honored head trainer Lindsey Elizondo, both of whom have been key members of the league’s staff. 

Unrivaled is a new full-court, professional women’s 3-on-3 basketball league co-founded by Collier and Breanna Stewart. The league is geared toward giving the best players in the WNBA a chance to stay in the U.S. during the offseason. 

Both Ogunbowale and Collier wore custom Icy Hot patches honoring members of their training staff as they walked through the tunnel before their weekend games. 

Elizondo was previously a trainer in the NBA, for the Orlando Magic, for four years,

“She’s smart, fun to be around, attentive, and always makes sure my body is right,” Ogunbowale said of Elizondo. “I appreciate all the work she puts in behind the scenes to make sure we can perform the best we can on the court.”

Acosta, meanwhile, was the head trainer on Team USA’s Olympic women’s basketball team. 

“She is such a hard worker, and I admire and appreciate the way that she shows up for each of us every day,” Collier said of Acosta. 

Unrivaled’s training staff has benefited quite a bit from the league’s success this season; Collier previously donated half of her $200,000 prize money from winning Unrivaled’s 1v1 tournament to her assistant coaches and training staff. 

From the jump, fair compensation has been a critical part of the league’s directive; on average, Unrivaled players earned more than $200,000 for their participation in the 9-week season. In addition, players receive equity and revenue-sharing. 

“We are really changing the outlook of the ecosystem holistically,” Alex Bazzell, Unrivaled’s president, told SB Nation before the season. “You’re seeing more leagues bumping up their pay because that’s where the space is now. We’re proud to play a part in that growth of just the economics of these players being paid a lot of money to play basketball. That’s where we want to get to. It’s great to have brand deals, it’s great to have all this off-court stuff, but at the end of the day, we want to be able to pay them high salaries on the court.”

The partnership with Icy Hot allowed staff to receive additional compensation for their work this winter. But, it’s one of many high-profile business deals that have benefitted Unrivaled this offseason; the league also partnered with Morgan Stanley, Sprite, Sephora, Under Armour, Samsung Galaxy, Wayfair, and Ally, among others. The league’s list of investors is also star-studded; Giannis Antetokounmpo, JuJu Watkins, Dawn Staley, Coco Gauff, and Michael Phelps are just a few of those.

Unrivaled’s season is coming to a close shortly. The inaugural season concludes on Monday, March 10th, while playoffs — which will include four teams — will begin on March 16th. The league’s championship game will be played on March 17th.

Jayson Tatum is never going to be the face of the NBA, and that’s just fine.

People seem oddly fixated on Jayson Tatum’s legacy these days, and I’m worried it might tear society apart. So as an expert who has been arguing with strangers on the internet about this subject for three full years, it’s time I intervened. 

The NBA is a highly personal league. Because there are so few of them, great players are more important to us than they are in any other sport. We develop parasocial relationships with them, want to be fulfilled by them and can become understandably defensive when people come for our prodigal sons. But it takes a keen eye to see the larger picture.

Despite the criticism, and the criticism of the critics and then the criticism of the critics’ critics, Jayson Tatum is exactly what he needs to be: a spectacular player on a spectacular team, who has achieved the pinnacle of NBA success. He showed how destructive his underappreciated, do-it-all skill set can be through Boston’s Saturday win over of the scorching-hot Lakers. The game was actually a perfect encapsulation of Tatum’s dynamic in the discourse, as the Lakers have two players some may put ahead of Tatum, but it didn’t matter, because his particular brand of greatness continues to put a very good Celtics team over the top. 

He is never going to be the face of the NBA, nor is he ever going to be the best player in the league. And that’s fine. 

To quote Michael Pina of The Ringer, we are absolutely missing the forest for the trees here. Looking at Tatum’s stature against all of NBA history ignores the kind of player he actually is. And we need to be asking questions about that, not “is Tatum really a superstar,” which is like asking if an apple is a fruit. Like… yeah, of course. But is the apple just… an apple, or is it a special, super apple?

In the NBA, most super-duper stars have some sort of magical power that no one has ever seen before, but Tatum doesn’t. Nikola Jokic’s vision or Giannis Antetokounmpo’s downhill momentum break the fabrics of basketball reality, while Tatum is just one of the most technically perfect swingmen we’ve ever seen. He isn’t the best at one thing, but he is really, super, duper, ultra good at everything. If you asked an AI to create the ideal NBA player, it would spit out Tatum.

Shooting, finishing, passing, rebounding, defense, dribbling. You could find a player in the league better than Tatum at any of these things, but try to find me one better than him at all of them. Gilgeous-Alexander? Much worse passer and rebounder. Antetokounmpo? Can’t shoot. Luka Doncic? Defensive liability. Victor Wembanyama could surpass Tatum one day in all six skills, but who knows if he’ll blossom into an all-world passer? Tatum is just so good at so much.

Instead of worrying about which player comps his critics have thrown out, let’s ask Tatum about his lofty aims. He has not been shy about his frustrations — he’s admitted he doesn’t feel appreciated for all he’s accomplished at such a young age — but he’s also been open about his ambitions, as before the Celtics set off on their 2024 championship run, he declared that he has his sights set on hallowed ground. 

“I would love to be on the Mount Rushmore of Celtics. Bird, Russell, Paul Pierce and those guys. They paved the way. The one thing all those guys have is chips. I have to get to the top of the mountain to even be considered one of those guys. I want to be an all-time great, I want to be known as a winner, and I believe I will be.”

If we put our literary-analysis hat on for a second, Tatum is basically equating “being a winner” with “being an all-time great,” which I would argue is not how we actually calculate those things. Winning does not make someone an all-time great, nor does being an all-time great actually require that much winning. Nikola Jokic is already (at least) the 15th greatest player ever, and Tatum is not even in that ballpark; yet they both have exactly one NBA title. It’s stats and awards that set the two apart.

Tatum also names three players he wants to sit next to in Celtics Valhalla: Bird, Russell and Pierce. And I think those three are the crux of his legacy. He has no chance of becoming as good as Bird or Russell; those are two of the top six players ever, and Tatum does not have the skills to pay those kinds of bills. Pierce, however? Iconic Celtics player, but Tatum absolutely has what it takes to be better than him all-time. In fact, he’s careening towards doing that.

Is Pierce really an “all-time great”? For the Celtics, yes, but he’s nowhere near the Pantheon of NBA history with the likes of modern day legends Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and even his personal idol Kobe Bryant. Tatum seems likely to retire a better player than Pierce, yet that may be his best stylistic comparison: beloved by his hometown fans, with a Hall of Fame career (and Tatum’s will be better), but never quite rising to the level of a national favorite.

Or, maybe all of these aura arguments are not just a waste of time, but directly contrasting with reality. Tatum actually might be face-of-the-league popular…just not among terminally online NBA fans. He’s third in the NBA in jersey sales — well above Antetokounmpo, Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokic — showing he resonates worldwide with at least somebody. Maybe that is not Colin Cowherd, but he’s not the president of the universe. 

But can Tatum ascend past Pierce’s tier? Will he get to that last level?

Probably not. As a lifetime member of the Professional Association of Jayson Tatum Analysts (PAJTA, we’re working on the acronym), I personally think he lacks the superpowers he would require to elevate him to the legendary status of his iconic contemporaries, namely Antetokounmpo and Jokic. But he’s still undoubtedly great, and this cycle of offending and getting-offended needs to be stopped by acknowledging that there are different types of greatness.

Some wrongly assert that the face of the NBA must be American, a vaguely-xenophobic take that ignores how international the league has become. But the desire for a young American superstar has seen pundits project their desires for a “next Kobe” or a “next LeBron” onto Tatum, but they’re missing the boat entirely. We have the next faces of the league already, in the undeniable greatness of Jokic and Antetokounmpo and the promise of Wembanyama and Doncic. There is no good reason why those guys can’t define the league going forward, with Tatum continuing to dominate in his own way. 

He’s a private guy, and namely didn’t say he wanted to be the “face of the league” in his statement of purpose I mentioned above. That’s not to say he doesn’t feel disrespected or isn’t marketable, but he’s certainly not the in-your-face celebrity that some want him to be. He has always cared more about his family and his game than being in the next Space Jam or Thunderstruck, being a player-GM or going after his haters on social media. But he’s his own kind of superstar, one who may ultimately win several championships and retire a surefire Hall of Famer. That’s who he is, and those who want him to be something else will be waiting a long time.

And that’s all good… because getting to that level in the first place is so rare. He’s snowballing a career together that might make him the third-best Celtic in history, and we should all appreciate the glorious player he is rather than worrying about who he isn’t, and probably never will be. Because it’s not about the forest of NBA history, it’s about each, individual, really awesome-looking tree.

Trae Young’s perfect missed free throw blew his teammate’s mind to seal Hawks win

Trae Young is one of the NBA’s best free throw shooters. The Atlanta Hawks guard has made 87.2 percent of his free throws for his career, which is a top-10 active mark in the league.  Young has been particularly good at the charity stripe lately: he was on a streak of 47 consecutive made free throws as he stepped to the line to ice the win over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night with under one second left.

Young sank the first free throw to give Atlanta a two-point lead. With 0.5 seconds remaining on the clock, he knew it wasn’t beneficial to make the second one, which would allow Indiana to take a timeout, advance the ball to halfcourt, and try to get off a shot at the buzzer to tie the game. 

For his second free throw, Young put up a comically high-arcing shot that just barely grazed the rim. The buzzer sounded, and the Hawks won. As he walked off the floor, Young was greeted by teammate Georges Niang, who provided a hilarious reaction to Young’s miss. Watch the shot and reaction here:

Georges Niang's reaction when Trae Young explains why he missed the free throw at the end of the game    pic.twitter.com/kB07MAFPE7

Niang had to know why Young missed the free throw, right? His reaction may have been because Young told him that shot ended his streak of 47 consecutive makes. Either way, it’s a hilarious look at the relationship between the two new teammates after Niang came to Atlanta in a trade deadline deal.

Young may have ended his own free throw streak, but the shot that broke it was the most perfectly placed of them all. This is your reminder that NBA stars are comically good at their jobs. 

The NBA should allow Young to keep his free throw streak going. He did exactly what he wanted with his second freebie, and the Hawks won because of it.

Chelsea welcome Leicester City to Stamford Bridge in a Premier League fixture that carries an intriguing subplot. Enzo Maresca, now steering Chelsea’s rebuild, faces his former club, with expectations firmly on his side to deliver a result.

Despite its significance, fans in the UK will be unable to watch Chelsea vs Leicester live due to broadcasting decisions and scheduling conflicts. However, there are ways to follow the action and catch up on key moments.

The original kick-off was planned for Saturday, 6 March 2025, at 3pm GMT, but the fixture was later rescheduled to Sunday following Chelsea’s involvement in the UEFA Conference League on Thursday night.

With Sky Sports already selecting Tottenham vs Bournemouth and Manchester United vs Arsenal for their live Sunday broadcasts, Chelsea vs Leicester was left without a TV slot in the UK.

It is an unfortunate reality of the Premier League’s domestic broadcasting rights, where selections are made weeks in advance, leaving some high-profile matches unavailable for live viewing.

Although live coverage will not be available in the UK, fans still have several ways to stay updated:

Live Text & Radio Updates: BBC Sport and Sky Sports News will provide live text commentary and match updates.

Club Coverage: Chelsea and Leicester will offer match updates via their official social media channels and club apps.

In-Stadium Atmosphere: Those lucky enough to have a ticket will witness Maresca’s tactical approach against his former club firsthand.

Need a VPN to watch the match? Our preferred VPN to watch UK TV from anywhere is LibertyShield.com – they offer a 48 hour no-obligation free trial and have apps or all popular devices including Mac, Windows, FireTV, iPhone/iPad and Android.

For those keen to relive the key moments, Match of the Day 2 will air free highlights on BBC One at 10:30pm GMT on Sunday, offering an in-depth review of the match.

The Leicester connection adds an intriguing narrative to this encounter. Maresca, who guided Leicester to Championship glory, is now tasked with restoring Chelsea’s standing among England’s elite.

His tenure at Stamford Bridge has been a mixture of progress and inconsistency, but this match provides a chance to underline the strides Chelsea are making under his leadership.

For Leicester, the focus remains on re-establishing themselves in the top flight, and claiming a result at Stamford Bridge would be a significant statement.

With Chelsea seeking momentum in their push for European qualification, and Leicester eager to prove their Premier League credentials, this fixture promises plenty of tactical intrigue.

Maresca’s Tactical Blueprint: Will Chelsea’s dominance in possession translate into clinical finishing, an area where they have struggled?

Leicester’s Response: Can Leicester disrupt Chelsea’s build-up play and exploit defensive vulnerabilities?

Key Battles: Expect Chelsea’s midfield control to meet Leicester’s counter-attacking threats, with both sides needing points for different reasons.

This may not be live on TV, but the significance of the fixture remains. Chelsea’s progress under Maresca will be tested, while Leicester seek to make their mark in the top tier once again.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Another Simple Favor director Paul Feig is debunking speculation about Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick’s joint appearance at SXSW.

A YouTuber claimed via X on Friday, March 7, that Lively, 37, and Kendrick, 39, were allegedly uncomfortable jointly attending the Austin, Texas premiere of Another Simple Favor.

“I just reported on Blake being terrified to walk the carpet as Anna is pissed and never wants to work with her again,” the social media user claimed on Friday.

Feig, 62, swiftly shut down the accusation, replying via X, “Um … you’re wrong.”



Lively and Kendrick costarred in Feig’s A Simple Favor, which came out in 2018. They recently filmed a sequel in Italy, debuting the first look during a Friday panel at SXSW.

Both actresses walked the red carpet solo before Lively told reporters that acting alongside Kendrick was “the best.” Kendrick, meanwhile, dodged answering similar questions about her costar.

After being asked what it was like to work with Lively, Kendrick coyly replied, “Oh, you know,” before trailing off and walking further down the carpet.

A source previously told Us Weekly that there was no bad blood between the women on the set of Another Simple Favor.

“There aren’t any issues between Blake and Anna right now,” the insider exclusively told Us in February, noting that both actresses “really love” the sequel and planned to “be doing press together.”

Per the source, Lively and Kendrick also “want fans to focus on the film and not any outside drama.”

During the SXSW event, Lively further gushed about making both Simple Favor movies with Kendrick.

“It worked out, so I was like, ‘OK, no nerves. I know what I’m doing this time,’” Lively said on Friday of returning for the sequel. “Right before we started shooting, [Paul] said, ‘I have, like, a little bit of a curveball idea.’ I’m not going to say what it was because, you know, we don’t want to give away anything. But it definitely upped the ante. It was very uncomfortable to watch in this theater with you all. … But, yeah, it was fun. It’s always fun getting to work with Anna again, obviously, and this incredible group of people is amazing.”

Lively’s appearance at SXSW was her second major public outing since her lawsuit against It Ends With Us costar Justin Baldoni — following her attendance at the SNL 50 anniversary taping last month. News broke in December 2024 that Lively sued Baldoni, 41, for alleged sexual harassment and fostering a “hostile work environment” on the set of It Ends With Us, which he also directed. Baldoni denied the allegations, later naming Lively in a $400 million defamation suit. Lively denounced his accusations.

Zac Efron, Penn Badgley, Evan Peters, Michael C. Hall — these actors aren’t just attractive men who have garnered sizable fanbases from high-profile projects. They’ve also all played serial killers.

“Do you have anything to say to the people out there who say they want to date Joe despite the minor flaw of murdering people?” Stephen Colbert once asked Badgley about the public’s overwhelming response to his fictional character on You, who kills over a dozen people on the Netflix series.



“I struggle greatly with the conflict of playing such a guy and him being partly so likable and people having such a, as we say, thirsty response to him,” he replied.

After its premiere on Lifetime in 2018, You quickly became a smashing success, moving to Netflix in 2019 where four more seasons were produced. The final season is set to premiere April 24 on the streaming service.

But don’t get it twisted: the presence of hot serial killers on TV isn’t a new phenomenon. Dexter premiered in 2006, and Efron portrayed the infamous Ted Bundy in a 2019 Netflix film. Yet America’s infatuation with true crime has given way to more and more stories about brutal killers, and audiences are eating it up.

Peters had viewers falling for him as one of the most reprehensible murderers of all time in 2022’s Dahmer; Patrick Gibson stars in last year’s prequel Dexter: Original Sin; Tom Bateman prompted new swaths of fans to swoon over him in Peacock’s meta true crime series Based on a True Story and Dennis Quaid portrays Keith Jespersen, who once claimed to have as many as 160 victims, in the upcoming Paramount+ series Happy Face.

In Bateman’s case, Liana Liberato’s character Tory falls in love with his character Matt — despite the fact that she is well aware of his status as the fictional serial killer the West Side Ripper.

“To be playing someone who does these terrible things is interesting because it does bring up a moral dilemma,” Bateman told The Hollywood Reporter in 2023 of Based on a True Story. “But I felt [that] it swung so big in such a comedic way that it kind of allowed for a lightness of touch and a sort of parody to it.”

We can all agree these characters’ actions are gruesome, deplorable and unethical, but fans are lusting over them nonetheless. (If you don’t believe Us, look up “Dexter Morgan edit” on TikTok — you’ll be scrolling for hours.)

“I call it the Bad Boy Syndrome,” criminologist Scott Bonn, PhD, who authored Why We Love Serial Killers: The Curious Appeal of the World’s Most Savage Murderers, told Us Weekly of the phenomenon, noting that murderers who are locked away in prison or fictional killers on screen provide a no-risk fantasy for viewers. “That attraction is not causing them the potential of physical harm because that individual is controlled. They’re behind bars or on TV. The fantasy in your mind is very different than Ted Bundy actually showing up at your door.”

Bonn, who noted that 75 to 80 percent of attendees at his national speaking tour on serial killers are women, warns viewers to take depictions of murderers with a grain of salt, calling them “popcorn entertainment.” He said the projects “[dilute] the real story by definition. It’s not reality, even though it’s based in truth, and it’s served up in a way as to provide mass appeal.”

He continued: “To the extent that you are portraying the perpetrator as someone who has some sort of redeeming qualities and even sex appeal, then I think you are potentially doing a disservice to the victims.”

Like any production, it makes sense that a good-looking actor would be cast as the leading man, regardless of the character’s moral compass. And it’s no wonder their fans would flock to see their latest work. But, Bonn reminds Us, by giving true-crime stories the Hollywood treatment, “you’ve lost some of the integrity of the case itself.”

So while we may get a thrill watching our favorite stars break bad, let’s remember this is all just part of storytelling — and the reaction they’re hoping for!

Kristin Davis is spilling some details about a scrapped plot on And Just Like That.

The 60-year-old actress opened up about the Sex and the City sequel series, and one of her character Charlotte’s exes from the original HBO series.

In a recent episode on her Are You A Charlotte? podcast, Kristin revealed a scrapped storyline that would involve ex-husband Trey (Kyle MacLachlan).

Keep reading to find out more...

“I loved working with Kyle MacLachlan so incredibly much,” she began, saying he was only supposed to be on the show for five episodes but ended up staying on the show. 

“We all really just fell madly in love with him and he had to stay.”

“There was an idea that Trey/Kyle would come on in And Just Like That… and then it didn’t happen, and so Kyle and I had to talk about it ’cause I was kind of mad at him, I said ‘Why didn’t you come on? We wanted you to come on,'"" she said.

""And he said, ‘I just wanted it to be amazing,’ meaning that it had a kind of almost sad note — I’m not saying too much, I hope Michael [Patrick King]’s not mad at me — but it had this incredible lead-up to me seeing Trey again and the thing that I loved most about this particular episode that did not happen is that Charlotte tells the friends that she has not communicated at all with Trey, which is kind of shocking in a way.”

She added that the storyline reflected Charlotte’s “unfinished feeling.""

“She really wants to see him, and I, Kristin, also feel that way. So I’m hoping that we can kind of revisit a ‘maybe they run into each other just at an event or a restaurant or something like that,"" she said.

“I did give him a hard time the other day, and then he explained his point of view and I did understand it. When you have played such a wonderful part in the past that people have such a great memory of, and it was so special as a work experience, you want it to kind of stay in this glorious place, and I think he just didn’t want there to be kind of a sad note to the end. So I get that,"" Kristin added.

Kevin Hart is yelling at Seth Meyers!

The 45-year-old actor and comedian revealed during a recent appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers that he ""almost died"" while filming the late night host's famous “Day Drinking” segment last year.

Keep reading to find out more...

“I came into that day with such an idea of who I thought I was,” he explained. “I was like, ‘This gonna be crazy. I’m gonna drink with Seth, show him what I do because I know I drink like I used to’ — and I almost died. There was really a chance where it was over.”

“And then you called me the next morning and yelled at me like I had tried to kill you,” Seth added.

Kevin admitted they both only remember “bits and pieces” from that filming day, which included a drinking game inspired by a Jumanji gameboard.

“I remember being on the floor, laying on your chest and not knowing how I got there,” Kevin recalled.

“And then I remember being in a car and for some reason, all the cheese on the pizza slid off and it was on my stomach. I just remember holding the pizza, saying, ‘Why would y’all pay for this? Why would you buy me just the idea of pizza with no cheese?’ And it was all on my chest.”

Seth agreed he had “no memory” of the game, although he said members of his staff told him that he “rolled the dice and you [Hart] tackled me and that was the end of the game.” 

“They also told me that when Seth rolled the dice, they said full speed I came and kicked the dice and said, ‘F--king s--t.’ For no reason, by the way. There’s no reason for the anger. And then I just tackled him, and then after immediately tackling them, gave him a hug and just laid on him,"" Kevin added, noting it was “definitely a moment of truth.”

Seth said: “I feel way more connected to you after that even though I have truly no memory of it. We’re kin.”

Prince Frederik has tragically passed away.

The youngest son of Prince Robert of Luxembourg and Princess Julie of Nassau sadly passed on March 1, his father confirmed in a message posted on the POLG Foundation website.

""It is with a very heavy heart that my wife and I would like to inform you of the passing of our son, The POLG Foundation Founder and Creative Director, Frederik,"" he began.

""Last Friday, February 28th, on 'Rare Disease Day,' our beloved son called us in to his room to speak to him for one last time. Frederik found the strength and the courage to say goodbye to each of us in turn – his brother, Alexander; his sister, Charlotte; me; his three cousins, Charly, Louis, and Donall; his brother-in-law, Mansour; and finally, his Aunt Charlotte and Uncle Mark. He had already spoken all that was in his heart to his extraordinary mother, who had not left his side in 15 years. After gifting each of us with our farewells – some kind, some wise, some instructive – in true Frederik fashion, he left us collectively with a final long-standing family joke. Even in his last moments, his humour, and his boundless compassion, compelled him to leave us with one last laugh….to cheer us all up,"" he continued.

""Frederik’s last question to me, prior to his other remarks was: 'Papa, are you proud of me?' He had barely been able to speak for several days, so the clarity of these words was as surprising as the weight of the moment was profound. The answer was very easy, and he had heard it oh so many times…. but at this time, he needed reassurance that he had contributed all that he possibly could in his short and beautiful existence and that he could now finally move on.""

Frederik had the rare genetic condition POLG Mitochondrial disease. The POLG Foundation was founded by Frederik to help find treatments and a cure for the illness.

Frederik was born with POLG Mitochondrial disease, and was later diagnosed at age 14, ""when his symptoms were showing more clearly and when the progression of his disease had become more acute,"" his father explained.

The disease, according to the POLG Foundation, ""is a genetic mitochondrial disorder that robs the body’s cells of energy, in turn causing progressive multiple organ (brain, nerves, liver, intestines, muscles, swallowing and ocular function, etc.) dysfunction and failure.""

Gene Hackman turned a painful childhood and years of rejection into a successful and legendary Hollywood career.

Gene – who died from heart disease with Alzheimer's as a significant contributing factor, about one week after his wife Betsy died from hantavirus – had always had a love and interest in movies, admiring James Cagney, Errol Flynn and Edward G. Robinson.

""I loved the idea that somebody could convince me that they were a sea captain without being phony. I’d grown up shy—not unusual for actors. They want to show they’re more than that—people of import, substance. I think because I was shy, I felt insecure, and acting seemed like a way of maybe getting around that. Getting to be somebody,"" he told Vanity Fair in 2004.

Gene Hackman Death: Complete Coverage

Born on January 30, 1930, Gene was raised in Danville, Illinois, by his mother, Anna. When Gene was 13, his father left the family, an event that influenced his pursuit of acting.

""It was a real adios,"" he told Vanity Fair. ""It was so precise. Maybe that’s why I became an actor. I doubt I would have become so sensitive to human behavior if that hadn’t happened to me as a child—if I hadn’t realized how much one small gesture can mean.""

During a 2001 appearance on ""Inside the Actors Studio,"" Gene recounted the last time he saw his father, becoming emotional as he spoke.

""I was down the street playing with some guys, and he drove by and kind of waved . . . "" Gene said before trailing off and looking visibly teary-eyed.

After Lipton asked whether he had been close to his mother, Gene stayed quiet before clearing his throat and apologizing.

""It’s only been 65 years or so,"" he said with a laugh, breaking the tension, though still looking slightly uncomfortable.

Lipton noted, ""It’s not something that goes away easily, is it?"" to which Gene replied, ""It probably makes you a better actor, I don't know.""

""I don’t advocate that,"" he added, explaining, ""You get in touch with your feelings, and that’s what we’re here for. I think the more that you can draw on that kind of thing . . . get something out of it.""

Gene did credit his mother as the individual who recognized something in him, encouraging him to pursue acting.

Speaking with GQ in 2011, the ""Bonnie and Clyde"" star confirmed a story that she once took him to the movie theater and told him she wanted to ""see you do that someday.""

""She did say that. I would have been 10. Things parents say to children are oftentimes not heard, but in some cases, you pick up on things that your parent would like to see you have done.""

He added, ""Unfortunately, my mom never saw me act, so I'm sorry for that, but that's the way it is.""

Gene Hackman's Nephew Addresses Actor's Death Theories: Report

Gene’s mother died in a fire lit by a burning cigarette, according to a Los Angeles Times profile on the actor. He also said he had ""buried the hatchet"" before his father died.

In his GQ interview, he shared that he wished his mother could have seen his performance in ""I Never Sang for My Father,"" a 1970 drama about a professor dealing with his aging father, which earned him his first Oscar nomination, in the best supporting actor category.

""I thought it was a sensitive picture about family and relationships, and I think she would have been proud and happy to see that,"" he said. ""You're fortunate sometimes to be able to do something in life that defines who you are and who your parents may have wanted you to be.""

Prior to making it big, Gene had enrolled in the Pasadena Playhouse in California, where he befriended another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman.

""I met Gene in acting school, at the Pasadena Playhouse, when he was 27, and I was 19. We used to play congas together on the roof, trying to be like our hero Marlon Brando,"" Hoffman told Fox News Digital after Gene’s death. ""And Gene was like Brando, in that he brought something unprecedented to our craft, something people didn't immediately understand as genius: He was expelled from our school after three months for ‘not having talent.’ It was the first time they ever did that. He was that good.""

Hoffman continued, ""Powerful, subtle, brilliant. A giant among actors. I miss him already.""

Both actors were voted ""least likely to succeed"" at the playhouse.

Gene Hackman And Wife Were ‘Joined At The Hip,’ Trained To Fly Together

""I think the highest I ever got was a 1.4 [GPA],"" Gene said in a 1984 interview with KCRA 3, noting he had nothing against the Pasadena Playhouse, just that it’s ""tough to grade actors.""

Gene and Hoffman eventually moved to New York, where they also hung out with Robert Duvall, and the trio spent years working jobs and looking for acting work.

Gene worked as a shoe salesman, a furniture mover, and a doorman, where he ran into one of his former Marine officers who muttered, ""Hackman, you’re a sorry son of a bitch,"" as he recalled to Vanity Fair. Gene had joined the Marines at 16, lying about his age to enlist, and served just under five years before being discharged in 1951.

Speaking with Hoffman and Duvall in the interview, the ""The Conversation"" star described the grind of auditioning.

""No one starts at the top in the theater, and the bottom is a very ugly place,"" he told the outlet.

""It was madness,"" Gene said of open calls. ""A cattle call, they called it. A lot of people would get physical about where they were in line, and who had to go to work, so let me in front of you so I can get the hell out.""

He once auditioned for Gene Kelly for a musical he was directing, which didn’t go well. After Gene sang, Kelly approached him and said, ""Nice try. Musicals are hard.""

The rejection and struggle fueled Gene’s desire to continue acting, if for no other reason than to prove doubters wrong.

As he said to Vanity Fair, ""it was more psychological warfare, because I wasn’t going to let those f--kers get me down. I insisted with myself that I would continue to do whatever it took to get a job. It was like me against them, and in some way, unfortunately, I still feel that way.""

""But I think if you’re really interested in acting, there is a part of you that relishes the struggle. It’s a narcotic in the way that you are trained to do this work and nobody will let you do it, so you’re a little bit nuts. You lie to people, you cheat, you do whatever it takes to get an audition, get a job,"" he continued. 

After years of work, Gene landed his breakout role as Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle in ""The French Connection,"" winning his first Oscar for best actor.

He went on to fill even more memorable roles, like the villainous Lex Luthor in ""Superman"" and basketball coach Norman Dale in ""Hoosiers,"" and picked up a second Oscar as best supporting actor in Clint Eastwood’s ""Unforgiven.""

In 2004, after decades of work, Gene appeared in his final film, ""Welcome to Mooseport,"" co-starring Ray Romano.

In a 2008 interview with Reuters, Gene later confirmed he was done acting.

""I haven’t held a press conference to announce retirement, but, yes, I’m not going to act any longer,"" he told the outlet. ""I’ve been told not to say that over the last few years, in case some real wonderful part comes up, but I really don’t want to do it any longer.""

Speaking to GQ about his legacy in 2011, Gene said he wanted to be remembered ""as a decent actor. As someone who tried to portray what was given to them in an honest fashion. I don't know, beyond that.""

Meghan Markle on Saturday shared a never-before-shown photo of her rarely seen 3-year-old daughter, Princess Lilibet.

The toddler is shown from the back while being cradled by her father, Prince Harry, on a boat.

The Duchess of Sussex included the photo on her new Instagram page Saturday along with three others to celebrate International Women’s Day.

She also posted a recent photo of her with her mother, Doria Ragland, one with the duchess and Harry on a beach and a black and white one of her with her mother as a child.

The post was Markle’s first since it was announced the lifestyle show ""With Love, Meghan"" was renewed for a second season on Netflix.

""If you’re loving Season 1, just wait until you see the fun we cooked up on Season 2!"" Markle wrote in a post on Friday. ""Thanks for joining the party, and an endless thanks to the amazing team and crew who helped bring it all to life!""

The show has stirred controversy after its first season was dropped on the streaming platform Tuesday, with some saying it seems more than similar to Pamela Anderson's cooking show on Flavor Network.

Some royal experts criticized the show after its release, and podcaster Kinsey Schofield told Fox News Digital the duchess is ""tone deaf"" and accused her of ""hijacking all the oxygen in the room.""

Royal expert Helena Chard told Fox News Digital Markle ""lacks charisma"" and missed an opportunity to be authentic on the gardening and cooking series.

By Saturday, the show had a dismal 25% rating on Rotten Tomatoes despite its renewal.

The 43-year-old brought up her children in one of the first season's episodes when she was creating a children’s tea party with comedian Mindy Kaling, who referred to her as ""Markle.""

""It’s so funny, too, that you keep saying Meghan Markle. You know I’m Sussex now,"" the royal remarked, referring to her title.

""You have kids, and you go, ‘No, I share my name with my children.’ I didn’t know how meaningful that would be to me, but it just means so much to go, ‘This is our family name, our little family name.’""

Markle and Harry stepped back as senior royals in 2020, leaving England for Montecito, California.

Their oldest child, Prince Archie, 6, was born in London in 2019. Lilibet was born in California in 2021 after their move.

Markle also shared a video of Lilibet last weekend playing a board game with ""Auntie"" tennis pro Serena Williams.

""When the aunties comes to celebrate … and to play! Love you @serenawilliams,"" Markle captioned the video.

Markle started her new Instagram page at the beginning of the year ahead of her show's premiere.

WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans are in thrall to Donald Trump, while Democrats are baffled about how best to oppose him.

Rather than stock his White House with a “team of rivals,” Trump has opted instead for a den of disciples.

At this point in Trump’s presidency, the most serious and forceful pushback he’s faced has come from two sets of people with little in common: foreign leaders and American judges.

Each has dished out comeuppance that is seldom seen in presidential politics.

Judges have stymied parts of Trump’s agenda they say violate the law, while world leaders have challenged him for taking positions that upend the rules-based order that the U.S. helped build.

In doing so, they risk provoking Trump in ways that could boomerang. Trump is attuned to slights of any kind. Anyone who crosses him, especially on camera, risks his ire.

Trump administration officials told Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy to leave the White House grounds and later paused arms shipments to his country after he clashed with Trump over the state of peace talks with Russia.

Already, Trump’s billionaire aide-de-camp Elon Musk has used his massive public platform to call for the impeachment of judges who’ve impeded Trump’s agenda.

“There’s a troubling aspect to this: The more the Trump administration and the folks that support them say these ridiculous things about federal judges, the more it puts their families and personal safety and courthouses at risk,” Doug Jones, a former Democratic senator and U.S. attorney from Alabama, said in an interview.

Yet neither the courts nor a corps of foreign leaders are deterred. Federal judges have lifetime tenures, after all, and overseas officials answer to their own citizenry. For now, they’re acting as the emergency brake as Trump pushes ahead with plans to remake the world.

In slapping down the Trump administration’s attempt to fire a member of the National Labor Relations Board, a federal judge saw fit to issue a stark reminder of the limits of presidential power.

“A President who touts an image of himself as a ‘king’ or a ‘dictator,’ perhaps as his vision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the U.S. Constitution,” U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote last week. (Trump said during the campaign he’d be a “dictator” on the first day of his presidency. After scuttling New York City’s congestion pricing system last month, he proclaimed in capital letters on his social media site, “Long live the king!”)

Another judge, William Alsup, in the Northern District of California, ruled in a case involving the Trump administration’s firing of probationary federal workers: “The ongoing, en masse termination of probationary employees across the federal government’s agencies has sown significant chaos.”

At least four U.S. allies have publicly rebuked Trump in recent weeks over statements they’ve deemed untruthful or unwise.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave a speech last week addressing Trump by his first name, “Donald,” and telling him that imposing tariffs on Canada was “a very dumb thing to do.”

Aides to Trudeau had given him a draft of the speech beforehand. Deciding he wanted to say something stronger, Trudeau rewrote it, a Western government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely.

“Frankly he has had enough,” the official said of Trudeau.

“The Prime Minister spoke quite honestly and was saying the very least that he needed to say in order to deal directly with the level of contempt that has been shown by the president toward him as a person” and toward Canada, the official added.

Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, said in an interview: “We know Americans love Canadians and Canadians love Americans. This is one person. President Trump has created a total mess. He’s created uncertainty.”

“This isn’t the way you trade with your closest ally and your closest friend in the entire world.”

Both President Emmanuel Macron of France and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stepped in to correct Trump after he claimed Europeans were being paid back for the aid they’ve sent to Ukraine and that U.S. taxpayers had gotten stiffed.

Putting his hand on Trump’s arm in the Oval Office, Macron said without hesitation on Feb. 24, “No, in fact, to be frank, we pay. We paid 60% of the total effort.”

After Trump said in his Oval Office meeting with Starmer three days later, “We don’t get the money back,” Starmer told him: “We’re not getting all of ours. Quite a bit of ours was gifted.”

Both leaders were guests sitting with Trump in the Oval Office as reporters asked questions and the cameras rolled. That they felt compelled to interject and correct Trump is a rarity in such settings, where decorum and deference are the norm.

“Foreign leaders don’t normally criticize or correct each other on camera,” said Peter Westmacott, who has served as British ambassador to the U.S., France and Turkey. “But we aren’t living in normal times. Sometimes the president’s lies don’t matter. But sometimes, because of the office he holds, they do.”

Asked about those moments with Starmer and Macron, a White House official said Trump wasn’t bothered by either. Trump has a long relationship with Macron, and when the cameras were off, the president and Starmer seemed to forge a real connection, the official said.

What’s more, neither man interrupted in quite the same way as Zelenskyy, the official added. (Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, lost their temper with Zelenskyy after he recounted how Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken agreements made with his country over the past decade.)

When world leaders come to the Oval Office, they’re not in the habit of winging it. They arrive with points they want to make and rebuttals they’ve prepared in response to arguments they expect to hear, diplomats say.

As an example, prior to his first-ever meeting with Trump last month at the White House, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba huddled with advisers in Tokyo for more than 20 hours of preparatory meetings, a person familiar with the planning said.

All that homework paid off. Ishiba arrived for his Oval Office meeting bearing charts that clearly and colorfully illustrated Japan’s investments in the United States, the source said, the sorts of visual aids that Trump prefers.

Ishiba also brought a golden samurai helmet as a gift, two people familiar with the present told NBC News. In Japan, this often signifies prayers for prosperity and longevity.

So, when leaders like Macron and Starmer interject to tell Trump he’s wrong, it’s not something they do lightly; they feel they can’t let his statements stand unchallenged, diplomats said.

“It’s remarkable and certainly to my knowledge, at least, unprecedented. We have some of the most seasoned diplomatic leaders, Starmer and Macron, who know Trump and who know precisely how thin-skinned he is,” said Ned Price, a former State Department spokesman in the Biden administration.

“The fact that they did this in this setting, in front of reporters and cameras, only underscores the concerns they have about how these false assertions really get at the fabric of the alliance,” Price added.

The most natural impediment to Trump’s aspirations would be the opposition party. But Democrats have looked hapless following their defeat in the 2024 presidential race.

At Trump’s speech last week to a joint session of Congress, Democratic lawmakers sat in the House chamber holding up paddles reading “False.” Late night talk show hosts mocked that bit of theater.

But Jones sees a way for his party to emerge from exile. Eight years ago, he did the unthinkable in bright-red Alabama, winning a Senate seat. Now, he says, Democrats can recover if they choose their targets more selectively rather than object to the dizzying number of policy pronouncements and walk-backs coming from the West Wing.

“Democrats have struggled a little bit in part because there was so much hitting quickly,” Jones said. “It was like playing whack-a-mole. You go down one path and Trump reverses course. That may be by design to keep Democrats off their game, and it worked.”

“But Democrats are beginning to home in on key important points. Medicaid is a really big deal. Health care is a really big deal that’s important to a lot of the swing districts and a lot of red districts.”

“What you’re seeing is Democrats are begging to fine-tune a message. They won’t go down every rabbit hole the administration throws at them.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, is laying bare his style of diplomacy in the early weeks of his new term: It’s a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top.

The tactics are clear in his brewing trade war with Canada and Mexico, in his approach to Russia’s war on Ukraine and in his selection of the first country he will visit in his second term.

“President Trump approaches diplomacy and engages in a very transactional manner, with economics as the foundation and driving force behind international affairs,” retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the president’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, explained at an event in Washington this past week.

For Trump, it’s about leverage, not friendship; dollars as much as values; and hard power versus soft.

It’s not just a matter of negotiating style. At stake is the post-World War II international order as Trump’s actions raise doubts about American leadership around the globe. 

He’s shaping a foreign policy that’s more inward looking and conscious of the bottom line, dismissing American soft-power levers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development as dubious and riddled by waste and suggesting that the United States might not defend fellow NATO members that aren’t meeting defense spending benchmarks set by the alliance. 

Politics and presidents to a certain degree are all transactional. But Trump, who helped make himself a household name by burnishing an image as an intrepid real estate dealmaker, is taking it to another level as he navigates an increasingly complicated world.

The Republican president, in his previous life as a real estate titan, saw every deal as one in which there were clear winners and losers. In his return to the White House, he is more demonstrably injecting a what’s-in-it-for-me approach to his dealings with both friend and foe.

Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian who has studied the American presidency, said Trump’s “ledger” approach might not be the most practical way to conduct diplomacy.

Frantz observed that Trump, 78, a baby boomer and football fan, seems inspired in his foreign policymaking by the ethos of legendary pro football coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said, “Winning isn’t everything. It’s the only thing.”

“But diplomacy, especially in a more complicated world, might be more like soccer,” Frantz said. “Sometimes you just need a tie. Sometimes you need to just survive and move on.” 

Trump on Thursday told reporters that he has decided to make Saudi Arabia the first overseas visit of his new term because the oil-rich kingdom has agreed to make a huge investment in the United States over the next four years.

“They’ve gotten richer, we’ve all gotten older. So I said, ’I’ll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies,’” Trump said. He also made the kingdom his first overseas stop during his first White House term after the Saudis promised $450 billion in U.S. investment.

Trump acknowledged that the United Kingdom, one of America’s oldest allies, has traditionally been the first stop for U.S. presidents. But money talks.

In his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has highly focused on who has the leverage. Putin has “the cards” and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly.

Zelenskyy appeared to be making some strides in assuaging Trump after their recent rocky meeting in the Oval Office ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing the Ukrainian leader for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance provided in the three years since Russia invaded.

Zelenskyy said later that how that meeting went down was “regrettable.” He also made clear he was ready to sign off on a minerals deal with the U.S. — even without the explicit American security guarantees sought by the Ukrainians — that Trump wants.

In his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy’s fence-mending efforts. Trump also announced plans to send top advisers to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with Ukrainian officials. 

But soon Trump was back to criticizing Zelenskyy, saying he does not have the leverage to keep fighting the war with Russia.

“I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don’t have the cards,” Trump said. “In terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.”

Trump’s push on Zelenskyy — and pivot toward Moscow — marks a significant departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia since the Cold War.

Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. Deep skepticism toward Moscow, even in the best moments in the relationship, has been the standard operating posture in both Republican and Democratic administrations.

But Trump, who ran on a promise to quickly end the war, has veered from Democratic President Joe Biden’s approach of making no major decision that could impact Ukraine without Kyiv’s involvement.

At the same time, the new Republican administration has taken steps toward a more cooperative line with Putin, for whom Trump has long shown admiration.

Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. military aid for and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, halted offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command and disbanded a program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish the Kremlin for its invasion.

Kellogg, who also served in Trump’s first White House, recalled seeing Trump’s “transactional diplomacy approach” early in the first term. Kellogg said that the president’s first question in meetings with foreign leaders was often the same.

“As I found the very first time we were in the Cabinet room when a foreign official came in, the comment was, ’What is the trade imbalance between our two nations?’'' Kellogg recalled, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations event.

The trade ledger has been top of mind for Trump as he argues that for too long America has been played by friends and adversaries, including neighbors Canada and Mexico.

Trump last week announced 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. He then postponed most of them.

The White House insists the pending tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also at times suggested that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit. 

The president on Friday was back to excoriating Canada, this time complaining about policies he said are hurting American dairy farmers and the lumber industry. He said he will act soon to even the ledger with Canada through reciprocal tariffs.

“Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,” Trump said.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom Trump has taken to belittling as the governor of America’s 51st state, said his country will not be backing down from Trump’s trade war. 

The episode has underscored Trump’s willingness to embrace hard power to resolve differences, even if it means testing one of the world’s most durable and amicable alliances.

The center-left Trudeau was so flummoxed by Trump’s move that he found himself quoting the sharply conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page to make the point that this fight was unnecessary.

“It’s not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal,” Trudeau said. “But Donald, they point out that even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.”

Mother of injured Hamas hostage directs plea to 'every mother in this world' to help secure son's release amid uncertain negotiations.

The mother of Alon Ohel, a hostage taken from the Nova Music Festival Oct. 7, 2023, who remains in Hamas captivity, is pleading for her son’s release after the first phase of the ceasefire concluded last week, but no new deal for a second phase has yet been reached. 

""I think every mother in this world, if they just stopped for a second, would [they] even be able to breathe, knowing that their son or daughter have eaten dinner, are not getting any food – they're being starved, chained and in bad condition,"" Idit Ohel  told Fox News Digital. 

""Would they be able to just do anything?  It's unbearable. It's just unbearable."" 

AFTER TRUMP THREAT, HAMAS REFUSES TO RELEASE MORE HOSTAGES WITHOUT PHASE 2 CEASEFIRE DEAL

Alon and 58 others, including one individual taken separately from the Oct. 7 attacks, remains a hostage after 518 days since the October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel.

During the attack, Alon hid in a bomb shelter outside the Nova music festival and was injured when shrapnel hit his right eye. 

Footage shared with Fox News Digital showed the harrowing state he and others were in during the attack and their subsequent abduction.

According to Israelis who were held hostage with Alon, his injury was never properly treated, and he is now at risk of going blind in both eyes, Idit explained.

Alon was confirmed last month to still be alive after the release of three hostages who were held with him. He is now believed to be held on his own.

""I have no idea where Allen is right now, but I do know as a mother that I'm frightened for him, and I know that he needs to be back as soon as possible. It's urgent,"" Idit explained to Fox News Digital.

President Donald Trump this week met with hostages released from Gaza who told the president they believed he had ""been sent by God"" to secure their release.

Idit, who is Israeli, has not heard from either the Trump administration or from Netanyahu’s office.

But she believes Trump will help to return her son.

""I know that Trump can bring my son home. I know this because he has the power to do it. And when he wants something, he does it,"" Idit said. ""I'm rooting for him.

""I came all the way from Israel to D.C. to make sure that I’m heard, that Alon is heard,"" she added. ""I'm advocating for him. Alon is being held. He can't speak.""

News this week revealed the Trump administration was directly communicating with Hamas to secure the release of five American hostages still held in Gaza, including the only surviving American, Edan Alexander.

Reports also noted that the administration was directly negotiating with the terrorist organization, an unprecedented move that has reportedly frustrated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to try to secure a 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of 10 hostages.

But there are 25 hostages still believed to be alive, including Ohel.

In a direct message to her son, Idit said, ""We pray for you, and I am doing everything in my power to make sure that you are not forgotten. 

""You are not forgotten,"" she added. ""People here think about you every day, and they want to save you and want to bring you back home. 

""Your father and I, and your sister and your brother, are with you all the time.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news,Trump suggests Ukraine ‘may not survive’ war — even with help from US,https://nypost.com/2025/03/09/world-news/trump-suggests-ukraine-may-not-survive-war-even-with-us-help/,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 17:37:28 GMT","

President Trump suggested that Ukraine might not be able to survive against Russia even if the US forged ahead with full-blown support for its fight.

Trump’s remarks came while defending his decision to draw down support to Ukraine in the face of Polish President Andrzej Duda’s and others’ concerns that Europe lacks the might to prop up Kyiv without the US.

“Well, it may not survive anyway,” Trump told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” in an interview that aired Sunday.

“We have some weaknesses with Russia,” Trump added. “It takes two. Look, it was not going to happen — that war and it happened. So now we’re stuck with this mess.”

Last week, CIA director John Ratcliffe confirmed that most intelligence sharing with Ukraine has been paused.

The Trump administration has also halted aid to Ukraine. Ukraine peace envoy Keith Kellogg has publicly said that the US could resume intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine if Kyiv finalizes a mineral agreement.

Ukrainian and American officials are set to meet in Saudi Arabia this week.

Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky got into a blow-up during a meeting inside the Oval Office that was captured on camera late last month. Following that spat, the White House booted Zelensky, and the mineral deal that was set to be finalized during that visit was left unsigned.

“You don’t have the cards right now,” Trump sternly told Zelensky during their heated clash. 

Zelensky, 47, later penned a note to Trump, conveying gratitude for US aid to Ukraine and expressing a desire to end the bloody conflict. 

“The letter reads: Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,” Trump recounted during an address to a joint session of Congress last week. 

In a break from the Biden administration’s policies, Trump has tried to position himself toward the center of the Russia-Ukraine war, whereas previous US policy had been steadfastly behind Kyiv. 

The president has prioritized his objective of brokering peace between the two warring countries and believes that a less hostile stance toward Russia will make that possible. 

Much of his focus has been on putting pressure on Ukraine — at least in the public eye. But last week, Trump also threatened sanctions and other penalties against Russia as Moscow continued bombarding Ukraine amid the president’s efforts to pursue peace. 

Russia is already facing some of the fiercest sanctions the US has ever dished out due to its unprovoked invasion of neighboring Ukraine. 

Despite his recent warning against Russia, Trump clarified that he finds it “more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine” than Russia, as Kyiv scrambles to defend its lands from foreign invaders. 

At home, Trump has faced pro-Ukraine protests outside the White House and around Washington, DC, from demonstrators who bemoan his departure from prior US policy of steadfastly backing Kyiv. 

Ukraine had widely been expected to quickly fold under pressure from the Russian military since its invasion began. Nearly three years later, Kyiv’s government is still intact, and the two warring nations have found themselves ensnared in protracted warfare.

BEIJING — As President Donald Trump gave a fiery and divisive speech to a joint session of Congress last week, a much more staid political event was underway on the other side of the world.

The annual gathering of the National People’s Congress, China’s parliament is tightly choreographed, with all decisions made in advance by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Security is even tighter than usual around central Beijing and armies of volunteers wearing red armbands are stationed on street corners and at subway stations.

Though there are few surprises and no debate, the weeklong National People’s Congress does offer clues to China’s priorities at home and how it plans to approach the world.

Even as it faces a slowing economy, China appears to be making a strategic decision to present itself as a global stalwart amid a world in turmoil as Trump upends international trade and long-standing alliances, eroding U.S. prestige and creating an opportunity for China to fill the void.

As if to underscore China’s relative steadfastness, Foreign Minister Wang Yi rarely gestured or moved his hands at his annual news conference on Friday. He used the word “stability” at least 14 times during 90 minutes in front of reporters, according to Chinese transcripts.

Some of his sharpest language was directed at the Trump administration, which last week doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% and said there could be more to come.

“No country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while developing good relations with China on the other,” Wang said, slamming what he called a “two-faced approach.”

China has long complained about U.S. tariffs, which in the first Trump administration set off a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. But at least outwardly, China doesn’t appear overly concerned about the impact of the new tariffs or in a rush to placate Trump to stave off more.

“Nobody worries about it,” tech executive Yao Lijun told NBC News on Wednesday as he walked out of the Great Hall of the People, an ornate building next to Tiananmen Square in Beijing where some 3,000 Chinese leaders and lawmakers were gathered for the NPC.

“We only focus on ourselves, how we can do much better,” he said. “We don’t worry about others.”

China responded to the new tariff on Tuesday by announcing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, mostly agricultural products, in a measured move similar to the levies it imposed when the first 10% tariff took effect last month.

“Appearing alarmed or alarmist is not something Beijing wants to communicate, because that’s precisely what Trump is trying to elicit,” said Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai.

Though Wang avoided saying anything too provocative on Friday, earlier in the week Beijing called back to its more aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy of the past, with the Foreign Ministry saying, “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.”

It was the harshest rhetoric from Beijing since Trump returned to office in January.

The message from those comments is clear, said Wang Dong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University in Beijing. China will resolutely defend its national interests, and any U.S. attempt to force it into submission “will backfire and fail,” he said.

“China will use a ‘tit for tat’ strategy, meaning if the U.S. shifts to conflict, China will follow suit and retaliate,” he said. “When the U.S. reverts back to cooperation, China will do the same.”

Cooperation did not appear to be on Trump’s mind on Tuesday as he told Congress he would impose reciprocal tariffs on “friend and foe” starting April 2.

His “America First” speech sent the message that “the U.S. only cares about its own interests and will pursue them in a relentless and ruthless manner, without caring about international rules or norms,” Wang, the professor, said in written comments.

He noted that Trump had withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, both of which he touted in his address to Congress. Such moves signal the U.S. is no longer interested in upholding the liberal values and rules-based international order it has championed since the end of World War II, Prof. Wang said.

“By contrast, China’s message is it is willing to work with other stakeholders and the international community to tackle common global challenges such as climate change,” he said.

In keeping with the stability theme, Chinese officials announced the same target for economic growth as last year: 5%. Likewise, China’s 2025 increase in defense spending is staying the same as last year at 7.2%.

Delivering a government work report at the opening session on Wednesday, Premier Li Qiang, China’s No. 2 official, did not mention Trump but noted rising unilateralism and protectionism around the world and indicated China would pursue the opposite.

“China is ready to work with other members of the international community to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world,” he said.

Li acknowledged China’s significant economic challenges, which include a persistent property crisis, high youth unemployment and sluggish consumer spending. And in a nod to U.S. tariffs and other measures, he said, “An increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science and technology.”

“Regardless of changes in the external environment, we should remain steadfast in our commitment to opening up,” Li said. “We will continue to expand our globally oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.”

China is counting on its trade relationships with other countries to help its export-dependent economy withstand Trump’s tariffs, the cost of which U.S. and other experts say will be almost entirely passed on to American consumers and importers.

“To be frank, with this kind of tariff war, both countries suffer,” said Zhang Weiwei, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai and the director of its China Institute.

“But the U.S. will suffer more.”

Elon Musk says the ""entire frontline"" in Ukraine would collapse if he chose to turn off his Starlink internet system. Elsewhere, Russian special forces reportedly crept through a gas pipeline to launch a surprise attack on Ukrainian soldiers in Kursk. Listen to Trump 100 as you scroll.

Sunday 9 March 2025 18:50, UK

Donald Trump has said Volodymyr Zelenskyy took money from the US under the Biden administration like ""candy from a baby"".

In an interview with Fox News, the US president reiterated that he thought his Ukrainian counterpart was not ""grateful"" but did go on to describe him as ""smart"" and ""tough"".

Trump repeated his claim that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 ""would never have happened"" if he was president.

He was also asked about critics who claimed Trump was easing political pressure on Russia, to which he responded by saying ""nobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump"", adding ""remember, I'm the one that stopped the pipeline - Nord Stream 2"".

Trump's comments come as US officials are set to meet with their Ukrainian counterparts this coming week in Saudi Arabia.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will take part in talks on the American side, as he did with Russian officials in Riyadh last month.

Russia's defence ministry has said its forces have recaptured three more settlements in the western Kursk region.

A ministry statement on Telegram said Russian troops were now in control of Malaya Lokhnya, Cherkasskoye Porechnoye and Kositsa.

It comes after open source maps showed this week that Ukraine's positions in Kursk have deteriorated sharply, with reports yesterday suggesting Ukrainians were nearly surrounded by Russians (see our 9.53am post).

Footage has also emerged showing Russian soldiers creeping through a disused gas pipeline to launch a surprise attack - see our 3.57pm post to watch the video.

This morning, Russia's defence ministry said its forces had retaken another village in Kursk and even seized a Ukrainian village across the border in the Sumy region.

For context: Thousands of Ukrainian troops stormed into Russia's Kursk region last August, partly as a way of diverting parts of Moscow's army away from the frontline in eastern Ukraine.

Analysts believed Kyiv had been hoping to use its presence in Kursk as leverage over Russia in any peace talks.

It's just gone 6pm in the UK, 8pm in Kyiv and 9pm in Moscow.

If you're just joining us, here's everything you need to know:

The UK is committed to ""leading from the front"" to bring together European allies to ensure security, Defence Secretary John Healey has said.

Writing in The Telegraph, Healey said: ""As global threats increase, our national security and our economic security are both at stake.

""From deepening our US-UK relationship to striving for peace in Europe and ensuring the benefits of increasing defence investment are felt here at home, Britain is committed to leading from the front to secure our future.""

Healey described the ""unique relationship"" between the US and UK as being ""as strong as ever"" and said the two countries will continue to collaborate closely on military operations, intelligence gathering and the development of advanced technologies.

On the decision to boost UK defence spending, Healey said: ""This isn't just a crucial move for our national security in the face of increasing global threats, it means defence will be an engine to drive economic growth across the UK.""

We've brought you comments from Elon Musk this afternoon, who said the ""entire frontline"" in Ukraine would collapse if he chose to turn off his Starlink internet system (see our 2pm post).

It comes after US negotiators pressing Kyiv for access to Ukraine's critical minerals raised the possibility of cutting the country's access to the service, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters in February. 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has now weighed in, stating ""no one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink"" in a post on X.

He was responding to a post from Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski, and urged him to ""say thank you because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago"".

""Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,"" he added.

Poland, which pays for Ukraine's Starlink internet services, said it may seek an alternative if Musk's company proves to be ""unreliable"".

Senior Western and Ukrainian officials have indicated that the pause on US intelligence to Ukraine has already helped Russian forces advance in the battlefield.

An ""unspecified"" officer has also told Time that the US pause on military aid has left Ukrainian forces unable to use ""some of their best weapons systems"".

Meanwhile, a source in the Ukrainian government is reported to have stated that Ukrainian operations in Kursk have been impacted the most, and that Ukrainian forces have lost the ability to detect Russian aircraft approaching Ukraine.

The Institute for the Study of War said - while it cannot independently verify the statements on the ground - it continues to assess that the complete suspension of US intelligence sharing would damage Ukraine's ability to defend against Russia's offensive operations.

Pro-Russian military bloggers have said Russian special forces recently walked miles along the inside of a major gas pipeline before surprising Ukrainian forces near Sudzha (see our 9.53am post).

Footage circulating on Telegram appears to show the soldiers creeping through a disused gas pipeline for several miles to launch the surprise attack.

Watch the video below...

Earlier, we told you Latvia's president has urged European countries to ""absolutely"" introduce conscription, as he conceded the continent was ""quite weak"" militarily (see our 8.50am post).

But senior cabinet minister Pat McFadden has told Sky News the UK is not considering conscription.

""We're not considering conscription, but of course, we've announced a major increase in defence expenditure a couple of weeks ago - and we do have to recognise that the world has changed here,"" he said on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips.

Asked if the UK's military will increase in size, McFadden said it's best to wait for the strategic defence review before nailing down where the spending increase will go.

But he notes that ""you would not spend that money today on the same things as you would 10 years ago"".

Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia has carried out ""hundreds of attacks"" against Ukrainians this week.

Posting on X, Ukraine's president said ""around 1,200 guided aerial bombs, nearly 870 attack drones, and over 80 missiles"" had been used by Moscow.

He said: ""Every day, we work with our partners to ensure that decisions are made to provide life-saving support: air defence systems, investments in our defence production, and the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. 

""We continue our efforts to bring a just peace closer and ensure reliable security guarantees.""

The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said last Friday was one of 2025's deadliest attacks for Ukrainian civilians, with at least 22 people killed in various Russian attacks.

By Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor, and Azad Safarov, Ukraine producer

It ""cuts my heart"" and is a ""betrayal"".

This was the response of a Ukrainian soldier in a frontline combat regiment directly affected by Donald Trump's decision to pause US military support to Ukraine.

Serhii, 45, maintains a unit of US-supplied Bradley infantry fighting vehicles that are defending an area of eastern Ukraine from attacking Russian forces.

The halt to American military aid - if sustained - means there will be no new ammunition and no ability to repair any of the vehicles when they are damaged - a constant risk.

On a recent mission by the 425th Storming Regiment ""Skala"", three Bradleys went into battle towards the direction of the city of Pokrovsk, an area of heavy clashes.

Only two returned after the other was hit by the Russian side.

""It's going to be very hard,"" Serhii said, standing next to a large Bradley, covered by a camouflage net and tucked under a line of trees in the Donetsk region.

""These vehicles are really good. You can fight back with them. And not just defend, you can even advance. It's a shame we didn't have this equipment two or three years ago.""

Edgars Rinkevics also told Sky News that European countries should increase defence spending amid the ""ups and downs"" in relations with the US.

The Latvian president has urged European countries to ""absolutely"" introduce conscription, as he conceded the continent was ""quite weak"" militarily. 

Edgars Rinkevics told Sky's Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips that European countries should increase defence spending amid the ""ups and downs"" in relations with the US.

Latvia introduced conscription for men in 2023 and has pushed defence spending to 4% of the country's GDP.

""Seeing what is happening in the world, the decision that we took - many other European countries need to follow that,"" Mr Rinkevics said.

""A lot of people are a little bit nervous. People are following the news. Of course strong reassurances [are] one thing, but another thing is other European governments [have] to make sure that we all get stronger.""

UK Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said the government is not considering introducing conscription, but decisions may be needed in the future to respond to the ""new reality"" we are now living in.

He said: ""We are not considering conscription, but of course we have announced a major increase in defence expenditure.

But Mr Rinkevics said he believes that both Europe and the US ""understand the risks and the threats"" of the future of NATO.

""An attack against any of NATO member means an attack against other NATO members, Europeans and non-Europeans. If there is a failure to fulfil article five, then I think everybody really understands this is the end of NATO.""

While calling Latvia and fellow Baltic states Estonia and Lithuania the ""litmus test of NATO"", Mr Rinkevics also called for an increase in ""the overall presence"" on the countries' borders with Russia amid ""increasing risks"".

""What is now important is not only declarations, but also how those declarations are being implemented. I'm fine with the wordings, but we also need some deeds,"" he said.

After the US's change in long-standing policy towards Russia and Ukraine in recent weeks, Mr Rinkevics insisted that Latvia's cooperation with the US is ""good"" but insisted that ""we do see the need also to apply equal pressure vis-a-vis Russia when it comes to the peace talks in Ukraine"".

He said: ""I do see that the United States are right when it comes to requesting more defence spending for NATO European allies. But what I also believe is needed is the kind of diplomatic approach that we tried to explain our point of view to the United States.

""We are concentrating very much on the United States. Unfortunately, what we are not talking so much [about is] what we as Europe should do, and we see that Europe currently is quite weak.

""We all understand that we do not have military capacity, but we also understand that we need to build it up. So my current suggestion would be - while I do see some differences with the United States when it comes to how to approach Ukraine - to concentrate on our own task to raise defence expenditure.""

The three Baltic countries - located on NATO's eastern flank with Russia - are among the highest defence spenders in NATO as a percentage of GDP.

They are also, relative to their size, among the biggest supporters of Ukraine and have been the strongest voices in Europe raising the alarm about the threat posed by President Vladimir Putin for years.","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}"

From showcasing rare art exhibitions to curating a workshop for Gond tribal art that celebrates the tribe's cultural heritage and connection to nature, the Harvard India Conference, held in February, provided the perfect opportunity for Indian art forms for a global audience. 

It was heartening to see that the two-day conference, which had the best of global and Indian leaders from all walks of life, provided adequate avenues for several Indian art forms to be displayed prominently. 

Over the two-day conference, which took place at the Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Business School, showcased Murgikala which reinterpret Indian arts through its illustrations and Rag Dream Weavers that is reimagining public spaces with street children.

The reason the conference chose many such artists was probably best explained by Arundhati, a second-year student at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Most artists create work that is at the cross section of promoting gender equality, championing arts in public spaces and governance.

Pictures by India's most celebrated dance photographer - Avinash Pasricha -- at the Harvard Business School provided a perfect primer for performing arts. These world-renowned artists have been the perfect bridge between Indian arts and the world, and the early ambassadors of India's growing soft power.

Beyond art, the session on venture capital and private equity highlighted the power of ideas. The session was one of the most well-attended ones and attracted a large number of young professionals keen to start a big venture of their own. 

(The author was a speaker at the Harvard India Conference 2025).



Brimming with innovative ideas, the session covered everything from the reason big investors stick to few sectors to how first-time promoters can raise funding. Manish Kejriwal, Deep Nishar and Akrit Dokania offered fresh ideas to HBS students keen on a global corporate career.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

 Kathmandu, Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah on Sunday arrived here amidst tight security, as pro-monarchy activists gathered at the airport to welcome him. 

 As soon as Gyanendra landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport from Pokhara on board the Simrik Air helicopter, hundreds of loyalists, including leaders and cadres of pro-monarchists Rastriya Prajatantra Party, started chanting slogans in his favour. 

 The crowd carried placards with slogans such as ""We want our King back,"" ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy,"" and ""The King and the country are dearer than our life."" 

 Gyanendra, 77, returned to Kathmandu from Pokhara after visiting religious places in different parts of the country. 

 Hundreds of loyalists riding motorbikes carrying Gyanendra's picture and national flags greeted him on both sides of the road outside the airport. 

 Dozens of riot policemen were guarding the Narayanhity Palace Museum, the erstwhile royal palace of the former king as there were rumours that Gyanendra would enter the palace along with his supporters. 

 However, no untoward incidents occurred as the crowd following Gyanendra headed towards Nirmal Niwas, the private residence of the former monarch on the outskirts of Kathmandu. 

 Hundreds of security personnel were deployed from the Kathmandu airport to the Nirmal Niwas to avert any untoward incident. 

 King supporters have been rallying in different parts of the country, including Kathmandu and Pokhara, for the past few days, demanding the reinstatement of the monarchy abolished in 2008 following the People's Movement. 

 Manisha Koirala, a popular Bollywood actress who is also the granddaughter of the first elected prime minister B P Koirala, on her social media, requested all the Nepalese to gather at the Kathmandu airport to welcome the former monarch. 

 The pro-monarchists have become active since the democracy day in February when Gyanendra said, ""Time has come for us to assume responsibility to protect the country and bring about national unity.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news,He's the face of Trump's tariffs. But 9/11 attacks put Howard Lutnick on the national stage,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/howard-lutnick-trump-tariffs-september-11-1.7475499,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Howard Lutnick took his five-year-old son to school for his first day of kindergarten, causing the Wall Street CEO to be a little late getting to work at his World Trade Center office in New York City.

That delay ended up saving the life of Lutnick, who is now the U.S. commerce secretary and has become a leading figure in the current trade war with Canada.

But on 9/11, every one of his 658 employees at the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald who were at the office that morning, including Lutnick's younger brother Gary, were killed when 1 WTC, the North Tower, was deliberately struck by hijacked American Airlines Flight 11. At the time, the firm had 960 employees based in New York.

Two days later, a grief-stricken and weeping Lutnick appeared on television, interviewed by then-ABC News journalist Connie Chung. Breaking down several times during the interview, Lutnick described how he went from hospital to hospital, searching for employees still unaccounted for.

""I don't go to a hospital or get anyone to go to any hospital and say, 'Find Gary Lutnick for me,'"" he said. ""I go with employee lists and say, 'Here' my list, here's everybody I got, find somebody on this list. I don't care who they are.'""

Following the broadcast, Lutnick made other media appearances, most notably on CNN with Larry King, and became somewhat of a national figure, representing just one of those who had suffered both personal and professional losses.

His image then certainly contrasts with the one Canadians see now — the confident pitchman for U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs against Canadian exports to the United States.

Since the Feb. 1 announcement by Trump of 25 per cent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico going to the U.S., Lutnick — whose responsibilities as commerce secretary include imposing trade restrictions — has been making the rounds of U.S. media networks, blasting Canada for not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl, singing the praises of tariffs but also hinting there could be some potential exemptions or compromises.

(On Thursday, Trump announced he was pausing tariffs on some Canadian goods until April 2.)

But even before Lutnick became commerce secretary, he had been an outspoken supporter of Trump's tariff plan, and as part  of Trump's inner circle, co-chair of his transition team.

When he was appointed commerce secretary, Lutnick stepped down as CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, where, according to its website, he led the firm for four decades and rebuilt it after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

At that time, the firm had offices among the top five floors of the 110-storey North Tower. When the plane flew into floors 93 to 99 of the tower at 8:46 a.m., it trapped those people who worked above.

Lutnick's company lost more employees than any other firm in 9/11 — more than two-thirds of its workforce and more than a third of the total killed at the North Tower.

""We lost every person in our office ... all the brokers, all the traders, all the salespeople at work. We lost them all,"" he said days later during an interview with CNN's Larry King.

Lutnick said that when he was at his son's school that morning, his phone kept ringing and disconnecting.

""I later learned it was my brother Gary trying to call to say goodbye,"" he said in a social media post last Sept 11, commemorating the attacks.

He also discovered that his brother had called their sister and told her ""he wasn't going to make it and the smoke was coming in and things were bad,"" he recounted to King, sobbing.

""And he called and said goodbye and that he loved her and for her to tell me that he, that he loved me.""

Happy birthday to Gary, my spectacular brother. I lost you on 9/11, but you will be missed and loved forever. <a href=""https://t.co/jcRIC0QMCG"">pic.twitter.com/jcRIC0QMCG</a>

Lutnick said when he eventually arrived at the building, he watched people fleeing and would ""grab and shake them,"" asking what floor they were on, hoping to find someone from floors 101 to 105, where Cantor Fitzgerald's offices were located, he told Chung.

""I knew if I got one employee, if one person came down from that floor, that I know that there had to be others,"" he said.

Lutnick made contact with someone fleeing the building from the 91st floor, but nothing higher. He was then forced to run as the second World Trade Center tower began to collapse after being struck by another plane.

He said he tried to get ahead of the  giant plume of smoke but was knocked down underneath a truck. He was completely covered in dust and just walked for hours, eventually calling his wife, he said.

That emotional and compelling interview with Chung engendered widespread sympathy, as it was jarring for the public to see the CEO of a Wall Street firm break down.

Yet that sympathy was short-lived. Lutnick soon faced immense scorn when it was learned that just days after the attacks, he had cut off the paycheques of those employees who at the time were missing and presumed dead.

That backlash included criticism from some of the widows of those employees. Chung did a followup story, this time interviewing some of the widows who were angry with Lutnick's salary termination.

""Don't expect these women to cry for Lutnick,"" Chung reported. ""Days after the tragedy, he did something they can neither forgive nor forget.""

Lutnick at the time acknowledged he was getting inquires from widows asking about the salary for their husbands.

""They call me and they say, 'How come you can't pay my salary? Why can't you pay my husband's salary? Other companies pay their [dead and missing employees'] salary, why can't you,'"" he told CNN's King.

""But, you see, I lost everybody in the company, so I can't pay their salary. They think we're doing something wrong. I can't pay their salaries,"" Lutnick said, again weeping.

Yet he defended that decision to cut off the paycheques and insisted he had no choice.

""I needed my bankers to know that I was in control,"" Lutnick told the New York Times in a 2011 interview. ""That I wasn't sentimental and that I was no less motivated or driven to make my business survive.""

He made good on his pledge to provide the families with 25 per cent of the firm's profits over the next five years — totalling $180 million US —and pay for their health care for the next 10 years.

U.S. commerce secretary hints at more tariff talks with Canada

Meanwhile, some of the family members who had been critical of Lutnick reversed their opinion and offered praise for his efforts.

Lutnick was able to rebuild and grow Cantor Fitzgerald and become a billionaire in the process. But the Sept. 11 attacks, and those lost at his firm, still remain close to the surface.

Just recently at his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate's commerce committee, Lutnick choked up as he recalled the events of that day and those killed.

 Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Sunday that US President Donald Trump's plan to remove Palestinians from war-battered Gaza was ""taking shape"", despite widespread rejection by governments in the region. 

 ""This plan is taking shape, with ongoing actions in coordination with the administration,"" Smotrich told an event in the Israeli parliament, adding that preparations were underway to form a managing body that would oversee displacement. 

 ""This has the potential to create a historic change in the Middle East and for the state of Israel,"" said Smotrich, who has repeatedly backed resuming the war against Hamas and has expressed support for re-establishing permanent Israeli presence in the territory. 

 The plan proposed by Trump would require finding countries willing to take in at least some of the Gaza Strip's 2.4 million people, Smotrich noted. 

 ""It involves identifying key countries, understanding their interests both with the US and with us and fostering cooperation,"" he said. 

 Implementing the plan, which other Israeli leaders have welcomed but Palestinians, Arab governments and some world leaders have condemned, would be a massive logistical operation, said Smotrich. 

 ""Just to give you an idea if we remove 10,000 people a day, seven days a week, it will take six months,"" he said. 

 ""If we remove 5,000 people a day, it will take a year. Of course, this is assuming we have countries willing to take them, but these are very, very, very long processes."" 

 Experts have said that forcibly removing Gazans would amount to a violation of international law. 

 Just days after he took office, Trump triggered global outrage when he suggested the US take over Gaza and turn it into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"", while forcing its Palestinian inhabitants to relocate to neighbouring Egypt and Jordan. 

 Last week, an Arab counterproposal to Trump's plan was put forward, with several Islamic nations and European governments endorsing it. 

 The Arab proposal aims to rebuild Gaza without displacing Gazans, who endured more than 15 months of devastating war before a fragile ceasefire took effect on January 19. 

 Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said the Arab plan was a ""good-faith first step from the Egyptians"", even as other Israeli and US officials have expressed reservations. 

 Smotrich said he was pushing for Trump's plan to happen, calling it ""an opportunity to bring an end to the conflict"" between Israel and the Palestinians. 

 Since Israel's creation in 1948 and ""until today, we have been dragging this along for 76 years, searching for solutions... With the current administration, we will do much more.""

 The EU still sees the United States as ""allies"" despite President Donald Trump's verbal broadsides against the bloc, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday, while stressing the need for Europe to ""step up"" on defence. 

 Asked in a news conference if she saw a need to redefine Brussels's approach to Washington, as it has already done towards Beijing, von der Leyen said the answer was ""a clear no it's a completely different relationship that we have with the United States than we have with China"". 

 ""Of course the US are allies,"" she told reporters in Brussels. 

 ""Yes, there are differences... but if you look at the common interests that we have, they always outweigh our differences,"" she said, adding: ""We will have our differences. We have to sort them out."" 

 Trump has repeatedly threatened to slap tariffs on the European Union, and his alignment with Russia on Ukraine has deeply unsettled European officials. The US leader has also thrown up questions about US security commitments to Europe under the NATO umbrella. 

 Von der Leyen, speaking in general terms, stated that in the world today ""everything has become transactional"". 

 There was a growing sense of urgency within the 27-nation EU because ""something fundamental has shifted. Our European values democracy, freedom, the rule of law are under threat,"" she said. 

 ""The world around us is changing at lightning speed. Geopolitical shifts are shaking alliances. Decade-old certainties are crumbling."" 

 When questioned specifically about the future of the transatlantic relationship with the United States, von der Leyen said that, while an allied bond persisted, ""this does not mean that the pattern that we had the last... 25 to 30 years... is still the right one"". 

 She stated that the changing tone of US ties was ""a very strong wake-up call, and Europe's moment now really to step up in defence and giving ourselves the posture that we need"". 

 The bloc has already sent a clear signal it is moving in that direction, with an EU summit on Thursday agreeing to mobilise about 800 billion euros to boost defence spending, which has long been urged by Washington, the EU chief said. 

 ""We are allies, but this means that all allies have to take their responsibilities,"" she said. 

 Von der Leyen added that, within the ""next weeks"", she would call the bloc's first-ever meeting of EU commissioners focused on ""external and internal security, to energy, defence and research"" and including cybersecurity, trade and ""foreign interference"".

	An armed man believed to be travelling from Indiana was shot by US Secret Service agents near the White House after a confrontation early Sunday, according to authorities.


	No one else was injured in the shooting that happened around midnight about a block from the White House, according to a Secret Service statement. President Donald Trump was in Florida at the time of the shooting.


	The Secret Service received information from local police about an alleged suicidal individual who was travelling from Indiana and found the man's car and a person matching his description nearby.


	As officers approached, the individual brandished a firearm and an armed confrontation ensued, during which shots were fired by our personnel, the Secret Service said in a statement.


	The man was hospitalised. The Secret Service said his condition was unknown.


	The Metropolitan Police Department will investigate because the shooting involved law enforcement officers. A message left Sunday for the police department wasn't immediately returned.

WASHINGTON — As U.S. and Ukrainian officials prepare to meet in Saudi Arabia this week, President Donald Trump has privately made clear to aides that a signed minerals deal between Washington and Kyiv won’t be enough to restart aid and intelligence sharing with the war-torn country, according an administration official and another U.S. official.

Trump wants the deal, which would give the U.S. a stake in Ukraine’s mineral resources, signed. But he also wants to see a change in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s attitude toward peace talks, the officials said, including a willingness to make concessions such as giving up territory to Russia. Trump also wants Zelenskyy to make some movement toward elections in Ukraine and possibly toward stepping down as his country’s leader, the officials said.

Elections in Ukraine have been paused under the country’s constitutional provision for martial law, which has been in effect since Russia invaded in 2022.

“As President Trump demonstrated by reading President Zelenskyy’s message at the joint session, the Ukrainians have made positive movement. With meetings in Saudi this coming week, we look forward to hearing more positive movement that will hopefully ultimately end this brutal war and bloodshed,” White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said when asked about Trump’s requirements.

Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine in the aftermath of the U.S. pause in equipment and intelligence sharing this week, making Friday one of the deadliest days for civilians this year, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Most of the casualties occurred in the Donetsk region, in territory controlled by Ukraine. Casualty numbers have been higher so far in 2025 than in 2024, the monitoring agency said.

The U.S. does not have any indication that the pause in intelligence sharing had a direct impact on the Russian attacks, according to the U.S. official and the administration official. They said these large attacks were likely planned before the intelligence and aid stopped.

Congressional Republicans are applying pressure on the White House to restart both aid and intelligence, and the two officials said they are optimistic the flow of weapons and equipment and sharing of intelligence could be restored as early as next week, especially after Zelenskyy pronounced that Ukraine is “ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible.” The Ukrainian president also said he and his team “stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.”

The officials said the U.S. is still sharing defensive intelligence with Ukraine — that is, information that helps Ukraine’s self-defense against attacks — explaining that they still have a duty to warn. But they are not providing targeting information against Russian targets. That means the U.S. can warn Ukraine when intelligence shows that Russians are preparing an attack, but they can no longer provide the targeting coordinates for Ukraine to strike first.

The U.S. has provided Ukraine with targeting information, satellite imagery and signals intelligence for most of the past three years.  European allies are now working to bridge some of the gaps, but the lack of U.S. intelligence is already having an impact on Ukraine every day, according to a Western official.

“Every day hurts Ukraine, and every day gives Russia a more favorable position,” the official said.

President Trump defended his administration's economic policy after he imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada last week and then rolled some of those levies back, causing what critics say is uncertainty for businesses and the broader economy. 

During an interview with Fox News Channel's Sunday Morning Futures, Trump dismissed concerns over his back-and-forth tariffs and said they ""could go up."" 

Fox News' Maria Bartiromo asked Trump whether he expects a recession during his first year in office. The president couldn't say. 

""I hate to predict things like that,"" Trump said. ""There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of it takes a little time.""

There are some signs that the economy may be headed toward a recession, but Howard Lutnick, the Commerce secretary, told NBC's Meet the Press there was ""no chance"" of one.

Last week, the Trump administration said it would place a 25% tariff on cars and auto parts from Mexico and Canada. Soon after, the White House announced a one-month delay on the measure after carmakers Ford, Stellantis and General Motors called the president. During his interview with Bartiromo, Trump explained the move. 

""This is short term and I felt for the good of the American carmakers,"" Trump said. ""I thought it would be a fair thing to do. And so I gave them a little bit of a break for this short period of time.""   

Criticism from automakers notwithstanding, Sean Fain, the head of the United Auto Workers, called the tariffs an ""attempt to stop the bleeding"" in the American economy.

Tariffs ""aren't the end solution,"" he told ABC's This Week, ""but they are a huge factor in fixing this problem.""

Meanwhile, the stock market had it's worst week in 6 months with the S&P 500 dropping 3.1% and Nasdaq down 3.45%. Fox News' Bartiromo asked the president whether the uncertainty over tariffs — which many economist say is causing stocks to slump — will continue or if there will be clarity for businesses.  

""Well I think so,"" Trump said. ""But you know the tariffs could go up as time goes by and they may go up.""

Trump also said he still plans to put  in place next month ""reciprocal"" tariffs against all trading partners that have tariffs on U.S. goods. 

""April 2nd, it becomes all reciprocal,"" he said. ""What they charge us, we charge them.""

MOAB, Utah ‒ In a normal year, the streets of this picturesque desert town would be filled with SUVs loaded with camping gear, tall-tired Jeeps, mountain bikes ‒ and Canadians.

This is not a normal year.

""I know lots of people who come fairly regularly. And they're not coming this year,"" said Stephen Krause, 51, a Canadian tourist from Alberta after parking his Lexus SUV at the grocery store.

All along Main Street, the story is the same: Businesses are reporting a significant drop in Canadian tourists angered by President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff plans and his talk of making Canada the 51st state. And potential American visitors are also canceling or worrying about the impact of federal job cuts on nearby Arches and Canyonlands national parks, which draw 3.6 million visitors annually.

Trump's initial layoffs, with the promise of dramatically more to come, have shaken some members of this outdoorsy community, where about 6,300 federal employees are spread across the 3rd Congressional District. Advocates worry about damage to National Parks, dirty restrooms and traffic jams around popular attractions, including trails like Hell's Revenge, the Whole Enchilada or Metal Masher.

""There's been a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth,"" said Lorenzo McGregor, 45, the co-owner of Tex's Riverways, which boats canoers and backpackers down the Colorado River into otherwise inaccessible parts of Canyonlands.

McGregor said he's been getting a steady stream of cancellations from Canadian visitors citing Trump's cuts or threatened tariffs, estimating about $10,000 in losses already. He hopes the impact on tourism will be short-lived but is making plans to adapt operations if necessary.

But others are heartened by the cuts, which they hope will lighten the federal government's sometimes-heavy local footprint.

They want the job cuts to be the first step in rolling back some federal oversight of public lands, private development and energy development, especially when it comes to where people can drive their off-road vehicles, a longtime sore spot.

Moab got its big start during the uranium boom following World War II, when hundreds of Geiger-counter-wielding prospectors built roads and dug mines to extract the element U92, which by law they could sell only to the federal government. Many of those roads are now off-road trails.

Where some public lands advocates cheer when Democratic presidents have named new national monuments and assigned federal workers to manage them, some Utah conservatives remain angry at those moves, hearkening back to the Sagebrush Rebellion invoked by President Ronald Reagan, among others.

Like many business owners who deal with federal officials in the area, McGregor said he'd love to see the government reduce what he considers to be unnecessary paperwork and oversight. He's just not sure Trump's cuts are the most effective approach.

As an example, he said his newly signed Park Service concessionaire permit requires him to log onto a government website to buy a $6 permit every time he launches a boat to ferry people into Canyonlands ‒ even though the overall permit already governs how often he can launch boats.

""I 100% understand the perspective that the government needs to be more responsive,"" McGregor said. ""I just don't know if a Roman salute and a sledgehammer is the right way to go about it.""

As in many western states, Utah has long chafed under the thumb of the federal government, which owns about 68% of the state's land. State lawmakers have periodically floated proposals to force the federal government to turn some of that land over to them or sell it off for development.

Portions of that include internationally known parks like Arches, Zion and Bryce Canyon, but also vast tracts of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land, where development and oil extraction are largely banned. The Biden administration sought to further limit development on those lands, angering many locals who believe their economy would be better if they could diversify.

Although the 10,000 residents of Moab's Grand County supported Kamala Harris over Trump in the presidential election, Trump won Utah as whole with nearly 60% of the vote, and many elected officials support his efforts to shrink the federal bureaucracy.

Congresswoman Celeste Maloy, a Republican who represents the western half of Utah, said that while people often complain about the federal government having to do more work with fewer people, ""I'd like to see agencies do less with less.""

The Blue Ribbon Coalition, a group of outdoor-oriented businesses and advocates, has long battled with the federal government over access to public lands. The coalition has repeatedly sued to force agencies like the BLM over management plans that restrict vehicular access in favor of preserving wilderness.

Executive director Ben Burr said he's got lots of friends working for federal agencies, and doesn't want to see people lose their jobs. But the coalition also wants a dramatic shift in land managers' ""culture of no,"" Burr said.

""The bottom line is we want these agencies run by great people taking care of the resources we all like to go out and enjoy,"" he said. ""Too often, they see their job prioritizing dirt over everything else. And so you're prioritizing dirt over the American people. They have a big course correction they need to make.""

About 40,000 federal workers are stationed in Utah, and Trump's cuts have trimmed about 10,000 of those jobs so far, according to some estimates. Before the cuts, there were about 150 permanent and seasonal employees at Arches and Canyonlands, along with regional supervisors for the Park Service, Forest Service and BLM.

The average federal employee's salary is about $106,000, according to the Office of Personnel Management and they represent a consistent inflow of income to a county heavily reliant on seasonal tourism.

""It's a big story in our town because we're so dependent on federal lands,"" said Ashley Korenblat, the president of the Moab Chamber of Commerce.

Korenblat is also a recreation consultant who co-owns Western Spirit Cycling Adventures. She said the company has already lost at least one $10,000 booking from longtime Canadian customers angry about Trump's tariffs and threats, and she worries more cancellations are coming. And she said the permit coordinator the company works with in Yellowstone National Park got fired or laid off in one of Trump's recent cuts.

For outfitters, restaurateurs and hoteliers still climbing out of the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts, the cuts have generated significant uncertainty. It's not just that their friends and neighbors have lost jobs but that tourists who are now making summer vacation plans might not come if they think the parks won't be well run.

""I think you're going to see the parks without enough services. It's not going to be good,"" said Kursat Gokalp, 43, who has owned the Nuclear Bean Coffee Co. food truck since 2018. ""If there's no enforcement, no rangers, places might get trashed … (and) if it's trashed, people won't come.""

After announcing the fulltime Park Service staffing cuts, Trump said he wants to hire about 7,700 seasonal workers this summer, significantly more than the normal number of about 6,300 seasonals hired to help clean toilets, manage campgrounds, direct traffic and collect entrance fees. Despite that promise, the uncertainty lingers.

""We were really hoping things would turn around this year,"" said Steven Allred, 38, the co-owner of 4x4 rental service Moab Tour Company. ""People might assume the national parks will be shut down. That's my biggest concern: By far the majority of people who come to this town do something that’s connected to the national parks.""

Allred said in the summer, it would be common to hear French, German and Spanish being spoken inside one of the town's two grocery stores, but those international tourists have been dropping for the past several years, a combination of pandemic travel restrictions and a change of advertising focus by town leaders. He worries what the rest of 2025 will look like for his business.

""I'm very hopeful that people won’t let this short-term affect them,"" he said. ""There needs to be a little more foresight before you blanket fire people.""

Inside Arches, which is about five times the size of Manhattan island, there's little obvious sign of Trump's cuts. Later this year the park will shift to a Disneyland-style timed entry system, but for now there's just a single ranger staffing the entrance gate and the visitor center opens at 9 a.m daily. Some of the toilets are closed off with orange cones or other barriers, but there's no sign explaining why.

During two days of driving and hiking around the park, a USA TODAY reporter never saw a uniformed ranger or law enforcement officer on patrol, although workers cleaned the toilets each morning and graded a dirt road. The 51-spot Devil's Garden campground is essentially fully booked for the season already, managed by contractors who live on site.

Each day, even during the current slow season, hundreds of visitors entered the park to marvel at the eroded sandstone features that include Balanced Rock, the Windows and the most iconic site, the 46-foot high Delicate Arch, reached via a 1.5-mile hike across bare rock and sand.

Phoenix tourists Jeannine Acantilado, 62, and Dr. Steven Wolinsky, 61, stopped at the park with their son on a drive back from Colorado. The couple say they have visited many national parks, and while they generally support the idea of trimming the size of government, they worry about park safety and maintenance due to cuts.

Wolinsky, making his first visit to Arches, said he's consistently impressed with how well run the National Park system is, given how little it costs, and fondly remembers a recent visit to Zion National Park, further west in Utah.

""I thought as a taxpaying American I could get into the park for $35 and get shuttled around – that’s a great value,"" said Wolinsky, a cardiologist. ""I felt like my tax dollars were well spent.""","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA TODAY'}"

BEIJING — As President Donald Trump gave a fiery and divisive speech to a joint session of Congress last week, a much more staid political event was underway on the other side of the world.

The annual gathering of the National People’s Congress, China’s parliament is tightly choreographed, with all decisions made in advance by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Security is even tighter than usual around central Beijing and armies of volunteers wearing red armbands are stationed on street corners and at subway stations.

Though there are few surprises and no debate, the weeklong National People’s Congress does offer clues to China’s priorities at home and how it plans to approach the world.

Even as it faces a slowing economy, China appears to be making a strategic decision to present itself as a global stalwart amid a world in turmoil as Trump upends international trade and long-standing alliances, eroding U.S. prestige and creating an opportunity for China to fill the void.

As if to underscore China’s relative steadfastness, Foreign Minister Wang Yi rarely gestured or moved his hands at his annual news conference on Friday. He used the word “stability” at least 14 times during 90 minutes in front of reporters, according to Chinese transcripts.

Some of his sharpest language was directed at the Trump administration, which last week doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% and said there could be more to come.

“No country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while developing good relations with China on the other,” Wang said, slamming what he called a “two-faced approach.”

China has long complained about U.S. tariffs, which in the first Trump administration set off a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. But at least outwardly, China doesn’t appear overly concerned about the impact of the new tariffs or in a rush to placate Trump to stave off more.

“Nobody worries about it,” tech executive Yao Lijun told NBC News on Wednesday as he walked out of the Great Hall of the People, an ornate building next to Tiananmen Square in Beijing where some 3,000 Chinese leaders and lawmakers were gathered for the NPC.

“We only focus on ourselves, how we can do much better,” he said. “We don’t worry about others.”

China responded to the new tariff on Tuesday by announcing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, mostly agricultural products, in a measured move similar to the levies it imposed when the first 10% tariff took effect last month.

“Appearing alarmed or alarmist is not something Beijing wants to communicate, because that’s precisely what Trump is trying to elicit,” said Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai.

Though Wang avoided saying anything too provocative on Friday, earlier in the week Beijing called back to its more aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy of the past, with the Foreign Ministry saying, “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.”

It was the harshest rhetoric from Beijing since Trump returned to office in January.

The message from those comments is clear, said Wang Dong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University in Beijing. China will resolutely defend its national interests, and any U.S. attempt to force it into submission “will backfire and fail,” he said.

“China will use a ‘tit for tat’ strategy, meaning if the U.S. shifts to conflict, China will follow suit and retaliate,” he said. “When the U.S. reverts back to cooperation, China will do the same.”

Cooperation did not appear to be on Trump’s mind on Tuesday as he told Congress he would impose reciprocal tariffs on “friend and foe” starting April 2.

His “America First” speech sent the message that “the U.S. only cares about its own interests and will pursue them in a relentless and ruthless manner, without caring about international rules or norms,” Wang, the professor, said in written comments.

He noted that Trump had withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, both of which he touted in his address to Congress. Such moves signal the U.S. is no longer interested in upholding the liberal values and rules-based international order it has championed since the end of World War II, Prof. Wang said.

“By contrast, China’s message is it is willing to work with other stakeholders and the international community to tackle common global challenges such as climate change,” he said.

In keeping with the stability theme, Chinese officials announced the same target for economic growth as last year: 5%. Likewise, China’s 2025 increase in defense spending is staying the same as last year at 7.2%.

Delivering a government work report at the opening session on Wednesday, Premier Li Qiang, China’s No. 2 official, did not mention Trump but noted rising unilateralism and protectionism around the world and indicated China would pursue the opposite.

“China is ready to work with other members of the international community to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world,” he said.

Li acknowledged China’s significant economic challenges, which include a persistent property crisis, high youth unemployment and sluggish consumer spending. And in a nod to U.S. tariffs and other measures, he said, “An increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science and technology.”

“Regardless of changes in the external environment, we should remain steadfast in our commitment to opening up,” Li said. “We will continue to expand our globally oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.”

China is counting on its trade relationships with other countries to help its export-dependent economy withstand Trump’s tariffs, the cost of which U.S. and other experts say will be almost entirely passed on to American consumers and importers.

“To be frank, with this kind of tariff war, both countries suffer,” said Zhang Weiwei, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai and the director of its China Institute.

“But the U.S. will suffer more.”

A man who was brandishing a firearm in Washington, D.C., was shot by Secret Service officers near the White House on Sunday morning, the Secret Service said.

The man, who is thought to have travelled from Indiana, had been flagged to the Secret Service by local police as a potential suicide risk, according to the agency. Officials came across the man's car, and found him nearby with a firearm, when an armed confrontation ensued, the Secret Service said.

The man was transported to a nearby hospital, and his condition is so far unknown. No Secret Service personnel are thought to have been harmed.

President Donald Trump was at his home in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, at the time of the shooting, which occurred just one block away from the White House.

The incident is now under investigation by Washington's Metropolitan Police, which investigates all law-enforcement shootings in the District of Columbia.

The full statement by the Secret Service is below:

""On Sunday March 9th, an adult male was shot by U.S. Secret Service personnel following an armed confrontation with law enforcement in Washington DC.

Earlier on Saturday, local police shared information about a suicidal individual who may be traveling to Washington DC from Indiana. Around midnight, members of the Secret Service encountered the individual's parked vehicle near 17th and F Streets, NW. They also saw an individual on foot matching the description nearby.

As officers approached, the individual brandished a firearm and an armed confrontation ensued, during which shots were fired by our personnel.

The suspect was transported to an area hospital and his condition is unknown. There were no reported injuries to Secret Service personnel.

The incident is under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department Internal Affairs Division's Force Investigations Team, which investigates all law enforcement officer involved shootings in the District of Columbia.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news,He's the face of Trump's tariffs. But 9/11 attacks put Howard Lutnick on the national stage,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/howard-lutnick-trump-tariffs-september-11-1.7475499,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Howard Lutnick took his five-year-old son to school for his first day of kindergarten, causing the Wall Street CEO to be a little late getting to work at his World Trade Center office in New York City.

That delay ended up saving the life of Lutnick, who is now the U.S. commerce secretary and has become a leading figure in the current trade war with Canada.

But on 9/11, every one of his 658 employees at the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald who were at the office that morning, including Lutnick's younger brother Gary, were killed when 1 WTC, the North Tower, was deliberately struck by hijacked American Airlines Flight 11. At the time, the firm had 960 employees based in New York.

Two days later, a grief-stricken and weeping Lutnick appeared on television, interviewed by then-ABC News journalist Connie Chung. Breaking down several times during the interview, Lutnick described how he went from hospital to hospital, searching for employees still unaccounted for.

""I don't go to a hospital or get anyone to go to any hospital and say, 'Find Gary Lutnick for me,'"" he said. ""I go with employee lists and say, 'Here' my list, here's everybody I got, find somebody on this list. I don't care who they are.'""

Following the broadcast, Lutnick made other media appearances, most notably on CNN with Larry King, and became somewhat of a national figure, representing just one of those who had suffered both personal and professional losses.

His image then certainly contrasts with the one Canadians see now — the confident pitchman for U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs against Canadian exports to the United States.

Since the Feb. 1 announcement by Trump of 25 per cent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico going to the U.S., Lutnick — whose responsibilities as commerce secretary include imposing trade restrictions — has been making the rounds of U.S. media networks, blasting Canada for not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl, singing the praises of tariffs but also hinting there could be some potential exemptions or compromises.

(On Thursday, Trump announced he was pausing tariffs on some Canadian goods until April 2.)

But even before Lutnick became commerce secretary, he had been an outspoken supporter of Trump's tariff plan, and as part  of Trump's inner circle, co-chair of his transition team.

When he was appointed commerce secretary, Lutnick stepped down as CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, where, according to its website, he led the firm for four decades and rebuilt it after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

At that time, the firm had offices among the top five floors of the 110-storey North Tower. When the plane flew into floors 93 to 99 of the tower at 8:46 a.m., it trapped those people who worked above.

Lutnick's company lost more employees than any other firm in 9/11 — more than two-thirds of its workforce and more than a third of the total killed at the North Tower.

""We lost every person in our office ... all the brokers, all the traders, all the salespeople at work. We lost them all,"" he said days later during an interview with CNN's Larry King.

Lutnick said that when he was at his son's school that morning, his phone kept ringing and disconnecting.

""I later learned it was my brother Gary trying to call to say goodbye,"" he said in a social media post last Sept 11, commemorating the attacks.

He also discovered that his brother had called their sister and told her ""he wasn't going to make it and the smoke was coming in and things were bad,"" he recounted to King, sobbing.

""And he called and said goodbye and that he loved her and for her to tell me that he, that he loved me.""

Happy birthday to Gary, my spectacular brother. I lost you on 9/11, but you will be missed and loved forever. <a href=""https://t.co/jcRIC0QMCG"">pic.twitter.com/jcRIC0QMCG</a>

Lutnick said when he eventually arrived at the building, he watched people fleeing and would ""grab and shake them,"" asking what floor they were on, hoping to find someone from floors 101 to 105, where Cantor Fitzgerald's offices were located, he told Chung.

""I knew if I got one employee, if one person came down from that floor, that I know that there had to be others,"" he said.

Lutnick made contact with someone fleeing the building from the 91st floor, but nothing higher. He was then forced to run as the second World Trade Center tower began to collapse after being struck by another plane.

He said he tried to get ahead of the  giant plume of smoke but was knocked down underneath a truck. He was completely covered in dust and just walked for hours, eventually calling his wife, he said.

That emotional and compelling interview with Chung engendered widespread sympathy, as it was jarring for the public to see the CEO of a Wall Street firm break down.

Yet that sympathy was short-lived. Lutnick soon faced immense scorn when it was learned that just days after the attacks, he had cut off the paycheques of those employees who at the time were missing and presumed dead.

That backlash included criticism from some of the widows of those employees. Chung did a followup story, this time interviewing some of the widows who were angry with Lutnick's salary termination.

""Don't expect these women to cry for Lutnick,"" Chung reported. ""Days after the tragedy, he did something they can neither forgive nor forget.""

Lutnick at the time acknowledged he was getting inquires from widows asking about the salary for their husbands.

""They call me and they say, 'How come you can't pay my salary? Why can't you pay my husband's salary? Other companies pay their [dead and missing employees'] salary, why can't you,'"" he told CNN's King.

""But, you see, I lost everybody in the company, so I can't pay their salary. They think we're doing something wrong. I can't pay their salaries,"" Lutnick said, again weeping.

Yet he defended that decision to cut off the paycheques and insisted he had no choice.

""I needed my bankers to know that I was in control,"" Lutnick told the New York Times in a 2011 interview. ""That I wasn't sentimental and that I was no less motivated or driven to make my business survive.""

He made good on his pledge to provide the families with 25 per cent of the firm's profits over the next five years — totalling $180 million US —and pay for their health care for the next 10 years.

U.S. commerce secretary hints at more tariff talks with Canada

Meanwhile, some of the family members who had been critical of Lutnick reversed their opinion and offered praise for his efforts.

Lutnick was able to rebuild and grow Cantor Fitzgerald and become a billionaire in the process. But the Sept. 11 attacks, and those lost at his firm, still remain close to the surface.

Just recently at his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate's commerce committee, Lutnick choked up as he recalled the events of that day and those killed.

""I still can't say it without getting emotional, sorry,"" he said.

Christine McVie's former London penthouse is now up for grabs.

The late Fleetwood Mac singer and keyboardist's former home in the Belgravia neighborhood of London is on the market for $8.9 million, in partnership with Beauchamp Estates, which holds the listing.

""With a private roof garden, this penthouse has all the layout advantages of a house with entertaining on the lower level and the private bedrooms on the upper floor,"" Jeremy Gee, managing director of Beauchamp Estates, said in a statement. ""Bright and airy with a superb specification and tastefully decorated, this wonderful penthouse offers contemporary living in Belgravia at its very best."" 

McVie purchased the penthouse in 2015, after which she refurbished it with the help of a developer, making changes to the flooring and completely customizing the kitchen to her liking.

""Offering elevated living on Eaton Place, the London penthouse of the late Christine McVie of legendary British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac provides privacy and security, and we anticipate the proposed sale will attract global interest from discerning buyers from around the world,"" Gary Hersham, founding director of Beauchamp Estates, said in a statement.

Upon entry, guests will find a grand double reception room, which features two separate seating areas, with oak parquet flooring throughout. One side features a white marble wood-burning fireplace, with artwork of kimono hanging above it and a full-length mirror on either side.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Spring Statement: What will be in chancellor Rachel Reeves plan?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qjn879lr4o,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:52:16 GMT","

The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March.

Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events. 

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.

It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.

Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.

After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.

Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to ""give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes"".

That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.

With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.

The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the £9.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.

Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are ""non-negotiable"". Her two main rules are: 

Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.

It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.

The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged ""fundamental"" reform of the welfare system.

The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.

Possible other announcements that are being reported include: 

Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.

A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.

The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.

Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2025, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze to raise about £7bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi. 

Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so ""would hurt working people"" and ""take more money out of their payslips"".

Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.

Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired. 

The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.

When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.

In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted. 

The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.

Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.

Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.

Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.

Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.

Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation.

Following her decision to stand down, the SNP MP opens up on her mental health struggles at Westminster ahead of a new BBC documentary.

Former SNP MP Mhairi Black discusses her time at Westminster in a new BBC documentary.

Interest rates, set by the Bank of England, affect mortgage, loan and savings rates for millions.

Trump tariffs could affect UK economic growth, hitting UK consumers in the pocket, Bank experts warn

Ministers hope the plans will help reduce the rapidly rising cost of health and disability benefits.

Here are five things in business tech news that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?

Meta has launched a pilot program introducing AI-powered customer service agents to assist businesses on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. These agents can interact with customers in real-time, handling tasks such as managing returns, providing product recommendations, and processing purchases. Utilizing data from a business's Meta footprint – including previous posts and customer service messages – agents can answer customer inquiries directly on ad pages or through direct messages. Agentic AI is enhancing CRM platforms like Salesforce which recently introduced AgentExchange – a new marketplace for AI agents in enterprise software. Launching with over 200 partners – including Google Cloud, DocuSign, Box, and Workday – pre-packaged agent solutions are being developed for businesses that can implement them without extensive technical expertise. Unlike traditional AI tools focused on text generation, these specialized AI agents are designed to perform complex tasks autonomously within business systems, effectively increasing labor capacity. (Source: Fast Company; VentureBeat)

2025 is the year of the agent. I’ve written about this before and will be revisiting this topic for another Forbes column soon. The takeaway is that finally – finally – generative AI will evolve this year to only provide information but also perform tasks to help us run our businesses more productively. The focus is on customer service. My advice is to lean in heavily and perhaps use some of these tools to build your own solutions.

The latest PayPal scam alert involves Docusign's Application Programming Interface (API). Scammers are exploiting the software to enhance the credibility of their phishing emails targeting PayPal users. By setting up Docusign accounts, these fraudsters utilize available templates to send legitimate-looking PayPal invoices. Recipients are notified of unauthorized transactions and prompted to contact a provided phone number to secure their account and process a refund. Since these emails originate from Docusign, they can bypass many security filters. Red flags include the use of Gmail addresses for PayPal customer support and the absence of documents requiring signatures – which is unusual for Docusign communications. Docusign has stated that it investigates and shuts down suspicious accounts within 24 hours of detection or reporting. (Source: Finextra)

I’ve been getting a ton o PayPal scam emails recently, requesting payment or asking me to confirm a payment made to my company. This is a new twist and using Docusign is a pretty savvy way to dupe businesses and individuals into giving away confidential information. Make sure your employees are aware of this, be extra vigilant, get training for your company and report anything you see to both PayPal and Docusign.

Lucas Mearian of Computerworld highlighted a significant increase in electronic employee monitoring as reported in a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The study found 80 percent of companies are monitoring remote or hybrid workers with 74 percent using software to log web browsing and 62 percent tracking screen activity. This surge in surveillance is linked to heightened worker stress, reduced job satisfaction, and potential declines in productivity. The proliferation of monitoring tools – such as RFID badges and biometric scanners – has raised ethical concerns regarding privacy and the potential for discriminatory practices. Experts caution that while these tools aim to boost productivity, they may inadvertently harm employee well-being and trust in the workplace. (Source: Computerworld)

I’m an opponent of employee monitoring. I realize that in some situations – cases where there’s valuable inventory, a higher risk of theft or even instances of potential harmful employee behavior – where monitoring can help a business. But for the most part I see my clients spending too much monitoring the minutia of an employee’s day – even when working from home – rather than running their business. You hire adults. Give them the respect of being adults. Stop spending so much time on something that likely has much lower risk to the overall profitability of your business and instead focus on growing your business and making your employees better.

Reddit is becoming an optimal platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to enhance their search engine optimization (SEO) efforts, engage with local communities, and build brand trust. Reddit content often appears prominently in Google search results, with users actively seeking out Reddit discussions for authentic reviews and insights. Example – when searching for services like a personal trainer in Brooklyn – users might include ""Reddit"" in their queries to find genuine community feedback. Unlike other social media platforms that frequently change their algorithms, Reddit maintains a consistent forum-style structure, allowing businesses to connect directly with niche audiences through specific communities known as subreddits. This direct engagement can lead to increased visibility and credibility. (Source: Search Engine Land)

I’m active on the r/CRM subreddit and have even received a few leads from it. But here’s the secret: don’t use Reddit as a leadgen tool. I like to go on the CRM subreddit to learn more about the industry, engage with users and even offer advice. I often get great advice there. Yes, I sometimes pitch our solutions, but usually it’s just an education and helpful engage which builds credibility and relationships. I never even considered the fact that this activity might showing up in online searches but that’s just a plus. I strongly recommend business owners pick a subreddit in their industry or expertise and engage with that community on a regular basis.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Companies warn investors that DOGE’s federal cuts might hurt business,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/09/doge-companies-warnings-sec-filings/,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 18:33:49 GMT","

As earnings season begins, filings to the SEC point to uncertainty from the current administration as potential trouble for business.

Elon Musk’s sweeping makeover of the federal government in recent weeks is reverberating across the private sector, where companies have started expressing fear and uncertainty about disruptions these changes  might inflict on their businesses.

As the year’s first earnings season kicks off, dozens of companies in health care, technology, real estate and defense — industries that  might have expected rising profits from President Donald Trump’s business-friendly campaign posture — are warning investors in their quarterly reports and conference calls that the effects of rapid change in Washington are unpredictable and could hurt their bottom lines.

“I hope over time that DOGE can potentially become a tailwind for companies like us who are focusing on the federal government,” Carl Eschenbach, CEO of human-resources software maker Workday, said at an investor conference Tuesday.  “But right now, there is a lot of uncertainty, and I don’t know when that’s going to tip.”

The concerns come as Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service, which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, cuts a chaotic path through the government to reduce spending. Large numbers of federal workers have been fired and reinstated, contracts have been canceled then restored and lawsuits challenging DOGE’s actions have put some initiatives on hold and allowed others to go through.

Federal government contractors say they are still unclear which parts of their businesses may be on the chopping block. The administration is seeking to cut nonessential contracts from every department, according to an email the acting GSA administrator sent to all agency heads last month, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post.

The uncertainty has spread even to some companies that don’t directly rely on government contracts. For example, some drugmakers warned that cuts to the Food and Drug Administration could slow drug approvals. And two real estate businesses with large footprints in Washington, D.C., said that mass firings of federal workers could decrease demand for their properties.

Investors are paying attention. Since November, the stock prices of a group of companies with the most potential exposure to DOGE underperformed the S&P 500 index by 20 percent, according to an analysis last month by the investment bank Barclays.

“What do you do right now? Do you invest? Probably you want to wait a little bit to see exactly what happens at the end of the day,” Dominique Toublan, head of U.S. credit strategy at Barclays, said in an interview. “Even on its own, we know uncertainty, risk, ambiguity, can feed on itself and create a slowdown in the economy because people have a hard time deciding how they want to spend, how they want to invest.”

Businesses have mostly stayed quiet about DOGE until recently, when warnings started appearing under legally mandated sections of their quarterly investor reports. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires all publicly traded companies to list significant risks to their businesses. These so-called “risk factors” include shifts in competition, regulation and consumer tastes.

Trump campaigned on a business-friendly agenda, including plans to pare  environmental regulations and further slash the corporate tax rate, which he cut during his first term from 35 percent to 21 percent. Weeks into his second term, business groups have applauded his steps toward expanding oil and gas production and lifting  SEC rules they saw as onerous.

But a review of SEC filings and earnings transcripts shows the corporate view of the administration is mixed. In addition to the warnings about DOGE, business groups including the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce have urged Trump to back off his plan for tariffs, saying they raise the costs of doing business.

Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that Trump has worked to help businesses by lowering taxes, rolling back regulations and driving “historic investments” in the country.

A spokesman for DOGE did not respond to requests for comment.

Some executives have struck an optimistic tone in public remarks, emphasizing that the products and services they provide government agencies are essential and likely to be spared from cuts. In SEC filings, though, a number expressed worries.

“DOGE is a huge win for us,” Eric DeMarco, CEO of military drone-maker Kratos, said during a call with analysts Feb. 26. But in a Feb. 5 filing with the SEC,  the company said: “The potential impact of DOGE and the President’s potential intentions on the Defense and National Security industry, and the Company, if any, is unknown at this time.” Kratos, which reported $762 million in sales from U.S. government customers last year, did not respond to a request for comment.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered subordinates to submit plans for a potential 8 percent budget cut in each of the next five years, with limited exemptions.

John Heller, CEO of technology and engineering firm Amentum, told analysts on Feb. 5, “We still have to deliver services to 330 million citizens, and doing that in a more efficient way should create opportunities for companies that have the ability to deliver more efficient methods and processes and technology.” But in a filing the same day the Chantilly, Virginia-based company warned that a decline in defense spending “could have an adverse impact on our business.”

Amentum derived more than $5 billion in revenue from U.S. defense and intelligence contracts last fiscal year, according to company filings, but DOGE said it canceled contracts for Amentum and its subsidiaries worth $35.3 million in recent weeks.

Chanel Mann, a spokeswoman for Amentum, acknowledged losing almost 1 percent of the company’s revenue “as a result of the new administration initiatives,” but declined to discuss other specifics around DOGE.

Marc Steinberg, a law professor at  Southern Methodist University and former enforcement attorney at the SEC, said in an interview that it’s not uncommon for executives to present a more rosy picture in earnings calls, where they are more free to use “puffery” than in required SEC disclosures, which protect companies from investor lawsuits.

“What happens with some frequency is in these earnings calls, there is an upbeat tone of optimism, irrespective of some of the surrounding circumstances,” Steinberg said. “In the SEC filings, more precise disclosure is called for.”

Still, not all companies are reporting risks from the new administration, even within the same industry.

Drugmakers ImmunityBio, PMV Pharmaceuticals, Rezolute and Ventyx Biosciences said in filings that cuts in federal staffing could hurt their business plans, which hinge on getting the FDA to approve their new products within a predictable time frame. The Trump administration fired hundreds of FDA probationary employees — though some were rehired — and the agency faces the prospect of further cuts.

“Disruptions in how the FDA operates due to these policies may materially adversely affect our business,” read a public filing last month by Rezolute, which makes drugs for people with hypoglycemia.

But Eli Lilly, the most valuable U.S. health-care firm, and some other larger pharmaceutical companies have said they are not overly worried. In an interview with The Post on Feb. 26, Dave Ricks, Eli Lilly’s CEO, said the FDA is insulated from deep staffing cuts because half of its $7.2 billion budget comes from “user fees” from companies seeking approval for their prescription drugs and medical devices.

“Almost all of the innovative drug personnel are funded through user fees, not taxpayer dollars,” Ricks said. “So it’s not like the government saves money if they eliminate the people.”

Marty Makary, Trump’s nominee to lead the FDA, said during his confirmation hearing Thursday that he would conduct his “own independent assessment of personnel.”

Encompass Health, one of the nation’s largest operators of rehabilitation hospitals, disclosed in its annual securities filing  Feb. 28 that it “cannot predict” whether DOGE and other regulatory changes could result in cuts to Medicare spending, which makes up a large portion of the company’s revenue.

Trump has insisted he won’t cut benefits to Medicare, the federal program providing health insurance to seniors, and Medicaid, which provides health coverage to Americans with low incomes and disabilities. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that the only way to meet a directive in the proposed House GOP budget, passed Feb. 25, to cut at least $880 billion from health care spending over 10 years would be to cut Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

“We are in a period of great uncertainty with headwinds in the health care provider space,” Mark Ordan, CEO of Pediatrix Medical Group, a national physician network, told financial analysts Feb. 20.

An analyst on the call responded with a quip: “All of us are checking Twitter on a daily basis for sort of nebulous headwinds.”

The technology industry, with close ties to Musk, is one of the few sectors sounding widely upbeat about DOGE. Tech executives have effused that the efficiencies Musk says he hopes to achieve at federal agencies will only be possible with their products.

At a Morgan Stanley conference this month, Brian Robins, finance chief for San Francisco-based software maker GitLab, said GitLab is aligned with the goals of DOGE, because the company’s software tools aim to help people do more with less.

“What the Department of Government Efficiency is trying to do is what GitLab does,” Robins said.

At the same conference, Mark Lynch, the chief financial officer at Appian, a McLean,  Virginia, developer of software tools, expressed some optimism that his company will keep its federal agency customers, which include the Commerce, Defense, Education and Energy departments.

“There's a hurricane going on in the federal government right now, and we're in the basement,” Lynch said, “So we're kind of protected, but, you know, we're still not immune to it.”

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is dismissing business concerns over the uncertainty caused by his planned tariffs on a range of American trading partners and the prospect of higher prices, and isn't ruling out the possibility of a recession this year.

After imposing and then quickly pausing 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada that sent markets tumbling over concerns of a trade war, Trump said his plans for broader ""reciprocal"" tariffs will go into effect April 2, raising them to match what other countries assess.

“April 2nd, it becomes all reciprocal,” he said in a taped interview with Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.” “What they charge us, we charge them.”

Asked about the Atlanta Fed's warning of an economic contraction in the first quarter of the year, Trump seemingly acknowledged that his plans could affect U.S. growth. Still, he claimed, it would ultimately be ""great for us.”

When questioned whether he was expecting a recession in 2025, Trump responded: “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing.” He then added, “It takes a little time. It takes a little time.""

On Wall Street, it was a tough week with wild swings dominated by worries about the economy and uncertainty about what Trump's tariffs.



Trump brushed aside concerns from businesses seeking stability as they make investment decisions. He said that “for years the globalists, the big globalists have been ripping off the United States"" and that now, ""all we’re doing is getting some of it back, and we’re going to treat our country fairly.""

“You know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up and, you know, I don’t know if it’s predictability,” the Republican president said.

Trump last week lifted the Mexico and Canada tariffs on American car manufacturers, and then virtually all imports to the U.S., but kept them on goods from China.

More tariffs are coming this week, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling NBC's “Meet the Press” that 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will take effect Wednesday. Lutnick said Trump's threatened tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber though would wait until April.

“Will there be distortions? Of course,” Lutnick said. “Foreign goods may get a little more expensive. But American goods are going to get cheaper, and you’re going to be helping Americans by buying American.”

UK appears to be out of US eyeline for now but it would not be immune to slowdown triggered by rising tariffs

Forget the “Trump put”, as financial analysts called the bet that the US president’s policies would unleash a winning era for the nation’s stock markets. By Friday, the chat was of the “Merz spurt”.

The decision by Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor-in-waiting, to cut a deal on ditching Germany’s debt brake – still to be confirmed by the outgoing parliament – marked a seismic shift.

The EU country most associated with strict fiscal discipline is now contemplating what could in principle be unlimited borrowing to fund Europe’s defence.

Lifting the brake, widely regarded by experts as an unnecessarily tight constraint on public spending in an economy sorely in need of stimulus, cheered European markets.

Bond yields rose, as investors contemplated the extra borrowing Germany is now expected to undertake; but so did the euro and European stocks, on the assumption the move would be positive for growth.

Merz’s abrupt about-turn, after arguing for spending restraint during the recent election campaign, is part of a dramatic EU-wide push to “ReArm Europe” – a slogan it was depressing and disorientating to see on official communications last week, in the EU’s trademark blue and yellow branding.

The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, suggested as much as €800bn (£671bn) could ultimately be mobilised to create a bulwark against Russia, as the US withdraws.

In other words, Donald Trump’s isolationist turn has had a dramatic galvanising effect on the EU, smashing through its cumbersome decision-making structures.

The German decision is the right one – although Merz’s insistence on trying to pass it in the outgoing parliament is hardly democratic best-practice.

As US markets turned sour last week against the backdrop of Trump’s chaotic trade policy, it may have been tempting for the Europeans to feel a touch of schadenfreude – an appropriately German word.

Yet while EU countries have rapidly drawn up plans to deal with the new, less cooperative US in the security sphere, they must also brace themselves for the impact of Trump’s other great project – smashing up the global trading system and rebuilding it in the US’s favour.

The barely credible fact that Trump had slapped 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, countries with which he negotiated a free trade agreement in his first term, almost got lost in the maelstrom of history-making news last week.

As Canadian liquor stores stripped their shelves of American bourbon, and US carmakers warned that prices could rocket, the president offered a temporary carve-out, and then a broader reprieve.

But the administration remains strongly wedded to the idea of tariffs. Trump even argued on Saturday that the prospect of a trade war with Canada and Mexico would spice up next year’s football World Cup, which the the two countries are jointly hosting with the US. “Tension is a good thing … It makes it much more exciting,” he said.

It is usually a mistake to try to read too much logic into Trump’s approach, which owes as much to personal gripes and grudges as to theory. But he and his henchmen do seem determined to ditch the rules-based world trading system, in favour of something much more Hobbesian.

Just as the administration is using the language of liberty and free speech to clothe its attacks on many aspects of US public life, the aim of the tariffs policy is apparently to enforce “fairness”.

As the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, put it on Friday: “What we are trying to do is make free trade fair trade, because the trading systems have become incredibly imbalanced. You see it with these gigantic trade deficits that we run.”

The next wave of import taxes is due to be imposed on steel, aluminium and derivative products – everything from vehicle parts to kitchen sinks – this Wednesday, and analysts at Global Trade Alert estimate that more than $20bn (£15.5bn) of EU exports will be affected.

When it comes to the “reciprocal” tariffs Trump has threatened to impose on 2 April, with higher rates for countries the US deems to be trading unfairly, the EU appears to be firmly in his sights.

Trump described the bloc in a typically bellicose statement on Friday as a “terrible abuser” of the current system.

Recent analysis by Aslak Berg at the Centre for European Reform, suggested a 20% tariff on all EU exports would lead to a decline in exports to the US of $200bn a year. “Given the weakness of the European economy, this would certainly cause a recession,” he said.

The EU has a toolkit of retaliatory instruments ready to go, including the ability to slap tariffs on US products, as it did in response to steel tariffs in Trump’s first term. These are understandably aimed at bringing Trump to the negotiating table, but in the interim they will just add to the chaos.

The UK appears to be out of the US president’s eyeline for the moment, after Keir Starmer’s trip to Washington, and Britain does not have the trade surplus in goods that Trump tends to read as a sign of some underlying inequity.

But the US may still zero in on other UK policies, such as the digital services tax, expected to raise £800m this year from tech companies – and as the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has made clear, Britain would not be immune to a global slowdown triggered by rising tariffs.

The most important news this last week was that Trump 2.0 has made Europe a much more dangerous place, but it would be a mistake to lose sight of the wrecking ball he continues to wield over the global trading system. The next few weeks and months look likely to be, as some headlines had it last week, “tariffying”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Feedback

In a groundbreaking experiment, researchers have successfully transformed light into a supersolid — an exotic state of matter that behaves both as a solid and a fluid. Published in Nature, the discovery by a team of physicists and nanotechnologists opens new possibilities for quantum mechanics, photonics, and advanced materials research.  

A supersolid maintains a crystalline structure like a solid while also flowing without resistance, a property typical of superfluids. Until now, supersolids had only been observed in ultracold atomic gases near absolute zero. The ability to create a supersolid using light challenges traditional views on matter and energy.  

The research, led by Dimitris Trypogeorgos and Daniele Sanvitto at the National Research Council (CNR) in Italy, involved firing a laser at a gallium arsenide structure with precisely engineered microscopic ridges. This interaction created polaritons — hybrid light-matter particles — that exhibited supersolid behavior.  

This breakthrough could have significant implications for quantum computing, as supersolid-based photonic systems may provide a more stable platform for qubits, the fundamental units of quantum information. It could also lead to faster, more efficient optical circuits, revolutionizing photonic devices.  

Beyond technology, the ability to generate supersolid light paves the way for exploring new states of matter, offering deeper insights into light-matter interactions under extreme quantum conditions.  

The team plans to refine their approach to better control these supersolid light formations and explore their potential in next-generation quantum systems. Future research will focus on stabilizing and manipulating these structures, potentially transforming fields ranging from fundamental physics to cutting-edge computing and photonics.  

This milestone reshapes our understanding of light, bridging the gap between classical and quantum materials — and setting the stage for future breakthroughs in physics and material science.

Here are five things in business tech news that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?

Meta has launched a pilot program introducing AI-powered customer service agents to assist businesses on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. These agents can interact with customers in real-time, handling tasks such as managing returns, providing product recommendations, and processing purchases. Utilizing data from a business's Meta footprint – including previous posts and customer service messages – agents can answer customer inquiries directly on ad pages or through direct messages. Agentic AI is enhancing CRM platforms like Salesforce which recently introduced AgentExchange – a new marketplace for AI agents in enterprise software. Launching with over 200 partners – including Google Cloud, DocuSign, Box, and Workday – pre-packaged agent solutions are being developed for businesses that can implement them without extensive technical expertise. Unlike traditional AI tools focused on text generation, these specialized AI agents are designed to perform complex tasks autonomously within business systems, effectively increasing labor capacity. (Source: Fast Company; VentureBeat)

2025 is the year of the agent. I’ve written about this before and will be revisiting this topic for another Forbes column soon. The takeaway is that finally – finally – generative AI will evolve this year to only provide information but also perform tasks to help us run our businesses more productively. The focus is on customer service. My advice is to lean in heavily and perhaps use some of these tools to build your own solutions.

The latest PayPal scam alert involves Docusign's Application Programming Interface (API). Scammers are exploiting the software to enhance the credibility of their phishing emails targeting PayPal users. By setting up Docusign accounts, these fraudsters utilize available templates to send legitimate-looking PayPal invoices. Recipients are notified of unauthorized transactions and prompted to contact a provided phone number to secure their account and process a refund. Since these emails originate from Docusign, they can bypass many security filters. Red flags include the use of Gmail addresses for PayPal customer support and the absence of documents requiring signatures – which is unusual for Docusign communications. Docusign has stated that it investigates and shuts down suspicious accounts within 24 hours of detection or reporting. (Source: Finextra)

I’ve been getting a ton o PayPal scam emails recently, requesting payment or asking me to confirm a payment made to my company. This is a new twist and using Docusign is a pretty savvy way to dupe businesses and individuals into giving away confidential information. Make sure your employees are aware of this, be extra vigilant, get training for your company and report anything you see to both PayPal and Docusign.

Lucas Mearian of Computerworld highlighted a significant increase in electronic employee monitoring as reported in a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The study found 80 percent of companies are monitoring remote or hybrid workers with 74 percent using software to log web browsing and 62 percent tracking screen activity.

The proliferation of monitoring tools – such as RFID badges and biometric scanners – has raised ethical concerns regarding privacy and the potential for discriminatory practices. Experts caution that while these tools aim to boost productivity, they may inadvertently harm employee well-being and trust in the workplace. (Source: Computerworld)

I’m an opponent of employee monitoring. I realize that in some situations – cases where there’s valuable inventory, a higher risk of theft or even instances of potential harmful employee behavior – where monitoring can help a business. But for the most part I see my clients spending too much monitoring the minutia of an employee’s day – even when working from home – rather than running their business. You hire adults. Give them the respect of being adults. Stop spending so much time on something that likely has much lower risk to the overall profitability of your business and instead focus on growing your business and making your employees better.

Reddit is becoming an optimal platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to enhance their search engine optimization (SEO) efforts, engage with local communities, and build brand trust. Reddit content often appears prominently in Google search results, with users actively seeking out Reddit discussions for authentic reviews and insights.

With millions of songs across various genres, Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming platforms in the world. However, Spotify is yet to roll out lossless streaming. Its biggest competitor, Apple Music, has had it since its inception in 2021.

However, with the right settings and optimisations, you can still get an excellent audio experience on Spotify. Here’s what you need to do:

Compared to Apple Music, Spotify currently prioritises efficiency. This means streaming music on Spotify will consume less data compared to Apple Music. Many users may not notice any difference at all unless they use high-end headphones or speakers.

However, with some simple fine-tuning, you can enhance your Spotify experience significantly.

Go to Settings &gt; Audio Quality and select “Very High”. This enables streaming at 320kbps, which is the highest quality Spotify currently offers. However, this option is only available for Premium Spotify users.

Similarly, enable the “Download in Very High-Quality” option. This will not only improve music quality but will also help you save data, especially if you are someone who listens to select songs repeatedly.

Lastly, turn off the “Data Saver” Mode (Settings > Data Saver), as it reduces audio quality to conserve bandwidth.

These three changes can significantly improve your Spotify user experience. Needless to say that you need to have a high-speed, uninterrupted internet connection as patchy networks can impact your music-streaming experience.

Spotify offers playback settings that can enhance your listening experience. This includes the Crossfade (Settings > Playback > Crossfade) option, which enables a smooth transition between songs.

You can also turn on the Gapless Playback option. This, at least for some users, will deliver a seamless switching experience between songs. You can also enable the Normalise Volume option that eliminates sudden spikes to ensure the entire song plays at the same tempo. However, according to some, this feature makes the music sound flatter.

No matter how optimised your settings are, your output device plays a significant role in audio quality. This simply means you need better earphones, headphones, or speakers to get the best possible music-streaming experience on Spotify.

Invest in wired headphones or buy wireless earphones or headphones with high-quality Bluetooth codec support, such as aptX, LDAC, or AAC.

To further enhance your experience, you can also invest in an in-ear monitor (IEM) and pair it with an external Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), especially if you’re serious about audio fidelity and plan on listening to music the way artists wish you would.

Until Spotify HiFi is released, these optimisations ensure you get the best possible audio output. Spotify’s high-bitrate format, coupled with proper settings and high-quality audio gear, can still provide an impressive listening experience.

Bitcoin and crypto prices—including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, solana’s SOL and cardano’s ADA—have flat-lined over the last week after Donald Trump revealed the cryptocurrencies that the U.S. was betting on, sparking market mayhem.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has fallen back to around $85,000 per bitcoin, exactly where it was at the beginning of March (despite China quietly priming the bitcoin price for a major earthquake).

Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, Donald Trump’s crypto czar has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile.

“We’re going to move the [cryptocurrency owned by the U.S. government] to the digital stockpile,” David Sacks, a technology investor and entrepreneur who has joined the Trump administration as artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the job.

“The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship, it’s a place for safekeeping, it’s a centralized account under the direction of the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the value of these holdings.”

This week, after Trump’s surprise announcement that Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House has shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, cardano and solana.

""The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge
 fund manager so he’s going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and
 we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management,"" Sacks said.

Speaking at the much-hyped White House crypto summit this week, alongside Sacks and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin—placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve.

“I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said, it was reported by the New York Times. “We’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.”

In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a ""strategic national bitcoin reserve"" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

During Friday’s White House summit, Trump also called it ""foolish"" of the government to have previously sold so much of its seized bitcoin, while Sacks, speaking on the podcast, claimed the U.S. might have lost as much as $16 billion by selling off its bitcoin.

""At one point in time, we had about 400,000 bitcoin on the federal balance sheet. We sold roughly half of that for something like $360 million total,"" Sacks said during the podcast. ""If we had held all of that, just that the portion we sold would be worth over $17 billion.""

Ahead of the summit, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of the bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile using existing government holdings, disappointing traders with a lack of commitment to new bitcoin and crypto purchases though leaving the door open to acquiring more bitcoin though “budget neutral” methods that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers.""

Sacks added during a press conference that the Treasury and Commerce department, led by bitcoin price bull Howard Lutnick, are only “allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.”

“The subpar strategic bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market,” Agne Linge, head of growth at crypto platform WeFi, said in emailed comments.

“With the executive order directing agencies to consolidate seized bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new bitcoin purchase was announced. Despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the fact is that the bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of bitcoin through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. The available options in this regard include bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves.”

Some have speculated that China is weighing the creation of its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race.""

“The U.S. bitcoin reserve raises the likelihood of other nations adopting similar reserves and accelerates their consideration of such initiatives,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note.

“With the U.S. planning to adopt bitcoin reserves, this is likely to drive broader global adoption, with more nations integrating bitcoin into their reserves—potentially shifting from gold to digital assets, much like how some economies have embraced the U.S. dollar alongside or instead of their own currencies.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

About us

Michael Saylor took his Bitcoin evangelism to the White House on Friday, presenting his roadmap to an $81 trillion digital asset strategy at the administration’s first-ever crypto summit. 

His plan calls for the US to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic national asset, which he claims will help bolster the dollar, reduce national debt, and establish economic dominance.

Saylor’s proposal aligns with President Donald Trump’s executive order signed Thursday, which converts $17 billion in seized Bitcoin holdings into a strategic reserve and bans federal agencies from selling these Bitcoins. 

“From this day on, America will follow the rule that every Bitcoiner knows very well: never sell your Bitcoin,” Trump said.

Saylor argues that Bitcoin should be the foundation of a revamped US financial system that integrates digital tokens, securities, and currencies. 

He sees Bitcoin’s role as a digital commodity, attracting global capital flows and establishing the US as the financial epicenter of the 21st century. 

His vision includes programmatic government Bitcoin purchases, potentially securing up to 25% of the network by 2035.

To reach his $81 trillion projection, Bitcoin would need to surpass $15 million per coin, a valuation exponentially higher than today’s prices. 

In December, Saylor predicted that in this scenario, the digital asset market would expand to $280 trillion — around 100 times its current size — but provided no specifics on how he arrived at these figures.

Despite growing support, some investors expected more aggressive policy changes from the summit. 

Still, Saylor remains steadfast in saying that the United States has a chance to “dominate cyberspace and own the future.”

A week ago on Sunday, US President Trump made a mess of the crypto market but tweeting about a crypto reserve including Solana, Ripple and Cardano.

Shortly afterwards he added Ethereum and Bitcoin to the list. Throughout the week, everyone was looking for clarity but the White House later said that he just named the five largest-volume cryptos and that a plan was in the works. That led to a week of announcements that culminated in a long-rumored plan to hold cryptos that were already seized by the government rather than selling them.

Late on Friday, Trump signed the executive order and it's been a 'sell-the-fact' trade since, with bitcoin down about $3000 in the aftermath and carving out fresh lows at the moment.

The  order kept open the possibility of the government buying bitcoin in future but that may be difficult because it would likely require money from Congress.

The US Commerce and Treasury secretaries ""are authorized to develop 
budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided 
that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American 
taxpayers,"" a factsheet on the White House website said.

Similarly, cardano has given back nearly all its post-tweet gains and has just fallen below the retracement low on March 4. Solana is at the lowest since late February and XRP is below pre-tweet levels.  Ethereum had given back Trump-pump gains the day after the announcement and is threatening the lowest levels since 2023.

The lesson here: The government is exit liquidity not entry liquidity.

Will Still signed a three-year deal to be Lens manager in June 2024

Lens boss Will Still says he oversaw his side's Ligue 1 win over Marseille after girlfriend Emma Saunders told him to remain in the dugout, despite her health problems.

Saunders, a presenter on Sky Sports who previously worked for BBC Sport, said in a post on Instagram, external on Saturday she was recovering from encephalitis, which is an infection of the brain.

Still had been absent for part of the build-up to Lens' 4-3 home league defeat to Le Havre on 1 March when the nature of Saunders' illness was not made public. 

His brothers Nicolas and Edward, who are assistants at Lens, had prepared the side during that time while Still was in the UK with Saunders, but he returned to take charge against Le Havre.

With her blessing, the 32-year-old - born in Belgium to English parents - was in the technical area against Marseille on Saturday as his side snatched a dramatic victory thanks to a 94th-minute winner from Neil El Aynaoui.

""When I came back last Saturday I knew she [Saunders] was in the best place possible to get treatment,"" Still said after the success at Stade Velodrome.

""I asked her, 'should I go? should I not go?' - and she said to me, 'you have to go'. I thank the staff again who did the work for me when I wasn't here.""

Still said Saunders is ""stable"" and ""doing well"", which was ""the most important thing"", as he praised his players for how they have responded to the situation.

""Of course, there are more important things in life than a football match or a shot into the top corner,"" Still added.

""I have been honest with the guys. My girlfriend was in a coma, I had to be with her. We had to take care of her and the group have reacted admirably well.""

When asked how he could manage in these circumstances, Still added: ""It's my job, it's what I am paid for. I am well paid, so I told myself I have to give something back, hence my frustration last week.""

Saunders thanked Still for ""being you and being there for me"" and hopes to return to Sky Sports' coverage later in the season.

""I hope it won't be long until I'm back to see out the end of 2024-25 – especially after missing part of the start of the season before this when I was treated for thyroid cancer,"" she wrote on Instagram.

""So, as I spend time now recovering and rebuilding again I just wanted to thank my family and friends for their rock-solid support, my colleagues at Sky for their patience allowing me the time to heal, and our wonderful NHS for their extraordinary kindness and care.""

Kevin Keatts' eight-year run as the head coach of the N.C. State men's basketball team has come to an abrupt end. On Sunday, the university announced its decision to part ways with Keatts.

The move comes less than a year after Keatts coached the Wolfpack to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship and the Final Four. N.C. State ended the 2024-25 regular season with a 12-19 record.

Athletic director Boo Corrigan released a statement thanking Keatts for his ""contributions"" and also acknowledged last year's deep run in the NCAA tournament.

""I want to thank Coach Keatts for his contributions to N.C. State and for always representing the university with class,"" the statement from Corrigan read. ""He will always have a treasured place in Wolfpack history for the accomplishments of his 2023-24 squad and I appreciate the passion he brought to this role. We wish him and his family the best in the future.""

Keatts described the past eight years as ""a dream come true.""

""As we enter this new era of college sports, I wholeheartedly believe that I am leaving the program in better position to succeed than when I started – and that the basketball program will continue to thrive when supported to the level necessary to compete,"" Keatts wrote in a social media post on Sunday.

Keatts went 151-113 at N.C. State, including 69-84 in ACC play. His teams earned three NCAA Tournament bids, the last coming when the Wolfpack followed a five-games-in-five-days ride to their first ACC Tournament title since 1987 with a just-as-unexpected run to the program’s first Final Four since the late Jim Valvano led the ""Cardiac Pack"" to the 1983 NCAA title.

But he couldn’t sustain that momentum as this season turned into a crashout, with the Wolfpack’s retooling through the transfer portal – which had worked well enough to get N.C. State to back-to-back NCAA bids – proving to be a major miss. N.C. State went just 5-15 in league play.

The firing comes after Keatts faced multiple challenges in his tenure, starting with stabilizing a wobbly program on the court and then working for years amid the shadow of a federal corruption investigation into the sport that was tied to predecessor Mark Gottfried's tenure.

That case hovered for years before the program was placed on a year of probation in December 2021.

He arrived in 2017 from UNC Wilmington promising that ""Kevin Keatts is a winner"" in his introductory news conference. In many ways, he matched that, particularly after the program had bottomed out in Gottfried’s final two seasons after four straight NCAA bids. 

Keatts started with a 21-win season that included taking down highly ranked Duke, UNC and Arizona teams before reaching the NCAAs.

Mikaela Shiffrin broke a long-standing record with her 156th career World Cup podium finish, taking third in a slalom in Åre, Sweden, on Sunday.

Shiffrin led after the first run and had the 25th-fastest second run, skiing last on a beaten-up course at the site of her first World Cup victory in December 2012.

Austrian Katharina Truppe earned her first World Cup win in her 186th start, prevailing by five hundredths of a second over countrywoman Katharina Liensberger.

“First victory, it’s crazy,” said the 29-year-old Truppe, who previously finished third on four occasions. “I have goosebumps.”

ALPINE SKIING: Full Results | Broadcast Schedule

Shiffrin ended up 19 hundredths behind, two weeks after earning her record-extending 100th World Cup win.

Shiffrin broke her tie with Ingemar Stenmark for the most Alpine skiing World Cup podiums, two years after breaking the Swedish legend’s wins record of 86. Stenmark’s last podium and win came on Feb. 19, 1989.

Shiffrin, who turns 30 on Thursday, has made the podium in nearly 56% of her 280 career World Cup starts dating to 2011, including 75% in slalom.

The women’s Alpine World Cup moves next weekend to La Thuile, Italy, for a downhill and two super-Gs. 

Shiffrin is expected to race one more time this season in a March 27 slalom at the World Cup Finals in Sun Valley, Idaho. 

Shiffrin, a record eight-time World Cup slalom season champion, is mathematically out of the running for this year’s title after missing two months after tearing oblique muscles in a Nov. 30 giant slalom crash.

“I’m still trying to get the repetition back,” she said. “I feel almost like when you haven’t skied the whole summer, and then you come back and your timing is just a little bit wrong. It’s coming really well in slalom now, but I just have to keep practicing it.”

Croatian Zrinka Ljutic leads the standings by 41 points and will win her first season title with a podium finish — and possibly lower — in Sun Valley.

The Buffalo Bills are releasing outside linebacker Von Miller, NFL Network reports.

Miller, 36, played 13 games for Buffalo last season, registering six sacks with 17 total tackles, seven tackles for loss and 32 total pressures. Cutting him will save the Bills $8.5 million on their salary cap.

The Bills and Miller are open to him rejoining the team, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero and Ian Rapoport.

He played three seasons with the Bills, signing with them as a free agent after the Denver Broncos traded him to the Los Angeles Rams during the 2021-22 season. That move helped the Rams win Super Bowl LVI, the second championship of Miller's career.

— SeaBrayden09 (@SBrayden09) March 9, 2025

Miller has become more of a part-time pass rushing specialist in recent seasons, suffering a torn ACL in Week 12 of the 2022 season. He later acknowledged that he probably shouldn't have attempted to play the following season while recovering from the injury. Miller finished the 2023 campaign with no sacks and three tackles.

Last season, he served a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy amid accusations of domestic violence. Miller was never charged, but the league still investigated the alleged incidents.

Two years after signing a six-year, $120 million free-agent deal and sustaining the ACL injury, Miller agreed to a contract restructuring that reduced his base salary by half to save the Bills $8.645 million. With his sixth sack last season, Miller triggered a $1.5 million incentive for his 2024 salary.

Bills general manager Brandon Beane needed to push those salary cap savings even further for 2025 with Miller's production in decline. Buffalo is $4.5 million over the cap, according to Spotrac.

In 13 NFL seasons, Miller has 129.5 sacks (making him the NFL's active leader in that category), 27 forced fumbles and 581 combined tackles in 186 games. His best performance was during his second season in 2012 when he registered 18.5 sacks with 28 tackles for loss.

During his career, Miller has earned first-team All-Pro honors three times and second-team four times, while also being named to eight Pro Bowls. After winning Defensive Rookie of the Year, he twice finished second in balloting for NFL Defensive Player of the Year.

Miller was the Denver Broncos' 2021 first-round selection (No. 2 overall) out of Texas A&M and won Super Bowl championships with the Broncos and Rams.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Myles Garrett Becomes the Highest-Paid Non-Quarterback in NFL History at $40 Million Per Year

Myles Garrett is staying in Cleveland after the Browns gave him a record four-year contract extension that makes the four-time All-Pro edge rusher the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.

A person with knowledge of the details told The Associated Press that Garrett’s deal includes $122.8 million guaranteed, an average annual salary of $40 million with a total value of $204.8 million. The person spoke Sunday on condition of anonymity because terms weren’t announced.

Garrett, the 2023 AP Defensive Player of the Year, had asked for a trade last month but the Browns were adamant about keeping the 29-year-old star in Cleveland.

Garrett's contract raises the bar for other non-QBs, including Bengals All-Pro wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase and Cowboys edge rusher Micah Parsons. Cincinnati already has stated plans to make Chase the highest-paid non-QB in the league. 

Garrett, a first-round pick in 2017, had 14 sacks and 22 tackles for loss last season. He has 102 1/2 sacks in his eight seasons with the Browns. 

Garrett has only played in three playoff games with Cleveland.

Reporter

Snow League founder Shaun White looks on during qualifiers on Friday from atop the Snow League Club, a three-story VIP viewing structure at the bottom of Buttermilk. 

You only get to make one first impression, and the Snow League evidently proved to its athletes that it truly is built to serve them in its inaugural competition. Now the question is how all the pieces of the new landscape of snowboarding and freeskiing will fit together going forward.

The Snow League, founded by Winter X Games and Olympic champion Shaun White, garnered instant trust from many athletes after the legendary snowboarder reached out to many of them personally to pick their brains about what they liked and didn’t like about other events going on. White also promised to make the league all about the athletes, elevating their visibility and proving to outsiders that they are legitimately elite — and compensate them for each event they compete in. The league’s marketing orbits around a core message of “the future of winter action sports.”

It also introduced a new competition format, trying to add more importance to each run and create new storylines.

Japan’s Yuto Totsuka became the first men’s Snow League champion on Saturday at Buttermilk, topping Ruka Hirano in the head-to-head finals. Japanese entrants took four of the six podium spots across the men and women’s events, and claimed both champion spots, with Sena Tomita winning the women’s competition. 

And the athletes, for whom all this effort went into, were impressed by what the first event brought. Nearing the end of the 2024-25 season’s calendar, it begs the question of how it’ll work in a competitive landscape that already features the International Skiing Federation schedule — both World Cups and continental cups, which are important for things like placing on a national roster, etc. — and X Games promising a multiple-event calendar as well, starting as soon as next season, not to mention world championship events and the Olympics.

Aspen’s Alex Ferreira, the most decorated halfpipe skier in the world in the past few seasons, got to take in the inaugural Snow League in his backyard as a spectator: The Snow League held its first event as snowboard only, but will feature freeskiing at its next event in December in China.

Ferreira, who spoke with White about some ideas early on, was just as impressed as the competitors were with the first go-around. And he firmly thinks that the Snow League is prepared to claw its way to the forefront of the action sports landscape, as its marketing promises.

“Honestly, there’s not room for more (in the calendar), but I bet you a lot of athletes are going to make room for this event due to the prize money, due to the amount of care to the athletes, due to just the overall impression of it,” Ferreira said. “We all want to be superstars and be big. And this is going to be the pathway and channel to do it.”

Maddie Mastro, left, turns her champagne spray away from the crowd and toward Shaun White on the stage at Buttermilk on Saturday in the podium ceremony following the inaugural Snow League competition. Mastro placed second in the women's competition, the highest finish for an American. 

The first Snow League competition was livestreamed in more than 95 countries, according to its communications team (though Japan, which produced four of the six podium finishers, including the two gold medalists, was not listed among them on the Snow League’s website). In the United States it was streamed on NBC’s Peacock, which has previously been the host of other events like NFL games and features more than 36 million subscribers. It will be re-broadcast on NBC on March 29.

Events like X Games have been broadcast live on platforms like ESPN and ABC, but the Snow League is trying to stake its claim in the TV/streaming audience landscape.

Saturday’s finals appeared to be well attended, with White stating that they had reached their attendance goal, but the Snow League did not immediately provide ticket sales or attendance information. There was some empty space in the general admission corral at the bottom of the halfpipe — which itself appeared to be a smaller space than it has been for X Games events — but was still crowded and fans lined both sides of the halfpipe. The Snow League Club, a three-story temporary luxury structure hosting VIPs, sold out.

Leadville's Chase Blackwell talks with Snow League staff after crashing in his second run of the quarterfinals at Buttermilk on Saturday. Blackwell and Alessandro Barbieri were slated to go to the first tiebreaking third run in the competition before Blackwell was pulled from the event following the crash. 

“We’re pretty packed, I’m pretty thrilled,” White said in a post-finals media scrum. “Obviously, the first event so I don’t know the exact numbers, but we were sold out in the club. A lot of the GA attendance was great and I just was thrilled that people had an amazing time.

“Obviously events like X have been around for years and Opens and these things so I think we definitely made our mark and I think the attendance will ramp up more and more every year.”

The Snow League communications team did not make White available to the Aspen Daily News for further comments beyond the scrum, despite several requests before and during the event.

Athletes noted several details of the first event that stood out, from little things like fancier bibs (complete with athlete-specific numbers that they’ll wear for each event and will reportedly be retired with them) to shorter wait times at the top of the halfpipe thanks to the new format. But there were also notable details for the general admission fan experience, like a musical performance/podium stage directly adjacent to the pipe and widely viewable from the majority of the venue and traction mats running up the majority of the pipe.

The competition itself reserved some of its newly found drama for late: the new format was designed to lend itself to potential upsets in head-to-head competition and tiebreaking, do-or-die runs in the vein of a proverbial game seven in other sports.

Sena Tomita went to two third-run tiebreakers in head-to-head matchups on Snow League finals on Saturday, taking a total of eight runs on the day en route to becoming the first Snow League champion in history. 

Seven of the eight No. 1 seeds advanced out of day one, with half of them winning their heats on Friday. Four of them landed on the podium, including three on the men’s side. Seven of the eight quarterfinals were decided in two-run sweeps — Leadville’s Chase Blackwell was leading Alessandro Barbieri after the first run before crashing out on his second, drawing a tie. But the matchup didn’t yield the first third-run tiebreaker in Snow League history as Blackwell, blood dripping from his face from the crash but appearing to be OK, was pulled from the competition.

The third-run dramatics were reserved seemingly solely for Japan’s Sena Tomita, who worked harder than anyone else on Saturday to earn her women’s gold medal. Tomita came from behind against South Korea’s Gaon Choi in the semifinals after Choi won the first run. Tomita then put down back-to-back over-90-point runs to advance to the finals in the first true three-run head-to-head matchup.

Tomita then went the distance against Maddie Mastro, the only American to podium in the event. Tomita won the first run with a 91.25 run but yielded the second after crashing out. She narrowly beat out Mastro in the third run, with scores of 78.50 and 78.

“It was really hard because as soon as you made your run you had to go back up and get ready for your next run,” Tomita said through an interpreter. “So it was really challenging. … It’s an amazing feeling … it (holds) a lot of value to be the inaugural Snow League champion.”

Rapper Big Boi performed a post-competition concert for fans in attendance of the inaugural Snow League competition at Buttermilk on Saturday. 

Tomita took the win — and the season points leader patch — while Mastro took silver and Choi took bronze.

On the men’s side, it was a Japanese sweep. Yuto Totsuka topped Ruka Hirano in the finals in a two-run sweep, posting scores of 95.00 and 96.50, while Ayumu Hirano, the 2022 gold medalist and favorite to win the event, took bronze after topping Barbieri in the consolation match.

For many of the athletes it was likely one of the last competitions of the season — some will head to Switzerland for the world championships at the end of March. It’s the conclusion of a full World Cup calendar — plus other events like X Games — that has many athletes tired and bruised by the end.

New York-based musical duo Sofi Tukker played a surprise halftime show at the Snow League during Saturday’s finals. The band is reportedly friends with Snow League founder Shaun White and played in the Palm Tree Music Festival in Aspen on Feb. 22. 

And as true as the fact is that more competitions means more exposure, it’s simply not a reality of competing for some athletes. FIS, X Games and Snow League will either have to cooperate to allow scheduling for athletes or force them to choose — which they may have to do to begin with due to simple energy.

“Between X Games, Snow League, FIS, it’s only going to get busier from the sounds of it,” Mastro said. “So that’s definitely going to be an interesting item that I don’t know how we’ll get managed. 

“It’s going to require all three of those organizations to work together to put the athletes first and hopefully they’re considering that and realizing that they need to talk to each other and how they can make it all possible, make it so we can go to Snow League, go to X Games, compete in our World Cups and get Crystal Globes and do all of it. So hopefully they’re having those conversations of how they can think about the athletes and not overload us, because at some point we need to sleep and recover.”

With Snow League’s format refresh and athlete focus, some of the athletes at Buttermilk over the weekend think it may take an edge over its competitors. It’s other advantage is athlete compensation: the Snow League is set to dole out $370,000 in payments to athletes, ranging from $5,000 to all 36 competitors to an additional $50,000 given to Totsuka and Tomita for winning, with a total prize purse of $1.6 million for the first season’s four events.

But like all things, the question for the Snow League will be financial viability: it’s always ideal to compensate your athletes as best you can and provide top-of-the-scale experiences, but the money has to come from somewhere. 

The inaugural Snow League podium featured four Japanese snowboarders, including champions Yuto Totsuka and Sena Tomita. Maddie Mastro was the only American, taking second place. 

The Snow League’s founding partners are hotel loyalty program Marriott Bonvoy; off-road vehicle Ineos Grenadier and beer brand Pacifico. It also has a multi-year broadcasting deal with NBC and secured $15 million in a funding round from a group of investors led by Left Lane Capital in January.

The money will just be part of the ongoing question: the Snow League will have to solve its calendar questions with other leagues, learn how to attract and keep snow action sports casuals and learn how to grow sustainably.

“It’s uncharted landscape,” White said in an article by The Washington Post. “I know where we want to go, but I don’t know how we’re going to get there.”

The Snow League will break for the summer, learn from its first event and prepare for its second event at Secret Garden in China in December. The competition will return to Aspen at the end of February 2026 and complete its first season in Switzerland after that. White told the athletes that in future years he hopes to expand the calendar to as many as 12 events.

What the future holds for the Snow League and winter action sports in general can’t yet be known. But it appears that some athletes are getting ready to bet on this horse — and its redheaded jockey.

“I’m excited to compete in this event,” Ferreira said. “I think Shaun White really taking the leap of faith, and him being an athlete, knowing what it takes to make the absolute best event, and now he’s living it in real life. And he’s actually, we’re all getting to see his vision come to life. And I think it’s really cool. I’m a huge fan, and I really want to see him succeed.”

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Freshman Kon Knueppel scored 17 points to help No. 2 Duke beat rival North Carolina 82-69 on Saturday night and clinch the outright Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season title.

Cooper Flagg added 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists despite first-half foul trouble for the Blue Devils (28-3, 19-1).

Duke blew a 15-point first-half lead and trailed by seven early after the break, but responded with 12 consecutive points to turn the game and silence a roaring hostile crowd.

The Blue Devils are now in position to rise to No. 1 in Monday's AP Top 25 poll with top-ranked Auburn losing its past two games.

Fifth-year senior RJ Davis scored 20 points in his final home game for Tar Heels (20-12), who were blown out in the first meeting but responded with far more resilience this time before Duke asserted control to stretch out the lead in the final seven minutes.

Duke: The Final Four favorite completed the first 19-1 regular-season slate since the ACC moved to 20 games in 2019-20.

UNC: The Tar Heels had won six straight coming in with their best play of the season to get back into better positioning for an NCAA bid. But this was their last chance to add a resume-topping win to help that case.

UNC led 59-53 when Duke made its move with 12 straight points in a 15-2 burst that put the Blue Devils ahead to stay. That included Knueppel's backdoor layup for the lead, while versatile defender Maliq Brown had a big 3-pointer in his return from injury that pushed Duke to a 68-61 lead with 8 1/2 minutes left.

UNC missed 22 of its last 27 shots in the final 15-plus minutes as Duke made its move.

The ACC Tournament starts Tuesday in Charlotte. Duke opens play as the 1-seed in Thursday's quarterfinals. UNC is the 5-seed and will play in Wednesday's second round.","{'href': 'https://spectrumlocalnews.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News'}"
https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,LeBron James says 'not much concern' on groin strain after exiting Lakers-Celtics amid fears he could miss weeks,https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/lebron-james-says-not-much-concern-on-groin-strain-after-exiting-lakers-celtics-amid-fears-he-could-miss-weeks-035839082.html,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 13:26:36 GMT","

LeBron James exited Saturday's much-anticipated rivalry clash between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics with a groin strain.

Midway through the fourth quarter, the 40-year-old left for the locker room and was soon announced to be ruled out for the rest of the game. He ended his night with 22 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists, with the Lakers going on to lose 111-101.

The injury appeared to occur while James made a few pivot moves in the game. He proceeded to signal to be taken out after the following defensive possession, then didn't return after testing it during a timeout.

Lakers head coach JJ Redick didn't have any additional details after the game, but conceded there was ""obvious concern"" about James' health. ESPN's Dave McMenamin also reported the initial thought is James will be out weeks rather than days.

However, James didn't seem to think the injury was that serious afterward. Yet he acknowledged that consulting with trainer Mike Mancias for more tests and imaging was necessary.

""Not much concern,"" James said to reporters. ""Obviously, we'll go day-to-day and look at it each day and see if it gets better and then take the proper measures and see what we need to do moving forward.""

— Spectrum SportsNet (@SpectrumSN) March 9, 2025

James added that this injury didn't feel as serious as the groin injury he suffered in 2018 on Christmas Day, which occurred against the Golden State Warriors. That strain sidelined him for 17 games and lingered through the rest of that season.

""Ive been there before and know what type of injury we're dealing with,"" he explained and said that he expects to stay with the Lakers through the remaining three games of their road trip.

The injury and the loss put a halt to what had been a dream stretch for the Lakers, who entered Saturday with an eight-game win streak after their league-shaking trade for Dončić. The move also seemed to energize James, who went from averaging 24 points per game before the trade to 28.5 in the games since.

A significant James injury would obviously be a blow for the Lakers, who just started a road trip that will also see them face the Milwaukee Bucks and Denver Nuggets. It would also put more pressure on Dončić to lead a team he joined a month ago.

James has only missed four games so far this season and entered Saturday on track for his most games played in a season since he played all 82 in 2017-18.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

The Buffalo Bills made the long-anticipated decision to release Von Miller, parting ways with the aging edge rusher whose contract proved too expensive for his dwindling playing time and production

Buffalo Bills Release NFL's Active Sacks Leader Von Miller in a Salary Cap-Saving Move

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — The Buffalo Bills announced the long-anticipated decision to release Von Miller on Sunday, parting ways with the aging edge rusher whose contract proved too expensive for his dwindling playing time and production.

The move allows the Bills to free up about $8.4 million in salary cap space, which comes close to matching how much the team was projected to be over the limit before the NFL’s new year begins Wednesday. Nevertheless, a portion of Miller’s contract will remain on Buffalo’s books this year and is projected to count more than $15 million against the cap.

The Bills posted a picture of Miller with the words “Thank You Von” in making the announcement on their X account.

The 14-year veteran is the NFL's active leader in sacks and set to turn 36 in two weeks. Miller avoided being released a year ago by agreeing to take a substantial pay cut to lower his cap number. It’s unclear if the two sides considered a similar contract restructuring this offseason.

Miller expressed optimism he’d remain in Buffalo for a fourth season after the Bills lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC championship game in January.

“There’s always some stuff that you can work out or something that you can do,” Miller said.

“I want to be here. I don’t want to speak for them, but I think they want me here, too,” he added. “If you want to make God laugh, start making plans. But I plan on being a Buffalo Bill for sure.”

General manager Brandon Beane was vague in saying the team was still working through its roster plans when specifically asked about Miller's status at the NFL combine in Indianapolis last month.

Beane has since placed his priority on locking in his young core by signing fourth-year edge rusher Greg Rousseau and third-year players linebacker Terrel Bernard and receiver Khalil Shakir to four-year contract extensions.

Miller failed to play to the high expectations Beane had in making the bold gamble to sign the player to a six-year, $120 million contract three years ago. Miller chose Buffalo instead of re-signing with the Los Angeles Rams after winning his second Super Bowl.

After leading the Bills with eight sacks through his first 10 games in 2022, Miller tore the ACL in his right knee in Week 11, an injury from which he never fully recovered.

He failed to register a sack in 12 regular-season and two playoff games in 2023. Miller had six sacks in 15 games, including playoffs, last season. His playing time was severely limited to mostly pass-rush situations in averaging 21 1/2 snaps per regular-season outing.

Miller also missed four games because of an NFL suspension for violating the league’s personal conduct policy. The suspension stemmed from allegations that Miller assaulted his pregnant girlfriend a year earlier. He was arrested but never charged.

The future is cloudy for a player who enters free agency for just the second time entering what would become his 15th season. His 129 1/2 sacks rank 16th — two behind Lawrence Taylor and Leslie O’Neal since sacks became an official stat in 1982.

Miller was the No. 2 pick in the 2011 draft and spent his first 10-plus seasons with the Denver Broncos. He earned NFL defensive rookie of the year honors and appeared in two Super Bowls with Denver, including the Broncos' win in the 2015 season.

The NFL's franchise tag deadline has come and gone, which puts the focus on free agency, which officially opens at 4 p.m. ET on March 12. Deals can be made before that though as the so-called legal tampering period begins at noon ET on March 10. But plenty of action is already underway as teams are cutting veterans, re-signing stars and shopping for potential trades.

The Las Vegas Raiders made one of the loudest moves of the week, reportedly trading for Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith. That's a move that will have significance for Minnesota Vikings QB Sam Darnold.

Here's everything you need to know as teams across the league continue to make moves this offseason.

Kansas City Chiefs OL Trey Smith

Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins

This marks the fewest players tagged in a year since 1994, per ESPN.

The Dallas Cowboys worked out a four-year, $80 million deal with defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who reportedly would have been place on the tag if a deal couldn't be reached.

Darnold, meanwhile, seemed like a straightforward candidate for the tag, so that he and the Vikings could buy more time in trying to work out a longer-term deal. But the $40.2 million number for QBs on the tag (see below) was reportedly too high for the Vikings, and would have limited their ability to build out the rest of the roster.

The Kansas City Chiefs and linebacker Nick Bolton have agreed to a three-year, $45 million deal with $30 million in guaranteed money, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports.

The 2021 second-round draft pick has been a key defender on Chiefs teams that have played in three consecutive Super Bowls and won two. He tallied 106 tackles, 11 tackles for loss and three sacks last season.

The Seahawks and defensive tackle Jarran Reed have agreed to a three-year deal contract up to $25 million, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports. The contract will keep Reed from hitting free agency.

Reed, 32, tallied 4.5 sacks, 15 quarterback hits, 45 tackles and five tackles for loss in 17 games last season.

The Bills are releasing edge rusher Von Miller, NFL Network reports.

Miller, 36, played 13 games for Buffalo last season, registering six sacks with 17 total tackles, seven tackles for loss and 32 total pressures.

Cutting him will save the Bills $8.5 million on their salary cap. Miller and the Bills are open to him rejoining the team, according to Tom Pelissero and Ian Rapoport.

Zach Ertz apparently liked the Commanders' offense. The veteran tight end is re-signing with Washington on a one-year, $6.25 million deal after one season with the team. After rough end to his career with the Arizona Cardinals, he ranked second on D.C. in receiving yards with 654 catching passes from Jayden Daniels.

The Saints cap maneuvering continues.

According to ESPN, New Orleans is restructuring Derek Carr's contract to free up nearly $31 million in cap space.

The Saints have been heavily leveraged against the cap in recent seasons and have needed to make moves like this simply to get under the cap in recent seasons. The move also means that Carr will now carry a cap number of $69 million in 2026. Unless, of course, the Saints make more cap moves.

Per Spotrac, New Orleans was over $38 million over the cap as of Saturday before Carr's deal was redone. That means the franchise needs to make more moves simply to be cap compliant.

Take another tight end off the board.

Last season with the Chiefs, Brown was limited to two games (starting one) after dislocating his shoulder during the preseason and eventually undergoing surgery. He returned during Week 16 and notched nine receptions for 91 yards in total. In the postseason, he caught five passes (on 13 targets) for 50 yards.

Brown, 27, had his best season in 2021 with the Ravens, tallying 91 receptions for 1,008 yards and six TDs. For his career, he's totaled 322 catches for 3,735 yards and 28 scores with Baltimore, the Cardinals and Chiefs.

Gesicki, 29, caught 65 passes for 665 yards and two touchdowns last season, his first with the Cincinnati Bengals. He spent the 2023 season with the New England Patriots and his first five NFL seasons with the Miami Dolphins.

Tight end Mike Gesicki is re-signing with the Benglas on a three-year, $25.5 million deal, per sources.

It's one of the great rivalries in English football but of late Arsenal's meetings with Manchester United have rather looked like one way traffic. Ruben Amorim's side might have clung on to a draw in the FA Cup third round, winning the tie on penalties, but they have lost their last four league games to Mikel Arteta's side, their longest losing streak ever to Arsenal.

Following a grueling trip to face Real Sociedad on Thursday, Ruben Amorim and his players will have to dig deep against an opponent who arrives on an almighty high having rained down seven goals on PSV Eindhoven two days earlier. Injury issues still plague the Arsenal attack but they haven't gone three Premier League games without a goal since August 2021.

Manchester United: Patrick Dorgu is serving his suspension after a red card against Ipswich, complicating Amorim's options at left wing back, where defensive solidity will be needed to quell Arsenal's bright young spark Ethan Nwaneri. The wing back adds to a pretty lengthy list of absentees for United, with the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Lisandro Martinez and Amad Diallo unavailable. Toby Collyer returned to action against Real Sociedad in midweek but both Harry Maguire and Manuel Ugarte were missing because of knocks. Whether they will be available is not yet clear.

""We have to recover, be really smart during the game against Arsenal,"" said Amorim, who must keep one eye on Thursday's Europa League round of 16 second leg at Old Trafford. ""We have to check the players, they have to sleep. It's an important moment in our season.""

Possible Manchester United XI: Onana; Lindelof, De Ligt, Yoro; Mazraoui, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dalot; Zirkzee, Garnacho; Hojlund

Arsenal: The levee having broken in Eindhoven, it will be up to Arsenal to prove that there was more to their enormous win than bad defending by PSV and a few shots breaking their way. Without the injured quartet of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka the attack has unsurprisingly stuttered and Mikel Merino still does not look like a natural leading the Arsenal line.

Still it seems likely he'll keep his place in a team that might change little from Tuesday night. After all if Arteta needs to bring in some fringe players he can do so on Wednesday where his side are six goals to the good. This game should really about keeping the daylight between Arsenal in second and the chasing pack for Champions League spots.

Possible Arsenal XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Lewis-Skelly; Odegaard, Partey, Rice; Nwaneri, Merino, Trossard

Given the heavy legs in United colors, this might just be the day for Arsenal and their defense to grind out three points. PICK: Manchester United 0, Arsenal 1

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Eddie George reportedly agrees to become Bowling Green's next head coach,https://sports.yahoo.com/college-football/article/eddie-george-reportedly-agrees-to-become-bowling-greens-next-head-coach-152938293.html,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:32:55 GMT","

Eddie George is getting a chance to coach at the top level of college football.

According to multiple reports, Bowling Green has agreed to terms with the former NFL running back to become its next head coach. The deal is for five years, per ESPN. The Falcons were forced into an early 2025 coaching search when Scot Loeffler left to take an assistant coaching position with the Philadelphia Eagles.

George has been the head coach at Tennessee State for the past four seasons. The Tigers were 9-13 in his first two seasons before moving to 6-5 in 2023 and jumping to 9-4 in 2024. Tennessee State made the FCS playoffs a season ago after tying for first in the Big South-OVC but lost in the first round to Montana.

George is a native of Philadelphia but a legend in the state of Ohio after starring at Ohio State from 1992-95. George capped off his Ohio State career with the Heisman in 1995 following a 1,826-yard season that included 23 rushing touchdowns along with 44 catches for 399 yards. George, a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, had 3,768 rushing yards with the Buckeyes and ranks fourth all-time in school history behind Archie Griffin, J.K. Dobbins and Ezekiel Elliott.

After George won the Heisman, he was a first-round pick of the Houston Oilers in 1996 before the franchise moved to Tennessee a season later. He rushed for over 1,000 yards in seven of his eight seasons with the franchise and had 64 total touchdowns.

He played the final season of his career with the Dallas Cowboys before retiring after the 2004 season. George finished his career with 10,441 rushing yards and 78 total touchdowns.

George’s hire is similar to Colorado’s move to hire Deion Sanders from FCS-level Jackson State. The Pro Football Hall of Famer has energized the Colorado football program. Bowling Green was 7-6 in 2024 and lost the 68 Ventures Bowl. The Falcons have gone to bowl games in each of the past three seasons but haven’t won a bowl game since the 2014 season.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

On his new podcast ‘This Is Gavin Newsom’ Thursday, the California governor also said Democrats should make room for pro-lifers.

Males who identify as transgender women shouldn’t be allowed to play female sports and the Democratic Party should make room for pro-lifers, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on his podcast Thursday.

Newsom, 57, governor of one of the most Democratic states in America and often lampooned by conservatives as an unhinged left-winger, made the comments during an 82-minute interview with an unlikely guest — conservative Christian activist Charlie Kirk.

Newsom, widely considered a likely presidential candidate in 2028, is a strong supporter of legal and publicly funded abortion, despite being a baptized Catholic. As mayor of San Francisco in 2004, he ordered the clerk’s office to issue same-sex civil marriage licenses, which was against state law at the time.

But his comments during his This Is Gavin Newsom podcast have drawn widespread attention.

Newsom’s newsmaking statements came in response to Kirk’s prodding, which was spurred on by Newsom’s repeated pumping of Kirk for political advice.

“But what do you do? Seriously, Charlie Kirk, give us some advice,” Newsom said at one point.

“Get better ideas, Governor,” Kirk said. “… Like for example — you have an opportunity to, like, run to the middle and seize this mantle. Obviously you’re talking to me about people. 

You right now should come out and be like, ‘You know what? The young man who’s about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports, that shouldn’t happen.’ You as the governor should stay up and say, ‘No.’ Would you do something like that? Would you say, ‘No men in female sports’?”

“Well, I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It’s deeply unfair,” Newsom said.

Kirk, the co-founder of the politically conservative advocacy organization Turning Point USA, noted that a recent poll found that 80% of Americans oppose males playing female sports. He said he could see Newsom wrestling with the issue.

“No, I’m not wrestling with it, the fairness issue. I totally agree with you,” Newsom said.

Newsom also seemed to downplay the value of using alternative pronouns for people who identify as other than male or female, saying he has only seen it happen once during a meeting during his time as governor. He also said no one in his office has ever used the purportedly gender-neutral term “Latinx.”

Again under Kirk’s prodding, Newsom praised as “brilliant” a Trump campaign spot before the presidential election last fall saying that “Kamala is for they-them. President Trump is for you.”

“Devastating. Devastating. Devastating. And she didn’t even react to it, which was more devastating,” Newsom said.

Kirk also raised the issue of abortion. He said the Democratic Party has what he called “an unhealthy purification process” that leaves the party “a bunch of people who are talking to each other.”

“For example, if there’s a pro-life Democrat, is there a place for a pro-life Democrat in the party?” Kirk asked.

“There should be,” Newsom said. “That’s principle. There should be. That’s a deeply held personal point of view. God bless.”

“And I say this as one of the biggest champions for reproductive freedom on the planet,” Newsom said.

Newsom, who still identifies as a Catholic, praised Kirk “as a man of faith, and I deeply admire that about you.”

Kirk occasionally chided Newsom for taking the Lord’s name in vain, which he did several times during the interview.

At times, Newsom sounded as if he were doing what is known in politics as opposition research — but with the goal not of discrediting his opponent but rather learning from him.

“These things are important — and by the way, it’s the reason we’re having this conversation,” Newsom said. “This is very illuminating and helpful to me, to understand sort of the animus. What is it about, you know, that animus?”

Newsom said his own 13-year-old son wanted to skip school on Thursday so he could meet 

Kirk, 31, who makes popular online videos based on his frequent visits to college campuses. Kirk often debates liberal students outside, while inviting them to ask him anything.

Asked by Newsom how often he talks to President Donald Trump, Kirk said, “Once or twice a week.”

The conversation between Newsom and Kirk was cordial, bordering on friendly, but the two clashed on certain issues, including whether what Kirk called “pornographic” books should be eliminated from elementary schools, which Newsom called “book banning.”

On another matter, Kirk said teachers should be fired if they withhold a student’s gender transitioning at school from the child’s parents. Newsom responded: “There’s so much extreme rhetoric in this space.”

Kirk said Democrats will lose on that issue.

“Sometimes you lose on principle. It’s one of those things; everything’s not political, is the point,” Newsom said.

Newsom said Kirk and Republicans are on the unpopular side on abortion and same-sex civil marriage, which Kirk acknowledged.

But Newsom said he agreed with Kirk that Democrats are hurt by their stance on gender-identity issues.

“I deeply am mindful of the politics of this, which are very unhelpful personally,” Newsom said. “It’s unhelpful more broadly, professionally [to] the Democratic Party and our brand and one of the reasons — to your point — the Democratic Party brand has just been crushed.”

Matthew McDonald Matthew McDonald is a staff reporter for The National Catholic Register and the editor of New Boston Post.  He lives in Massachusetts.

The court’s decision is not a final ruling but rather puts enforcement on hold indefinitely until the case is settled.

“The Catholic Church in California has been a staunch advocate and resource for unhoused populations, providing both emergency shelter and pathways to permanent housing.”

Newsom told CNS after his meeting with Pope Francis that he was “struck” by the Pope’s sudden comments to him on the death penalty.

The Golden State leader nixed the annual Christmas tree lighting festival and skipped a menorah lighting ceremony.

EWTN foundress offered practical resolutions, underscoring how to grow in faith this season.

The Intentional Catholic Student Residency Program will be open to Catholic undergraduates interning in the capital.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,"SEC tournament bracket, schedule: Can Auburn still run the table in Nashville?",https://sports.yahoo.com/college-basketball/article/sec-tournament-bracket-schedule-can-auburn-still-run-the-table-in-nashville-154853800.html,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:52:08 GMT","

The SEC tournament should be the best among the major conference tournaments this week, and not just because Auburn has dominated the sport in the second half of the season.

Here’s everything you need to know about the SEC tournament.

Regardless of what happens in Nashville, the Tigers are in a great position headed into the NCAA tournament. The Tigers, who fell at Texas A&M before losing to Alabama in overtime on Saturday, have 16 Quad 1 wins this season — which is way more than any other team in the country. They held onto the top spot in the national rankings for more than two months and have been nearly unstoppable in the best conference in basketball behind Player of the Year candidate Johni Broome. They should take home a No. 1 seed, if not the top overall seed, in the NCAA tournament.

Even though they've lost two straight, the Tigers are still the team to beat — both in the SEC tournament and in general.

The Tigers aren't the only great team in the SEC. Florida ended the year winning nine of its last 10 games to finish in second in the conference, and it lost just four times all year. The Gators beat Auburn convincingly in Alabama, too. Tennessee, despite slipping at Ole Miss last week, won five of its last six and beat Florida by 20 points last month while hanging in at the top of the conference. The Crimson Tide were right there, too, though they dropped two of their last three to Tennessee and Florida before beating Auburn on Saturday.

Alabama may be the least convincing of this group to challenge Auburn for the title. The SEC tournament, however, is very much up for grabs.

The SEC will almost certainly set a new record in the NCAA tournament this spring, especially if things go the right way in the conference tournament. The league is looking at 12 bids in the NCAA tournament this season, which would break the record set by the Big East in 2011. The Big Ten is pushing double-digit bids, too.

Keep an eye on both Georgia and Oklahoma this week in Nashville. Both teams could use a solid win or two to solidify their spots in the tournament. Georgia ended the year on a four-game win streak, which included an upset win over Florida, and should sneak into the tournament regardless. Oklahoma, after a 13-0 start, could use a win to ensure they make it to the tournament for the first time since 2021.

HUNTINGTON – Here Saturday night inside Marshall Health Network Arena the only area Mid-Ohio Valley Class AA/A wrestler to have his arm raised at the 78th annual state tournament was Williamstown High School freshman Dutch Sandy.

In and out of the lineup all season due to injury, Sandy was able to cap what turned out to be an historic 34-1 campaign with the 120-pound title after he rolled to an 18-3 tech fall against Herbert Hoover junior Hunter Hughart.

Williamstown, which bumped up to double-A for head coach Tyler George, managed to crack the top five in fourth with 122 points. The ‘Jackets finished just ahead of fifth-place Ripley (115) as Point Pleasant (164.5), Herbert Hoover (142) and Oak Glen (125) led the way in the team standings.

Sandy registered a trio of takedowns in the opening period and never looked back.

“Dutch is an extremely talented individual who is backed by tons of hard work,” admitted WHS assistant coach Dalton George, who had been the only freshman in school history to win a state crown, which came back in 2011 at 103.

“We are all very proud of him and trust me when I say this, this is just the beginning of Dutch Sandy’s accomplishments.”

Sandy’s title represented the 48th all-time in ‘Jacket history. In fact, Williamstown hadn’t reached the top of the podium in more than a decade. The last Yellowjacket to have his hand raised during the final match in Huntington was 195-pounder David Hastings back in 2014, which also happened to be the same year Dalton George won his third career crown and was honored with the Robert Dutton Award.

Sandy’s only defeat this season came to Ripley’s Kendrick Durst, who placed fourth in triple-A.

“I should’ve won the match, but it happens, you know. Mistakes get made,” Sandy admitted of his only hiccup this winter.

The freshman wasn’t able to compete at the Bob Zide Rumble among other tournaments.

“I missed quite a few. I dislocated my shoulder twice within three weeks,” Sandy explained. “You just got to recover and take care of your body. It was a tough season, but came out on top.”

When asked if he was nervous making his first state final he stressed “no. I was calm, cool, collected. I knew I was going to win that match. I just went out there and did what I needed to do.

“I’ve always been injury prone, but I started taking a lot better care of my body so I was healthy and ready to compete. It means a lot man. I mean just doing it for all my family and all my friends and coaches, you know, representing the school of Williamstown and putting us back on the map like we deserve to be. It’s awesome. It’s awesome.”

Williamstown was aided to its top-five finish by a trio of consolation finals triumphs thanks to Aiden Meeks (113), Cole Smith (126) and Kipp Freed (157). ‘Jacket 215-pounder Thad Trent finished fourth.

Ripley head man Matt Smith’s squad had finalists with 157-pounder Ethan Kay and 190-pounder Cooper Durst, who won the triple-A crown at 190 last winter. Durst, though, was facing top-ranked Independence junior Jesse Adams, who captured his third career crown via a 9-1 major decision. Kay, also a senior, allowed an edge of the mat takedown in the first and suffered a 10-4 setback in his only finals appearance to Cameron sophomore Eli Tedrow, who was the 157-pound state runner-up in 2024 for Wheeling Central.

Tyler Consolidated's Eliana Winfrey, pictured here getting a takedown in the first against Buckhannon-Upshur's Lylah Ketterman in their 152-pound girls state invitational title match, won her second career crown after securing a win by fall in 5:29.

The Vikings were aided to their fifth-place team finish with the help of Carter Neal (3rd, 285), Durst (4th, 126), Mason Philyaw (5th, 144) and Garrett Brown (5th, 150).

Gilmer County freshman Dallas Goodrich, who was the first Little Kanawha Conference champion in school history for head coach Denny Hardman, reached the 106-pound finals, but ran out of time.

The Titan fell behind 3-0 to Greenbrier West sophomore Matthew Kesterson with 28 ticks left in the first and the scoreboard read 9-1 in favor of the Cav entering the third. Goodrich, though, refused to quit and continued to fight as he closed the deficit all the way to the final score of 12-10.

Thanks to his effort, Goodrich was honored as the Class A Most Outstanding Wrestler.

Also trying for state titles on Saturday night in Class AA/A from the Mid-Ohio Valley were Braxton County 150-pound junior Paxton Smith, the MOW at the LKC, as well as Roane County 215-pound senior Lane Watson, who was the 190-pound state champ a year ago.

The Titan was named Most Outstanding Wrestler for single-A.

Watson, who faced defending 215-pound victor Isaac Martin of Wheeling Central, was unable to muster any offense as head coach Rick Welker watched his Maroon Knight take the lead for good with a takedown at 0:39 of the first en route to securing a 5-2 victory. It was the same case for Smith, who trailed 6-0 entering the third and recorded the only other point of the match via an escape with 65 seconds remaining.

Braxton County, which saw veteran boss Sterling Beane honored with the Class A Mike Stump Coaching Award, finished runner-up to Cameron (126-72.5) as Greenbrier West (42) placed third with Tyler Consolidated and East Hardy tying for fifth with 38 points apiece.

Also finding their way to the podium for coach Beane were Luke Kelly (4th, 132) and Eliah Moore (3rd, 175).

Watson was joined by sixth-place, 175-pound finisher Wyatt Nichols while the Silver Knights were led by Branson Winfrey (4th, 157) and Colsen Spragg (5th, 138).

Five other area wrestlers found their way to the podium in South Harrison’s Maddox Lewis (3rd, 120), Doddridge County’s Trey McDonough (5th, 113), Ritchie County’s Zayden Cordeiro (5th, 120) along with Ravenswood teammates Linkin Andrick (6th, 132) and Trenton Bush (6th, 165).

In the girls state invitational, Silver Knight junior Eliana Winfrey capped a 32-1 campaign by jumping ahead of Buckhannon-Upshur freshman Lylah Ketterman 6-1 before earning the mat slapper in 5:29.

Tyler Consolidated also had a podium finish from Chloe Dutton (6th, 185).

A half dozen other girls managed a top-six effort – Calhoun County’s Kyleigh Morris (5th, 100), Williamstown’s Annabelle Sandy (5th, 126), Wirt County’s Anaston Carouthers (6th, 145) as well as Ripley teammates Lanie Knopp (6th, 107), Savannah Modrzakowski (5th, 114) and Emily Dunlap (6th, 138).

The Bills are releasing veteran pass rusher Von Miller.

The move, which will be made official this week, comes as no surprise: Miller would have had a $23.814 million salary cap hit if he had stayed on the Bills under his current contract, and that wasn't feasible.

That doesn't necessarily mean Miller is done in Buffalo: It's possible that he and the Bills could agree to a return at a lower salary. But by cutting him, the Bills avoid that massive cap hit and give Miller the opportunity to find out his value on the open market.

Miller, who will turn 36 this month, is one of the best pass rushers of his era, a Super Bowl MVP and a three-time first-team All-Pro. He's not playing at that level anymore, but he'll draw interest from NFL teams who think he can still contribute, and can be a valuable veteran presence.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

So much for Browns defensive end Myles Garrett demanding a trade to a Super Bowl contender.

After a month in which Garrett requested a trade and the Browns said he wasn’t going anywhere, an agreement has been reached: Garrett will sign a new contract with the Browns that makes him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history, according to Adam Schefter of ESPN.

The full details of the contract are not yet known, but it reportedly includes $123.5 million guaranteed and will pay him an average of $40 million a year.

Garrett’s trade request gave him leverage with the Browns, who didn’t want to lose their best player but recognized he wasn’t happy. Giving a player $123.5 million guaranteed is a good way to make him happy.

The question, though, is whether anything has changed with Garrett’s stance that his biggest goal is to win a Super Bowl. The Browns do not look particularly close to that. With the 29-year-old Garrett now apparently planning to play out his prime in Cleveland, either he thinks the team is closer to a turnaround than it appears, or he is accepting that if the Browns can’t make him a champion, they can make him rich.

Mikaela Shiffrin let a slalom win slip away Sunday yet set an all-time World Cup record with her 156th finish on a race podium

Mikaela Shiffrin Sets World Cup Podiums Record With 3rd Place in a Slalom Won by Katharina Truppe

ARE, Sweden (AP) — Mikaela Shiffrin set an all-time World Cup record Sunday with her 156th podium finish though she let victory slip away in a slalom. 

Racing through steadily falling snow with a first-run lead, Shiffrin was only 25th-fastest in the second run to finish in third place, 0.19 seconds behind surprise winner Katharina Truppe.

Katharina Liensberger placed second, trailing 0.05 behind her Austria teammate, whose first career World Cup win was earned at age 29.

“Katharina Day!” Shiffrin said in the finish area as she hugged the two racers who beat her.

“I actually feel pretty good about it,"" Shiffrin said of her fifth slalom race in her comeback from a serious crash in November. ""I maybe wasn’t always perfect but I was pushing really hard.”

Shiffrin's 156th top-3 result in her World Cup career broke a tie with Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark. Shiffrin also took the all-time wins record from Stenmark and now has 100 to his 86.

Truppe now has one from her 181st World Cup start, though she has three championship medals including the team event gold at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. 

“It’s just: ‘Wow.’ I’m a little bit speechless,” said Truppe, who had been sixth-fastest in the morning run, trailing Shiffrin by 0.91. “First victory, it’s crazy. I will enjoy it and soak up all this emotion.""

Both Truppe and Shiffrin are aged 29 and won slalom bronze medals at the junior world championships though their careers were on different trajectories. Shiffrin won her medal aged 15 in 2011 and already had two World Cup slalom titles and Olympic gold before Truppe got her junior worlds medal in 2015. 

Shiffrin needed to win Sunday to earn 100 race points and stay in contention — though only just – for a ninth career season-long slalom title. She missed four slalom races while recovering from her physical and psychological injuries.

“I’m still trying to get the repetition back. I just have to keep practicing it,” she said.

With Olympic slalom champion Petra Vlhova skipping the entire season to recover from a knee injury, the door opened for a new World Cup title winner.

The World Cup season-ending last slalom is at Sun Valley, Idaho, on March 27 with four skiers ahead of Shiffrin and within 100 points of the lead to lift the crystal globe trophy.

Title-chasing contenders Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, the world championships gold medalist last month, both were below their best form Sunday and placed 10th and 11th, respectively.

Ahead of going to the United States, the 21-year-old Ljutic leads Rast in the slalom standings by 41 points and will win the title with a top-three result. Liensberger, the 2021 champion, and Rast’s Swiss teammate Wendy Holdener also could win.

Shiffrin said she plans to train in Europe before the trip across seven time zones, to the Idaho resort that last staged World Cup races in 1977. 

“There’s certainly some travel challenges. It’s a really long distance,” she said. ""I guess one more race this season for me but I’m looking forward to it.”

Between Houston, Texas Tech and Iowa State, we should be in for a great week in Kansas City.

Here’s everything you need to know about the Big 12 tournament.

Houston has rolled through a very solid Big 12 this season, and the Cougars look like a legit national title contender. They closed out the regular season with 10 straight wins, including over both Iowa State and Texas Tech, and they’ve lost just once since the end of November. L.J Cryer has dominated offensively, and the Houston defense has been remarkable. The Cougars haven’t let a team score more than 65 points during their 10-game win streak, too.

If Kelvin Sampson is going to make a title run, this is the perfect chance to do it. That starts in Kansas City, where the Cougars will get the double bye.

The Cyclones looked incredibly dominant early in the season. They climbed as high as No. 2 in the national rankings, a program best, after opening the year on a 15-1 tear. But lately, the team has been dealing with both significant injuries and illness, which has caused it to drop three of its last five games to close out the season. Houston held the Cyclones to just 59 points in their only matchup last month, too.

Texas Tech may be the better option. The Red Raiders have climbed their way into the rankings after a very solid run through the Big 12, which included a wild overtime win against the Cougars last month. They have won three straight to end the season and finished second in the Big 12.

If anyone is going to dethrone Houston, it’s likely going to be one of these two.

The preseason No. 1 team in the nation is entering the Big 12 tournament in perhaps the worst possible way. The Jayhawks finished the regular season with a 20-11 record and lost seven of their last 13 games. They fell out of the national rankings for the first time in years and suffered one of the worst blowout losses in the Bill Self era when they lost to BYU by more than 30.

The team that generally dominates the Big 12 and has a huge advantage with what essentially is a home conference tournament looks far from a team that can make an NCAA tournament run. If there is any hope of that left, it will likely take a run to the Big 12 title game in order for the Jayhawks to get their confidence back.

Eight teams will book their tickets to the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League this week as the round of 16 comes to a close. The stakes vary for different teams across Europe, especially since some exited the first leg with sizable advantages while others have all to play for in the second leg. While Arsenal's 7-1 win at PSV and Bayern Munich's 3-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen will allow those two teams to feel like they already have a foot in the last eight, Real Madrid's 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid and Barcelona's 1-0 triumph at Benfica means those two join a host of European heavyweights that will have to be at their best this week to advance.

Ahead of another consequential round of games, here's what you need to know.

1. Paris Saint-Germain eye comeback at Liverpool

Liverpool's first-leg advantage over Paris Saint-Germain is not necessarily a surprise, in theory – the Premier League leaders were the class of the league phase and finished in first place with relative ease, while PSG just about snuck into the knockouts after a difficult opening phase of the competition. Things are not so simple in this round of 16 tie, though, with Liverpool looking pretty vulnerable heading into their home leg.

The Reds' one-goal lead naturally sets up for a competitive second leg, but especially so considering how the first leg went. A youth-focused PSG did all the right things last week in a completely dominant performance, boasting 70.1% of the ball and putting 10 of their 27 shots on frame while Liverpool took just two shots overall. The Reds' Alisson, though, somehow came up with nine saves to keep his side in the game, allowing them to score off their lone shot on target – Harvey Elliot's strike in the 87th minute.

As a result, it's difficult to know which version of Liverpool will show up on Tuesday. It's clear the fatigue of a long season has caught up with them, though they still have the incomparable Mfirst-legohamed Salah to keep their chances of advancing high. PSG will have plenty to play for at Anfield, though, and clearly, they also have all the tools they need to succeed.

2. Is it Real Madrid's time to shine?

Real Madrid's season of inconsistency means last season's uncanny ability to win even in imperfect circumstances has not been equally as present this campaign, but they may have looked like their vintage selves in their 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid last week.

It was undoubtedly a closely contested game, with both sides having meaningful spells of possession and impactful goalscoring chances. Though Los Blancos' early lead was canceled out by the half-hour mark, they snapped into form once Brahim Diaz restored their advantage early in the second half. Real Madrid found a way to suck the energy out of the game and stifle Atletico's talented attack, calmly getting over the first leg finish line. A one-goal advantage means Atletico are still very much in this tie but if the first leg is anything to go by, Real Madrid might just be peaking at the right time.

3. Barcelona aim to reverse course

Barcelona may have a first leg advantage over Benfica, but last week's outing was far from their best. They were outshot 26 to 10 by Benfica in the first leg but were helped by the fact that the opposition could not muster a very effective offensive performance – Benfica posted 1.75 expected goals, not much better than Barcelona's 1.21. There's room for improvement for both teams heading into the second leg but considering each side's strengths, it sets up for a fascinating second leg in Barcelona.

Hansi Flick's side will be without Pau Cubarsi after he picked up a red card just 22 minutes into the first leg, which complicated matters for them last week and could also cause issues in the second leg. While Flick's team selection is usually fairly straightforward in attack, he will have some big calls in the back with Cubarsi's absence, especially against the talented Vangelis Pavlidis, who has seven goals in the Champions League with Benfica this season.

No. 8 Michigan State will be looking for a season sweep of rival No. 17 Michigan on Sunday when they meet to conclude the regular season on CBS. The Spartans (25-5, 16-3 Big Ten) have already secured the outright Big Ten title and will be looking to send their seniors out on a high note during their final game at the Breslin Center. 

The Wolverines (22-8, 14-5) are mired in their first two-game losing skid since December and are seeking to get back on track entering their first postseason under coach Dusty May. Earning the program's first road win over the rival Spartans since 2018 would give Michigan a needed jolt ahead of the Big Ten Tournament. 

Michigan led 38-34 at halftime of the first meeting on Feb. 21 but was outscored by 17 in the second half as the Spartans shot a scorching 53.3% from the field. Freshman star Jase Richardson paced Michigan State with 21 points in the victory as part of a late-season surge for the 6-3 guard. 

Richardson is averaging 16.8 points on 51.7% shooting over his past eight games while emerging as one of the Big Ten's top guards. Michigan counters with the towering tandem of Danny Wolf and Vlad Goldin. The 7-footers are the Wolverines' leading scorers and combined for 32 points in the first meeting. 

Date: Sunday, March 9 | Time: 12 p.m. ET Location: Breslin Center -- East Lansing, Michigan TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (Free) Streaming on Paramount+ with Showtime (Try It Free) 

All odds via SportsLine consensus   

Michigan will be highly motivated for a rivalry rematch after it squandered an early lead and got dragged in the second half of a 75-62 home loss to the Spartans on Feb. 21. Michigan State shot uncharacteristically well from 3-point range (9 of 22) in the first meeting while the Wolverines hit just 5-of-21 looks from deep. Winning straight up on the road against the Big Ten's outright regular season champions will be a tall order for Michigan, but the Wolverines should be able to muster enough pride to at least keep this one close. Pick: Michigan +6.5

All is well again between Myles Garrett and the Cleveland Browns. The two sides have agreed on a contract extension that will pay the defensive end an average annual salary of $40 million over four years and includes $123.5 million in guaranteed money, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported.

With the extension, which includes a no-trade clause, Garrett will now be the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. (Las Vegas Raiders pass rusher Maxx Crosby previously held that title for four days after getting a contract extension last Wednesday.)

The new contract ends a five-week saga during which Garrett requested a trade, saying he wanted to win a Super Bowl rather than be part of a rebuilding project. The Browns attempted to start talks on a contract extension, but Garrett cut off negotiations following his trade request.

From trade to truce and beyond: the Browns and Myles Garrett reached agreement today on a record contract extension that averages $40 million per year and includes $123.5 million in guaranteed money and now makes him the highest-paid non-QB in NFL history, sources tell ESPN.… pic.twitter.com/scNWJH2vFX

— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 9, 2025

Browns general manager Andrew Berry repeatedly said that the team had no interest in trading Garrett and wanted to extend his contract. Team owner Jimmy Haslem refused to meet with the 2023 NFL Defensive Player of the Year when Garrett wanted to discuss his future with the Browns. Obviously, something changed between the two sides.

Garrett, 29, finished second in the NFL with 14 sacks last season, his fifth consecutive season with 12 or more sacks. Additionally, he had 47 total tackles, 22 tackles for loss, 28 quarterback hits and 83 total pressures, playing in all 17 of the Browns games.

He was named first-team All-Pro for the second straight year and fourth time in the past five years, along with earning Pro Bowl honors for the fifth consecutive season.

Garrett was the No. 1 overall pick by the Browns in 2017 out of Texas A&M. In his eight NFL seasons, he's compiled 102.5 sacks and 352 total tackles in 117 games (114 starts).

However, Cleveland finished 3-14 last season and doesn't appear in position to improve much from that in the near future as the team attempts to solve its quarterback dilemma while attempting to fix the stranglehold that Deshaun Watson's contract has on its salary cap.

The Browns go into the offseason with only $4.3 million in cap space, according to Spotrac, which doesn't leave much room to make key additions.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Montreal Canadiens prospect Jacob Fowler closed out his fantastic sophomore season in the NCAA with a bang, backstopping Boston College’s Eagles to a 6-0 win. It was the 20-year-old’s seventh shutout of the season.

Canadiens: A False StartDemidov: The Best Since Guy LafleurLaine Needs a Better Center To Be EffectiveSt-Louis Liked His Captain's Response

Boston College finishes the season with 55 points and wins a second Hockey East regular season championship, the 19th win in program history. Fowler played a massive part in his team’s success, posting a 24-5-2 record with a .941 save percentage and a 1.62 goal-against average.

The masked man's seven shutouts were the third-highest total in a single season in program history. In two seasons with Boston College, Fowler posted 10 shutouts, the fifth-most in the college’s history.

What’s even more impressive about Fowler’s season is how he improved on a great rookie season last year. In his first year at BC, the netminder had a 32-6-1 record with three shutouts, a 2.14 GAA, and a .926 SP.

The netminder also showed he could play with an edge. He got suspended for one game after delivering a blocker hit to Tristan Fraser’s face after the UConn Husky forward scored and slid into him afterward.

Boston College will be the top seed in the Hockey East post-season tournament and hold a quarterfinal game on Saturday, March 15. Their opponent will be known after the first-round games on Wednesday, March 12. The semi-finals are scheduled for Thursday, March 20. The tournament final will be played on Friday, March 21.

Fowler and his teammates hope to participate in the NCAA National Championship, a 16-team single-elimination tournament that will take place from March 28-30, when the four regional matches will be played. The four winners will qualify for the Frozen Four, which will take place in St. Louis this year and is scheduled for April 10 and 12. Last year, the Eagles fell at the very last hurdle, dropping the final 2-0 against Denver University.

If everything goes according to plan for Boston College, it’s only after the Frozen Four that the Fowler watch will start. After dominating the competition in his sophomore season, it wouldn’t be surprising to see him end his collegiate career and sign an entry-level contract with the Canadiens to turn pro.

It's a big weekend for Real Madrid as the side coached by Carlo Ancelotti need to win after only having one win in the last five La Liga games as Los Blancos look to catch Atletico de Madrid and FC Barcelona. The match will be played on Sunday, three days before the second leg of the Madrid derby against Atletico, after Real Madrid won 2-1 in the first leg at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday. Here's what you need to know: 

Real Madrid: English midfielder Jude Bellingham will finally be back after serving his two-game suspension and he's widely expected to be back in the starting lineup alongside Rodrygo, Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr. 

Potential Real Madrid XI: Courtois; Vazquez, Asencio, Alaba, Fran Garcia; Modric, Tchouameni, Bellingham; Rodrygo, Mbappe, Vinicius. 

Rayo Vallecano: The away side will have to deal with the absence of Jorge de Frutos who is suspended and will definitely miss Sunday's game. 

Potential Rayo Vallecano XI: Batalla; Ratiu, Lejeune, Hernandez, Chavarria; Diaz, Cisse; Embarba, Trejo, A Garcia; Guardiola. 

Real Madrid are expected to win quite easily the game against Rayo as they need to get back to winning in the league between the two Champions League games. Pick: Real Madrid 2, Rayo Vallecano 0.

Player ratings from Manchester United versus Arsenal are an interesting ask, as Manchester United defended well and Arsenal again proved their attack is badly missing a center forward.

MORE — Ruben Amorim reaction from Old Trafford

The Red Devils will take something from this as they look to advance past Real Sociedad in the Europa League while Arsenal may have some job openings as they rotate for the Champions League second leg versus PSV Eindhoven.

Here’s what we saw from the 90 minutes at Old Trafford.

Andre Onana: 7 — Three good saves and the goal was unstoppable. Hoofed a lot of balls to the moon and not receivers.

Noussair Mazraoui: 7.5 — The fullbacks were excellent in the closest we’ve seen to Amorim’s ideal wide commitment.

Victor Lindelof: 8.5 — Only Casemiro recorded more defensive actions, as the former Benfica man thrived in Amorim’s system.

Matthijs De Ligt: 7 — Did very little wrong.

Leny Yoro (Off HT): 7 — Good with the ball and in the duel, came off at the break with either an ailment.

Diogo Dalot: 7 — (See Mazraoui).

Casemiro: 8 — Barely touched the ball but that wasn’t his job. This United is not his old Real Madrid, so his game-high 14 defensive actions are the stat of note.

Christian Eriksen (Off 76'): 5 — Had some moments with the ball at his feet but just as many moments didn’t come off for the Danish veteran. Could he have helped put off Rice after seeing the midfielder in space just before the Arsenal goal?

Bruno Fernandes: 7.5 — At times it feels like he is their entire attack. Splendid, powerful free kick goal. Got sucked into Timber’s dribble on the Arsenal goal.

Alejandro Garnacho: 6.5 — May not be one to defend the nest, but is at his best hunting prey and always had his eyes scanning for chances in the Arsenal half.

Joshua Zirzkee (Off 76'): 7 — Who knows if he’ll ever be a Man United star, but the 23 year old grinds and does the proverbial hard yards (especially considering he’s a center forward by trade). Nearly swept a back leg goal home around the hour mark.

SubsAyden Heaven (On HT): 7 — Just an 18-year-old center back making his Premier League debut against the club who sold him in January. Probably deserves a bonus point for that. Terrific sliding denial of a cross in the 74th minute.Toby Collyer (On 76'): N/ARasmus Hojlund (On 76'): N/A — Had two decent chances in limited time, two more bits of danger than we usually see from him.



David Raya: 7 — Will have wanted to do much better on the Fernandes free kick, but there was some real venom on that one and he more than made amends with a remarkable quickfire double save on the same player in stoppage time.. Made two nice saves just after halftime, too, as United bid to make it a two-goal game.

Jurrien Timber: 7.5 — Terrific work to set up Rice’s equalizer.

William Saliba: 7.5 — Barely put a foot wrong, putting double-digit passes into the final third in ringing up nearly 100 touches.

Gabriel Magalhaes: 7 — Just as good as Saliba, even if the game didn’t make its way to his side as much.

Riccardo Calafiori (Off 58'): 6 — Didn’t offer much going forward, which has been a strength of his this season.

Thomas Partey (Off 76'): 6.5 — Passed the ball well and was a menace on the ground.

Declan Rice: 8 — A marvelous goal to go with a game-saving 85h-minute tackle of Hojlund. A workmanlike-if-slightly-substandard game (relative to his very high standards).

Martin Odegaard: 7 — Presided over a dangerous 70th-minute free kick and cranked it into the wall. Largely ran the game but was missing his cutting edge.

Ethan Nwaneri (Off 58'): 5 — Sometimes 17-year-olds look 17. Lost the majority of his duels.

Leandro Trossard: 5 — Poor giveaways and a poorer foul to giveaway the free kick that led o Bruno Fernandes’ goal.

Mikel Merino: 5 — Still not a forward, so can’t grade him too harshly. We know they scored seven times at midweek but Arteta having no other idea about what to do at center forward is, frankly, perplexing.

SubsGabriel Martinelli (On 58'): 5.5 — Missed a big chance before he missed an offside big chance in stoppage time.

Myles Lewis-Skelly (On 58'): 7 — Created a dangerous free kick for Odegaard by winning a foul

Kieran Tierney (On 76'): N/A

Three down ... so, so many to go. New to the list Sunday: NC State. You can read our newser on Kevin Keatts' firing here. 

Other news from the weekend: Steve Prohm is out at Murray State after three years (and his second stint there) and Russell Springmann got sacked after just two seasons at Oral Roberts. 

This story is where you'll find our ever-updating men's college basketball coaching tracker. Over the next month-plus, this piece will get dozens of updates. Carousel intel, sourced info, inevitably debunking some rumors and the latest on what's happening off the court amid the busiest month of the year in college hoops: you'll find it all here.

Sixteen jobs are set to change as of now and that number is going to climb quickly over the next five days. We'll almost definitely hit at least 40 coaching moves in this cycle — and 50-plus wouldn't be a surprise at all. That said, don't expect 2025 to hit the levels of absurdity that 2024 did, when there was a record 68 job swaps. Be sure to bookmark this page. It will get daily updates moving forward.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news,"Republican Medicaid cuts could shutter rural hospitals, maternity care",https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/08/medicaid-cuts-rural-hospitals/,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 17:54:52 GMT","

Potential Medicaid cuts could devastate America’s teetering rural health-care system and jeopardize Republicans’ political power among rural voters.

HONDO, Tex. — Jaylee Williams needed to find somewhere to deliver her son.

The 19-year-old knew more about barrel racing on her horse Bet-n-pep than the complicated metrics of who takes what health insurance. But relief for Williams and her boyfriend, Xander Lopez, came when they realized Medina Regional Hospital — just 15 minutes from their home — accepted Medicaid, the federal-state program that covers medical costs for lower-income Americans. Provider groups an hour away in San Antonio had refused to take the insurance, she recalled while cradling little Ryker.

“You never know when something could happen,” Williams said, with Lopez adding, “I have no idea where we would have gone” without Medina Regional Hospital.

But the lifeline that the 25-bed critical-access hospital offered to Williams and Lopez could disappear in Hondo and other communities like it.

Rural hospitals across the United States fear that massive Medicaid cuts Republicans would have to consider under the current House budget proposal could decimate maternity services or shutter already struggling medical facilities in communities that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump.

Nearly half of all rural hospitals nationwide operate at a deficit, with Medicaid barely keeping them afloat. Already, almost 200 rural hospitals have closed in the past two decades, according to the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, part of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Rural hospital leaders in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas who spoke to The Washington Post warned that the enormous cuts congressional Republicans are weighing could further destroy limited health-care access in rural America. Proposals to slash up to $880 billion over 10 years — which is expected to be accomplished largely by scaling back on Medicaid — would also affect those who do not rely on the program but do rely on the medical facilities that are financially dependent on the program’s reimbursements.

While Republicans are reluctant to acknowledge potential entitlement cuts due to possible political backlash, the House-passed budget proposal would almost certainly require Medicaid cuts, health-care analysts say.

“Every nickel matters,” said Benjamin Anderson, chief executive of Hutchinson Regional Healthcare System, which runs a rural hospital in Kansas. “It will cripple and close the health-care delivery systems that serve everyone.”

Heart attack and stroke victims may lose crucial time being ferried by ambulance to big-city hospitals, health-care experts say. Rural nursing homes may vanish, straining families in the poorest of regions. Those who are pregnant may have no choice but to drive long distances for prenatal checkups and to give birth.

Public perception often associates the health-care safety net used by more than 1 in 5 Americans with the urban poor. But rural children and non-elderly adults are more likely to rely on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) than those in metro areas, according to the Center for Children and Families at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.

The possible cuts are an “existential issue” for rural hospitals, said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association.

“Medicaid cuts are going to result in rural hospital closures,” he said. “It’s just a question of how many.”

Medina Regional Hospital sits in an 8,000-person agricultural town roughly an hour west of San Antonio, the drive between the two dotted with taxidermy signs, John Deere tractors and cattle. Per capita income comes in under $20,000 annually, according to the economic development director for the town.

The facility’s chief executive, Billie Bell, had considered closing the unit serving expectant mothers a few years ago. It’s a service the hospital already loses money on, Bell said, as the vast majority of obstetrics patients are on Medicaid, which does not reimburse the facility dollar for dollar for care. She managed to keep the unit open because she feared adding to the maternity health-care deserts in a state that far outpaces the nation in rising rates of maternal deaths.

More than 35 percent of U.S. counties don’t have birthing facilities or obstetric clinicians, according to a March of Dimes report. In Texas, that figure is even worse: Nearly half of the state’s counties are considered maternity-care deserts. Bell warned that cuts to Medicaid could shutter her unit completely.

“We’d lose a big heart of our community,” Bell said. “We provide care from the time someone is born until they die.”

Even if rural facilities manage to stay open but are forced to cut Medicaid-heavy services such as nursing homes or obstetrics care, more rural Americans — and Republican voters — will be left to deal with the consequences.

Some Republicans, such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) and Trump ally Stephen K. Bannon, have warned against gutting Medicaid, pointing to the vast number of Trump supporters who qualify for the program amid the populist wave that has transformed the GOP. The president has repeatedly said he will not touch Medicaid.

But he has also endorsed the House’s plan to find ways to cut spending across federal programs, which are expected to come out of the Medicaid program if lawmakers avoid cutting Medicare or Social Security. All three programs make up more than 40 percent of the federal budget. The House and Senate will work to reconcile their visions for cutting the federal budget in coming weeks.

The Republican Party suffered large congressional losses in 2018, the last time it tried Medicaid cuts, said KFF’s executive vice president for health policy, Larry Levitt, whose nonpartisan health-care research group surveyed Trump voters on Medicaid. Similar political reprisals could happen again, he warned.

“Rural America is Trump country,” Levitt said. “When they voted for Trump, I don’t think they expected cuts to their health care.”

In rural Hondo, whose slogan is “This is God’s country,” that kind of reaction wouldn’t be a surprise, said Mayor John McAnelly.

Hondo is the county seat of Medina County, where almost three-quarters of the presidential vote went to Trump. But if Medicaid cuts hurt Medina Regional Hospital, the answer would be pretty clear, the mayor said.

“Regardless of which party is in power, anytime you start doing those cuts, there’s going to be backlash,” McAnelly said.

Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas), who represents Hondo, has spoken with Bell about the plight rural hospitals face.

When asked to comment, his office pointed to a letter he had sent to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) urging him to support a budget that tackles waste without harming critical programs that support Americans.

“Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing homes are already struggling to keep their doors open,” Gonzales and other representatives wrote.

About three in four rural residents said Medicaid funding should increase or stay the same, KFF found in a poll released Friday.

With broad support for rural hospitals, there are likely to be carve-outs to protect them in a Republican reconciliation bill, said Brian Blase, an influential voice in the Medicaid debate. He served as a White House economic official in the first Trump administration and is now president of Paragon Health Institute, a right-leaning think tank, that is pushing for states to cover more Medicaid costs.

That support comes in part because when a rural hospital closes, communities don’t just lose their access to care — they often lose their economic lifeblood. Medina Regional Hospital is the largest employer in town and key to attracting businesses and young families essential to making Hondo thrive.

But items Republicans are proposing, such as work requirements, which often take people off Medicaid’s rolls, could impact its financial stability. During the coronavirus pandemic, states were required to keep people enrolled continuously in Medicaid to access enhanced federal funds. So when the public health emergency ended, millions were removed from Medicaid rolls, including many — particularly children — who probably remained eligible.

The Medicaid unwinding hit Medina Regional Hospital’s bottom line, said Kevin Frosch, the hospital’s chief financial officer. As people in his area came off the Medicaid rolls, they often got junk plans and were unable to pay for care, Frosch said.

Inside Medina Regional Hospital’s health clinic offices at the end of February, Chelsey Sullaway had her 37-week pregnancy checkup for her second baby, with her first daughter in tow.

Sullaway, who used to work at the hospital before becoming a stay-at-home mom, drives to Medina Regional Hospital for maternity care even though she lives in the San Antonio area. Sullaway isn’t on Medicaid, but she knows the hospital relies on its payments.

She voted red in the last election, but if the rural hospital she loved cut services, she would reconsider.

“It would impact votes for sure,” she said, as her daughter Vivian tried to climb on her.

As the sun set on a high school track meet in Hondo, two grandmothers watching their grandchildren race toward a chance at state glory laid out their opposing views on potential Medicaid cuts.

Leticia Garza said her mother told her never to talk about politics, because identifying herself as a Democrat wasn’t going to help her make any friends. Garza said she worries constantly about the cuts the Trump administration has made to federal services. She’s heard about women who are denied treatment for miscarriages and thinks about the future for her granddaughter.

When asked whether she thought this conservative small town would respond if Medicaid cuts impacted its health care, Garza said, “I’m hopeful that would change their votes.”

But her daughter, Nicole Garza, laughed, saying those voters have been “drinking the Kool-Aid too long.”

Across from the bleachers on the other side of the track, 66-year-old Sylvia Flores, an Air Force veteran who voted for Trump, said she trusted he would root out waste, fraud and abuse — rhetoric Republican leaders have often repeated when talking about potential Medicaid cuts.

Flores also noted that she had received quick care after a stroke at Medina Regional Hospital and hoped lawmakers “read before they sign” so cuts don’t affect “our little hospital.”

To Trump, she said, “Keep it up!”

Flores wasn’t alone in her concerns about waste, fraud and abuse — something the health-care community has experienced. Two administrators of the county’s local emergency medical service pleaded guilty in 2013 to fraudulently billing the government hundreds of thousands of dollars through Medicare and Medicaid for ambulance rides, including some that never happened.

However, health policy experts warn that even though there is waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, it doesn’t reach $880 billion. So while it’s important to go after bad actors, McAnelly said, the bigger picture matters.

“Go after the fraud, don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater,” the mayor added. “Everybody gets hurt on that. The leaders get hurt on it, the followers get hurt on it. The politicians, if you will, get hurt on it. The country gets hurt on it.”

Michael Haynie, who heads the local EMS company following the fraud fallout and works weekend shifts with his wife to keep the ambulances running, said he wasn’t sure that voters would connect the dots between Medicaid cuts and a decrease in access to hospital services. Even if they did, he said, people who qualify for Medicaid often have more pressing problems.

“Your typical Medicaid enrollee is not interested in what the news is saying about Medicaid,” Haynie said. “They’ve got more important things to worry about, like eating.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Healthcare organizations are starting to implement AI agents — autonomous, task-specific systems designed to perform functions with little or no human intervention. While initial adoption is focused mainly on non-clinical areas like scheduling and prior authorizations, experts predict that AI agents could eventually play a role in clinical decision-making, provided they meet rigorous safety and reliability standards.

The use of AI in healthcare has evolved quite a bit over the past few years — with many healthcare organizations transitioning from a state of cautious experimentation to more serious attempts at scaled integration. As millions of venture capital dollars continue to flow to startups developing healthcare AI, it’s clear that organizations across the industry will be leveraging this technology to optimize workflows and improve patient outcomes for years to come. 

As this trend continues, healthcare leaders are becoming increasingly interested in the category of agentic AI. Experts predict that AI agents — autonomous, task-specific systems designed to perform functions with little or no human intervention — will likely become increasingly popular in healthcare over the next couple years. 

The industry is facing growing pressures to achieve cost containment without compromising care quality, and health tech experts believe AI agents are a scalable solution that can help with this arduous goal.


					Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.				

Why are AI agents getting so much buzz?

AI agent is somewhat of a buzzword, admitted Punit Soni, CEO of Suki. 

Suki sells an AI agent for physicians. By calling out to the AI-powered assistant, a physician can quickly access key information about their patient, such as their medications, vital signs, allergies or surgical histories. Physicians can also use Suki’s tool to do things like pull up their weekly schedule, dictate clinical notes and assist with ICD-10 coding.

The agent can also complete tasks autonomously, such as ordering labs, setting up follow-up visits and sending appointment reminders. Its list price is $399 per user per month.


					When it comes to managing inbound phone calls, underperformance has devastating cost implications.				

In Soni’s view, AI agents are simply building on the foundation of all the AI models that came before — combining predictive capabilities with actions and data to perform tasks. These tools are dubbed “agents” because they mimic human-like assistance, he explained.

He noted that healthcare can benefit greatly from AI agents, as the field is rife with inefficient workflows.

“Agentic AI works best when the user is incredibly sophisticated, when the workflows that you’re making better are incredibly repeatable, and when the ontology and knowledge that’s required is fixed. In those situations, AI actually is very effective,” Soni stated, adding that healthcare checks all those boxes.

He said that AI agents should be assistive and invisible, with the main goal of allowing clinicians to focus more on patient care.

How can providers deploy AI agents?

Soni said that agentic AI will see widespread adoption first for back-end, administrative use cases. When it comes to AI in the healthcare sector, this is always the first step, he noted. Some use cases include autonomous prior authorization requests and call center agents.

Another healthcare expert — Naimish Patel, head of healthcare at Red Cell Partners, an investment and incubation firm — agreed with Soni. He also said healthcare organizations will begin by deploying AI agents in non-clinical use cases, with clinical applications to follow.

In Patel’s view, AI agents focused on the patient journey will see the greatest adoption. For example, there are agentic AI models that can autonomously schedule appointments and check in with patients to see if they’re following their care plan at home, he explained.

“That’s a pretty low-stakes use case, but there are lots of areas where AI can greatly improve that process. Think about the specific preferences certain providers have — you may have three dermatologists, but one of those dermatologists may not perform certain procedures. Knowing which dermatologist performs which procedure and looking for availability are all multiple steps that a person would be doing — but now the AI can do it almost instantaneously,” Patel declared.

InTrivo is an example of a company selling agentic AI tools to complete the tasks Patel described for patients, as well as help them schedule appointments. 

AI agents can also take over some basic tasks for busy healthcare staff — which is key given the sector’s ongoing workforce shortage. 

Agentic AI can help alleviate the labor shortage by automating repetitive tasks, therefore allowing clinicians to focus on practicing at the top of their licenses. For instance, AI agents can make calls on behalf of nurses and send text messages to patients to remind them to pick up their medication or gather information about their recovery, Patel pointed out.

Some examples of companies selling agentic AI for these use cases include Notable, Luma Health and Hyro.

One agentic AI company — VoiceCare AI — has developed an agent specifically for providers’ revenue cycle management teams. 

The startup’s agent, named Joy, makes its own business-to-business calls, for things like insurance verification, prior authorization, claims processing and appeals.

Mayo Clinic is currently using the tool. Joy is making calls on Mayo’s behalf and then providing the health system with summaries of the outcomes, explained VoiceCare AI CEO Parag Jhaveri. 

“Let’s say we wanted to get a prior auth approval for a particular surgery or treatment. Joy can call the insurance company to ask if there is a prior auth on file or not. If there is not, she can initiate a prior auth — and she can follow up with the prior auth when it is approved to get the prior auth approval number and the reference ID. The patient can be seen by the doctor, and every conversation is recorded on the cloud,” he said.

Automating these phone calls end-to-end eliminates a “tremendous” amount of tedious work, Jhaveri pointed out. 

He said he was recently on a call with leaders from another large health system who told him their imaging department makes 70,000 calls to insurers per month. 

“They were saying, ‘Hey, can we free up these people to do other things?’ It’s slowly manifesting into becoming a reality as we speak,” Jhaveri declared.

He said this tool usually costs between $4.02 and $4.49 per hour on a consumption-based pricing model. Providers with higher call volumes pay a rate closer to the less expensive side of this range, and providers with lower call volumes pay a rate toward the more expensive side.

Jhaveri mentioned that VoiceCare also has an outcomes-based model, meaning providers have to pay only if the agent successfully delivers results. For providers opting for this pricing model, the agent costs between $4.99 and $5.99 per hour.

How can payers deploy AI agents?

Payers can also leverage agentic AI to improve member satisfaction. For instance, automation company Ushur released a new health plan-focused AI agent this week.

Ushur CEO Simha Sadasiva said he began his company because of the experience he had as the primary caregiver for his terminally ill mother. Every couple of weeks, he would spend hours on the phone with her health plan, often on hold and waiting to be transferred.

Ushur’s agent enables payers to automate member requests that would typically require human intervention at call centers. Unlike traditional chatbots that simply provide scripted answers to frequently asked questions, Ushur’s agentic AI can process and fulfill service requests, such as issuing a member ID card or scheduling a procedure — eliminating the need for human call center agents to manually perform these routine tasks, Sadasiva said.

As of 2023, the average annual cost of operating a healthcare call center is nearly $14 million.

“For example, a member may need their member ID card. Rather than sending that request to another worker and then waiting for somebody to actually make sure that member ID card is shipped out to the end customer, we can now take that entire workflow, digitize it, and offer that member ID card through a digital channel that can now be in your wallet on your phone. That’s an example of getting access to service requests in a jiffy — in a matter of a few seconds — as opposed to the hoops that end customers have to navigate,” he explained.

In just two months, Ushur’s AI agent resolved over 36,000 interactions autonomously for one of its health plan customers, Sadasiva noted. He pointed out that this member adoption occurred organically, with members discovering the tool through self-service options on the health plan’s website.

How do AI agents generate value?

Another healthcare technology expert — Kimberly Powell, vice president and general manager of healthcare at Nvidia — argued that AI agents can save providers time and money, while also enhancing the patient experience.

Nvidia is developing an AI enterprise platform to create task-specific AI agents, she noted. For example, the company recently created a preoperative agent for The Ottawa Hospital to provide patients with 24/7 access to reliable information about their surgeries.

Nvidia developed this AI-powered digital avatar to help answer patients’ questions about things like anesthesia, how to get ready for the procedure and recovery, Powell said. The agent increases patients’ preparedness and reduces their pre-procedure anxiety by offering continuous access to information, as well as alleviates the burden on hospital staff, she remarked.

“Pre-op appointments can take up to two hours, and these are conducted with a healthcare professional. But a lot of [the information shared during these appointments] — where to park, when to arrive — is not diagnostic or clinical information. But the patient needs to know it so they can adhere to the right instructions — so they can be there on time, and so they don’t have to cancel the surgery because they had any food that morning,” Powell stated.

The Ottawa Hospital sees Nvidia’s agent as a way to address its workforce shortages while also improving patient experiences, she added.

She pointed out that The Ottawa Hospital conducts about 80,000 surgeries a year. In the past, each surgery required a pre-operative appointment lasting about two hours, she said.

“That’s 160,000 hours of preoperative appointments with healthcare staff. What if you could shrink each one of those appointments down by 50%? Then you’ve essentially given back to The Ottawa Hospital 80,000 hours of healthcare staff time,” Powell declared.

She also noted that patients are satisfied with Nvidia’s agent. Patients can ask the agent as many questions as they want — and people don’t always feel like they can do that with their provider, Powell noted. With an AI agent, patients don’t have to worry about feeling judged or getting a rushed answer, she added.

The typical cost per use case when building out these digital teammates is between $500,000 and $1 million, according to a Nvidia spokesperson.

How might AI agent adoption evolve?

Soni of Suki envisions a bright future when it comes to expanding the use cases for agentic AI in the healthcare realm. Beyond administrative workflows, AI agents could play a key part in keeping patients in the loop about their health, he noted.

“At some point, all the administrative activities will help clinicians teach the AI enough that it can potentially start helping them connect to patients,” he declared.

For example, AI agents may be able to instantly provide patients with after-visit summaries or answers to their questions in the EHR, Soni said.

He also pointed out that agentic AI could someday help physicians make clinical decisions.

“At some point, [AI agents] will get enough information that they can start helping doctors with clinical acumen,” Soni stated.

If this prediction becomes a reality, it won’t be anytime soon, he noted.

An AI expert from a health system — Jeff Jones, senior vice president of product development at UPMC Enterprises — said that for agentic AI to play a real role in clinical decision-making, it must be rigorously tested and proven. Otherwise, patients won’t be comfortable with their providers using it.

“Trust begins with proof. AI tools need to be accurate, reliable and safe before they can support a physician’s choices. Nearly as important, they must integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows, delivering meaningful insights at the right time without disrupting care delivery,” Jones stated.

Ensuring that future generations of agentic AI are both effective and responsible will require close collaboration between health systems and technology partners.

Solutions like UPMC Enterprises’ Ahavi platform, which was released last month, allows hospitals to test AI tools on de-identified patient data before they are ever deployed on real-world patients, he pointed out.

Another health system AI expert — Zafar Chaudry, chief digital officer and chief AI and information officer at Seattle Children’s — noted that realizing agentic AI’s potential in clinical decision-making “requires substantial progress.”

“This includes developing AI models with verifiable, transparent reasoning, conducting extensive clinical trials to ensure safety and accuracy, and establishing clear legal and ethical standards for its deployment,” Chaudry said.

What might the future hold?

Powell of Nvidia pointed out another exciting use case she thinks may gain popularity: disaster relief agents. 

She mentioned that Hippocratic AI has already created disaster relief agents to check in with patients and provide information during situations like wildfires, heatwaves and freezes.

“They can deploy agents that can reach out to patients to see if they are in need of urgent care, or to help them keep the continuity of their dialysis treatment,” she explained. “You would never have enough nurses or healthcare staff to be able to deploy on a moment’s notice, or at the scale of hundreds of thousands of people.”

Hippocratic has made a big splash in the agentic AI space, having snagged $278 million in funding since being founded in 2023. Despite its fundraising success, AI expert and self-proclaimed “healthcare AI fraud investigator” Sergei Polevikov has criticized the company, saying that thousands of outsourced nurses have to monitor every AI interaction. Hippocratic CEO Munjal Shah declined to be interviewed for this article.

Another person who is deeply familiar with healthcare AI — Innovaccer CEO Abhinav Shashank — thinks AI agents have the potential to help scale value-based care models. His company launched a suite of AI agents for providers last month, including tools that can complete tasks such as referrals, coding and prior authorization.

As healthcare AI developers continue to apply agentic AI to new use cases, Shashank believes there is a future in which agent-driven care management can expand preventive outreach beyond just the highest-risk patients.

“If anyone is going into a value-based care contract, through their care coordination efforts, they’re only able to touch 5% of the highest-risk patients,” he said.

But with AI agents autonomously calling and sending messages to patients, providers could proactively engage a much larger group — closer to 50% of high-risk patients, leading to earlier interventions and better outcomes, Shashank explained.

Tedious tasks like patient outreach, prior authorization and appointment scheduling are not the best use of healthcare staff’s time — especially when the industry is projected to face a shortage of 3.2 million workers by 2026. The magnitude of this problem is why Shashank said he is not worried about all the other companies releasing AI agents for healthcare in recent months.

“After the last generation of technology that came into healthcare, productivity dropped. I think, as tech companies, we need to be responsible for helping our doctors deliver better care —  it’s just such a large problem to solve, the more tools the better,” he declared.

To him and the other executives interviewed in this article, the next frontier in healthcare AI isn’t just intelligence — it’s action.

As part of the US President Donald Trumpʼs government cutbacks, most of the 80 000 federal workers responsible for disease research, food inspection, and the administration of Medicare and Medicaid received a letter offering to resign in exchange for $25 000.

This is reported by the Associated Press news agency.

Workers must respond to the so-called voluntary redundancy offer by the evening of March 14. The email was sent to employees of the department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration in Maryland.

The mass mailing comes days before agency leaders at the US Department of Health and Human Services are set to propose plans for workforce cuts. The department is one of the most expensive federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion, most of which goes to providing health care to millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr. has hinted at plans for major staff cuts and last year promised to immediately lay off all 600 employees at the National Biomedical Research Office. But he has yet to do so.

“I have a list in my head,” Kennedy said of potential layoffs, adding that some employees “made very poor decisions” regarding food policies.

The Trump administration, with the support of billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is trying to reduce the number of civil servants in order to reduce costs. In January, most civil servants were offered resignations with eight months of salary. Thousands of employees who were on probation were fired from various institutions. The other day, the NYT newspaper wrote that the US Central Intelligence Agency began to lay off recently hired employees.

LAS VEGAS, March 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- C-suite leaders from Houston Methodist and Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) will be speaking at HumanX, discussing how AI can play a pivotal role in addressing the looming hospital capacity crisis and out of control healthcare expenses, while also improving quality and reducing epidemic levels of clinician burnout.  

The panel titled, ""Delivering on the promise of AI to improve health outcomes,"" occurs on Wednesday, March 12 at 11:45am Pacific Time. Roberta Schwartz, EVP and Chief Innovation Officer at Houston Methodist, an organization committed to the responsible use of AI to improve the health of patients, will join with Nassib Chamoun, Founder and CEO of HDAI. Mr. Chamoun will discuss the tangible benefits of identifying high risk patients before, during, after hospitalization, and in the community and the use of AI-generated summaries that replace clinician time spent searching the EHR with time spent caring for the patient. Health systems and value-based care organizations, like Houston Methodist and Buena Vida y Salud, are driving down unplanned admissions, post-discharge mortality, and reducing adverse events. The HDAI platform enables precise care planning, optimizing scarce healthcare resources to have the greatest impact on patients with the most pressing needs.  

""It is striking that in the US, 6% of patients account for almost 40% of adverse events, but also excess length of stay, readmissions, mortalities, and costs. By stratifying populations by risk and identifying those patients proactively, HDAI is helping clinicians to prevent unnecessary admissions with timely, personalized care plans to help patients stay healthy at home, where possible,"" adds Nassib Chamoun of HDAI. ""And, at the patient level, our LLM-powered HDAIAssist tools, sift and summarize the mountains of data in these highly complex patients' charts, saving time while improving care.""  

Other speakers on the panel include Dina Katabi, Professor of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Lynda Chin, Founder & CEO - Apricity Health and the panel moderator, Ian Krietzberg, Editor-in-Chief, The Deep View.   

HumanX is being launched by seasoned entrepreneurs, Stefan Weitz and Jonathan Weiner, veterans of Fortune 5 enterprises like Google and Microsoft. HumanX is focusing on actionable insights and real-world applications of AI solutions. The agenda covers nine diverse industry tracks, features over 300 expert speakers, and includes innovative immersive experiences for attendees.  

""This conference is about making meaningful connections in AI,"" HumanX founder, Stefan Weitz adds. ""HumanX speakers are set to inspire and enlighten; from innovators introducing breakthrough technologies to ethicists and policymakers framing the conversation around responsible AI use.""  

Delivering on the promise of AI to improve health outcomes   Wednesday, March 12, 11:45am PT, Stage 1, Fontainebleau, HumanX conference

Providing affordable point-of-care diagnostic tools can be instrumental in quickly and efficiently assessing the well-being of all people, especially pregnant mothers. This can empower healthcare providers to be better diagnosticians and improve overall patient care, particularly for those at risk.

For two years, an ambitious initiative in sub-Saharan Africa has demonstrated how pocket-sized ultrasound technology can help bridge the gap in maternal care access. The implementation of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) across hundreds of healthcare facilities offers new insights into how the innovative deployment of technology, combined with comprehensive training, can transform maternal health outcomes in resource-limited settings. This initiative has resulted in over 1,000 healthcare workers trained, and over one million pregnancy scans and counting.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an ultrasound scan before 24 weeks gestation for all pregnancies, yet the stark reality of access to high-quality global maternal healthcare presents an immense challenge. Nearly 95% of maternal deaths occur in low and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC). And in low-resource settings like parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, the high cost of equipment and the need for trained sonographers means that very few women have access to ultrasound. UNICEF’s 2021 report on child mortality trends and the WHO’s 2024 report on maternal mortality show that, in sub-Saharan Africa alone, approximately 202,000 mothers and 27 of every 1,000 infants die due to childbirth complications annually. While multiple factors contribute to these statistics, one significant barrier has been limited access to antenatal diagnostic imaging – a critical tool for identifying life-threatening complications during pregnancy. 

Many regions of the world, especially LMICs, are essentially diagnostic deserts. The lack of equitable, accessible primary healthcare for women, combined with higher disease burdens entering pregnancy, creates a perfect storm of risk factors that demands innovative solutions.


					Mayo Clinic has developed a new tool that could speed up the time it takes for digital health companies to validate their tech to hospitals.				

Breaking new ground in Kenya

The project began in Kenya in late 2022 and has resulted in deployment of 500 single-probe, whole-body portable ultrasound devices across 224 healthcare facilities in Kenya. This was combined with ultrasound training by Global Ultrasound Institute (GUSI) to over 500 frontline healthcare workers who provide care in counties in Kenya with disproportionately high rates of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. Recruitment of the participants and evaluation of the implementation was conducted by Kenyatta University.

Initial results from the evaluation conducted by Kenyatta University suggests that 90% of healthcare workers reported identifying high-risk conditions such as placenta previa or multiple gestations using their devices within one month of training. 

The findings from the research represent the largest impact study in Africa on point-of-care ultrasound to date and show that:


					This on-demand webinar will offer insights and share tips on helping practices run more efficiently.				

The training program, developed in partnership with GUSI, takes a comprehensive approach. It begins with creating a foundation of local expertise by training over 50 Kenyan clinicians and sonographers in International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG)-standard techniques, who become trainers. The curriculum covers operation, image acquisition and medical decision-making, with a specific focus on identifying high-risk conditions during pregnancy. 

Phase Two of the Kenya program included a curriculum from GUSI, which included pre-tests and required participants to log at least 20 of five different types of scans over the course of the week. On the final day of the program, a post-test and final Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) were administered. Participants who passed all training and tests were given a certificate at a closing ceremony. 

As of December 2024, research outcomes from Phase Two were significant. Over the 24-month period from the start of training, Kenyan clinicians have performed over 496,000 scans, with more than 95% of the equipment continuing to function as a vital part of the care workflow for midwives in these facilities. These data demonstrate the sustainability of POCUS when the approach pairs easy-to-use equipment with focused training for midwives.

Expanding impact: South Africa implementation 

Building on the success in Kenya, the program has expanded to South Africa, where maternal mortality rates and stillbirth rates remain disproportionately high, particularly in rural areas. The initiative rolled out across multiple provinces, starting in the Eastern Cape province in April 2024. In this phase of the training, learners received additional instruction in fetal biometry – an ultrasound test that provides rich detail on the health and growth of the fetus, in addition to confirming gestational age and an estimated due date for the pregnancy. Implementation and evaluation of this phase was led by the Clinton Health Access Initiative and University of Pretoria.

While formal evaluation results are forthcoming, preliminary results are extremely promising. South African learners have performed more than 573,000 scans and completed over 41,000 instances of fetal biometry. Taken together, these scans represent thousands of opportunities for mothers to be educated on the status of their pregnancies, as well as for providers to make informed decisions about additional testing or referral if complications were suspected. 

Healthcare users need easier access to antenatal imaging, and clinicians need better capabilities for screening high-risk conditions that lead to disproportionately worse pregnancy outcomes, particularly in rural areas. When ultrasound becomes more accessible, high-risk conditions may be identified earlier, leading to improved outcomes. 

The technology and training equation

What sets this initiative apart is its comprehensive approach to implementation. The program provides valuable insights into how to scale medical technology deployment in resource-limited settings effectively. But rather than simply distributing services, the program emphasizes sustainable integration into existing healthcare systems. This includes:

Looking ahead: implications for global health 

The collaboration among multiple stakeholders — including the Clinton Health Access Initiative, GUSI, Kenyatta University and local healthcare institutions – offers a model for future health technology implementations. It demonstrates how public-private partnerships can work together to address complex healthcare challenges while ensuring sustainability and local ownership. 

As the program continues to expand, (Kenyatta University’s College of Nursing in Kenya, CHAI and University of Pretoria in South Africa) researchers are evaluating its impact on broader health system metrics, including referral patterns and population-level maternal health outcomes. This data will be necessary for understanding how POCUS technology can be most effectively deployed to improve maternal health outcomes in similar settings around the world. 

The initiative extends beyond technology. It represents a comprehensive approach to addressing maternal health disparities through innovation, education and systematic support. We must advocate for earlier, better maternal and primary care for all, especially for mothers who reside in resource-limited settings as they enter pregnancy. We also need to address racial and socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access and improve the quality of healthcare across the entire continuum — and ultrasound plays a role in that every step of the way. Providing affordable point-of-care diagnostic tools can be instrumental in quickly and efficiently assessing the well-being of all people, especially pregnant mothers. This can empower healthcare providers to be better diagnosticians and improve overall patient care, particularly for those at risk.

As global health leaders continue to seek solutions for reducing maternal mortality, this program offers valuable lessons on how to effectively bridge the healthcare access gap in resource-limited settings. 

The initiative described above was supported by a $5 million grant to Butterfly Network.

Cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal was spotted enjoying the India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy 2025 final in Dubai, accompanied by RJ Mahvash. The duo's appearance together has piqued the interest of fans and onlookers amidst the buzz around Yuzvendra's divorce proceedings with choreographer Dhanashree Verma. Also read: Uorfi Javed hints that Dhanashree Verma reached out to her amid divorce from Yuzvendra Chahal

On Sunday, Yuzvendra was seen enjoying the high-stakes India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy 2025 final in Dubai. The duo was seen enthusiastically cheering for Team India from the stands, and several photographs of them together have surfaced on social media, quickly grabbing the attention of fans and followers.

In the images, RJ Mahvash is seen wearing a white t-shirt and black sunglasses, while Yuzvendra is wearing a black jacket over a matching t-shirt. The pair was caught on camera sitting together, completely absorbed in the excitement of the match. At one point, Yuzvendra was spotted leaning in close, whispering something in RJ Mahvash's ear. The images have led to speculation around their bond.



“Girl behind chahal is Rj mahvash,” one wrote, with another writing, “Chahal and RJ Mahvash watching Champions Trophy final in Dubai”.

“RJ Mahvash is much kuch cuter than Dhanashree,” one wrote, with another pointing out, “Rj Mahvash - 27 October 1996. Dhanashree Verma - 27 September 1996”.



One comment read, “My TL is filled with Yuzvendra Chahal and RJ Mahvash’s photo sitting together. Stop spamming and let them live”, with another reading, “New GF (RJ Mahvash)”.

“Chahal with his new GF?? RJ Mahvash #INDvsNZ,” one wondered.

Last year, RJ Mahvash broke her silence on the rumours around her dating Yuzvendra, which started when a photograph of her with the cricketer from a Christmas celebration went viral. She took to Instagram to react to the buzz.

Her note read, ""Some articles and speculations have been circulating around the internet. It's literally funny to see how baseless these rumours are. If you get seen with a person of the opposite gender, does that mean you are dating them? I'm sorry, what year is this? And how many people are you all dating then?""

“I have been patient for 2-3 days now, but I won't let any PR teams drag my name into this to cover up other people's images. Let people live in peace with their friends and family during tough times,” RJ Mahvash added.

Buzz about Dhanashree and Yuzvendra's divorce began after the couple unfollowed each other on Instagram, which sparked widespread speculation. The two tied the knot in December 2020 in an intimate ceremony in Gurugram. They met during the Covid-19 pandemic when he approached her for lessons.

Last month, Chahal's lawyer, Nitin K Gupta, confirmed that the divorce had been filed. In an official statement to Hindustan Times, he said, ""Mr. Chahal reached a settlement for obtaining Divorce by Mutual Consent with Mrs. Verma. A Petition for Divorce by mutual consent was presented before the Hon’ble Family Court, Bandra. The matter is currently sub-judice.""

There were also rumours that Dhanashree was seeking ₹60 crore in alimony. However, Dhanashree’s family issued a statement to the press, dismissing the claims. The statement read, ""We are deeply outraged by the baseless claims being circulated about the alimony figure. Let me be absolutely clear—no such amount has ever been asked, demanded, or even offered. There is no truth to these rumours whatsoever. It is deeply irresponsible to publish such unverified information, dragging not just the parties but also their families into unnecessary speculation. Reckless reporting like this only causes harm, and we urge the media to exercise restraint, fact-check before spreading misinformation, and be respectful of everyone’s privacy.""

The ""Emo Girl"" standout connected his loved one's passing to the birth of his first child with Fox, stating that he believes Trembath is in looking after the child in heaven. 

""I feel like you're up there with my new child, dressed up in a hilarious costume making them laugh, getting ready to send them down. i couldn’t ask for a more bittersweet birth blessing.""

According to Page Six, Fox, who announced that she was pregnant in November 2024, is due ""any day now."" The Jennifer's Body star and mgk called in quits later that month after Fox found content on his phone that she didn't like.

Despite numerous errors, Coco Gauff secures a hard-fought victory against Moyuka Uchijima.

Coco Gauff recently faced a tough match at the Indian Wells tournament, overcoming Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima with a score of 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(4). Throughout the match, Gauff struggled with consistency, committing 21 double faults and 74 unforced errors. She candidly assessed her performance as “D tennis,” acknowledging the need for improvement.

Earlier in the year, Gauff participated in the United Cup, where the United States team clinched the title against Poland. In the final, Gauff delivered a standout performance by defeating world number 2 Iga Świątek in straight sets, contributing significantly to the team’s success. She lost to Marta Kostyuk in the Round of 32 at the Qatar Open and then lost to McCartney Kessler the next week in the same round at the Dubai Tennis Championships.

Looking ahead, Gauff is set to face Maria Sakkari in the next round at Indian Wells. This upcoming match is particularly significant, as Sakkari defeated Gauff in the semifinals of the same tournament last year. Gauff aims to avenge that loss and advance further in the competition.

Coco Gauff has the opportunity to break a 24-year-old record held by Serena Williams. The record is for the longest streak of consecutive wins by an American woman at the Indian Wells tournament. Serena Williams won the title in 1999 and 2001, and Coco Gauff has the chance to surpass her by winning the title in 2025. If Gauff wins, it will mark her first Indian Wells title and she could become the youngest American to achieve such a feat since Serena Williams.

Inside the Baseline…

Coco Gauff’s journey this year has been a rollercoaster, with both impressive highs and frustrating lows. While she has shown incredible wins, her recent losses to players like McCartney Kessler and Marta Kostyuk highlight that even the best have their off days. Tennis is a game of fine margins, and sometimes, the smallest details can make the difference. These early losses may sting, but they could also be the catalyst for her to come back even stronger, refining her game and mental resilience. It is impressive to see a player win with their “D” level tennis.

A surprising confession followed a puzzling performance by the five-time champion.BySteve TignorPublished Mar 09, 2025 copy_link

Published Mar 09, 2025

What was the biggest stunner of Novak Djokovic’s Saturday in Indian Wells?There was, first and foremost, his three-set loss to 85th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp. That may sound like a shocking result to the casual fan, but anyone who follows the sport week to week knew it was a possibility.Djokovic was playing just his second match since the Australian Open. At his last event, in Doha, he lost his opening match to Matteo Berrettini. And van de Zandschulp is a quality player who, with wins over Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal last year, has earned a reputation as a giant slayer. He’s deceptively quick for someone 6-foot-3, he plays a somewhat similar game to Djokovic’s, and he’s eight years younger.It was hardly surprising that Djokovic was rusty. That he started slowly. That he missed the skill shots—half-volleys, lobs, drops—that don’t always come back right away. That his timing wasn’t sharp on his return. That the wind, the sun, and the transition from the practice court to the stadium court, affected him more than they normally would. That he may have had physical issues that remained unnamed.

Even the fact that he was breathing hard after a rally in the third set was somewhat understandable, despite his legendary level of fitness. And, of course, the animated discussions with his team about what to drink on the sidelines are all part of the Djokovic Theater that we’ve been attending for two decades now. (Though I will say that the sight of Djokovic with his baseball cap pulled sideways—to block the sun—was new to me.)

A post shared by Tennis (@tennischannel)

“I regret the level of tennis, considering how I practice these days,” Djokovic said. “To be honest, the difference between the center court and the other courts is immense. Ball is bouncing on the center courts higher than some of the highest clay courts.“Yeah, just struggled a lot with that. Couldn't find the rhythm.”But there were individual moments and aspects of the match that were more surprising, and concerning.

There was the fact that he turned the match around in the second set, gave the crowd one of his traditional war-cry first pumps ... and then squandered the momentum right away in a puzzling sequence at the start of the third.On one crucial point at that stage, Djokovic tried a floating cross-court drop shot from behind the baseline, while backing away. It landed well into the alley, and he walked to the changeover hanging his head. In the next game, van de Zandschulp hoisted up a topspin lob that landed five feet inside the baseline, but Djokovic simply turned around and watched it, without making a move. By then, even his fury was muted; after slamming a ball too close to a ball boy in the second set, he mostly opted for wry smiles of frustration in the third.Djokovic hit 15 winners, made 37 unforced errors, and won just seven of those 24 points on his second serve. Van de Zandschulp had his way in the neutral rallies. Does any of this have to do with a new, possibly more conservative approach that his coach, Andy Murray, has recommended? We’ll need to see more from them before making that judgment.

I regret the level of tennis, considering how I practice these days. Novak Djokovic

While none of what happened on court is standard for Djokovic, the bigger surprise to me was how he sounded in the interview room afterward. This is a man who has always said that he “puts no limits” on himself. This time, positivity and big-picture perspective were hard to come by. Asked whether he could find consolation in his past achievements on a day like this, he said:“Things are different, obviously, for me the last couple of years. I’ve been struggling to play on the desired level. Every now and then, I have a couple of good tournaments, but, you know, mostly it’s really a challenge. It’s a struggle for me.”

There was an unvarnished truth-telling to this comment that was different from his heyday. There was a little more resignation about the affects of aging and injury than I’ve heard from him in the past.Of course, it’s only natural that he would feel this way after going more than a year without an ATP title.

Follow:


            There was a time, not so long ago, when Novak Djokovic lost so rarely that it seemed the tennis world wobbled on its axis every time he did, shaking with the shock of it all.
    


            But the 37-year-old’s surprise 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 loss on Saturday to Botic van de Zandschulp at the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells marked his third consecutive defeat, the first time since 2018, and just second time since 2008, that he has suffered such a losing streak.
    


            “You know, things are different obviously for me the last couple of years. I’ve been struggling to play on the desired level,” the 24-time grand slam winner told reporters after losing his second-round match.
    


            “Every now and then, I have a couple good tournaments, but mostly it’s really a challenge. It’s a struggle for me. It is what it is, nothing can prepare you for that moment, you have to experience it and try to deal with it in the best possible way.”
    


            Since his dominant 2023 season – when he came within a match of winning a calendar grand slam and set a new men’s record for the most grand slam titles – Djokovic has won just one title which came at the 2024 Olympics in Paris.
    


            And against Van de Zandschulp, who reached the main draw at Indian Wells as one of the “lucky losers” from the qualifying tournament, Djokovic produced an uncharacteristically error-strewn performance, hitting 37 unforced errors.
    


            Van de Zandschulp broke Djokovic early in the first set when the Serbian clobbered an approach shot wide, and subsequently raced to a 5-1 lead, losing just two points on serve during that time. Another of Djokovic’s approach shots went awry on set point giving Van de Zandschulp the set.
    


            Though the world No. 5 rediscovered his usual groove in the second, breaking Van de Zandschulp at the first opportunity and winning the set to level the match, he was unable to measure up to his Dutch opponent in the third.
    


            “The first three games, four games of the third set were quite close. Had my chances. Was just some awful mistakes,” said Djokovic afterwards. “I thought I was on most of these points in the beginning of the third.”
    


            During key points too, Van de Zandschulp produced some magical shots like a perfectly weighted lob that left Djokovic stranded at the net and secured him a crucial break point in the third set.
    


            The Dutchman never relinquished that advantage and wrapped up the win in two hours and one minute to secure his eighth career victory over a top 10 opponent.
    


            Elsewhere at Indian Wells, the USA’s Taylor Fritz defeated Matteo Gigante 6-3, 7-5 in his opening match of the tournament while his compatriot Coco Gauff won her first match since the Australian Open against Moyuka Uchijima.

INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Marta Kostyuk, the top-ranked Ukrainian tennis player in the world, drew home-crowd favorite Robin Montgomery for her first match at the BNP Paribas Open Friday.

Listening to the crowd at Stadium 4, the match could have been in Kyiv, not California: they were there for Kostyuk, the world No. 24, from the first ball to the last as she beat Montgomery 6-1, 6-3.

That was no small thing for a Ukrainian player enduring one of the more tumultuous weeks in her country’s war against Russia, since Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion in early 2022.

Last Friday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine endured a withering attack from U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice-President J.D. Vance in the Oval Office. With television cameras rolling, they criticized Zelensky for not being sufficiently “thankful” for American aid and ridiculed him for trying to use leverage that they said he did not possess.

“You don’t have the cards. You’re either going to make a deal, or we’re out,” Trump told Zelensky.

He then announced a pause in U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

Sudden cutbacks at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had already affected the flow of humanitarian aid, after Trump directed Elon Musk, an unelected “special government employee”, and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is named for an internet meme featuring a dog, to shut that agency down.

After that White House confrontation, Kostyuk said her phone was flooded by American friends and acquaintances — some in tennis, many outside it — expressing empathy.

“A lot of messages and a lot of apologies, which is amazing,” she said in her news conference after beating Montgomery.  “It’s incredible to see this, that people still support us.”

Three years into the war back home, Ukraine’s tennis players have felt just about every emotion they could possibly feel.

The concern is never far from them. In the late afternoon Friday at Indian Wells, after she had upset three-time Grand Slam finalist Ons Jabeur 6-3, 6-1, Dayana Yastremska opened her phone to demonstrate how she keeps up with developments.

She thumbed through a series of apps including the messaging service Telegram, which keeps her up to date on the latest missile attacks, and the alarms that warn the citizens of her home city, Odesa, to head for the bomb shelters. Her sister, father and grandparents still live there, so Yastremska checks the alerts as soon as she wakes each day before she calls home. She repeats the process once her matches are over.

The news has been especially bad the past week, as the growing split between the Trump administration and Zelensky has emboldened Russia’s forces.

Trump and Zelensky's confrontation sends Ukrainian tennis players to Sunshine Double under a cloud

“After what happened on this day, the attack on Ukraine got higher than it was before, and on my city it is the same,” she says. “It’s very intense. So many days, we don’t have light and water.”

Yastremska was in Ukraine just a few weeks ago. She travelled there following the WTA tournament in Linz, Austria, to celebrate her younger sister Ivanna’s 18th birthday. Ivanna used to be a professional tennis player too but is now at university studying journalism while also pursuing a singing career.

Dayana had to fly from Austria to Chișinău, capital of Moldova, before driving about five hours across the border to reach Odesa. If Odesa were easier to get to, she would move home in a heartbeat, she says, war or no war.

“I love my city,” she stresses.

Last Friday was an especially trying one for Yastremska, who landed in San Francisco from Europe to the news of the disastrous Trump/Zelensky meeting. Then, immigration officials told her that someone had reported her passport to Interpol as stolen. That invalidated her 10-year visa to enter the U.S., and she was nearly sent back to Europe during four hours of wrangling to sort through the issue.

Ultimately, she received a six-month visa to tide her over; she will need to extend that if she wants to return to the States to play the U.S. Open in August.

“Crazy, crazy day. I thought I would explode,” she says.

She didn’t, of course. And a week later she was beating a three-time major finalist in straight sets, to set up a match Sunday against five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek, who has won two out of the past three BNP Paribas Opens.

She, Kostyuk and Elina Svitolina, who also won here Friday, have had three years of learning to cope with these kinds of hazards.

“We are Ukrainians, we have this kind of character that we are able to get through difficult situations,” Yastremska says. Or at the very least manage them, and even sometimes find a silver lining.

Kostyuk was heartbroken when that meeting of the presidents went so poorly. But she has since come to embrace the idea that so many people in the U.S. wanted to help early on after Russia’s attack, and still do. “It’s important to remember that that was not one person deciding to help Ukraine and to be an ally of Ukraine, but a lot of people,” she said. “And I’m very thankful for all these people.”

There’s a saying Kostyuk keeps coming back to, on and off the court. “Everything will be fine, and if it’s not fine, it means it’s not the end,”  she said.

She also does not forget that everyone in tennis has their own problems and has to figure out how to leave those on the side of the court and approach their jobs professionally. Chances are, she said, your opponent is spending very little time worrying about your mental state, or the traumas of your life.

“Everyone is going through something in their lives,” she says. “Whether it’s war or some of their relatives are not feeling well or dying or some problems in the family. It’s  very important to kind of put everything that’s outside of the court aside and just go out there and do the job that you are doing.”

With that, Kostyuk was off to prepare for another day at the office — Sunday’s round-of-32 date with another American opponent, Caroline Dolehide.

There’s a good chance she will get plenty of support in that one, too.

Old Dominion women’s tennis extends its win streak to five after downing Marshall 4-2 in its final game of its homestand on Sunday afternoon.

NORFOLK, Va. – Old Dominion women’s tennis extends its win streak to five after downing Marshall 4-2 in its final game of its homestand on Sunday afternoon.

“Gutsy performance from the team today,” Head Coach Dominic Manilla said. “A big congrats to Mya Byrd stepping up for our team when we absolutely needed her. We need to address some things in doubles but overall I feel we improved tremendously this weekend.”

Marshall came rolling in after No. 1 Emma Vanderheyden and Alina Mokrynska downed ODU’s Sofia Johnson and Lidiia Rasskouskaia (6-2) to open the doubles matches. While No. 3 Monarchs Marina Markina and Kira Matushkina responded by besting Johanna Strom and Nel Van Hout (6-4), the Herd took the match point after Sophia Hurrion and Aisling McGrane defeated Ulyana Romanova and Victoria Matasova (6-3).

No. 5 Markina got things going for Old Dominion after cruising past Nour El Ouazzani (6-1, 6-1) to put the Monarchs on the board. No. 4 Matasova followed suit with a win over Hurrion (6-4. 6-3), and teammate Mya Byrd recorded her first singles win of the season by besting McGrane (7-5, 6-1) after Matushkina had to be pulled from singles due to illness. For the winning point, Sofia Johnson downed Strom (6-3, 7-5) to put ODU at 2-0 in conference play. Marshall’s Mokrynska finished her match against Romanova (6-2, 7-5) to give the Herd one last point, though ODU’s Rasskouskaia had her match against Vanderheyden suspended (5-7, 3-4).

Old Dominion hits the road next weekend to take on Sun Belt opponents Troy on Saturday, March 15 and Georgia State on Sunday, March 16.","{'href': 'https://odusports.com', 'title': 'Old Dominion University'}"

WTA Staff


Coco Gauff picked up her first win since the Australian Open on Saturday, but she had to go down to the absolute wire to do so.

No. 3 seed Gauff of the United States outlasted Japan's Moyuka Uchijima 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(4) in an incredibly tight second-round meeting at the WTA 1000 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells.

Indian Wells: Draws | Scores | Order of play

After her first-round bye this week, Gauff snapped a three-match losing streak by overcoming Japanese No. 1 Uchijima in their first career meeting. The 2023 US Open champion had to battle through three extremely close sets before ousting 52nd-ranked Uchijima in a grueling 2 hours and 33 minutes.

""It was a tough match,"" Gauff said afterwards in press. ""I didn't play as well as I would like to, but full credit to her. She stepped it up when she needed to. But, yeah, just happy to get through it.""

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

A 2024 semifinal rematch awaits: In the third round, Gauff will face another player who has been ranked inside the Top 3 of the PIF WTA Rankings: Maria Sakkari of Greece. No. 29 seed Sakkari defeated Viktoriya Tomova of Bulgaria 6-0, 6-3 earlier on Saturday.

Sakkari leads Gauff 5-3 in their head-to-head, including a win in their most recent meeting, which was in Indian Wells last year. Sakkari topped Gauff 6-4, 6-7(5), 6-2 in the 2024 semifinals to make her second BNP Paribas Open final in a three-year span.

""Last year, that was such a long kind of day,"" Gauff said, looking back on her last meeting with Sakkari. ""It was rainy and we stopped and started so many times.

""I guess my keys will just be to focus on my end of the court and accept that she's going to hit some great shots. She's a great player. I think just trying to focus on my end and be ready and know that it's going to be a physical match.""

A post shared by Tennis (@tennischannel)

Reclaiming her winning ways: Gauff started the year with a 9-0 win-loss record, leading the United States to the United Cup title before her perfect run was ended by Paula Badosa in the Australian Open quarterfinals.

After that, though, Gauff went 0-2 in the Middle East swing, losing to Marta Kostyuk at Doha and her fellow American McCartney Kessler in Dubai. Thus, Gauff entered the Sunshine Double in the midst of her first three-match losing streak since the end of 2022.

Despite being pushed to the limit by Uchijima, Gauff finally got back into the winner's circle on Saturday. She is now the fourth American woman to register 10 or more wins at Indian Wells before turning 21, following Lindsay Davenport, Serena Williams and Venus Williams. 

""I think just today is just one of those days where I just did not feel great on the court and because of the last couple of weeks, I'm pretty hard on myself,"" Gauff said. ""I just wanted to do better.""

Back-and-forth battle: Gauff came back from an early break down to start Saturday’s match, pulling level at 2-2 and breaking Uchijima at 5-4 to seal the one-set lead.

However, double faults impeded Gauff’s game in the second set -- the American hit four in her first two service games to cede a quick double-break advantage to Uchijima. Unseeded Uchijima fired a bevy of forehand winners throughout the remainder of the set, including one on her second set point to level the match.

Gauff built a seemingly commanding 4-0 lead in the third set, but Uchijima chipped away throughout, saving one match point at 5-3 and another at 5-4. More double faults reared their heads for Gauff -- she finished the match with a total of 21 -- and Uchijima was able to fight back all the way into a decisive third-set tiebreak.

In the breaker, Gauff hit a stellar rally pass to take a 3-1 lead, and the American nudged that start all the way to 6-2 and four more match points. Uchijima saved two more, but Gauff finally booked a third-round spot by forcing an error with one last forehand on her fifth match point.

""Double [faults], I've been in the practice of trying to fix things on my serve,"" Gauff said. ""It was just an up-and-down process. It's tough out there.

""But, I mean, if I'm able to win matches playing kind of like [Grade] D tennis, then it gives me confidence just when I'm able to mesh things together, like I did earlier this season.""","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}"

The Olympic champion suffered a shock elimination by the world number 85 in the second round at the 2025 Indian Wells Open. 

Novak Djokovic has fallen at the first hurdle of the 2025 Indian Wells Open, suffering a shock defeat to Botic van de Zandschulp on Saturday (8 March).

The Olympic tennis gold medallist was beaten in three sets by world number 85 Van de Zandschulp, who secured a stunning 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 victory in their first men's singles meeting.

Djokovic, a five-time title winner at Indian Wells, committed 37 unforced errors in a subdued performance and was unable to take control of the second round match.

The Serbian star had been given a bye through the opening round. Djokovic is chasing his first title since claiming Olympic gold at Paris 2024, though has been hampered by injuries once again this year having withdrawn from the Australian Open semi-final in January.

Dutchman Van de Zandschulp had lost in the final round of qualifying for the event, before being given a lifeline as a lucky loser due to pre-tournament player withdrawals.

After losing in the qualifiers, lucky loser Van de Zandschulp is in to the third round at Indian Wells for the first time since 2022.

He defeated that year’s Wimbledon runner up Nick Kyrgios in the first round this time, to set up his maiden meeting with 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic on Saturday, earning his eighth career victory against a top 10 player.

Indeed, Van de Zandschulp is no stranger to significant scalps on the tour. Last year he shocked Carlos Alcaraz at the US Open, then defeated the retiring Rafael Nadal in his last professional tennis match at the Davis Cup Final 8.

Van de Zandschulp will meet 25th seed Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina in the third round at Indian Wells.","{'href': 'https://www.olympics.com', 'title': 'Olympics'}"

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. – The Yellow Jackets claimed their fourth Atlantic Coast Conference victory Saturday afternoon, defeating Boston College 4-0 in Chestnut Hill, Mass.

In doubles action, the Yellow Jackets claimed a quick 6-3 win from the number one doubles spot, where the Tech duo of Nate Bonetto and Gianluca Carlini defeated Aidan Pack/Jake Vassel.

Richmond, KY. -  The UConn women's tennis team continued their non-conference success with a 4-2 win over Eastern Kentucky. The Huskies single competitors carried them to victory to clinch the 4-2 win.

The Huskies started off slow, falling in two of the three doubles matchups with the third matchup going unfinished, but bounced back in the single matchups, winning four of five, with the sixth matchup going unfinished. The Huskies received wins from Olivia Wright, Caroline Hinshaw, Victoria Matos, and Cameron Didion.  With the win, the Huskies improve to 9-2 overall.

""This was a gut check win for our team today,"" stated head coach Glenn Marshall. ""Coming off a highlight victory at Xavier yesterday, we had to fight extremely hard today. Eastern Kentucky was a team with deep talent, and they fought tough and had us on the ropes. After losing the doubles point, we had to find our energy and focus going into singles. It was a slow start in singles, but we eventually dug deep and came back from losing the first set on Olivia's and Caroline's matches. They both had three set thrilling victories, which showed their resolve in the face of adversity.  Our fight and toughness was on display today, and we found a way to earn a hard fought victory.""

Owensboro Catholic’s tennis season has officially started with the boys’ team beating Paducah Tilghman 4-1, before losing to Greenwood 3-2. In the first match, Ben Haines and John Wathen won their singles matches, while the doubles teams of Houston Danzer and Joseph Merchant and Henry Haines and Luke Pfeifer both won. Against Greenwood. Both Jack Haines and Ben Haines won their singles matches. 

The Lady Aces dropped both of their matches yesterday. They lost to Sacred Heart Academy 7-2 and Greenwood 9-0. Against Sacred Heart Academy, Ella Cason and Lexie Moyers won their singles matches.

“Both of our teams played hard and for our first two matches we are pleased,” Owensboro Catholic head coach Noel Clayton said. “The boys lost two doubles tiebreakers, or we could have won the match against a very good Greenwood team. Our girls’ teams lost six girls from last year and it will take us a while to get up to speed. We probably played the top two girls’ teams in the state for our first match, so it was great experience.”

The App State tennis team faced its first conference setback of the season, falling to Old Dominion 5-2.

The Mountaineers (6-4, 0-1 SBC) struggled to gain momentum from the start, as ODU claimed the doubles point. While Naledi Manyube and Olwyn Ryan-Bovey posted a win in doubles, losses from the pairs of Savannah Dada-Mascoll/Ruby Broadbent and Alexi Cleveland/Riley Collins left App State trailing by one heading into singles play.

Dada-Mascoll, who had been undefeated this season, took her first loss to Sofia Johnson, the 2024 Sun Belt Conference Women’s Tennis Player of the Year, falling in straight sets.

Coco Gauff admitted she was taking her opening Indian Wells win as a significant “positive” after overcoming serving woes in a scrappy contest.

World No 3 and third seed Gauff was pushed to the brink by world No 52 Moyuka Uchijima on Saturday, with the American ultimately sealing a 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(4) triumph.

Despite a solid first-serve percentage of 65%, Gauff hit a staggering 21 double faults – compared to just four aces – and hit 74 unforced errors, compared to 37 winners.

However, victory for Gauff came after back-to-back opening-match defeats in Doha and Dubai, and an Australian Open quarter-final exit.

Gauff is not playing anywhere close to the level that saw her claim the China Open and WTA Finals titles towards the end of 2024, and guide USA to the United Cup title back in January.

However, after three straight losses, the 20-year-old revealed it was merely a relief to get back to winning ways.

“I think if I just double-faulted less, it could have probably been a straight-set match,” said Gauff. “Off the ground, I felt like I was dictating more of the rallies.

“But, coming off a tough couple back-to-back losses, I guess it’s just taking it more as a positive maybe than if I had a couple good weeks [in my] last two tournaments.

“The unforced errors, I had to go bigger towards the end of the match, and even in the middle, because I felt like she would dictate. It’s kind of: ‘just take your chances.’ Then doubles [double faults], I’ve been in the practice of trying to fix things on my serve.

“It was just an up-and-down process – it’s tough out there. But, if I’m able to win matches playing D tennis, then it gives me confidence just when I’m able to mesh things together like I did earlier this season.”

Up next for Gauff is 29th seed Maria Sakkari, who defeated the world No 3 in the Indian Wells semi-finals a year ago.

Gauff will head in as a significant favourite following the Greek’s struggles after that run, though will likely need to raise her game.

The 2023 US Open champion conceded that her level had been “frustrating” – but that she was trying not to worry too much about her performance on the whole.

She added: “I think today is just one of those days you just don’t feel great on the court. So it’s frustrating in that way, because I was having such great practices this week.

“I think sometimes in sports you want to just stay on the high and kind of ride that wave, but especially with this sport, a season as long as tennis, it’s kind of impossible to always be on that high wave.

“There’s going to be some low moments, I think. I’m just trying to stick through those tough moments and get better through them.

“I feel like I’m able to turn it around. It’s happened before. I think it just takes one match or two matches to kind of get that confidence back.”

Gadsden, AL – John David Cunningham and Luke Russo, members of the Gadsden State Community College men’s tennis team, have been named Tennis Co-Players of the Week by the Alabama Community College Conference. The recognition comes after the duo’s impressive 3-1 record last week at No. 2 doubles, securing key conference victories against Coastal Alabama Community College-North and Marion Military Institute, as well as a non-conference win against Shorter University.

Cunningham, a sophomore from Rome, Ga., attended Model High School and is currently pursuing pre-engineering courses at Gadsden State. Russo, a freshman from Springville, Ala., is a graduate of Springville High School and is majoring in accounting technology.

Coach Buster Stewart praised the pair’s performance and teamwork, emphasizing their contributions to the team.

“Their chemistry works well together,” Stewart said. “John David provides the experience and enthusiasm while Luke always provides great effort. They really enjoy playing matches together, and it shows.”

Cunningham and Russo are the sixth and seventh Gadsden State student-athletes to earn Player of the Week honors this academic year. Previous honorees include Ally Croy (softball), Keshawn Watkins and Giovanni Nannucci (men’s basketball), Kamoriah Gaines (women’s basketball), and Allie Bryant (volleyball).

“We are very proud of John David and Luke,” Stewart said of the Cardinal tennis players. “This recognition is well-deserved, and it highlights their outstanding play and the strength of our tennis program.”

The honor further underscores Gadsden State’s growing presence in collegiate athletics, demonstrating the dedication and talent of its student-athletes.

HAMMOND --- The Southeastern Louisiana University women’s tennis team will open the home portion of its Southland Conference schedule this week, hosting a pair of league opponents at the Southeastern Tennis Complex.

Southeastern (7-3, 0-2 SLC) will open the week’s action with an 11 a.m. match versus Lamar (2-9, 0-1 SLC) Monday. UIW (3-6, 1-0 SLC) was originally scheduled to visit Hammond March 8, but the match was rescheduled for Wednesday at 9 a.m. due to rain in the Hammond area.

SLU will be looking to earn its first conference wins of the season. The Lions opened league play last weekend with road losses to UTRGV and Texas A&M-Corpus Christi.

In singles play, Aitana Darder (6-3), Taisia Bolsova (6-4) and Panatchakorn Suanarsa (6-4) share the team lead in victories. Claudia Di Leonardo (5-5) and Leana Gomez (5-4) are right behind the team leaders on the wins list for Southeastern.

Suanarsa and Bente Bierma pace the squad with a team-best 7-3 doubles record. Darder and Gomez have paired for a 5-4 mark.

Lamar will come to town looking to snap an eight-match losing streak when it visits Monday. Last season in Beaumont, SLU earned a 7-0 win over the Cardinals.

UIW, which plays at McNeese Monday, opened Southland Conference play with a narrow 4-3 victory over Lamar. Southeastern will be looking to avenge a 4-2 loss to UIW last March in Hammond.

Following this week’s action, SLU will take a break from conference play to host Loyola of New Orleans March 18 at 5 p.m. at the Southeastern Tennis Complex.

Novak Djokovic has revealed he'll sit down with Andy Murray to discuss the pair's coaching partnership following the Serb's early exit at Indian Wells. The all-time record Grand Slam winner lost his opening match of the tournament to qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp.

Despite coming up against one of the game's greats, the Dutch outsider looked at ease throughout most of the contest and ran out a 2-6, 6-3, 1-6 victor. It marks Djokovic's second consecutive opening match exit, having been beaten in straight sets by Matteo Berrettini at last month's Qatar Open.

Djokovic's dip in form has led to questions over the arrangement between himself and former player-turned-coach Murray. When quizzed on what his next step was, Djokovic replied: ""Yeah. I mean, still haven't talked with Andy and the team, so going to do that and make a plan.""

Prior to being dumped out of the tournament in Florida, Djokovic had suggested his partnership with Murray could continue well into the summer. He said: ""I was very glad when he decided to keep going [after the Australian Open]. Indian Wells, Miami and most of the clay court season. We're going to speak after Miami but I think the plan is to go to the end of Roland-Garros, hopefully Wimbledon as well.

""I'm enjoying the relationship with Andy, I feel like we're going through the process of getting to know each other on the court in a different way than we have known each other for 25 years. It's obviously a new role for him, he's exploring it... I like the way I played [in Australia]. In terms of the game, I think I played maybe the best tennis I played since the Olympics. I definitely contribute that to the work I had with Andy.""

Following his defeat to world No.86 Van de Zandschulp, Djokovic became the latest player, alongside Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz, to blast the Indian Wells organisers over the conditions of the tennis courts. Commenting on the bounce of the ball, the 37-year-old stated: ""You know, I regret for the level of tennis, considering how I practice these days. To be honest, the difference between the centre court and the other courts is immense.

""Ball is bouncing on the center courts higher than some of the highest clay courts, to be honest. I just struggled a lot with that, couldn't find the rhythm.""

On his performance, he alarmingly added: “You know, things are different obviously for me the last couple of years. I've been struggling to play on the desired level. Every now and then, I have couple good tournaments, but mostly it's really a challenge. It's a struggle for me. I guess nothing can prepare you for that moment, in a sense. You have to experience it and try to deal with it in the best possible way.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Art.com,Starlink is ‘backbone’ of Ukrainian military,https://www.rt.com/news/613947-musk-starlink-ukrainian-backbone/,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:37:00 GMT","

The Ukrainian military is fully dependent on the Starlink internet system, and turning it off would result in the collapse of the “entire frontline,” Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has claimed.

The system “is the backbone of the Ukrainian army,” Musk said on Sunday in a post on X.

“Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off,” he wrote, claiming that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has become a stalemate and that peace must be achieved now. “What I am sickened by is years of slaughter in a stalemate that Ukraine will inevitably lose. Anyone who really cares, really thinks and really understands wants the meat grinder to stop.”

In late February, Reuters reported that Musk had been considering cutting off Ukraine’s Starlink internet access in order to provide Washington with leverage in bargaining over a deal for natural resources. At the time, Musk denied the claims, accusing the news agency of “lying” and fabricating the entire report.

SpaceX has provided the Ukrainian military with Starlink internet since the escalation of the conflict with Russia in 2022. More than 40,000 terminals have been delivered over the years, with the system becoming a crucial component in the command and control architecture of the Ukrainian military.

Apart from providing comms, the terminals have seen direct combat use. Starlink dishes have been repeatedly seen rigged to Ukrainian sea and aerial drones, providing the unmanned systems with difficult-to-jam, reliable control access.

Space X has been providing Kiev with access to Starshield, a more secure and militarized version of the system. According to a Bloomberg report, Musk’s company secured a new contract with the Pentagon late last year, with an additional 3,000 Starlink terminals in Ukraine granted access to Starshield.

France will use the interest accrued on Russia’s frozen central bank assets to procure weapons for the Ukrainian military, the country’s defense minister, Sebastien Lecornu, has announced. Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin criticized the decision, stating it contravenes international law.

Following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, Western states froze an estimated $300 billion worth of Russian sovereign funds, of which approximately $213 billion is held by the Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear. The assets have already generated billions in interest, of which Euroclear already transferred €1.55 billion ($1.63 billion) directly to Ukraine last July.

In an interview to France’s La Tribune Dimanche on Saturday, Lecornu said that “thanks to interest from frozen Russian assets, we will also tap new funds worth 195 million euros.” He revealed that Paris would use the money to finance the delivery to Kiev of 155-mm artillery shells and glide bombs compatible with the Mirage 2000 fighter jets that France has handed over to Ukraine.

The official added that France also plans to supply an unspecified number of armored fighting vehicles, including the AMX-10 RC.

Volodin, the chairman of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, denounced the scheme as contravening international law.

“What is obviously hysteria born of impotence has finally gotten the better of reason,” the MP said on Sunday.

Responding to a similar move by the UK on Friday, Volodin warned that London “will have to give back to Russia what they are now so generously giving away,” adding that Moscow has “every reason to respond in kind.”

The remarks came shortly after Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal confirmed that Kiev had received a first tranche worth about $1 billion from London, secured by the proceeds from the Russian assets.

Late last year, the US also transferred the first $1 billion installment of a $20 billion US loan backed by interest earned from the immobilized Russian assets.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the time that “this money was stolen from us. Our assets have been frozen absolutely illegally, against all norms and rules.” He added that Russia would exhaust all legal avenues to protect its property and rights.

While Kiev has long been pressing its Western backers to outright expropriate the frozen Russian assets to finance its military and reconstruction efforts, a number of EU member states, most notably Germany, France, and Italy, have been reluctant to do so, citing legal concerns. The International Monetary Fund has also warned that appropriating the funds without a clear legal basis could undermine global confidence in Western financial institutions.

The Ukrainian military launched two HIMARS rockets directly at the stalls of a market in the town of Veliky Kopani in Russia’s Kherson Region on Sunday, according to regional governor Vladimir Saldo. The attack left several civilians dead and “a lot” wounded, Saldo said, citing preliminary data.

Dozens of civilians were at the market when at least two projectiles fired from a US-supplied M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launcher struck the location, according to a Telegram post by Saldo, which included images from the aftermath. The photos show one building badly damaged, with thick smoke billowing from it.

Footage circulating online shows a destroyed van ablaze outside of the market, with an injured – or possibly dead – person lying next to it.

A paramedic and driver with the local emergency medical services were also injured in the attack, the regional health minister, Elena Borchaninova, told TASS. At least seven civilians were injured in the attack with one subsequently succumbing to his injuries, the ministry’s press service told the news agency.

The exact number of casualties has not yet been officially established, as the wounded are still being transferred to hospitals. At least some of the victims were sent to the coastal city of Skadovsk, located some 20 km to the south of Veliky Kopani.

“The information is still preliminary. We are waiting for all the victims. They have been sent to the Skadovsk hospital. So far, only two have been brought in. Unfortunately, one of the two has died,” the Health Ministry told RIA Novosti.

Kiev has been receiving M142 HIMARS and its heavier tracked cousin, the M270 MLRS, since mid-2022 from the US and other Western backers. The systems, once touted as a key tool for striking high-value Russian assets, have routinely been used by Kiev for indiscriminate strikes on civilian targets deep beyond the frontline.

        Greenland, the world's largest island, remains a self-governing territory of Denmark. Amid Trump's interest, Greenlanders might push for independence in upcoming elections.
    

Greenland is the world's largest island -  it's larger even than France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, and Belgium combined.

But despite its size, Greenland remains a self-governing territory of Denmark and its foreign, defence and monetary policies are all decided in Copenhagen.

Since 80 percent of it is permanently covered in ice, much of it remains inhabitable. It has a tiny population of just 56,000 people, most of them indigenous Inuits.

They've long taken pride in a culture and traditions that's helped them survive for centuries in some of the most rugged conditions. They have a close link to nature and belong to one of the most beautiful, remote, untouched places on Earth.

But Greenlanders now find their voices greatly amplified on the world stage after President Donald Trump's outlandish claimed that the US would take over their island.

Most say they don’t want to be American, and many are both worried and overwhelmed by the comments and the attention Trump's comments have brought. 

But many also see the global spotlight on them as an opportunity to promote their longstanding push for independence from Denmark, which is a key issue in Tuesday's legislative elections. 

Since 1979, Greenland has had its own prime minister who is able to govern at a local level. He or she has to come from the party with the most seats, which is currently the left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit party. Currently the prime minister is Múte Egede, who coincidentally will celebrate his 38th birthday on the day of the election.

The parliament - the Inatsisartut - has just 31 MPs who will be chosen from six political parties, two of whom are in the governing coalition of the Inuit Ataqatigiit and the Simiut parties.

Since few opinion polls take place on the North Atlantic island, it is less clear than in other European elections as to what the outcome might be. 

But one poll conducted by Verian in January asked 497 Greenlanders who they would vote for. It suggested that the Inuit Ataqatigiit party could gain about 31% and beat the Siumut party by about 9%.

The Simiut party has promised a vote on independence after the election, which may help it attract more voters, and perhaps allow it to choose the next prime minister.

But Naleraq is the largest opposition party, and it's been growing in popularity with its pro-independence policy and its apparent willingness to collaborate with the United States.

Qupanuk Olsen, who is Greenland's most popular influencer, is running for Naleraq, and with more than 500,000 followers on TikTok and 300,000 on Instagram, she has the best online platform to campaign from.

Unsurprisingly, Greenlanders are not keen for the US to take them over. Just hours after Trump declared in his speech to a joint session of Congress that he intends to gain control of the island “one way or the other,"" Greenland’s prime minister Egede posted a simple message on Facebook: “Greenland is ours.”

“Kalaallit Nunaat is ours,” Egede said in the post, using the Greenlandic name for his country.

“We don’t want to be Americans, nor Danes; We are Kalaallit. The Americans and their leader must understand that. We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,” he said. The post ended with a clenched fist emoji and a Greenlandic flag.

Since taking office six weeks ago, Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in mineral-rich Greenland, which sits along strategic sea lanes in the North Atlantic. Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark with a population of about 56,000 people, lies off the northeastern coast of Canada, closer to Washington than to Copenhagen.

Trump made a direct appeal to Greenlanders in his speech to US Congress, just a week before the country’s voters cast their ballots in parliamentary elections.

“We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America,” Trump said.

“We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before,” he added.

Greenlanders voted overwhelmingly in favour of self-government in a 2009 referendum that also established a pathway to independence whenever the people of the island support such a move. Under the terms of that referendum, Denmark remains responsible for Greenland’s defence and foreign affairs, with the local government controlling other matters.

Asked about Trump’s comments, Denmark’s foreign minister said he doesn’t think Greenlanders want to separate from Denmark only to become “an integrated part of America.”

Lars Løkke Rasmussen said he believed Trump’s reference to respecting Greenlanders’ right to self-determination was the most important part of his speech.

“I’m very optimistic about what will be a Greenlandic decision about this,” he said during a trip to Finland. “They want to loosen their ties to Denmark. We’re working on that, to have a more equal relationship.”

Løkke added that it was important for next week’s elections to be free and fair “without any kind of international intervention.”

Greenland is vital to the world, though much of the world may not realise it. The U.S and other global powers covet its strategic location in the Arctic; its valuable rare earth minerals trapped under the ice needed for telecommunications; its billions of barrels of untapped oil. 

There’s also potential for shipping and trade routes as the ice that covers most of Greenland keeps retreating because of climate change. If that ice melts, it would reshape coastlines across the globe and potentially shift weather patterns.

Denmark colonised Greenland 300 years ago and still exercises control over foreign and defence policy, though Greenland won self-rule in 1979 and runs itself through its parliament.

Trump’s comments about Greenland also set off a political crisis in Denmark. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen went on a tour of European capitals to garner support, saying the continent faced “a more uncertain reality,” while her country moved to strengthen its military presence around Greenland.

Greenland’s economy depends on fisheries and other industries as well as on an annual grant of about 554 million euros from Denmark.

Aka Hansen, an Inuk filmmaker and writer, is suspicious of Trump’s intentions - but still thanks him for turning the world’s attention to her homeland.

Like many other Greenlanders, she wants her homeland and people to be respected and she doesn’t want to be ruled by another colonial power. But she feels Trump’s rhetoric has increased the momentum for independence from Denmark.

Denmark has been accused of committing abuses against Greenland’s Inuit people, including removing children from their families in the 1950s with the excuse of integrating them into Danish society and fitting women with intrauterine contraceptive devices in the 1960s and 1970s — allegedly to limit population growth in Greenland.

        Ankara has pledged to fully apply a law to remove millions of stray dogs from the streets after the death of a toddler. However, opponents believe this could lead to further widespread neglect of pets.
    

Turkey’s interior minister has pledged to fully apply a law to remove millions of stray dogs from the streets in the wake of the death of a toddler earlier this week.  

“Either they will do this job or I will use whatever authority the law gives me to the fullest,” Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said in a video message posted on social media.

The two-year-old Rana El Selci died after being attacked by a pack of stray dogs in the central Turkish city of Konya on Friday, sparking fresh outcry about the 4 million stray dogs that the government estimates roam Turkey’s streets and rural areas. 

A criminal investigation was launched following her death as municipal workers began rounding up dogs in the city. On Saturday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the government was “taking determined steps to ensure the implementation of the law.” 

The legislation – labelled the “massacre law” by animal welfare groups – was passed by parliament last summer but has been only partially implemented by municipal authorities. 

It requires municipalities to collect stray dogs and house them in shelters to be vaccinated, neutered or spayed before making them available for adoption. Dogs that are in pain, terminally ill, or pose a health risk to humans will be euthanised.  

A report released by the Safe Streets and Defence of the Right to Life Association, an organisation campaigning for the removal of all stray dogs from the streets, says that 65 people have died in street dog attacks since 2022, not including Rana El Selci.

Animal lovers fear the legislation will lead to dogs being killed or ending up in neglected, overcrowded shelters. When the law was passed, the main opposition party pledged that its municipalities would not implement the round-up of strays. 

The issue has proven to be divisive in Turkish society, with at least one former government minister having professed his admiration for ""man's best friend"".

During the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago, the former Minister of Justice Adbulhamit Gul posted a photo of himself on X petting a dog, saying: ''We should not abandon our animal friends during these tough days.''

The post came as the government was publicly promoting feeding stray animals whilst COVID-19 restrictions were in force.

Meanwhile, demonstrations in cities across Turkey have seen thousands call for the law to be scrapped. There have also been protests across Europe, as people warned the legislation could dissuade tourists from visiting Turkey.  

Some critics have blamed the growth in the stray canine population on the failure to implement previous regulations, which required stray dogs to be caught, neutered, or spayed and returned to their original location. 

Turkey’s Animal Rights Federation, HAYTAP, posted a video on X showing stray dogs and cats peacefully coexisting with people in the street, in shops, and even on the metro network.

The organisation recalled a previous attempt to get rid of stray dogs in 1910 in a statement on its website: ""In an effort to 'Westernise' Istanbul just before the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan ordered tens of thousands stray dogs from Istanbul to be sent to a nearby island.""

""The island did not have food or water for the dogs, so this ended horribly with cannibalisation, starvation, and many dogs drowning trying to swim back.  Records show reports of people on the mainland being haunted by hearing the howls of the starving dogs on the island,"" HAYTAP said.

Animal rights activists are concerned that some municipalities might kill dogs on the pretext that they are ill rather than allocate resources to shelter them.

Videos showing dead cats and dogs buried in ditches have been circulating on social media. Animal rights activists say the animals were indiscriminately killed after the passage of the law.

The recent warning issued by US President Trump to Ukrainian President Zelensky that Ukraine is “gambling with World War III” has given many people pause. But is the world really on the cusp of such a catastrophe? I don’t think so – at least not tomorrow.The fact is that unlike the situation that existed at the onset of World War II, there is no country in the world today except for the United States capable of starting World War III with any hope of success.  World War II was started by Germany and Japan, who at least thought that they had the military capability to win, augmented by the intent to conquer. While the democratic West won the battle, there were nearly 15 million military casualties and almost 38 million civilian deaths, a terribly high price to pay for freedom. And, of course, we need to remember that victory by the West was not assured until well into the war itself.CHURCHILL, ROOSEVELT and Stalin at the Yalta Conference in 1945 – expect the worst from your enemies, and little better from your friends (credit: Wikimedia Commons)What is the situation today?Russia, in spite of all its bluster, is in no position to start a global conflagration. Their economy is in the toilet, interest rates are over 21%, almost a million Russian troops have been killed in the fighting with Ukraine, large portions of the middle class have left the country or are leaving, there is unrest in Siberia as well as in other areas of the country, and their military capability has been decimated by losses in the last three years of the conflict with Ukraine. AdvertisementChina, often seen as a potential aggressor as well, is also in no position to begin World War III. According to a recent report by the World Bank: “Over the medium term, China’s economy is expected to undergo a structural slowdown. Potential growth has been on a declining trend, reflecting adverse demographics, tepid productivity growth, and rising constraints to a debt-fueled, investment-driven growth model. Structural reforms are needed to reinvigorate the shift to more balanced high-quality growth.” In spite of China being the world’s second largest economy after the US, it has way too many internal problems to even think of starting a world war. As for Iran, trigger-happy as they may be to get everyone fighting each other, Israel has reduced their military capability so that, at least over the next 12-18 months, they have no capacity to engage the world militarily. With the sanctions being reimposed by the Trump administration, their economic power will be reduced as well.Nevertheless, the world is not out of the woods just yet on this score. The seeming decision by the new administration in Washington, whether implied or articulated, for the US to no longer be the guarantor of the security of its allies, creates a level of discomfort among many countries that will most likely cause many of them to take certain actions to protect themselves.

It is a good bet that most will try to develop a nuclear arsenal to offset those of nations who presently have such weapons available for use. Everyone knows that Iran is capable of achieving this in a matter of weeks, while there is no doubt many other countries as well would decide to move in this direction. AdvertisementThis is most likely where the threat of World War III has the highest probability of eventuating into something real. Absent the nuclear non-proliferation treaties that were in place in the years following the end of World War II, there are no longer any restraints on nations who want to move in this direction.History has taught us that conflicts are often touched off by small incidents that then become the reasons someone “pulls the plug,” as it were, out of fear that another country will act first. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria in 1914, for example, was the presumed trigger that set off World War I. The more hands that have access to the nuclear button, the higher the risk of an inadvertent mistake being made.Hopefully, the world will not find itself on the precipice of another world war. If fought with nuclear weapons, it would be good to recall the observation of Albert Einstein, who said: “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.”  Let us hope that cooler heads will prevail – a real challenge in this perilous time – and that we will figure out how to retreat from the precipice of a war that could destroy most of humanity.The writer, who has lived in Israel for 41 years, is the founder and chair of Atid EDI Ltd., an international business development consultancy.

This is most likely where the threat of World War III has the highest probability of eventuating into something real. Absent the nuclear non-proliferation treaties that were in place in the years following the end of World War II, there are no longer any restraints on nations who want to move in this direction.History has taught us that conflicts are often touched off by small incidents that then become the reasons someone “pulls the plug,” as it were, out of fear that another country will act first.

Israel is coming off the worst massacre in its history – men, women, and children slaughtered, and others taken hostage. It found itself forced to fight for its survival on seven different fronts. And it now has in the White House the most pro-Israel president in memory.Yet, despite all that, support for Israel in America is at its lowest level in a quarter century, at least according to the Gallup World Affairs survey, which has been asking the same question since 2001: “In the Middle East situation, are your sympathies more with the Israelis or with the Palestinians?”  When 1,004 Americans were asked this question in telephone interviews between February 3-16, only 46% said Israel, while 33% said the Palestinians.Why “only”? Because less than half of Americans now express greater sympathy for Israel over the Palestinians. Because this is the lowest level of support recorded in this poll since 2001 – though in other Gallup polls, it dipped as low as 37% in 1988. In that particular poll, however, support for the Palestinians was just 15%, meaning that while sympathy for Israel was low, the gap between the two was still significant. Today, that gap has narrowed to just 13 points – the lowest since 1988. AdvertisementThis should set alarm bells ringing. A FAMILY displaced to the southern part of the Gaza Strip sets out to return home in January after a Hamas-Israel ceasefire was reached. Even amid Gaza’s destruction, Hamas celebrated the return of displaced civilians to northern Gaza as a nationalist victory, says the writer. (credit: Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters)This week, Jews around the world will mark the Purim holiday. One of the key figures in the story is King Ahasuerus of Persia, who granted Haman permission to carry out a genocide against the Jewish people – one that, miraculously, was averted. It is striking that Ahasuerus was the grandson of another Persian king, Cyrus, the great liberator of the Jewish people, the ruler who allowed them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Second Temple.In just two generations, the Jews went from living under a Persian king who freed them to one who authorized their destruction.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The lesson is clear: Never be complacent. Just because support for Israel was overwhelming a generation or two ago does not mean it will always remain so. This is not to suggest that America will turn on Israel as swiftly as Ahasuerus did on the Jews. Still, these numbers – indicating dwindling support – must be taken seriously and policy adjusted accordingly. AdvertisementHow can American support for Israel be lower – significantly lower – now than it was before the October 7 massacre?One might have expected that the massacre and the ongoing hostage crisis would have generated lasting sympathy among fair-minded Americans. And initially, it did. But only briefly.Wilting sympathy for Israel amidst troubling Gaza imageryTHE TELEVISION screens quickly filled with ghastly images of destruction in Gaza, and sympathy for Israel began to wilt. Hardcore Israel-haters didn’t wait for those images; they were already marching and demonstrating against Israel on October 8, well before Israel counterattacked. For others, the relentless flood of heartbreaking images from Gaza and negative stories about Israel had an effect.  A recent study by Yale University professor Edieal Pinker found that The New York Times’s coverage of the Israel-Hamas War overwhelmingly generated sympathy for the Palestinian people while downplaying both Hamas’s responsibility for the conflict and Israel’s suffering. Pinker reached these conclusions after analyzing 1,561 Times articles about the conflict between October 7, 2023, and June 7, 2024.“It is common to go a week at a time without a single mention of IDF deaths even when such deaths were frequent,” he wrote. “The net result of these imbalances and others is to create a depiction of events that is imbalanced toward creating sympathy for the Palestinian side, places most of the agency in the hands of Israel, is often at odds with actual events, and fails to give readers an understanding of how Israelis are experiencing the war.”That kind of coverage has an impact.The Israeli media, for the most part, has not extensively covered the devastation and suffering in Gaza. The American media has, and over the last 16 months, the constant stream of images has undoubtedly shaped public perception of the conflict. This helps explain why support for Israel has dropped from 54% in 2023 (before October 7) to 46% today and why the gap between support for Israel and the Palestinians has shrunk from a high of 52 points in 2013 to just 13 points now.And then there is the Trump effect.Trump is unabashedly pro-Israel, and his policies reflect this sentiment. One might think that strong pro-Israel rhetoric from the White House would trickle down and boost public support. But this poll – conducted just weeks after he took office – suggests the opposite. In today’s deeply divided America, where the part of the population that hates Trump tends to oppose whatever he supports, the president’s vocal backing of Israel may have pushed many of his critics in the opposite direction.Indeed, Democratic support for Israel plummeted by a staggering 14 points in the past year from 35% to 21%, while support for the Palestinians jumped from 43% to 59%.Another concerning trend in the poll is that, while Republican support for Israel remains overwhelming – 54 points higher than among Democrats (75% vs. 21%) – it is at its lowest level since 2005, when it stood at 73%. Support among Republicans slipped from 80% last year to 75% this year, possibly reflecting the influence of isolationist voices within the party, such as Tucker Carlson.THERE IS a common misconception that massive Republican support for Israel is a recent phenomenon. However, Gallup polling dating back to 1988 shows that even then, more Republicans sympathized with Israel over the Palestinians – by a margin of 43% to 37%. Today, that margin stands at 75% to 21%.These poll results carry two clear policy implications for Israel.First, far more must be done to improve Israel’s image in the US and counteract the steady drumbeat of negative coverage.American Jewish organizations and NGOs spend millions of dollars annually trying to improve Israel’s image, yet this poll indicates that the current approach is not working. A new, more effective strategy is needed, and the Israeli government must engage on a much larger scale. This is becoming a strategic issue that demands government intervention at an unprecedented level. Even then, success is far from guaranteed.Second, Israel must continue an effort it began during the current war – as a result of the US slow-walking vital arms to Israel – to locally produce as much of its weaponry as possible.Under the 10-year Memorandum of Understanding signed with then-president Barack Obama, the US-Israel military aid agreement currently provides Israel with $3.8 billion annually in aid – a tremendous benefit.But the catch is that all of it now must be spent in the US, leading Israel to purchase not only fighter aircraft and helicopters in the US but also missiles, mortars, and basic munitions from American manufacturers because it ends up saving money. That makes sense. But the downside is that it creates a dangerous dependence.The Trump administration has approved billions in arms sales to Israel in recent weeks – a critical lifeline. But that type of support is not a given. It exists largely because of the perception that the vast majority of Americans back Israel.But what if they don’t? After all, in the 18-34 year-old demographic – according to the Gallup poll – 48% sympathize more with the Palestinians, and only 29% with the Israelis. What if US support continues to erode?Israel must prepare for that possibility, however distant it may seem. These polling trends are sobering and must not be ignored.

The American media has, and over the last 16 months, the constant stream of images has undoubtedly shaped public perception of the conflict. This helps explain why support for Israel has dropped from 54% in 2023 (before October 7) to 46% today and why the gap between support for Israel and the Palestinians has shrunk from a high of 52 points in 2013 to just 13 points now.And then there is the Trump effect.Trump is unabashedly pro-Israel, and his policies reflect this sentiment. One might think that strong pro-Israel rhetoric from the White House would trickle down and boost public support. But this poll – conducted just weeks after he took office – suggests the opposite. In today’s deeply divided America, where the part of the population that hates Trump tends to oppose whatever he supports, the president’s vocal backing of Israel may have pushed many of his critics in the opposite direction.Indeed, Democratic support for Israel plummeted by a staggering 14 points in the past year from 35% to 21%, while support for the Palestinians jumped from 43% to 59%.Another concerning trend in the poll is that, while Republican support for Israel remains overwhelming – 54 points higher than among Democrats (75% vs. 21%) – it is at its lowest level since 2005, when it stood at 73%. Support among Republicans slipped from 80% last year to 75% this year, possibly reflecting the influence of isolationist voices within the party, such as Tucker Carlson.THERE IS a common misconception that massive Republican support for Israel is a recent phenomenon. However, Gallup polling dating back to 1988 shows that even then, more Republicans sympathized with Israel over the Palestinians – by a margin of 43% to 37%. Today, that margin stands at 75% to 21%.These poll results carry two clear policy implications for Israel.First, far more must be done to improve Israel’s image in the US and counteract the steady drumbeat of negative coverage.American Jewish organizations and NGOs spend millions of dollars annually trying to improve Israel’s image, yet this poll indicates that the current approach is not working. A new, more effective strategy is needed, and the Israeli government must engage on a much larger scale. This is becoming a strategic issue that demands government intervention at an unprecedented level. Even then, success is far from guaranteed.Second, Israel must continue an effort it began during the current war – as a result of the US slow-walking vital arms to Israel – to locally produce as much of its weaponry as possible.Under the 10-year Memorandum of Understanding signed with then-president Barack Obama, the US-Israel military aid agreement currently provides Israel with $3.8 billion annually in aid – a tremendous benefit.But the catch is that all of it now must be spent in the US, leading Israel to purchase not only fighter aircraft and helicopters in the US but also missiles, mortars, and basic munitions from American manufacturers because it ends up saving money. That makes sense. But the downside is that it creates a dangerous dependence.The Trump administration has approved billions in arms sales to Israel in recent weeks – a critical lifeline. But that type of support is not a given. It exists largely because of the perception that the vast majority of Americans back Israel.But what if they don’t? After all, in the 18-34 year-old demographic – according to the Gallup poll – 48% sympathize more with the Palestinians, and only 29% with the Israelis. What if US support continues to erode?Israel must prepare for that possibility, however distant it may seem. These polling trends are sobering and must not be ignored. 
            



This should set alarm bells ringing. A FAMILY displaced to the southern part of the Gaza Strip sets out to return home in January after a Hamas-Israel ceasefire was reached. Even amid Gaza’s destruction, Hamas celebrated the return of displaced civilians to northern Gaza as a nationalist victory, says the writer. (credit: Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters)This week, Jews around the world will mark the Purim holiday. One of the key figures in the story is King Ahasuerus of Persia, who granted Haman permission to carry out a genocide against the Jewish people – one that, miraculously, was averted.

The American media has, and over the last 16 months, the constant stream of images has undoubtedly shaped public perception of the conflict. This helps explain why support for Israel has dropped from 54% in 2023 (before October 7) to 46% today and why the gap between support for Israel and the Palestinians has shrunk from a high of 52 points in 2013 to just 13 points now.And then there is the Trump effect.Trump is unabashedly pro-Israel, and his policies reflect this sentiment. One might think that strong pro-Israel rhetoric from the White House would trickle down and boost public support. But this poll – conducted just weeks after he took office – suggests the opposite. In today’s deeply divided America, where the part of the population that hates Trump tends to oppose whatever he supports, the president’s vocal backing of Israel may have pushed many of his critics in the opposite direction.Indeed, Democratic support for Israel plummeted by a staggering 14 points in the past year from 35% to 21%, while support for the Palestinians jumped from 43% to 59%.Another concerning trend in the poll is that, while Republican support for Israel remains overwhelming – 54 points higher than among Democrats (75% vs. 21%) – it is at its lowest level since 2005, when it stood at 73%. Support among Republicans slipped from 80% last year to 75% this year, possibly reflecting the influence of isolationist voices within the party, such as Tucker Carlson.THERE IS a common misconception that massive Republican support for Israel is a recent phenomenon. However, Gallup polling dating back to 1988 shows that even then, more Republicans sympathized with Israel over the Palestinians – by a margin of 43% to 37%. Today, that margin stands at 75% to 21%.These poll results carry two clear policy implications for Israel.First, far more must be done to improve Israel’s image in the US and counteract the steady drumbeat of negative coverage.American Jewish organizations and NGOs spend millions of dollars annually trying to improve Israel’s image, yet this poll indicates that the current approach is not working. A new, more effective strategy is needed, and the Israeli government must engage on a much larger scale. This is becoming a strategic issue that demands government intervention at an unprecedented level. Even then, success is far from guaranteed.Second, Israel must continue an effort it began during the current war – as a result of the US slow-walking vital arms to Israel – to locally produce as much of its weaponry as possible.Under the 10-year Memorandum of Understanding signed with then-president Barack Obama, the US-Israel military aid agreement currently provides Israel with $3.8 billion annually in aid – a tremendous benefit.But the catch is that all of it now must be spent in the US, leading Israel to purchase not only fighter aircraft and helicopters in the US but also missiles, mortars, and basic munitions from American manufacturers because it ends up saving money. That makes sense. But the downside is that it creates a dangerous dependence.The Trump administration has approved billions in arms sales to Israel in recent weeks – a critical lifeline. But that type of support is not a given. It exists largely because of the perception that the vast majority of Americans back Israel.But what if they don’t? After all, in the 18-34 year-old demographic – according to the Gallup poll – 48% sympathize more with the Palestinians, and only 29% with the Israelis. What if US support continues to erode?Israel must prepare for that possibility, however distant it may seem. These polling trends are sobering and must not be ignored.

No Child Spared (in Hebrew, “Ha’Heder”) is a powerful and disturbing documentary currently available on Hot VOD and Next TV about what its director, Meni Philip, describes as the widespread use of corporal punishment in ultra-Orthodox (haredi) schools and yeshivot.Philip, who grew up in the haredi community, doesn’t delve into statistics or investigations into this issue, although there have been news stories about it around the world. However, he makes a convincing case that horrifying levels of physical abuse are tolerated in this community.  Philip says he got the idea for the documentary when his brother, Nasich Katan Philip, posted about his experiences being beaten by teachers during his childhood on social media, and the post went viral, opening up a dialogue with many other survivors of this kind of abuse.The brothers and about a dozen other young men and boys who are interviewed describe harrowing instances of suffering beatings in the classroom and of watching others being beaten. Their testimony is punctuated by childhood photos of them looking innocent and cute, which makes it easier to visualize the abuse and even harder to understand it.  Advertisement“When I listened to all the stories, I realized how much the blows were only part of what happened to me there,” says Meni Philip. “I went from being not just the child that they hurt, to being the father who doesn’t see his children and doesn’t protect them… Trauma doesn’t affect everyone the same way. An ultra-Orthodox Jewish family takes part in the tashlich ritual, to symbolically cast away sins, ahead of Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, in Ashdod, Israel, October 3, 2022. (credit: REUTERS/AMIR COHEN)“But everyone [who goes through this experience] in one way or another becomes closed to the possibility of feeling others’ [pain], if from when you’re a little child you see your friends who are abused, and you can’t help them, you have to shut yourself down. And if your friends never help you, you learn that there’s no one in the world you can depend on. That shapes people, and it creates a whole society of people like this. Parents like this, teachers like this, friends like this, rabbis like this, Knesset members like this.”  The film features a few videos of abuse, some from the US and some from Israel, where the beatings take place in state-supported schools. Philip does make the point that there are those fighting against this abuse, but based on the testimonies in the film, the opponents aren’t making much headway. At least if those who have been or are being abused see this film, they will know that someone cares about their suffering, even if no one managed to prevent it. A very different side of the haredi world is the focus of the second season of the comedy The New Black, aka Shababnikim, which is now available (although without English titles) on Netflix, or season three, which is showing on Hot 3, Hot VOD, and Next TV throughout March.    Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  This series focuses on three haredi goof-offs: Avinoam (Daniel Gad), the son of an Arye Deri-like politician; Meir (Israel Atias), a Mizrahi guy from a modest family; and Dov (Omer Pereleman Striks), whose wealthy Ashkenazi family lives abroad. There’s also Gedalia (Ori Laizerouvich), a brilliant and very pious scholar who is abrasive and lacks social skills, much like a haredi Sheldon Cooper, the hero of The Big Bang Theory.  AdvertisementAvinoam, Meir, and Dov are running a yeshiva, while Gedalia is an inspector for the Religious Affairs Ministry who threatens to cut their budget. These four are some of the funniest actors in Israel. Other stars included in the cast are Guri Alfi, Shuli Rand, Maya Landsman, Maya Wertheimer, Keren Mor, and Adi Havshush (who was just in Save the Date). Gene Hackman's brilliant actingOnce Gene Hackman’s death was announced, I realized how much I had missed his distinctive, brilliant acting in the 20 years since he retired from the screen. He had that regular-guy look and could be playful and funny but also menacing and dramatic. Hackman won an Oscar for his iconic performance as the relentless, brutal cop chasing a European heroin cartel operating in New York in The French Connection, a gritty ’70s movie where there aren’t really any good guys, just bad guys and worse guys. The film is available on Disney+ and Apple TV+.   Apple TV+ also features what many consider Hackman's masterpiece, Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation, in which he plays a loner surveillance expert who is moved to take a stand when he suspects that a couple he is spying on is about to be murdered. The movie is heavy on paranoid atmosphere and features an incredible supporting cast, including Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, Teri Garr, Allen Garfield, and John Cazale (who played Fredo in The Godfather movies and died very young). Hackman was often the menacing white-collar heavy, sometimes a corporate stooge, sometimes a government agent, and you can see him in these kinds of roles in Runaway Jury on Netflix and Enemy of the State on Disney+. If you’d like to see Hackman as a stubborn military commander, try Crimson Tide and Behind Enemy Lines on Disney+.It’s harder to find comic Hackman streaming these days, but Disney and Apple both offer Wes Anderson’s The Royal Tenenbaums. Hackman plays Royal, the disgraced patriarch in this quirky family saga, with Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller as his children and Anjelica Huston as his ex. It’s one of his best performances, showcasing every aspect of his talent, and it proves why he became a star: Once you’ve seen it, it’s impossible to imagine anyone else in his role. Kate Hudson has been a pleasure to watch since her breakout performance in Almost Famous. Now, she is perfectly cast as the team owner’s daughter who ends up running an NBA franchise in Los Angeles in the new Netflix series Running Point. If that setup reminds you of the HBO series Winning Time about the Los Angeles Lakers, that’s no coincidence. Portrayed in the film is the executive producer of Running Point, Jeanie Buss, who is now the president and controlling owner of the Lakers and the daughter of the late former team owner Jerry Buss.So if you liked Winning Time, you’ll probably enjoy Running Point, although the former isn’t nearly as good.The Running Point follows the outline of Jeanie Buss’s life as she unexpectedly takes over the team when her older brother (Justin Theroux) announces he is getting help for his crack addiction. In the film, Buss copes with rivalry with her brothers from her father’s various marriages and girlfriends, egotistical players, and eccentric co-workers, and there is even a storyline about her mulling whether to convert to Judaism to please her Jewish fiancé, which will appeal to fans of Nobody Wants This.Subtle it’s not, but occasionally, it’s funny. It's even appropriate viewing for Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day on March 8.

The movie is heavy on paranoid atmosphere and features an incredible supporting cast, including Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, Teri Garr, Allen Garfield, and John Cazale (who played Fredo in The Godfather movies and died very young). Hackman was often the menacing white-collar heavy, sometimes a corporate stooge, sometimes a government agent, and you can see him in these kinds of roles in Runaway Jury on Netflix and Enemy of the State on Disney+. If you’d like to see Hackman as a stubborn military commander, try Crimson Tide and Behind Enemy Lines on Disney+.It’s harder to find comic Hackman streaming these days, but Disney and Apple both offer Wes Anderson’s The Royal Tenenbaums. Hackman plays Royal, the disgraced patriarch in this quirky family saga, with Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller as his children and Anjelica Huston as his ex. It’s one of his best performances, showcasing every aspect of his talent, and it proves why he became a star: Once you’ve seen it, it’s impossible to imagine anyone else in his role. Kate Hudson has been a pleasure to watch since her breakout performance in Almost Famous. Now, she is perfectly cast as the team owner’s daughter who ends up running an NBA franchise in Los Angeles in the new Netflix series Running Point. If that setup reminds you of the HBO series Winning Time about the Los Angeles Lakers, that’s no coincidence. Portrayed in the film is the executive producer of Running Point, Jeanie Buss, who is now the president and controlling owner of the Lakers and the daughter of the late former team owner Jerry Buss.So if you liked Winning Time, you’ll probably enjoy Running Point, although the former isn’t nearly as good.The Running Point follows the outline of Jeanie Buss’s life as she unexpectedly takes over the team when her older brother (Justin Theroux) announces he is getting help for his crack addiction. In the film, Buss copes with rivalry with her brothers from her father’s various marriages and girlfriends, egotistical players, and eccentric co-workers, and there is even a storyline about her mulling whether to convert to Judaism to please her Jewish fiancé, which will appeal to fans of Nobody Wants This.Subtle it’s not, but occasionally, it’s funny. It's even appropriate viewing for Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day on March 8.
            



“When I listened to all the stories, I realized how much the blows were only part of what happened to me there,” says Meni Philip. “I went from being not just the child that they hurt, to being the father who doesn’t see his children and doesn’t protect them… Trauma doesn’t affect everyone the same way. An ultra-Orthodox Jewish family takes part in the tashlich ritual, to symbolically cast away sins, ahead of Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, in Ashdod, Israel, October 3, 2022.

Philip does make the point that there are those fighting against this abuse, but based on the testimonies in the film, the opponents aren’t making much headway.

Hackman plays Royal, the disgraced patriarch in this quirky family saga, with Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller as his children and Anjelica Huston as his ex. It’s one of his best performances, showcasing every aspect of his talent, and it proves why he became a star: Once you’ve seen it, it’s impossible to imagine anyone else in his role. Kate Hudson has been a pleasure to watch since her breakout performance in Almost Famous. Now, she is perfectly cast as the team owner’s daughter who ends up running an NBA franchise in Los Angeles in the new Netflix series Running Point. If that setup reminds you of the HBO series Winning Time about the Los Angeles Lakers, that’s no coincidence. Portrayed in the film is the executive producer of Running Point, Jeanie Buss, who is now the president and controlling owner of the Lakers and the daughter of the late former team owner Jerry Buss.So if you liked Winning Time, you’ll probably enjoy Running Point, although the former isn’t nearly as good.The Running Point follows the outline of Jeanie Buss’s life as she unexpectedly takes over the team when her older brother (Justin Theroux) announces he is getting help for his crack addiction. In the film, Buss copes with rivalry with her brothers from her father’s various marriages and girlfriends, egotistical players, and eccentric co-workers, and there is even a storyline about her mulling whether to convert to Judaism to please her Jewish fiancé, which will appeal to fans of Nobody Wants This.Subtle it’s not, but occasionally, it’s funny. It's even appropriate viewing for Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day on March 8.
            



Apple TV+ also features what many consider Hackman's masterpiece, Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation, in which he plays a loner surveillance expert who is moved to take a stand when he suspects that a couple he is spying on is about to be murdered.

Iran has said it prefers a one-state solution to the conflict in Gaza rather than a recent plan put forward by Arab states after a meeting in Cairo last week. Tehran expressed this view at an Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference, where foreign ministers of various Muslim countries had gathered.This is a pivotal time in the region. The ceasefire in Gaza is still holding, Hamas has rejected Israel’s attempts to extend the first phase of a hostage deal, US President Donald Trump’s administration has engaged in direct talks with the terror group, and the Islamic Republic and the Arab states oppose his plan for re-settling Gazans.  Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said at the OIC that the two-state solution “will not secure Palestinian rights, emphasizing Tehran’s support for the establishment of one state representing all the original inhabitants of Palestine.”He said, “With due respect to the views of some brotherly countries on the two-state solution, the Islamic Republic of Iran maintains its view that this solution will not lead to the realization of the rights of the Palestinian people.” AdvertisementIran has lost some of its influence in the Middle East after the fall of the Assad regime and the weakening of its proxies throughout the Middle East. It is now trying to claw this power back.Leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, the Palestinian Authority, and the Arab League participate in discussions on the potential displacement of Gazans in Cairo, February 1, 2025.  (credit: screenshot)No two-state solution“In our view, ‘one democratic state’ representing all the original inhabitants of Palestine is the only viable solution,” the Iranian foreign minister said. “Given the Israeli regime’s persistent defiance of the UN Charter, its designation of the UN secretary-general as persona non grata, the complete obstruction of UNRWA’s operations, and the unprecedented tragic loss of hundreds of UN staff in Palestine, it is imperative to continue our endeavors for Israeli regime’s expulsion from the United Nations,” Iran said at the OIC. The country’s state media published the foreign minister’s entire speech, indicating its importance in their eyes.Tehran says it has “uncompromising support” for the “cause of Palestine.”   Stay updated with the latest news!

AdvertisementIran says it doesn’t want the OIC to be construed as recognizing the “Zionist regime.” Its foreign minister went on to say that the country “earnestly hopes that this auspicious meeting will inspire the international community to take meaningful action to advance justice and peace for the people of Palestine. May this gathering be a renewed commitment to their honorable cause.”Iran is thus trying to claw back some role in the Islamic world. It is obviously concerned that the Saudi Arabian and Egyptian proposal at the Arab League for Gaza could end with moderation or the replacement of Hamas. Iran would thus lose out in Gaza as well.

Iran says it doesn’t want the OIC to be construed as recognizing the “Zionist regime.” Its foreign minister went on to say that the country “earnestly hopes that this auspicious meeting will inspire the international community to take meaningful action to advance justice and peace for the people of Palestine. May this gathering be a renewed commitment to their honorable cause.”Iran is thus trying to claw back some role in the Islamic world.

A date with an online partner turned tragic for a 16-year-old girl from Florida as she was allegedly kidnapped, tortured and murdered by the man.

As per the St Petersburg Police Department, 35-year-old Steven Gress and his 37-year-old partner, Michelle Brandes have been arrested in connection with the brutal killing of Miranada Corsette.

Corsette, who lived with her grandmother in Gulfport, was reported missing on February 24 and an investigation was launched to find her.

She was reportedly lured by Gress through a dating app before Corsette went missing. The two met in person for the first time on Valentines Day, and Corsette spent the day with him at his duplex in St. Petersburg before returning to her grandmother's home.

The following day, she went back to Gress's home, where she stayed for nearly a week. During this time, tensions arose when Gress and Brandes accused the victim of stealing her ring.

This led to a violent confrontation during which Corsette was allegedly held captive and brutally tortured.

The police found that in the course of seven days, Corsette endured relentless abuse, including physical beatings. She was ultimately suffocated by forcing a billiard ball into her mouth and wrapping her face with plastic, ABC reported.

Investigators believe that Corsette was murdered sometime between February 20 and February 24.

After killing her, Gress and his reported partner allegedly transported Corsette's body to a home on Mallory Drive in Largo and police later found evidence suggesting her body was dismembered there.

Gress and Brandes then allegedly drove the remains to Ruskin in Hillsborough County and dumped them in a dumpster at 2893 14th Ave, SE.

On March 6, a witness contacted police with critical information about a possible kidnapping and homicide.

The police statement revealed that at the time of the witness report, Gress was already in jail on different charges.

For Corsette's alleged murder, Gress is currently facing a kidnapping charge. However, the police clarified that the investigation was still active and more changes were expected.

Hamas on Sunday condemned Israel's decision to cut off electricity supply to the strife-torn Gaza, accusing it of ""cheap and unacceptable blackmail"" over its move which, the militant group said was made in an effort to pressure them into releasing hostages.

Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas' political bureau said in a statement, ""We strongly condemn the occupation's decision to cut off electricity to Gaza, after depriving it of food, medicine, and water."" Al-Rishq further described Israel's move as a ""desperate attempt to pressure our (Hamas) people and their resistance through cheap and unacceptable blackmail tactics"".

Earlier, Israel ordered an immediate halt to Gaza's electricity supply, apparently in a bid to pressurise the Palestinian militant group into releasing hostages, even though it is preparing to hold fresh talks on the ceasefire negotiations.

Israel's move comes just a week after it blocked all the aid supplies to the war-torn territory, a move which brings back the earlier memories of Israel's ""siege"" announcement on Gaza.

The truce deal's initial phase concluded on March 1 and both sides have refrained from returning to an all-out war, even though violence including an air strike struck Sunday that Israel said targeted militants.

Meanwhile, Hamas has been repeatedly calling for an immediate resumption of the negotiation talks on the second phase of the ceasefire deal, which was mediated by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt, aiming to end the war permanently.

Israel said that it prefers extending phase one until mid-April, and paused aid to Gaza over the impasse.

On Sunday, Energy minister Eli Cohen said in a video statement, ""I have just signed the order to stop supplying electricity immediately to the Gaza Strip. We will use all the tools at our disposal to bring back the hostages and ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza the day after"" the war.

Notably, Israel had cut electricity supply to Gaza days after a war broke out with Hamas after the October 7, 2023 attack. It had only restored the supply in mid-2024.

The sole power line between Israel and Gaza supplies the main desalination plant, and Gazans mainly rely now on solar panels and fuel-powered generators to produce electricity.

Now, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians live in tents across Gaza, with night-time temperatures now predicted to be around 12 degrees Celsius.

Saturday Night Live poked fun at President Donald Trump's this week's cabinet meeting, where he purportedly told secretaries that they were in command of their departments, not Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

SNL set the scenario in the Oval Office in the cold-open sketch for episode 14 of the 50th season, where Trump (James Austin Johnson) was trying to resolve the alleged disagreement between Musk (Mike Myers) and Rubio (Marcello Hernández) during the March 6 cabinet meeting.

According to reports, Rubio is upset with Musk for essentially dismantling the US Agency for International Development with the help of Department of agency Efficiency, which has endangered billions of dollars in government funding and led to firing of staff.

Rubio blasted Musk's “total access to our government” in the episode, pointing out that Trump had fired air traffic controllers and asserting that Musk's accomplishment as a businessman “does not mean he should run the country.”

Trump then defend Musk and lauded his efforts on DOGE, asking the Tesla CEO to “work things out” with the Secretary of State.

Musk then claimed that Rubio was “good on TV,” implying that he is merely a departmental figure. However, Trump backed the state secretary, saying that he was performing a “great job.”

The Trump character went on to say, “Elon knows a lot about air travel — he runs SpaceX, which is doing incredible things in terms of explosions and with regard to rocket debris.” This was in reference to SpaceX's unsuccessful launch on Thursday, which caused a 400-foot spacecraft to undergo a ""rapid unscheduled disassembly.""

Trump, who was mediating the argument between the two, stated that Musk needed to “begin acting like mature adults”. “Marco, Get your budget under control,” Trump said, asking Musk to “stay in your lane”. The billionaire then remined that he “is the boss” as he “paid Trump $300 million.”

“And that's why you're the boss,” Trump said. “We’ll get out of your office.”

SNL's cold-open comes just after a story in The New York Times report that Musk criticized Rubio of not terminating enough of his employees during Thursday's cabinet meeting. In response, Rubio mentioned that over 1,500 employees agreed to buyouts.

In a Truth Social post, Trump denied rumors of Musk and Rubio's disagreement, writing: “ELON AND MARCO HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. ANY STATEMENT OTHER THAN THAT IS FAKE NEWS!!! DJT.”

The United States Secret Service critically injured a man in Washington, D.C., near the White House on Sunday morning following an “armed confrontation.”

The individual, later identified as, Andrew Dawson, a 27-year-old Indiana resident, had already been on the radar of local law enforcement before the shootout.

Dawson was carrying both a knife and a firearm when he was confronted by Secret Service agents just after midnight, just one block away from the West Wing, per New York Post.

Dawson, a resident of North Manchester, Indiana—located approximately 100 miles north of Indianapolis—was described as being “suicidal” before travelling to the Washington, D.C., area, based on intelligence provided by Indiana authorities. Cops suspect that his intention was to commit “suicide by cop.”

The shooting took place near the Eisenhower Executive Office Building after agents, responding to an alert, confronted him. “As officers approached, the individual brandished a firearm, and an armed confrontation ensued, during which shots were fired by our personnel,” Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said.

Dawson was transported to a hospital in Washington, D.C. Guglielmi later also confirmed, “There were no reported injuries to Secret Service personnel.”

Notably, the Secret Service confirmed that President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and was not present at the White House, per Reuters.

For now, “The incident is under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department Internal Affairs Division’s Force Investigations Team,” the Secret Service said.

Baba Ramdev, yoga guru and the co-founder of FMCG giant Patanjali, lambasted US President Donald Trump on Sunday, saying the latter has been promoting “tariff terrorism”. Referring to the US president's push to impose reciprocal tariffs on other nations, Ramdev claimed Trump has been bullying the poor and developing nations by unleashing a new “era of intellectual colonisation”.

""There is a new era of intellectual colonization. Amid this, ever since Donald Trump rose to power, he created a new world record of 'tariff terrorism'. He has ripped off democracy by threatening poor and developing nations... This is 'economic terrorism'... He is taking the world to a different era... In such a case, India needs to develop... All Indians should unite to build a strong nation and answer all these destructive powers,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI in Maharashtra's Nagpur.

He said amid dangerous situations, India needs to become developed as some powerful nations want to take the world towards destruction.

Since taking office less than two months ago, Trump has rolled out hefty import taxes on goods coming from America's three biggest trading partners — Mexico, Canada and China.

However, after talks, Trump granted a one-month exemption on his new tariffs impacting goods from Mexico and Canada for US automakers. He plans to impose reciprocal tariffs from April 2.

Trump's on-and-off tariff announcements sparked uncertainty in the global financial markets, including in India, leading to volatility.

Ramdev on Sunday condemned vandalism at a Hindu temple in California and said India should take the initiative in finding a way to curb ""religious terrorism"".

""The entire world is suffering due to this religious terrorism. All the heads of different countries need to find a way out of this, and India should take an initiative for this,"" he told PTI.

To another question pertaining to Aurangzeb, Ramdev said the Mughal king could not be an ideal for the people of India.

""He belonged to a family of robbers. Be it Babur or his family, they came to loot India. They tortured thousands of our women. They cannot be our ideals...Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is our ideal,"" he added.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have now been dating for almost a year and a half, which has surprised many, including Bill Maher. On Friday's episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, the comedian made a joke about how long their relationship has lasted, pointing out Swift's history of shorter flings.

During the episode, Maher said, “This world is so upside down now. It took [President] Trump three weeks to break up with Ukraine and Mexico and Canada, but Taylor Swift has had the same boyfriend for over a year,” as reported by Fox News. The comedian killed to birds with one stone as he criticised Trump’s diplomatic policies while also taunting the singer's short flings over the years.

The Lover singer’s relationship with Kelce is her second-longest relationship after she dates actor Joe Alwyn. Alwyn and Swift dates from May 2017 to April 2023 while her relationship with the tight-end player is believed to have begun in July 2023. Her romance with Calvin Harris also lasted over a year, beginning from March 2015 to May 2016.

Before dating Kelce, Swift had a history of short-lived relationships. She was with singer Matty Healy for just a month in 2023, and in 2016, she dated actor Tom Hiddleston for about five months. The Bad Blood also had brief romances with Harry Styles, from November 2012 to January 2013, and actor Jake Gyllenhaal in late 2010.

Earlier that year, she ended relationships with musician John Mayer and actor Taylor Lautner, both of which had been brief. Swift's first high-profile relationship was with Joe Jonas, lasting from July to October 2008.

The relationship between Swift and Kelce became a major talking point in the fall of 2023, dominating sports headlines. Her frequent appearances at Kansas City Chiefs games drew massive attention, with her presence often taking centre stage during broadcasts and sparking widespread discussion on social media.

However, she also pissed off some longstanding fans of the NFL as she was booed at the Super Bowl 2025 where she made an appearance to support her boyfriend playing for Kanas City Chiefs who lost the game.

A video of an Indian man calling out fellow Indians' behaviour in public spaces is going viral on social media. In the clip, Instagram user Ankush captured an incident that took place at the lounge of Abu Dhabi Airport. He showed an Indian man talking loudly on his phone and said that the man continued to speak at high volume, despite being told by the bartender to lower his voice. He questioned the lack of civic sense among Indians in general. He claimed he's come across similar instances that highlighted an apparent insensitivity towards others in public spaces. The Instagram user also compared the behaviour of Indians in public spaces with that of people from countries like the US and South Korea, where such loud conversations in public are rare. 

""What do you think about people who talk loudly on their phones in public spaces without considering those around them? I have to admit, I might be guilty of this too. Why do we do it? Here's a quick rant about someone in an airport lounge who just wouldn't lower their voice,"" Ankush captioned the post. 

Take a look below:

Since being shared, the video has accumulated more than 7,300 likes and nearly 140,000 views. The post triggered a wave of reactions from people online. 

""Absolutely agree with you. And we wonder why people annoy us,"" wrote one user. ""Absolutely right. No civic sense at all. What are the parents doing? It is their job to teach civic sense to the children,"" commented another. 

""Manners, etiquette and civic sense don't come naturally to most people unless they are taught to. And even after learning they continue to operate opposite to what they learn. It's the ""chalta hai"" attitude that continues to be prevalent. This paints everyone in the country as a bad tourist but they don't think beyond their actions,"" said a third user.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Chaos broke out in Romania’s capital Sunday evening as incensed supporters of the far-right populist Calin Georgescu protested the electoral body’s decision to reject his candidacy in a presidential election redo. He won the first round of last year’s race before a top court annulled the election.

The 62-year-old Georgescu filed his candidacy on Friday in the capital, Bucharest. The Central Election Bureau, also known by its Romanian acronym BEC, had 48 hours to register or reject it. 

It wasn’t immediately clear on what grounds his candidacy was rejected, but the BEC said that a full text of its decision would later be published on its website. The decision can be appealed at the Constitutional Court within 24 hours.

Hundreds of protesters gathered outside BEC’s headquarters to express anger over its decision, with many waving Romanian flags and chanting: “The last resort is another revolution!” Some protesters threw broken paving stones and other objects at the scores of riot police dispatched to the area, overturned a news vehicle and set a bush ablaze.

Georgescu reacted to the decision Sunday by calling it “a direct blow to the heart of democracy worldwide!” 

“I have one message left! If democracy in Romania falls, the entire democratic world will fall! This is just the beginning. It’s that simple!” he said in a post on X. “Europe is now a dictatorship, Romania is under tyranny!”




The BEC’s rejection came after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the first-round results two days before the Dec. 8 runoff, after allegations emerged that Russia had run a coordinated online campaign to promote the outsider, who ran as an independent.

The court’s unprecedented decision plunged the European Union and NATO member country into a protracted political crisis.

Last month, prosecutors launched a criminal investigation against Georgescu, accusing him of “incitement to actions against the constitutional order,” supporting fascist groups and false declarations of electoral campaign funding and asset disclosures.

Before the Nov. 24 election, Georgescu, who is under judicial control and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, had polled in single digits and declared zero campaign spending. Allegations quickly emerged of electoral violations and Russian interference. Moscow denied that it had meddled in the election.

Georgescu has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and questioned Ukraine’s statehood, but says that he’s not pro-Russia.

The first round of the rerun is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will follow on May 18. The deadline for presidential candidacy applications is March 15 at midnight.

George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, who had backed Georgescu’s bid, reacted to the BEC’s decision on Sunday by calling it “a new abuse and a continuation of the coup d’état.”

“Down with Ciolacu, down with the dictators!” he said in a post on Facebook, referring to Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu.

Since Romania canceled the election, Georgescu has become a cause célèbre among the far right, with support coming from prominent figures such as U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk, who have both strongly criticized Romania for annulling the vote.

Musk reacted to the BEC decision in a repost of the news on X, saying: “This is crazy!”

Incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan also filed his candidacy on Friday as an independent under the campaign slogan “Honest Romania.” The BEC registered his candidacy on Sunday. 

Crin Antonescu, the joint presidential candidate backed by Romania’s governing coalition — comprised of the Social Democratic Party, the National Liberal Party, and the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party — also registered his presidential bid on Sunday.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, officials said Sunday, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory. Hamas called it part of Israel’s “starvation policy.”

Israel last week suspended supplies of goods to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of the war. 

Israel is pressing the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.

Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.

The militant group — which has warned that discontinuing supplies would affect the hostages — said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position.

Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday in an effort to “advance” the negotiations.

Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The letter from Israel’s energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza.




The territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam said that Israel has ”practically” cut off electricity since the war began and called the latest decision part of Israel’s “starvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.”

The desalination plant was providing 18,000 cubic meters of water per day for central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah area, according to Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement. Executive director Tania Hary said that it’s expected to run on generators and produce around 2,500 cubic meters per day, about the amount in an Olympic swimming pool.

Israel’s restrictions on fuel entering Gaza have a larger impact, Hary said, and water shortages are a looming issue, because fuel is needed for distribution trucks.

Israel has faced sharp criticism over suspending supplies. 

“Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,” the U.N. human rights office said Friday.

The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used “starvation as a method of warfare” when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide.

Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the United Nations’ inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid.

The leader of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid doesn’t resume to Gaza. The Houthis described their earlier attacks as solidarity with Palestinians there.

The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies.

The White House on Wednesday made the surprise confirmation of direct U.S. talks with Hamas.

On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. The militant group has previously called disarming unacceptable.

A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss contacts with the U.S., said that the group had expressed its longstanding position that it would lay down its arms in return for a “fair and just solution” that includes an independent Palestinian state.

Boehler also told CNN that “I think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they’re not part of the political party going forward. I think that’s a reality. It’s real close.”

When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, “You never know.”

He added: “I think something could come together within weeks,” and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones. Boehler has said four of the five American hostages in Gaza are dead, with Edan Alexander alive.

Hamas on Sunday didn’t mention the talks, but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections.

Hamas’ attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements.

Many Israelis are pressing for a deal to bring everyone home. “We are here to send a clear message to the Israeli government: stop stalling,” Zahiro Shahar Mor, nephew of slain hostage Avraham Munder, said in front of tents set up outside Israel’s defense ministry in one demonstration.

Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t say how many of the dead were militants.

With the cutoff of supplies to Gaza, Palestinians are reporting sharp price increases for dwindling items during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

“Since the ceasefire began, the situation has improved a little. But before that, the situation was very bad,” said Fares al-Qeisi in the southern city of Khan Younis.

AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Syria’s top diplomat and his counterparts from neighboring countries Sunday called for the lifting of Western-led sanctions on Syria and post-war reconciliation. 

The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon made their remarks alongside Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani following a meeting in the Jordanian capital Amman. 

They come following days of clashes between Syrian security forces and insurgents of the minority Alawite community loyal to the deposed Bashar Assad government in Syria’s coastal province. Some rights groups say hundreds of civilians, mostly Alawite, were killed in revenge attacks after the fighting broke out. The Associated Press could not independently verify those numbers.

The United States and Europe have been hesitant to lift sanctions on Syria before there is a clear political transition that is democratic and inclusive of Syria’s minorities and civil society. At the same time, the country desperately needs money to rebuild after years of war and pull millions out of poverty. The United Nations estimates that some 90% of Syria’s population lives in poverty.

“We are protecting all components of the Syrian people, and we do not discriminate between them. We will not allow the repetition of the tragedies of the Syrian people,” said al-Shibani.

Syria’s new Islamist authorities under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa have struggled to convince the United States and Europe to lift sanctions to start rebuilding the country after 13 years of war and reconcile with the Kurds in the northeast and Druze in the south to exert state authority across the country. 




The weekend’s violence appears likely to stymie attempts to remove sanctions in the immediate future. The U.S. and U.N. released statements condemning the killing of civilians, which U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as being carried out by “radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis.” He called for Damascus to hold the perpetrators accountable.

Also on Sunday, al-Sharaa announced the formation of a committee tasked with investigating the violence in coastal communities, including “violations against civilians” and another one tasked with “maintaining civil peace.”

Al-Sharaa said in a video statement that the outbreak of violence was part of “attempts by remnants of the former regime, with foreign parties behind them, to create new strife and drag our country to a civil war, with the goal of dividing it and destroying its unity and stability.”

He said the country’s new authorities “will not tolerate the remnants of Assad who committed crimes against our army forces and state institutions” and promised to “hold accountable with all firmness and without leniency anyone who was involved in the blood of civilians or harmed our people.”

It remained to be seen whether those measures will succeed in calming the situation and reassuring both Syrians and the international community.

Syria’s neighbors fear that the country’s pulverized economy and internal tensions could impact their own stability.

“Stability in Syria requires dialogue with the country’s various components,” said Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein at a joint news conference.

The foreign ministers were critical of what they said was foreign intervention in the region after Israeli troops conducted military operations in southern Syria and seized a U.N. buffer zone that divides Syria from the Golan Heights, which Israel seized and annexed in 1967. On Sunday, the Israeli commanding officers visited and assessed the buffer zone. 

Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan welcomed the “historic” meeting and called for cooperation to decrease tension in Syria, and said he alongside others will work against sleeper cells belonging to the extremist Islamic State group and affiliates of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party in Syria and Iraq.

“This is a regional problem. Regardless of our ideals we should all combat IS as well as the PKK, they are both terrorist entities,” he added.

Iraq’s foreign minister warned that IS sleeper cells are growing in numbers.

“We need to take the initiative first in exchanging views and information about (the Islamic State group’s) latest operations and especially their expansion not only on the Syrian borders with Iraq and Jordan but also their expansion in the Syrian land,” said Hussein.

Associated Press writers Kareem Chehayeb and Abby Sewell in Beirut and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed to this report.

Homeland security secretary pledges lie detector tests for employees she suspects are passing information to press

Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday announced new leadership at the agency tasked with immigration enforcement as she also pledged to step up lie detector tests on employees to identify those who may be leaking information about operations to the media.

Noem confirmed, in addition, that the government will expand immigration detention operations further into the military sphere, following reports of the intention to use the huge Fort Bliss army base close to the US-Mexico border in Texas for that purpose.

“There is, yes, a plan to use the facility at Fort Bliss for detention,” she said.

The secretary also warned that her department has “just weeks” before running out of money for its mass deportation mission unless Congress ups funding.

“The authorities that I have under the Department of Homeland Security are broad and extensive, and I plan to use every single one of them to make sure that we’re following the law, that we are following the procedures in place to keep people safe and that we’re making sure we’re following through on what President Trump has promised,” Noem told Face the Nation on CBS.

While these polygraph exams are typically not admissible in court, they are frequently used by federal law enforcement agencies and for national security clearances.

White House officials have previously expressed frustration with the pace of deportations, blaming it in part on recent leaks revealing cities where authorities planned raids.

This despite the department’s publicity blitz about raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), invitations to journalists to accompany agents and also witness deportation flights and questions about the facts Ice is issuing and the justifications they are using for arresting, detaining and deporting some of those affected.

Todd Lyons, the former assistant director of field operations for the agency’s enforcement arm, will serve as acting Ice director. Madison Sheahan, secretary of the Louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries and Noem’s former aide when she was governor of South Dakota, has been tapped to be the agency’s deputy director.

The leadership changes come after Ice’s acting director Caleb Vitello was reassigned on February 21 for failing to meet anti-immigration expectations, Reuters reported. Two other top immigration enforcement officials were reassigned February 11.

The Trump administration deported 37,660 people during the president’s first month back in office, DHS data first reported by Reuters last month show, far less than the monthly average of 57,000 people removed from the US in the last full year of Joe Biden’s administration.

Arrest rates were higher than usual in the first few weeks of the Trump administration, a Guardian analysis showed, but arrests and detentions do not always translate into removals and, at the same time, the numbers of people crossing the US-Mexico border without authorization has dropped dramatically since last summer, first under new Biden restrictions and now further under Trump.

Noem said on Friday that the agency planned to prosecute two “leakers of information”.

On Sunday, she said these two people “were leaking our enforcement operations that we had planned and were going to conduct in several cities and exposed vulnerabilities”. She said they could face up to 10 years in federal prison. A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

President downplays recent stock market volatility that followed his ducking and weaving over tariff policy

Donald Trump on Sunday refused to rule out the possibility that the US economy will head into recession this year and that inflation will rise, as his chaotic trade tariffs policy cause uncertainty and market turbulence.

The US president predicted that his economic goals would take time and a period of transition to bear fruit. But when asked in an interview with the Fox News show Sunday Morning Futures “are you expecting a recession this year?” he demurred.

“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing. And there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,” Trump said.

When asked whether he thought his tariffs on US imports would fuel inflation, he said: “You may get it. In the meantime, guess what? Interest rates are down.”

He downplayed recent stock market volatility that followed his ducking and weaving over tariff policy on exports from Canada, Mexico and China and similar threats to other countries, despite his usual fixation with market performance in relation to the politics of the day and an appetite to claim credit when stocks rise on his watch.

“You have to do what’s right,” he said.

Last week the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested that the US economy is on course to contract in the first quarter, triggering fears a recession could hit the world’s largest economy if weakness persisted and fueling stock market jitters.

In 2018 Trump posted on Twitter, now X, that “trade wars are good, and easy to win”, a view that is not widely shared by financial and economic experts.

On Sunday, however, he was cautious overall after boasting throughout his election campaign of the swift gains his policies would bring for the US economy and ordinary Americans’ finances.

Fox News Sunday Morning Futures anchor Maria Bartiromo introduced the topic of recession by telling Trump “look, I know you inherited a mess”, even though most experts agree that predecessor Joe Biden, a Democrat, left the Republican president a stable economy where inflation, although painfully high for a long time, was continuing to come down and international trading conditions for the US were steady.

Meanwhile, also on Sunday morning, NBC’s Meet the Press TV politics show was interviewing US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.

He pushed back on concerns that the prospect of Trump’s global tariffs would cause a recession in the US. “Absolutely not,” he said. “There’s going to be no recession in America.”

Lutnick added: “Anybody who bets against Donald Trump, it’s like the same people who thought Donald Trump wasn’t going to win a year ago … you are going to see over the next two years the greatest set of growth coming from America … I would never bet on recession, no chance.”

Human rights commissioner calls for investigation into ‘extremely disturbing’ attacks in Latakia province

The UN has condemned what it called “extremely disturbing” reports of entire families being killed in north-west Syria as clashes between security forces and Assad regime loyalists resulted in the country’s highest death toll since the start of its revolution in 2011.

The UN commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, called on Sunday for investigations into the killings and for perpetrators to be held accountable. “We are receiving extremely disturbing reports of entire families, including women, children and hors de combat [surrendered] fighters, being killed,” he said in a statement. “The killing of civilians in coastal areas in north-west Syria must cease, immediately.”

Fighting began on Thursday after fighters loyal to the ousted Assad regime ambushed security forces in Jableh, in the coastal Latakia province, sparking a wave of revenge attacks, including against civilians belonging to the minority Alawite sect. Clashes erupted once again on Sunday after security forces were attacked by Assad loyalists at a power plant in Banias, Latakia.

To crush the rebellion, the Syrian government called for reinforcements, with thousands of fighters converging on Syria’s coast from all over the country. Though fighters are nominally under the auspices of the new Syrian government, militias still persist, some of which have been implicated in past human rights abuses and are relatively undisciplined.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said that more than 1,000 people had been killed in the attack, including 745 civilians, 125 members of Syrian security forces and 148 Assad loyalists.

Death tolls from the two days of fighting varied wildly, with a second rights group, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) saying 148 civilians were killed by Assad loyalists and 327 civilians and captured militants were killed by Syrian security forces.

The Syrian government has not released figures for casualties, and the Guardian has not been able to independently verify the number of deaths.

On Sunday, Syria’s transitional president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, said the developments were within “expected challenges” and called for national unity. “We have to preserve national unity and domestic peace; we can live together,” he said in a video circulated by Arab media, speaking at a mosque in his childhood neighbourhood of Mazzah in Damascus.

Later on Sunday, the Syrian presidency announced the formation of a seven-person committee, comprising judges and one lawyer, tasked with investigating the killings of civilians and security forces in north-west Syria. The committee, which was formed to “achieve civil peace and uncover the truth”, will issue a report with its findings in 30 days.

The wide-ranging, coordinated assault was the biggest challenge to the country’s Islamist authorities, three months after opposition fighters led by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) toppled Bashar al-Assad.

The Syrian government has said “individual actions” led to the killing of civilians and that the influx of fighters on the coast had led to human rights violations.

An adviser to Syria’s foreign ministry estimated that 4,000 Assad loyalists were involved in the attacks. Videos showed the bodies of Syrian security officers strewn on the streets as well as bodies seemingly buried hastily in a mass grave in the coastal province of Tartus. The Guardian was unable to independently verify the contents of these videos.

In his statement, Türk said: “There are reports of summary executions on a sectarian basis by unidentified perpetrators, by members of the caretaker authorities’ security forces, as well as by elements associated with the former government.”

The wave of revenge killings, mostly targeting Alawites, by Syrian security forces in Syria’s coastal communities has struck fear into the Alawite community. The Syrian coast is heavily populated by the sect, from which the deposed Syrian president hailed, though most Alawites were not associated with the Assad regime.

Videos showed the bodies of dozens of people in civilian clothes piled up in the town of al-Mukhtariya, where more than 40 people were killed at one time, according to the SNHR.

Other videos showed fighters in security uniforms killing people point-blank, ordering men to bark like dogs and beating captives. The Guardian was not able to independently verify these videos.

A man from the town of al-Sanobar, Latakia, detailed how gunmen killed at least 14 of his neighbours who were all from the Arris family, including a 75-year-old father and his three sons in front of the mother.

“After they killed the father and his boys, they asked the mother to take her gold off, or they would kill her,” said the man who was close to the family but spoke under the condition of anonymity for his safety.

Another person in Latakia said power and water to the area had been cut off for the past day and they had been sheltering in their house, scared of the militants on the streets. “There’s no water and no power for more than 24 hours. The factions are killing anyone who appears in front of them; the corpses are piled up in the streets. This is collective punishment,” they said.

Rights groups said a real commitment to transitional justice and an inclusive government was crucial to preventing Syria from spiralling into a cycle of violence. Syria’s transitional authorities are due to announce a new government this month, which will be scrutinised closely for how representative it is of Syria’s religious and ethnic diversity after this week’s violence.

Syria’s new authorities will probably face more difficulties in getting international sanctions lifted, particularly US sanctions, after the wave of violence on Syria’s coast. Damascus has been courting international powers to help its beleaguered economy by removing sanctions, which are seen as one of the main obstacles to the country’s stability.

Western powers have stressed that respect for the country’s minority populations will be key to removing economic sanctions.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, condemned the attacks, which he said were committed by “radical Islamic terrorists” and called for Damascus to hold the perpetrators accountable. “The United States stands with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite and Kurdish communities, and offers its condolences to the victims and their families,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Far-right supporters of the candidate claim decision is undemocratic and Elon Musk describes his ban as ‘crazy’

Romania’s central election authority has barred far-right pro-Russia candidate Călin Georgescu from running in May’s presidential election re-run.

The rejection of his candidacy, which was announced on Sunday evening and was condemned by far-right party leaders as undemocratic, can be challenged at the constitutional court.

Dozens of supporters of the populist Georgescu gathered outside the election bureau shouting “Freedom” and briefly tried to force their way through the security cordon.

Georgescu submitted his candidacy for the May ballot re-run on Friday amid doubts that he would be allowed to run.

Romania’s highest court annulled the ballot two days before the second round of voting in December, citing allegations of Russian interference in Georgescu’s favour, which Moscow has denied.

Members of US President Donald Trump’s administration called Romania’s cancelled election an example of European governments suppressing freedom of speech and political opponents.

Tech billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk called the election authority’s decision “crazy” on his social media platform X.

Georgescu is under criminal investigation on six counts, including membership of a fascist organisation and communicating false information about campaign financing. He has denied all wrongdoing.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

TTT therapy burns away nodules that lead to salt buildup in body, which increases risk of stroke or heart attack

Half a million people in the UK with dangerously high blood pressure – a “silent killer” that causes tens of thousands of deaths a year – could be cured by a new treatment.

Doctors have developed a technique to burn away nodules that lead to a large amount of salt building up in the body, which increases the risk of a stroke or heart attack.

The breakthrough could mean people with primary aldosteronism – which causes one in 20 cases of high blood pressure – no longer have to have surgery or spend their lives taking the drug spironolactone to lower their risk of a stroke or heart attack.

People with primary aldosteronism develop nodules on one or both of their adrenal glands. They sit beside the kidneys and make three key hormones: adrenaline, cortisol and aldosterone. Nodules, which can develop on one or both glands, produce excess amounts of aldosterone, a steroid hormone which regulates how much salt the body retains instead of using the kidneys to flush it away. The retained salt then gives someone high blood pressure or hypertension.

Primary aldosteronism can send someone’s blood pressure as high as 200/130, far above the 120/80 level doctors say is healthy, increasing the probability they may suffer a fatal cardiovascular event. It can be challenging to treat because some patients do not respond well to standard blood pressure medications and thus remain at heightened risk of death.

Doctors in London and Cambridge have developed the innovative treatment, which is called targeted thermal therapy (TTT) or endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation. It could “transform” the lives of patients and cure that type of high blood pressure by using short bursts of intense heat from a needle to destroy the nodules, medics involved say.

It takes only 20 minutes, is done under sedation and allows the patient to go home that day, whereas surgery to remove an adrenal gland takes one and a half to two hours and involves the patient having a general anaesthetic and a two or three-night stay in hospital.

A trial of TTT in 28 patients with primary aldosteronism reported in The Lancet last month provided “proof of principle”. Four patients were able to come off drugs altogether after undergoing the procedure while another 12 greatly improved their blood pressure or halved their drug intake, and it stopped the body producing too much aldosterone in three-quarters of participants.

“This procedure could potentially transform life for one in 20 people with high blood pressure by reducing their risk of stroke, heart attack and heart arrhythmias. They feel better, they have more energy, they are less depressed and they achieve a normal blood pressure without having to take a medication every day or having surgery,” said Prof Morris Brown, a co-author of the Lancet study and professor of endocrinology at Barts Health NHS trust in London.

Brown, who is also a professor of endocrine hypertension at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), said: “We have known about primary aldosteronism for 70 years but nothing has changed in how we manage it for 30 years. And now we are able to get away from cutting out an entire organ for the sake of a fingernail-sized nodule and hugely improve the lives of people who have high blood pressure for this particular reason.

“It’s very exciting when people who’ve had uncontrolled high blood pressure for years have this procedure and come home the same day and find that their blood pressure is back to normal literally the next day.”

Experts from QMUL, Barts, University College London Hospitals NHS trust, Cambridge University and Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge jointly developed TTT.

A further trial, involving 110 patients, is under way to test how TTT works.

Dr Pauline Swift, the chair of Blood Pressure UK, said the results of the 28-patient trial “are very encouraging. This minimally invasive technique appears to be safe and effective. There are potentially many individuals living with high blood pressure that may benefit from this new treatment.”

She added: “High blood pressure is often called the ‘silent killer’ because it usually presents no noticeable symptoms yet significantly increases the risk of serious health issues such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Humanitarian officials say move could hit already meagre water supply, as ceasefire talks grow increasingly chaotic

Israel is to cut off any remaining electricity supplies to Gaza in an apparent attempt to ramp up pressure on Hamas amid increasingly chaotic multi-track negotiations over the fragile ceasefire in the territory.

The potential consequences of the Israeli decision for the 2.3 million residents of the devastated Palestinian territory are unclear, as most rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power.

But humanitarian officials in Gaza contacted on Sunday afternoon said they thought the two functioning desalination plants would be forced to shut down, reducing the already meagre supply of clean water. Others have suggested the remaining sewage treatment plant could be affected.

In a video announcing the directive, Eli Cohen, Israel’s energy minister, said that Israel would use “all means available … to ensure the return of all Israeli hostages” and that Hamas would not remain in Gaza after the war.

Israel is seeking to force Hamas to accept an extension until mid-April of the first phase of the ceasefire, which came into effect in mid-January but ended formally last weekend. Israel has already cut off all supplies of goods to the territory, claiming that Hamas was stealing aid and profiting from its distribution.

Israel has also intensified strikes in Gaza, while military officials have briefed local and international journalists that preparations for a major offensive are under way.

There are daily reports of casualties inflicted by Israeli warplanes, drones or artillery.

On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out an airstrike in northern Gaza, which a spokesperson said was aimed at militants “attempting to plant an explosive device in the ground in northern Gaza” near Israeli troops.

A day earlier, an airstrike in Rafah in southern Gaza targeted a drone that entered the territory from Israel and a group of suspected militants, according to the IDF.

Israel wants Hamas to release more of the 58 hostages the group and its allies in Gaza are believed to be holding. Fewer than half are thought to still be alive. Hamas has rejected any extension and wants an immediate start to negotiations on the ceasefire’s second phase, which aims to bring a permanent end to the war and was supposed to directly follow the first phase.

Representatives of the group met mediators in Cairo over the weekend, emphasising the urgent need to resume humanitarian aid deliveries to the territory “without restrictions or conditions”.

“We call on mediators in Egypt and Qatar, as well as the guarantors in the US administration, to ensure that [Israel] complies with the agreement … and proceeds with the second phase according to the agreed-upon terms,” the Hamas spokesperson, Hazem Qassem, told Agence France-Presse.

Hamas’s key demands for the second phase include further releases of Palestinians held in Israeli jails in exchange for hostages, a complete withdrawal of Israel from Gaza, a permanent ceasefire and the lifting of the Israeli blockade.

The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said it would send delegates to Doha on Monday to join talks on continuing the ceasefire in one form or another.

Complicating the picture further are unprecedented direct talks between the US and Hamas aimed primarily at freeing five US citizens among the hostages still held by Hamas. Only one is thought to be still alive.

The US envoy involved in the direct talks, which were revealed by US-based media last week, described on Sunday his meeting with Hamas as “very helpful” and said he was confident a hostage release deal could be reached “within weeks”. Speaking to CNN, Adam Boehler acknowledged it had been “odd” sitting face to face with leaders of a militant Islamist group that the US has listed as a terrorist organisation since 1997, but did not rule out further meetings.

Boehler said he understood Israel’s “consternation” that the US had held talks with the group, but said he had been seeking to jump-start the “fragile” negotiations. “I think something could come together within weeks … I think there is a deal where they can get all of the prisoners out, not just the Americans,” he added.

January’s truce paused more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza in which virtually the entire population was displaced, swaths of the territory were reduced to rubble and more than 48,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Israel’s military offensive. The war was triggered by Hamas’s surprise attack into Israel in October 2023, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 251 hostages taken.

The six-week first phase of the ceasefire led to the exchange of 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight others, for the release of about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It also allowed much-needed food, shelter and medical assistance to re-enter Gaza.

Since Israel subsequently cut off the aid flow, UN rights experts accused the government of “weaponising starvation”.

Last week, Donald Trump threatened further destruction of Gaza if all remaining hostages were not released, issuing what he called a “last warning” to Hamas leaders. The US president caused outrage in February when he said the US wanted to oversee the mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza to allow the territory to be reconstructed as the “riviera of the Middle East”. On Sunday Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, said that proposal was “taking shape”.

Smotrich said the government was planning to establish a “migration directorate” to assist residents of Gaza who wanted to leave the territory permanently.

Arab leaders have proposed an alternative plan under which Gaza’s reconstruction would be financed through a trust fund, with the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority returning to govern the territory.

At a weekend rally in Tel Aviv, family members of Israeli hostages demanded their government fully implement the ceasefire. “The war could resume in a week,” Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, told the crowd. “The war won’t bring the hostages back home. It will kill them.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Mikaela Shiffrin set an all-time World Cup record on Sunday with her 156th podium finish though she let victory slip away in the slalom in Are, Sweden.

Racing through steadily falling snow with a first-run lead, Shiffrin was only 25th-fastest in the second run to finish in third place, 0.19 seconds behind surprise winner Katharina Truppe. Katharina Liensberger placed second, trailing 0.05 behind her Austrian teammate, whose first career World Cup win was earned at the age of 29.

“Katharina Day!” Shiffrin said in the finish area as she hugged the two racers who beat her.

“I actually feel pretty good about it,” Shiffrin said of her fifth slalom race since her comeback from a serious crash in November. “I maybe wasn’t always perfect but I was pushing really hard.”

Shiffrin’s 156th top-three finish in her World Cup career broke a tie with Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark. Shiffrin also took the all-time wins record from Stenmark and has 100 victories to his 86.

Truppe has one win from her 181 World Cup starts, though she has three championship medals including the team event gold at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.

“It’s just: ‘Wow.’ I’m a little bit speechless,” said Truppe, who had been sixth-fastest in the morning run, trailing Shiffrin by 0.91. “First victory, it’s crazy. I will enjoy it and soak up all this emotion.”

Shiffrin needed to win on Sunday to earn 100 race points and stay in contention for a ninth career season-long slalom title. She missed four slalom races while recovering from her physical and psychological injuries sustained in November.

“I’m still trying to get the repetition back. I just have to keep practicing it,” she said.

With Olympic slalom champion Petra Vlhova skipping the entire season to recover from a knee injury, the door opened for a new World Cup title winner.

The World Cup season-ending last slalom is at Sun Valley, Idaho, on 27 March with four skiers ahead of Shiffrin and within 100 points of the lead to lift the crystal globe trophy.

Title-chasing contenders Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, the world championships gold medalist last month, were below their best form on Sunday and placed 10th and 11th, respectively.
 The 21-year-old Ljutic leads Rast in the slalom standings by 41 points and will win the title with a top-three result at Sun Valley. Liensberger, the 2021 champion, and Rast’s Swiss teammate Wendy Holdener could also win.

Shiffrin said she plans to train in Europe before the trip across seven time zones to Idaho.

“There’s certainly some travel challenges. It’s a really long distance,” she said. “I guess one more race this season for me but I’m looking forward to it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Claudia Sheinbaum has twice persuaded Trump to postpone tariffs. The low-key scientist’s success is helping her step out of her predecessor’s shadow.

MEXICO CITY — Tens of thousands of Mexicans poured into the country’s most important plaza on Sunday to cheer President Claudia Sheinbaum after she succeeded in one of the most daunting challenges in global politics: negotiating with Donald Trump.

The U.S. president on Thursday backed down on his plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian products “out of respect for President Sheinbaum,” he said. It was the second time in two months that the Mexican leader won a delay of the penalties.

Supporters of Sheinbaum’s party, top business leaders and ordinary citizens packed the capital’s iconic Zócalo on Sunday,  chanting “Mexico! Mexico!” in a sign of how the nation’s first female president has unified the population. Sheinbaum’s approval rating leaped from 70 percent when she took office in October to 85 percent last month, according to a poll by the newspaper El Financiero.

Politicians around the world, including the leaders of Ukraine, Colombia and Canada, have been upended in the riptide of Trump’s wrath. Sheinbaum, in contrast, has emerged from her encounters with the U.S. president “looking even and measured,” said Carin Zissis, a fellow at the Mexico Institute of the Wilson Center in Washington. “It has given her a global presence that is distinct.”

Sheinbaum has made significant concessions to Trump, sending 10,000 more troops to the border to deter fentanyl shipments and illegal migration — his stated reason for imposing the tariffs. She handed over 29 drug-cartel operatives in a massive operation involving 20 jets. But she hasn’t hesitated to challenge him, either.

“We cannot cede our sovereignty,” Sheinbaum told the massive, flag-waving crowd. “Nor can we let our people be hurt by decisions that foreign governments or powers make.”

As she has navigated Mexico’s most important bilateral relationship, analysts say, Sheinbaum has shaken off the image that she is merely a dutiful protégée of former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the founder of their leftist Morena party.

Sheinbaum still faces enormous challenges. Trump may call her a “very wonderful woman,” but his administration hasn’t ruled out U.S. military strikes on fentanyl targets in Mexico. He could cripple Mexico’s export-reliant economy with recurrent tariff threats and pressure on auto manufacturers to relocate to the United States.

“The uncertainty and volatility are going to remain,” said Julián Ventura, a former senior Foreign Ministry official. But Sheinbaum is among a handful of leaders — including Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer — who have built a constructive dialogue with Trump, Ventura said, adding: “It’s a win.”

Sheinbaum’s diplomatic skill has surprised Mexicans who viewed her mainly as López Obrador’s handpicked successor.

It’s not that Sheinbaum lacked her own political credentials — she served as Mexico City mayor and won  June’s presidential election by just over 30 percentage points.

But she has been criticized as a brainy technocrat who moved in lockstep with López Obrador, even imitating his country-boy drawl. The Mexican constitution prohibits presidents from seeking reelection. Nonetheless, López Obrador, known by his initials, AMLO, still wields enormous influence in the Morena party.

Analysts questioned whether Sheinbaum could replicate López Obrador’s friendly relationship with Trump. The two men sit at opposite ends of the political spectrum, but they bonded as charismatic founders of antiestablishment movements.

Sheinbaum, in contrast, is a low-key scientist with a Ph.D. in energy engineering. She can be so unemotional that her main rival in the presidential race, Xóchitl Gálvez, dubbed her the “Ice Lady.”

How has Sheinbaum succeeded with Trump?

She says she has benefited from AMLO’s warm relationship with the U.S. leader. But she has brought her own strengths to the job. She prepares rigorously for calls with Trump, aides say, consulting her cabinet ministers, business leaders and others, and studying the U.S. president’s statements. She doesn’t take umbrage at his insults, they say, and instead calmly lays out facts.

For example, after Trump said that he would go ahead with the 25 percent tariffs on March 4, alleging a lack of progress by Mexico and Canada on stopping cross-border fentanyl shipments, Sheinbaum sent him a graphic with data from the Department of Homeland Security. It showed U.S. seizures at the southern border plummeting since October. Less fentanyl was reaching the United States because it was being stopped in Mexico, Sheinbaum told Trump.

“He didn’t know about this graphic until we sent it to him,” she later told reporters.

In another call, Sheinbaum told Trump about the Mexican government’s publicity campaign to discourage fentanyl use. Trump was impressed. “You know, I make so many calls, and I never learn anything from anybody,” the U.S. president said last month. “And I spoke to this woman, as soon as she said it … I said, ‘Exactly, what a great idea.’” He soon announced a multimillion-dollar campaign of his own.

In both cases, the reality is a bit more complicated than how Sheinbaum portrayed it. Analysts say there are any number of possible reasons for the reduction in U.S. fentanyl seizures, including infighting in the Sinaloa cartel, a main trafficker of the opioid.

As for the ad campaign against fentanyl, it was largely designed to impress the U.S. government, said one prominent Morena official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. Mexico has no fentanyl-use epidemic.

Still, Sheinbaum has also made politically risky moves to assuage Trump’s concerns, starting when he first threatened to impose tariffs in early February. She has roughly doubled military forces at the U.S. border and handed over the 29 cartel leaders in an operation that legal scholars said violated Mexican law. Mexico has taken back not just its own migrants but also people from other countries deported from the United States.

Sheinbaum has proved to have a good sense of timing. While Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has quickly announced tit-for-tat tariffs following the U.S. threats, Sheinbaum has held off each time, seeking dialogue. As U.S. stock markets plunged and retailers warned of higher prices, the pressure mounted on Trump to call off the measures.

The Mexican government “built off that pressure without having to actually put out their own measures,” said John Creamer, a former senior U.S. diplomat in Mexico. The result? The Mexicans “don’t get Trump’s ire, the way the Canadians do.”

Morena holds majorities in both houses of Congress and a virtual lock on power, thanks largely to López Obrador’s popularity. Now, analysts say, Sheinbaum is coming into her own.

When asked in the February poll who exercises the most power in Mexico, 49 percent of respondents answered Sheinbaum, while only 11 percent answered López Obrador. (Roughly one-fourth of Mexicans replied “organized crime.”)

Sheinbaum’s expulsion of the 29 drug traffickers was a pivotal moment, political analyst Carlos Heredia said. “With this action, she essentially slammed her fist on the table and said, ‘I’m in command,’” he said.

Still, Mexico is probably facing a difficult period, with a slowing economy and growing wariness among investors. They have been spooked not just by possible tariffs but also by a judicial reform backed by Sheinbaum that is likely to reduce the independence of Mexico’s courts, analysts say.

Sheinbaum scheduled Sunday’s rally to announce her countermeasures to Trump’s tariffs. Once they were postponed, it turned into a victory celebration.

Luis Ramirez, 74, an electrician from Michoacán state who attended, said Sheinbaum “has all of our support.” But the negotiations with Trump continue. “As our president said, we need to stay serene and patient — very patient,” he said.

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the office would carry out the “massive logistical operation” needed to remove Palestinians from Gaza.

JERUSALEM — Israel will open an office under its Defense Ministry to manage the mass displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to other countries, far-right lawmakers said Sunday, as they pitched their mounting effort to depopulate the territory as being closely aligned with President Donald Trump’s own vision to “clean out” and redevelop the enclave.

The formation of the new office, which was not immediately confirmed by the Defense Ministry, would represent a tangible step toward implementing the highly controversial proposal voiced in February by Trump — and cheered on by Israel’s right wing — to remove Gazans, after 15 months of war and intense Israeli bombardment that have left the tiny territory in ruins.

At a public hearing on Sunday in Israel’s Knesset, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the new “Emigration Authority” would be co-led by the Defense Ministry and the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It would receive enough funding to carry out what he envisions as a “massive logistical operation” to find destination countries that will accept and employ Palestinians from Gaza, he said.

More than 2 million people currently live inside the Strip. Smotrich, who visited Washington last week, said he spoke to U.S. officials who backed the plan.

“Various officials in the [Trump] administration told me again and again, ‘We will not allow 2 million Nazis to live just beyond the fence,’” he said, referring to Palestinians. “Not too long ago, it was taboo to speak about people leaving Gaza, but now the people who were crazy are the most realistic,” Smotrich added. “Not only is it realistic, but it’s the only plan that’s realistic.”

The proposal, which would require the forced transfer of at least some of the population, has been likened to ethnic cleansing and has received heavy criticism from Arab countries. Last week, Arab leaders unveiled a competing plan for Gaza’s reconstruction — one that does not include the displacement of Palestinian civilians.

But right-wing Israeli lawmakers and experts who support the plan to remove Palestinians said at Sunday’s hearing that emigration from Gaza would be voluntary and that polls indicate most Gazans would choose to leave the territory if they could. When asked if Palestinians would be allowed to eventually return to Gaza, or if Jewish settlement would be allowed after the population leaves, some demurred.

Simcha Rothman, a lawmaker from the Religious Zionism party led by Smotrich, told reporters that the Arab counterproposal unveiled last week in Cairo is unacceptable to Israel because it would leave Hamas, the militant group that ruled Gaza, in place. The idea from Trump and Israelis to relocate Gaza’s residents abroad is realistic, Rothman argued, because they need jobs and many aging countries around the world need to import young laborers.

The Religious Zionism party, whose supporters often view Gaza as part of the land given to Jews by God and its settlement as a religious duty, has wielded significant influence within Netanyahu’s coalition government and has been one of the major voices calling for a resumption of war against Hamas.

The militant group that governs Gaza led a violent attack on communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and abducting more than 250 others. Israel responded with a punishing military operation that destroyed the enclave, displaced the majority of the population and killed more than 48,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.

On Sunday, Israel also announced that it would cut its supply of electricity to Gaza, about a week after a 42-day ceasefire expired March 1. Israel has provided almost no electricity to Gaza since the start of the war, but the largely symbolic announcement was applauded by the far right, which has argued for the near-total elimination of humanitarian aid, fuel and power supplies to ramp up pressure on Hamas and Palestinian civilians.

Several right-wing lawmakers said Sunday that the Gaza war presented a rare opportunity that must be seized by Israel.

“Things that seemed impossible for many years are now completely legitimate topics for policy initiatives,” said Yuli Edelstein, a Knesset member and the chair of the “Land of Israel” caucus, who has called for the annexation of Palestinian territory by Israel.

“We must not squander the opportunity to take the right steps toward the new Middle East we are discussing,” Edelstein said.

Humanitarian groups and some Arab nations, including mediators Qatar and Egypt, condemned Israel’s decision Sunday to halt the entry of all aid into war-battered Gaza. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Follow:


            Armed men loyal to the Syrian government carried out field executions and spoke of purifying the country, according to eyewitnesses and video, providing a gruesome picture of a crackdown against remnants of the former Assad regime that spiraled into communal killings.
    


            Syria has seen the worst outbreak of violence since the ousting of former President Bashar al-Assad late last year, after armed men descended on Alawite heartlands on Thursday in what Syrian authorities said was an attempt to put down an insurgency by rebels still loyal to the former government.
    


            A UK-based independent monitoring group, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), said that at least 642 people have died in the violence, including scores of civilians who were killed after government forces committed “widespread field executions” of young men and adults.
    


            Syria’s interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, on Sunday blamed the violence on the remnants of Assad’s forces and said his government would hold accountable anyone involved in the deaths of civilians.
    


            “We will not tolerate the remnants of Assad’s forces,” he said. “They have only one option: to surrender themselves to the law immediately.”
    


            He also called for national unity, describing the clashes as “expected challenges.” His office has ordered the formation of committees to investigate and engage with people in affected areas. CNN has approached the Syrian government for comment.
    


            “Armed men were moving from house to house attacking people as a form of entertainment… They declared jihad on us from all over Syria,” said one resident of the city of Latakia, who chose to remain anonymous through concern for the safety of their family still in the city.
    


            The resident, who fled the city Saturday after 30 years of living there, told CNN they started seeing dead bodies on the streets as early as Tuesday.
    


            “People were fleeing, those who couldn’t were killed,” Bashir, another resident of Latakia, told CNN. “My 70-year-old uncle, a history professor, and his 60-year-old wife were killed in cold blood at home,” he said. Both were Alawites residing in the city of Baniyas in the western Tartous province.
    


            “I fear for my life and the lives of my two children,” Bashir said.
    


            Armed men started heading en masse to Latakia and Tartous on Thursday night after reports of attacks by Assad loyalists against Syria’s new government forces stationed in the Alawite cities.
    


            Rasha Sadeq, a 35-year-old Alawite mother of three living in Homs, told CNN that she received a phone call over the weekend from her brother’s business partner, telling her that her mother and two brothers had been killed by armed groups loyal to the new government in Baniyas.
    


            “I was constantly in touch with my family; they told me there are gunfire sounds,” she said, adding that her family had said they also heard religious chants. Her family were civilians and not pro-Assad, she said.
    


            The Assad family, members of the minority Alawite sect, ruled Syria for over half a century until Bashar was ousted in December by Sunni Islamist militants who sought to reshape the country’s political and sectarian order. The group, led by former al Qaeda militant Ahmad al-Sharaa, promised political equality and representation to the various sects of Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious populations.

Hundreds reported killed in Syria clashes in worst violence since ouster of Assad regime



            Security remains a major challenge for the new administration. Syria’s Alawites – some 10% of the population – were prominent in the Assad regime, and while many Alawites have surrendered their weapons since December, many others have not.
    


            The attacks started this week after reports emerged that Assad loyalists had ambushed and killed members of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham – the rebel group that spearheaded the rebellion that ousted the former Syrian leader.
    


            “The Assad loyalists won’t be in the villages they attacked, these (armed men) were killing regular people in those villages,” Bashir told CNN.
    


            A Syrian government source told state media that “individual violations” had been perpetrated after “large, unorganized crowds” traveled to the area.
    


            The Syrian government told CNN on Saturday that at least 150 of its security forces had been killed since Thursday and 300 had been captured in clashes with Assad loyalists.
    


            CNN cannot independently confirm casualty numbers.
    


            Several videos appeared on social media showing convoys of armed men in vehicles heading to the cities of Latakia and Tartous in the run-up to the violence.
    


            “It was the battle for liberation. Now it’s a battle for purification (of Syria),” a narrator accompanying the armed convoys says. It’s unclear when exactly the video was filmed.
    


            “To the Alawites, we’re coming to slaughter you and your fathers,” a man in military fatigues said in what sounded like an Egyptian accent in one of the videos filmed at night.
    


            “Everyone is going out with guns, we will show you the (strength) of the Sunnis.” CNN has not been able to geolocate the video, which appears to show a large number of vehicles.
    


            Reports of horrific acts of violence soon started emerging. Videos geolocated by CNN showed dozens of dead bodies lying on the ground in the village of Al Mukhtareyah as people mourned.
    


            “These are the Alawite pigs,” a voice is heard saying before shooting an apparently lifeless body on open ground in another video. It was unclear where or when the shooting took place.
    


            Another video circulating on Syrian social media showed a man dressed in military fatigues pull up to a house on a motorcycle, and tell its resident to look at the camera before shooting him.
    


            “I caught you, cheeky,” the attacker says laughing. “Are you still not dead? You’re still not dead,” he says before shooting him again.
    


            In another, a man wearing military fatigues asks a captive to step outside a building, then tells him to bark like a dog before fatally shooting him.
    


            CNN could not verify either of these two videos, but they’re among several that emerged in recent days apparently showing killings on camera.
    


            The attacks raise major questions over the new Syrian administration which has made efforts to distance itself from its jihadist past.
    


            “What happened from three months ago until today, equals what the Assads did to us in five decades. The Assads were criminals, and these (new rulers) are also criminals,” Bashir said.

 Major centralized exchanges are exploring and implementing changes to the token listing process as the number of cryptocurrencies grows. 

Binance, the world's largest centralized exchange, has announced a community co-governance structure that allows Binance users to vote to list or delist tokens on the platform.

According to the announcement, Binance will select projects which the community can vote on. Tokens that receive the most votes will be listed on Binance following due diligence from the centralized exchange company.

Projects that fail to provide regular progress updates or necessary token information, engage in malfeasance, or have inactive developer teams and communities will be placed in the platform's ""monitoring zone.""

Once the projects are in the monitoring zone, Binance community members can vote to delist these projects from the platform.

The announcement follows an exponential increase in the amount of new cryptocurrency tokens and projects, which now number in the tens of millions.

CoinMarketCap featured less than 11 million cryptocurrencies on Feb 8. At the time of this writing, the number of unique digital assets listed on the website has swelled to 12.4 million.

Some market analysts believe that the rapid surge in new token listings competing for limited capital and investor attention has a dilutive effect on crypto prices and could even prevent altcoin season during this market cycle.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that Coinbase must rethink its token listing process, in a January 24 X post. Armstrong wrote:

""Regulators need to understand that applying for approval for each one is totally infeasible at this point as well,"" the CEO continued.

Armstrong ultimately concluded that the exchange needed to pivot to an ""allow-list"" and a ""block-list"" structure that partially relies on community reviews and onchain data to make determinations on which new projects to list on the US-based centralized exchange.

 Bots continue to be an issue for X users within the cryptosphere as they battle spam, impersonation accounts, and phishing links. 

Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) urged Elon Musk to ban bots — automated accounts that spam the social media site and are used to amplify content or for coordinated attacks — from the X platform.

""If someone uses Grok, ChatGPT, or DeepSeek to generate a tweet and copy and paste it here, fine, but API posting should be disabled,"" CZ wrote in a March 9 X post.

In a separate comment, the Binance founder differentiated automated social media bots from AI agents, saying that the latter was helpful in real-world applications such as booking hotels or writing code without having to socialize with them.

Automated bots are a well-documented problem on X that spam the site and are particularly active in the crypto sphere of influence — plaguing users with scam messages advertising fake tokens, phishing links to malicious sites, and pump-and-dump schemes.

The crypto community has been asking Musk to tackle the bot problem since he bought the platform in 2022. However, little has been done to curb the issue.

Musk has proposed several solutions to automated bots, including asking users to register a credit card that would incur a small fee of several cents to impose a cost on new account creation, preventing bot farms from mobilizing armies of fake accounts.

Often, these bots impersonate crypto influencers and industry leaders to peddle fake tokens or redirect users to malicious sites through phishing links designed to steal funds.

AI-powered chatbots have also supercharged romance scams. These scams feature a long time horizon where a threat actor pretends to have a romantic interest in their target to build up trust with the victim over time.

Once trust is sufficiently established, the malicious actor typically requests funds from the target either through feigning financial problems or pitching a fake investment scheme.

A 2023 study from the Network Contagion Research Institute also found that bots were responsible for manipulating altcoin prices by using coordinated posts from multiple bots to artificially pump prices.

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS

RAM: 16 GB DDR5

GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060

Storage: 1 TB SSD

Display: 16.1 in (41 cm)

Weight: 5.22 lbs (2.37 kg)

Dimensions (in): 14.5 x 10.2 x 0.9 (W x H x D)

Dimensions (cm): 37 x 25.9 x 2,3 (W x H x D)

The HP Omen 16 is undeniably a gaming laptop. The design and quality of the display all target hardcore players, and its multicolor keyboard is also a dead giveaway. Here we have the 2023 version, with AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor and Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060 GPU – a configuration only available in Europe. U.S. customers will only have Intel variants for 16in models.

A newer Omen 16 was announced at CES 2025 recently — the Omen Max 16 — so the lofty price of the old Omen has now been reduced from $1,600 to a more palatable $1,170. Regardless of its price, though, we want to know if it’s any good.

There have now been a decade's worth of HP Omen laptops, with very little stylistic change across the last few iterations. The 16.1-inch ‘xd0001na’ model we have on review is virtually the same as the 2022 model, save for a new polished Omen logo on the lid instead of the classic VoodooPC diamond. There’s also a large, shiny ""16"" emblazoned on the bottom half.

Nevertheless, the design is neat and understated, all in black and with a matte finish. It could be more lithe, more petite in places, but then it would no doubt be even more expensive. The all-plastic build is not ideal, but also not that much of an issue — you will leave plenty of finger smears, but they’re easy enough to wipe away with a cloth. There is some slight flex in the lid, though.

The bottom portion of the device is neatly laid out, with 70% of the available real estate taken up by the keyboard. You get a stunning multicolor backlit keyboard, with transparent key covers for W, A, S, and D. In the corners, there’s lots of space for palm rests, though there is an awkward reach to use the trackpad.

Both sides of the device have a wide array of ports, with three USB-A types (one with HP sleep charge) and slots for HDMI 2.1, ethernet and a 35mm headphone jack. Sadly there’s only one USB-C port, which is odd for a modern laptop, but it has Thunderbolt 4 support and also HP sleep charger capabilities.

The Omen 16 has a pleasingly smooth and vivid 16.1 in IPS display with a 165Hz refresh rate and a full HD resolution of 1,920 x 1080. The panel is crisp and sharp, and thankfully bright enough for even the murkiest of game worlds.

While that is true to the naked eye, our benchmarks suggest that the Omen’s display isn’t especially great. With our colorimeter, we recorded a peak brightness of 281 candela per square meter (cd/m2), which is actually quite low. That would suggest you’ll find it harder to see certain parts of the screen if you have a strong source of light in your room, though we didn’t really notice any issues here.

Likewise, its gamut color coverage (a measure of how many colors it can display) was a meager 91.40% — which is lower than one would expect of a modern gaming laptop. The Adobe sRGB score of 70% is more in line with its rivals but we would not recommend this machine for tackling serious Photoshop workloads.

The colors, however, pop off the screen and the refresh rate keeps everything smooth and liquid. This is partly down to the AI optimization that comes from the Ryzen 7 chip and that beefy Nvidia RTX GPU. So on paper it looks middling, but our eyes suggest otherwise.

The Omen 16 has a multi-zone backlit keyboard that can be customized. The default is three different sections; from left to right you have a portion in red, a middle section in purple, and a final section in light or neon blue. The three transparent keys all turn a funky shade of orange when the lights are on, though. The whole thing looks dramatic in the dark and you can swap the colors around, have one specific color across the whole thing, or have it change shades as you play, which is frankly a little distracting.

Still, there’s a satisfying punch to the keys, which are all nicely sized and responsive. We were able to get up to a good typing speed while hammering out emails and documents. There was also a pleasing ease to the gaming controls, with the W, A, S, and D buttons singled out with transparent key caps — you barely need to look down as you move about in Fortnite.

The trackpad, however, takes some getting used to, especially if you come to it from a smaller touchpad, such as you would find on a MacBook. The number of accidental right clicks we made increased by about 100%. It does have a nice, firm click action, and lots of scope, but if you’re used to using your right hand to click, you really do need to reach right across — it’s quite awkward.

The Omen 16 is powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS chip, which is paired with 16 GB of DDR5 RAM and 1 TB of storage. The Ryzen 7 has an up to 5.1 GHz max boost clock, 16 MB L3 cache, eight cores and 16 threads. It is a high-end 4nm processor and one of the best chips on the market for gaming.

The Omen notched up a CrystalDiskMark read score of 6,434.39, which places it as one of the more powerful HP laptops we’ve tested. Only the Spectre x360 14 and the AI-powered OmniBook Ultra 14 scored higher, and only by small margins.

However, while its performance is good, there’s only so much the Omen can take before its fans start to sound like the creaking air con in a cheap Vegas motel. Putting it through Geekbench 6 sounded like a form of laptop torture and its multi-core score of 9,239 isn’t especially good for this price range. Similarly priced HP models, such as the new OmniBook and EliteBook, will give you almost 50% more (14,153 and 14,035 respectively).

How much gaming you can do away from a power outlet is also debatable, due to the Omen’s weak battery. The 165Hz refresh rate, as wonderful as it is, is part of the problem here because you have a power-hungry display hogging what little juice the laptop can hold.

In our looped video test, with the laptop forced to repeatedly play the same 20 minutes of Spider-Man 2, it lasted a pitiful 4 hr, 53 mins. HP claims that it can last up to eight hours, which is true, but if you’re playing something quite big and graphically intense then it won’t get anywhere near that. A few rounds of Fortnite, maybe.

Thankfully, once depleted, the battery only takes an hour or so to reach full charge.

The ports are all neatly aligned, with two USB-A ports and slots for HDMI 2.1 and an ethernet connection in easy-to-reach places. It’s always good to have a 35mm headphone jack on a laptop, but that solo USB-C port does cause frustration. Thunderbolt 4 support is what people want — it makes everything easier to connect — so a second port here would be a real boon.

Feature-wise, you have the standard fare of Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) and Bluetooth 5.3, plus Windows 11 Home fresh out of the box. There’s a neat clip cover for the webcam. You also get crisp Bang & Olufsen DTS:X Ultra dual speakers, which have a nice hum to them, but these are hard to enjoy when those fans begin whirring.

You also get the Omen Gaming Hub pre-installed. One of the best features here is that you can monitor all your laptop's performance metrics, and it includes a clever booster tool. This looks like the rev counter on a car, but you can use it to max out the machine's performance.

✅ You're a hardcore gamer: Playing games is what this machine was designed to do — and what it's good at

✅ You're on a budget: This laptop looks like much better value for money after its asking price was recently slashed

❌ You like a quiet working environment: The noisy fans on the Omen 16 are a less than welcome distraction

❌ You're on the go a lot: Battery life isn't brilliant, which might rule out playing more graphics-intensive games for long periods

The answer to this has been made a lot simpler thanks to HP’s recent CES 2025 announcements and the more feature-rich Omen Max 16. With this better version coming out soon, HP has slashed the cost of the older model, from $1,600 to $1,170, making it more of a bargain than it was previously. This review would have been more scathing if it stayed at its original price.

For that cut price you get a snappy AMD Ryzen CPU, a powerful GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, a smooth display and an attractive keyboard. You also get poor battery life and loud fans that can be heard no matter what volume your music is playing. They keep the machine cool but their sound is impossible to ignore. Headphones are not included, but they darn well should be!

—Best laptops for coding & programming—Best laptops for photo editing—Best MacBooks for students—Best laptops for students

The question is whether there is anything better in this new price range. The newer Omen Max is practically double the price so that’s not comparable here. The Omen Transend is also considerably more expensive — both the 14in and 16in models — so price-wise, the Omen 16 is currently HP’s best offer.

Dell’s Alienware x16 R2 machine is roughly comparable, though it has Intel processor options, not AMD, and costs at least $400 more. However, it does benefit from a wider selection of Nvidia RTX GPU configurations (4060, 4070, 4080, and 4090).

If it’s gaming on a budget you want, however, then the Omen 16 is hard to beat right now.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

For the second time in his LIV Golf career -- and the second time in as many tournaments -- Sergio Garcia has won both individually and as a team captain. The Spaniard improved each day of LIV Golf Hong Kong with rounds of 65-64-63 to reach 18 under for the tournament and claim a three-stroke victory over Dean Burmester with Phil Mickelson rounding out the podium just one further adrift.

Garcia's individual title was accompanied by a team triumph as his Fireballs eked out a close victory over Stinger GC. Garcia's group tallied 37 under while Louis Oosthuizen's all-South African squad fell one short at 36 under. Cameron Smith's Ripper GC and Mickelson's HyFlyers finished at 34 under.

""I played very well. I gave myself a lot of chances throughout the whole day,"" Garcia said. ""I only made a couple bad swings, but I got away with them and recovered nicely. It was nice to see not only that I was doing well and leading the tournament, but my teammates were playing great. They were keeping us there with a chance to win. Obviously, when you can pull the double, it's a lot sweeter than if it's just one of them. Very proud of them.""

Garcia entered the final round in Hong Kong among three tied for the lead at 11 under. While co-leader Peter Uihlein struggled to keep pace, Garcia jumped head first into his round with an eagle on the par-5 3rd, the same hole that Dean Burmester eagled to begin his round.

The South African surged into Garcia's rearview mirror with five birdies across the back nine at Hong Kong Golf Club, but it proved to be too little too late as the Fireballs captain kept his foot on the gas pedal. After a string of pars, Garcia rattled off four straight birdies on Nos. 8-11 to seize a five-stroke lead and full control of the tournament.

One last birdie on the par-4 16th was just icing on the cake for his individual endeavors but much needed for the team competition. His teammate Luis Masaveu snagged a birdie on final hole to secure the team title and allow Garcia a stress-free walk up the last.

""It's still early. We still have a month to go,"" Garcia said regarding major championship season. ""We still have two big tournaments coming up in Singapore and Miami, so we've got to focus on that, and when we get to Augusta, then we'll focus on that. 

""Obviously, it's going to be a very special week for me because it's my 100th major, so I'm super proud of that. It's not a number that a lot of people get to achieve. I just want to have a lot of fun there no matter what happens, and that's my goal. But first, we've got next week and then we've got Miami, and then we'll focus on Augusta.""

A giant wave of undulating gas and dust appears, per new research, to have engulfed our Solar System millions of years ago.

As New Scientist reports, astrophysicists have discovered that the Radcliffe wave — a 9,000 light-year-long structure full of stars and the gas and dust needed to form new ones — seems to have swept over our entire Solar System around 14 million years ago.

Previous research into this fantastic galactic wave suggested that Earth passed through it some 13 million years ago, plunging our planet into ""a festival of supernovae going off,"" as Harvard astrophysicist Catherine Zucker told the Washington Post last year.

Now, University of Vienna doctoral student Efrem Maconi thinks that our whole Solar System may have passed through this incredible structure.

Using data from the European Space Agency's Gaia telescope, Maconi and his team identified recently-formed stars and the gases surrounding them within the Radcliffe wave to see how the structure itself appears to be moving.

Comparing that data to estimates about our Solar System's trajectory, the Vienna researchers found that the Sun and the Radcliffe wave were near each other between 12 and 15 million years ago. Ultimately, the scientists estimated that we moved through the wave roughly 14 million years ago. On a geological and even evolutionary scale, that's incredibly recent; the dinosaurs are believed to have gone exstinct around 66 million years ago.

Along with the finding, Maconi also told New Scientist that the sky would have looked very different to anyone looking out from Earth when our Solar System passed through the Radcliffe wave.

""If we are in a denser region of the interstellar medium, that would mean that the light coming from the stars to you would be dimmed,"" he explained. ""It’s like being in a foggy day.""

Extrapolating this finding even further, the scientists behind this discovery also think there's a chance that the Radcliffe wave played a role in the climate cooling that occurred in the Middle Miocene epoch, when temperatures plunged and permanent ice sheets were established. According to Ralph Schoenrich, an associate climate and physics professor at University College London, that may be a stretch.

""A rule of thumb is that geology trumps any cosmic influence,"" Schoenrich, who was not involved in the research, told New Scientist. ""If you shift continents or interrupt ocean currents, you get climate shifts from that, so I’m very skeptical you need anything in addition.""

The majority of official documents signed by President Joe Biden allegedly used the same autopen signature, reinvigorating concerns over the former president’s mental acuity and if he ""actually ordered the signature of relevant legal documents,"" a report published by an arm of the Heritage Foundation found.

""WHOEVER CONTROLLED THE AUTOPEN CONTROLLED THE PRESIDENCY,"" the Oversight Project, which is an initiative within the conservative Heritage Foundation that investigates the government to bolster transparency, posted to X on Thursday.

""We gathered every document we could find with Biden's signature over the course of his presidency. All used the same autopen signature except for the announcement that the former President was dropping out of the race last year. Here is the autopen signature,"" the group claimed on X, accompanied by photo examples.

Autopen signatures are ones that are automatically produced by a machine, as opposed to an authentic, handwritten signature.

'Embarrassingly Wrong': Liberal Media Figures Admit Being In Denial About Biden's Mental Decline

The Oversight Project posted three examples showing Biden’s signature, including two executive orders and the president’s announcement he was bowing out of the 2024 presidential race. The signature on the two executive orders, one of which was signed in 2022 and the other in 2024, showed the same signature that included what appeared to be a line, followed by ""R. Biden Jr.""

Biden’s signature on the document announcing his departure from the 2024 race varied from the other two posted by the Oversight Project, showing a signature that wasn’t as clear as the one on the executive orders.

Fox News Digital, at random, examined more than 20 Biden-era executive orders documented on the Federal Register’s office between 2021 and 2024 and found each had the same signature.

Lies About Biden's Age, Health During His Presidency Is A 'Scandal Of Epic Proportions,' Scott Jennings Says

Fox News Digital reached out to Biden’s office for comment on the Oversight Project’s findings on the autopen investigation, but did not immediately receive a reply on Sunday.

Fox News Digital also examined the signatures on President Donald Trump’s executive orders, which are often signed in public or in front of the media, during his first administration and second administration and found the signatures were also the same.

Biden and his administration, however, came under fierce concern and scrutiny over his mental acuity last year.

The year 2024 kicked off with Biden in the driver’s seat of the Democratic Party as he keyed up a re-election effort in what was shaping up to be a rematch against Trump. In February of that year, however, Biden’s 81 years of age and mental acuity fell under public scrutiny after years of conservatives questioning the commander in chief’s mental fitness.

Special counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents as vice president, announced he would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, calling Biden ""a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""

The report renewed scrutiny over Biden’s mental fitness, which rose to a fever pitch in June 2024 after the president’s first and only presidential debate against Trump.

Biden Insider Exposes How White House 'Gaslit' The Public About Former President's Decline

Biden faced backlash for a handful of gaffes and miscues in the days leading up to his ill-fated debate against Trump, including former President Barack Obama taking Biden’s wrist and appearing to lead him off a stage during a swank fundraiser, and also abroad when Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni guided Biden back to a group of world leaders when he appeared to wander off to give a thumbs-up to a parachutist during the G-7 summit.

When the big debate day arrived, Biden missed his marks repeatedly, tripping over his responses and appearing to lose his train of thought as he squared off against Trump. The disastrous debate performance led to an outpouring from both conservatives and traditional Democrat allies calling on the president to bow out of the race in favor of a younger generation.

Biden dropped out of the race in July, with the signature on that official document showing it was noticeably different from the signature on his EOs.

Republican Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey sent a letter to the Department of Justice on Wednesday of last week demanding an investigation be opened into whether Biden’s ""cognitive decline allowed unelected staff to push through radical policy without his knowing approval.""

""There are profound reasons to suspect that Biden's staff and political allies exploited his mental decline to issue purported presidential orders without his knowing approval,"" the letter read.

""Speaker Johnson, for example, reported that staff and elected officials – including former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer – tried to prevent Johnson from meeting with Biden,"" it continued.

Biden Ripped For ‘Old’ Appearance, ‘Weak’ Voice During First Presidential Debate: ‘Deeply Alarming’

""Though presidents always have gatekeepers, in Biden's case, the walls around him were higher and the controls greater, according to Democratic lawmakers, donors and aides who worked for Biden and other administrations. Staff limited Biden's ability to speak with others and limited the sources of information he consumed.""

The Oversight Project shared Bailey’s letter in its thread investigating Biden’s signature on official documents, in addition to an interview with Speaker Johnson, R-La., when he recounted that Biden didn’t remember signing an order freezing new liquid natural gas exports in 2024.

""I didn’t do that,"" the president said, Johnson recounted during an interview with the Free Press’ Bari Weiss in January.

""Sir, you paused it, I know. I have the export terminals in my state. I talked to those people in my state, I’ve talked to those people this morning, this is doing massive damage to our economy, national security,"" Johnson said he told the president at the time.

""I walked out of that meeting with fear and loathing because I thought, ‘We are in serious trouble – who is running the country?’"" Johnson said of the 2024 meeting.

""Like, I don’t know who put the paper in front of him, but he didn’t know,"" he added.

The Oversight Project continued in its findings that investigators should determine ""who controlled the autopen"" during the Biden administration.

""For investigators to determine whether then-President Biden actually ordered the signature of relevant legal documents, or if he even had the mental capacity to, they must first determine who controlled the autopen and what checks there were in place. Given President Biden's decision to revoke Executive Privilege for individuals advising Trump during his first Presidency, this is a knowable fact that can be determined with the correct legal process?"" the Oversight Project posted to X.

Biden Had No Idea He Signed Natural Gas Export Pause, Johnson Says

Concerns over Biden’s mental acuity when he was in office, combined with the Oversight Project’s findings, have sparked outrage among conservative social media users as they question if Biden personally signed the executive orders.

Melissa Peterman got emotional discussing her onscreen reunion with Reba costar Christopher Rich following his massive stroke.

“When he had a stroke, it was really scary — and I think a lot of people didn’t know,” Peterman, 53, exclusively told Us Weekly, noting that she might “tear up a little” as she talks about Rich. “I think fans just thought that, ‘Oh, maybe he retired and maybe he decided to take a break.’ That wasn’t the case. He had a massive stroke and it was scary.”



Peterman recalled the initial months after the health scare, saying, “He put in so much hard work to get back to [himself even though], he was always Chris. I saw him in the hospital right away and Chris was there. He was cracking jokes immediately.”

Despite Rich’s progress, he’s still experiencing some side effects.

“His left side is still affected. But we wanted him to come back and he was ready to come back,” Peterman told Us. “It was really wonderful because I remember when I was on Reba, I was such a baby. It was my first series regular role and Chris was essentially my acting partner during that entire series.”

Peterman and Rich, 71, became household names when Reba aired from 2001 to 2007. The hit show followed a single mom who had to start over after her husband, Brock (Rich), left her for his dental hygienist, Barbra Jean (Peterman). Reba (Reba McEntire) attempted to start fresh while raising her three kids — including her pregnant teen daughter (JoAnna Garcia Swisher) and her boyfriend (Steve Howey).

“It was me and him and he was so kind to me,” Peterman continued. “He taught me so many things. He would even whisper things in my ear so I didn’t feel dumb not knowing. And he’s one of the smartest men I know. He’s such a good actor.”

McEntire, 69, and Peterman reunited two decades later as costars on NBC’s Happy’s Place, which paved the way for them to reunite with Rich and Howey as well. Rich’s episode in February held extra significance after he stepped away from acting for several years following a massive stroke.

“It’s hard for all of us if your body betrays you and yet you’re still there and you want to do it. It’s scary. But our whole team felt familiar for him and he felt safe to play. By the way, he crushed it,” Peterman gushed. “He was so funny.”

Peterman praised Rich for being “so brave,” adding, “When we had talked about other iterations of what we could do — if there was a Reba reboot — we’d have to address it because he physically can’t hide it. He was always so open about being really honest about it and being vulnerable.”

During Rich’s return to acting, Happy’s Place had him playing a tattoo artist who immediately caught Gabby’s (Peterman) eye. The episode even included a line where Gabby asked Maverick (Rich) whether he had a wife she could steal him away from.

“I liked that they let me call [Reba’s character Bobbie] Red at one point. That’s what I called her on the show,” Rich exclusively told Us about Brock’s reference to Reba on the hit sitcom. “Frequently, those little things are magnificent. And Reba [the show] has such a wonderful following that people will comment about it online. It was just so wonderful to work with those two women. They took such good care of me and they were very, very protective.”

While Reba fans await more cameo news, Peterman didn’t rule out more onscreen reunions.

“Scarlett [Pomers] as Kyra was just incredibly and comedically gifted. I know we would love to see JoAnna Garcia [Swisher] and I think she just saw Reba recently. So I hope Reba was like, ‘When you are available … ‘ It would be fun to have any and all Reba participants — whether they’re a cast member or a guest,” Peterman said. “It would be so much fun, and we would love to have all of them.”

Happy’s Place airs on NBC Fridays at 8 p.m. ET.

Long before AnnaSophia Robb kept Us guessing on NBC’s Grosse Pointe Garden Society, she stepped into Carrie Bradshaw’s oh-so-fashionable shoes.

From 2013 to 2014, The CW aired a two-season Sex in the City prequel chronicling Carrie’s high school years in Castlebury, Connecticut. The Carrie Diaries, inspired by Candace Bushnell’s SATC novels, was also adapted from a Young Adult novel in Bushnell’s franchise.

Robb’s Carrie was an aspiring writer, who finds an affinity for fashion and the Big Apple all while balancing school, family and romance with resident bad boy Sebastian Kydd (played by Austin Butler, long before Elvis fame).

“They told me that I got the part because I did a little chicken dance at the end of my audition after they asked me about my prom,” Robb told Teen Vogue in 2013. “I’ve got rhythm, but not the moves to go with it, and I guess they liked that I wasn’t afraid to be goofy.”



At the time, Robb was hesitant to even audition for the role.

“When I was younger, I didn’t want to be on TV, I wanted to play different kinds of roles and have the freedom to choose my projects,” Robb explained. “So when my agent called about this job, I said no way. TV was too much of a commitment. I realized it was actually a really strong story. It had a lot of heart and integrity, and Carrie seems like a character that I can grow with.”

Stepping onto the Manhattan-based set, Robb totally transformed into an ‘80s version of Carrie — bright colors, funky prints, major curls and all. Plus, who could forget her custom “Carrie” handbag? (As noted in the pilot, Carrie’s sister accidentally spilled nail polish on the purse that belonged to their late mother. Carrie, in a stroke of ingenuity, came up with a creative solution to continue using the heirloom clutch.)

Look back with Us at Robb’s early TV days bringing the ever-iconic Carrie Bradshaw to life:

Following the success of HBO’s SATC (and two feature-length films) starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Bushnell wrote The Carrie Diaries and Summer in the City in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The two-book series took fans back to Carrie’s high school years.

On the CW show, Carrie’s crew was rounded out by friends Mouse (Ellen Wong), Maggie (Katie Findlay), Walt (Brendan Dooling), Donna (Chloe Bridges) and mentor Larissa (Freema Agyeman). Carrie’s father, Tom, was played by Matt Letscher opposite Stefania LaVie Owen as her younger sister, Dorrit.

In the pilot, Carrie was struggling to deal with her grief after the death of her mother, Grace. As a result, Tom and the school’s guidance counselor allowed Carrie to tackle an internship in NYC at a law firm. Carrie, however, found her own opportunity as an assistant at Interview magazine, which she took unbeknownst to her father.

By season 2, fans saw Carrie’s SATC bestie Samantha Jones arrive in town, brought to life by Lindsay Gort. In the season opener, Carrie and Samantha (who happens to be Donna’s older cousin) met by chance after Carrie was locked out of her NYC apartment during her summer in the Big Apple. The shenanigans soon led the pair to become roommates and eventually foster a tight-knit friendship.

Considering SATC is one of the most famous TV dramedies, it’s no secret that there was a market to discover what Carrie was like (to quote the show opening) “before there was sex” and “before there was the city.”

“It feels surreal, and I don’t think I’ve quite processed it yet,” Robb told Elle in 2013 of taking over the mantle. “Carrie lives a dual life in the show, and I definitely felt that way in high school, balancing work and life as a student.”

Parker herself even approved of Robb’s casting.

“She sent me a letter! I wrote her one back, too,” Robb exclusively told Us Weekly in 2013 ahead of filming. “She was just very encouraging about it all. It was really cool! I know everyone’s going to compare it to Sex and the City, but we’re never going to be that. The show is more for my generation, but it’s set in the ’80s, so it’s fun.”

Later that year, Parker told Net-A-Porter’s The Edit that the prequel premise felt “odd.”

“You know, I think it’s one of those tests of your generosity,” Parker said. “[AnnaSophia] is a lovely girl and I want her to feel good about it, but it’s … odd.”

By the end of The Carrie Diaries, Carrie opted to forgo college to pursue a dream writing job as a journalist in a move that disappointed her dad. Episodes earlier, she found a specific penchant for writing about her real life (namely losing her virginity to Chris Wood’s Adam Weaver) that would eventually inspire the sex column and memoirs penned in SATC.

Parker, meanwhile, reprised her role of Carrie in 2021’s And Just Like That series on Max, which picked up post-pandemic and after the death of her husband, Mr. Big (Chris Noth). Robb has since moved on to star in NBC’s Grosse Pointe Garden Society, playing Alice.

FOX’s new reality competition series Extracted follows 12 amateur survivalists with no training who are abandoned in a remote forest where surveillance cameras film them 24-7. And miles away their families watch every move they make.

And if that’s not dramatic enough, the survivalists are only allowed to bring the clothes on their backs, while they’re forced to contend with the unpredictable conditions and scarcity of food, water and shelter. Back at headquarters, their loved ones have to work together to decide on the critical supplies they need to survive the wilderness.

And why are they risking it all? A $250,000 cash prize.

Executive produced by Rambo himself, Sylvester Stallone, the survivalists push themselves to the brink, while their family members have the power to pull them from the competition at any time – by pushing the extraction button.



Us Weekly talks to one of the show’s breakout stars, Blake Kaminer, below about what it really takes to survive in the wild and to navigate his newfound fame in the social media jungle.

Your father Woody is a retired law enforcement officer. He said in the beginning of the show that you’re actually more outdoorsy than he is, so did you want to be the survivalist?

Yes, I wanted to be the survivalist. I spent my teenage years in the outdoors hunting, fishing, making fires, forts and pretty much anything else outdoors. Being comfortable in that environment definitely gives you the upper hand in this type of competition.

You’re a boat captain and you revealed on the show you’ve trapped and hunted animals. Are you best suited in HQ? Or out in the wild?

My first thought is that I would be better in the wild, but now that the competition has begun, I realized I’m better off in HQ. Receiving the best supplies with less experience is better than great experience but no good supplies, which makes it cool to have [my dad’s] support.

So far, do you still think you’d do better than your dad?

I can’t say I would be doing any better than my dad. At the end of the day, I know he is giving his all which is exactly what I would do.

Alliances and strategy are crucial in survival games. How do you strategize alliances? How difficult was it to strategize on the spot with your cousin Collin?

With competitions like this, you always have to have your head on a swivel, watching who you can and can’t trust. But me and Collin have that type of relationship where we can work together and make crucial decisions in the heat of the moment.

Who will we see you ally with coming up? Who are you wary of and have your eye out for?

Each day is different in HQ, so you’ll have to watch and see. But I know I can always count on Cousin Collin.

What did you think of Anthony being the first one extracted? Surprised? What was it like watching how he was acting from HQ?

It was tough watching Anthony yell at his parents. Knowing they were doing all they could to get him some of the best supplies. Considering his setup, I was surprised he was extracted this early in the competition.

How about Davina as the second survivalist extracted. Did you see that coming?

I think Davina did an amazing job out in the wild, especially considering her outdoors experience. She definitely lasted longer than I expected, respectfully.

What’s the hardest part of watching your loved one from HQ? Did you ever want to trade places?

The hardest part of watching my dad while in HQ was watching him struggle and not being able to help him. I remember the moment my dad got the bow drill and all I wanted to do was reach through the screen and do it for him. So frustrating! I wanted to trade places every single day.

It’s a game of survival. From what you’ve seen and experienced so far, what are your tips for surviving the wild? What have you learned to do and not to do?

If I had any tips for surviving in the wild it would be to prioritize water, shelter and fire. Acquiring those three things could be the difference between surviving or not. One main thing to do is to keep your clothes as dry as possible, including shoes. Trench foot in the woods makes for a bad day.

What have you learned from other survival reality shows before starring in one yourself? Do you have any favorites?

The biggest thing I’ve learned from watching other survival reality shows is not to drink the lake water! My favorite show is Man vs Wild. I’ve always looked up to Bear Grylls.

You star on a real survival show, but did anyone prepare you for surviving social media fame? Has it been a fun ride?

So far, it’s been a blast to interact with everyone and answer questions about the show. I didn’t have any preparation coming into this, but I’m looking forward to what’s to come.

Have there been any celebrity fans of the show you’ve been excited about or to hear from?

I’m super excited to know Stallone is involved with this production. He is a household name and is very well known which makes it cool to have his support.

Watch an all-new Extracted on FOX Monday, March 10, at 8 p.m. ET.

Pierce Brosnan has strong feelings about who should take on the role of 007 next.

The 71-year-old actor, who portrayed the iconic character of James Bond between 1995 and 2002, spoke out about who should take on the role next given the recent news about Amazon's creative control takeover of the franchise.

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Pierce was asked about who should take on the role.

Pierce said it's “a given” that that the next actor to take the role should be British.

An American actor has never played the role. Pierce, who is Irish, and George Lazenby, an Australian, have been the only non-British actors to play James Bond.

“In this world that is moving so fast now, at the speed of light, [the takeover] does come with a certain lament,”  he said of Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson handing creative control to the giant company.

“I thought it was coming for some time I guess, but I think it was the right decision for Barbara and Michael,” he went on.

“It takes great courage for them to let go,” he said.

“I hope that [Amazon] handles the work and the character with dignity and imagination and respect,"" he continued, adding that “no one really knows” what 007 might look like under Amazon’s control.

“History has been passed on and I’m very proud to have been part of the history and the legacy of Bond and the movies I made with Barbara and Michael.”

“That we moved the needle, that we brought it back to life. It had been dormant [for] six years and GoldenEye was such a success that it continued and went from strength to strength…You know, everything changes, everything falls apart, and I wish them well,"" he added.

Tim Baltz has a new skill!

The 44-year-old actor learned to pole dance for the fourth and final season of The Righteous Gemstones, he confirmed.

Tim, who plays BJ in the HBO series, the husband of Judy Gemstone, will showcase his skills on the pole this season, which premieres on Sunday (March 9).

Keep reading to find out more...

“I did most of my own stunts,” he told Variety at the show’s fourth season premiere.

“I would go probably three times a week, and I’d train for about two-and-a-half hours each time,” he elaborated.

“And then once I got the routine down, I would go every other day, and I would just do it three times. So for an hour.”

He trained with Tanya Christopher, who is president of the U.S. Aerial Federation organization, who is also campaigning to have pole dancing added to the Olympics.

“I was essentially getting trained by the Olympic coach if pole dancing were to get in the Olympics, and she was incredible,” Tim said.

David Gordon Green, an executive producer and director on the series, told him ahead of time: “‘Hey, you should start Pilates right now because you’re going to need an incredible amount of core strength.'”

Edi Patterson, who plays Judy Gemstone said: “I’m so blown away by what Tim ended up being able to learn to do.""

She also took lessons for a scrapped idea to have Judy pole dance as well. 

“The storyline ended up changing, and honestly, I was like, thank God,” she admitted, saying it was “so hard and so painful.”

As for BJ's pole dancing, Tim said: “He’s trying to show his elegance, but also his power because he has a different kind of masculinity, one that’s rooted in being very loyal, fiercely devoted to his wife despite all the trials and tribulations that they go through.”

The Righteous Gemstones Season 4 premieres at 10 p.m. ET on HBO.

Seyfried told the story to People magazine in a recent interview, revealing that at the 2023 Critics Choice Awards, ""My boobs fell out of my dress.""

""I was wearing this amazing vintage dress. I made my stylist dress up in it before I went just for fun,"" she said.

Critics slammed Meghan Markle online shortly after the Duchess of Sussex shared a rare photo of her 3-year-old daughter, Princess Lilibet.

Markle, 43, posted a carousel of images Saturday to celebrate International Women's Day, and included a snap of her husband Prince Harry cradling their little girl in his arms in what appeared to be a boat with water surrounding the pair.

Social media users were not happy and blasted the royal couple for taking a lax approach to water safety while boating.

""Prince Harry & Meghan Markle are so good at showing the world how much they suck at being parents What f----ng moron doesn’t put their child in a safety vest while boating,"" one person said.

Markle's ""With Love, Meghan"" lifestyle show recently picked up a second season on Netflix despite negative reviews.

Launched on March 4, the ""Suits"" actress is joined by a few of her famous friends and chefs as she shares her favorite recipes and hosting tips.

The show was widely criticized as ""cringey"" and inauthentic by royal experts and The Hollywood Reporter. British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that the show ""appears mundane and lacks wow factor.""

""Meghan seems eager to play the altruistic, kind soul, but it is a tad smarmy,"" she claimed. ""My toes are curling.… This is so cringey and not fun at all. It feels too staged, and the tips and tricks are far too basic… Meghan comes across as a modern Stepford Wife.""

US officials are planning to use Tuesday’s meeting with a Ukrainian delegation in Saudi Arabia in part to determine whether Ukraine is willing to make material concessions to Russia to end the war, according to two US officials.

The US delegation will also be watching for signs that the Ukrainians are serious about improving ties with the Trump administration after a meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy devolved into an argument last month, said one of the officials, who requested anonymity to preview the closed-door talks.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will fly to Jeddah on Sunday for the bilateral talks with Ukrainian officials, who will be led by Andriy Yermak, a top Zelenskyy aide. Rubio is expected to be joined by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.

“You can’t say ‘I want peace,’ and, ‘I refuse to compromise on anything,'” one of the US officials said of the upcoming talks.

“We want to see if the Ukrainians are interested not just in peace, but in a realistic peace,” said the other official. “If they are only interested in 2014 or 2022 borders, that tells you something.”

Ukraine’s European allies argue that Ukraine can only ink a deal with Russia from a position of strength and that Kyiv should not be rushed to the negotiating table with an aggressor.

Zelenskyy has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not want peace and that Russia will attack other European countries if its invasion of Ukraine does not result in a clear defeat.

US officials met with Russian officials in the Saudi capital of Riyadh in February for separate bilateral discussions, which were focused largely on rebuilding a working relationship after a near-total freeze on official contact under former US President Joe Biden.

Trump has expressed frustration with Ukraine in recent weeks, saying the eastern European nation is running out of manpower and resources and that it needs to quickly come to the table with Russia.

His administration has cut off weapons shipments and some intelligence sharing with Kyiv in recent days, accusing the Ukrainians of not being sufficiently open to a potential peace process.

Critics say Trump’s moves risk prolonging the war by strengthening Russia’s hand and making the country less likely to lay down arms and strike an equitable peace deal.

Russian troops have been making slow but steady progress in eastern Ukraine, while thousands of Ukrainian troops who stormed into Russia’s Kursk region last summer are nearly surrounded.

In a statement, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said Zelenskyy had made progress in restoring the US-Ukraine relationship following his acrimonious meeting with Trump on February 28.

He pointed to comments by Trump during his address to the US Congress earlier last week, when he said he had received a conciliatory note from the Ukrainian leader.

“With meetings in Saudi Arabia this coming week, we look forward to hearing more positive movement that will hopefully and ultimately end this brutal war and bloodshed,” Hughes said.

Witkoff, the Middle East envoy, said publicly earlier this week that he hoped to discuss a “framework” for a potential ceasefire and peace deal during the talks.

Hanging over Jeddah is the fate of a minerals deal between the US and Ukraine. Zelenskyy and Trump had been slated to sign that accord— which would give the US access to certain mineral resources in Ukraine— during Zelenskyy’s White House visit. But after the blowup between the two men, it was not signed.

Since then, both sides have expressed a renewed willingness to sign the deal, but no signing has yet occurred.

The State Department and the Ukrainian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Health authorities are calling attention to a looming consequence of the Trump administration’s gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development: the risk of a global surge in tuberculosis cases and deaths.

The World Health Organization warned this week that the sweeping funding cuts could endanger millions of lives, since many countries depend on foreign aid for TB prevention, testing and treatment.

“Without immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk,” Dr. Tereza Kasaeva, director of the WHO’s Global Programme on TB and Lung Health, said in a statement Wednesday.

Globally, tuberculosis is responsible for the most deaths of any infectious disease. Around 1.25 million people died from the bacterial infection in 2023, the latest data available, and new cases hit an all-time high that year, with around 8.2 million people diagnosed, according to the WHO.

Until recently, USAID provided about a quarter of the international donor funding for tuberculosis services in other countries — up to $250 million annually, according to the WHO. The agency operated tuberculosis programs in 24 countries.

The WHO said that because of the U.S. funding cuts, drug supply chains in other countries are “breaking down,” laboratory services are “severely disrupted” and surveillance systems are “collapsing,” making it difficult to identify, monitor and treat tuberculosis cases. Some research trials have been halted, as well.

That has incapacitated some national tuberculosis programs, with the WHO warning of devastating impacts in 18 countries with the highest burden of disease, many of which are in Africa.

In Uganda, the rollback of USAID funding has made it hard to pay community health workers, leading to understaffing, said Dr. Luke Davis, a clinical epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. Such workers play a critical role in notifying people who test positive for tuberculosis, getting them treatment and screening their close contacts for infection.

“Patients may get a diagnosis of TB after they’ve left the clinic because they’re waiting for the results, and they may be at home with TB and not know they have TB. There’s literally not the resources to go out and reach those people,” he said. “People are dying because they have disease that hasn’t been diagnosed, hasn’t been treated, hasn’t been prevented.”

Since Jan. 24, the discontinuation of USAID funding may have led to an estimated 3,400 additional tuberculosis deaths and 6,000 additional infections, according to a project modeling the impact of the cuts. The model is coordinated by the Stop TB Partnership, a United Nations organization that aims to eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem.

Any increase in the disease’s spread could affect the U.S., since it would allow more people who live or travel abroad to bring the disease in. Already, tuberculosis cases in the U.S. have risen: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded more than 9,600 cases in 2023, a nearly 16% increase from the year prior and a 9% increase over prepandemic levels in 2019.

A persistent outbreak in Kansas has led to 68 active cases since January 2024.

“What happens when we travel overseas? I’ve known servicemen and -women who come back with multidrug-resistant TB after a tour of duty. I’ve known of bankers, people from Silicon Valley who work overseas, come back with the disease,” said Dr. Kenneth Castro, a professor of global health at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health.

“The problem with all these infectious diseases is that they know no borders, and neither should our efforts stop at the border,” he said.

A resurgence of tuberculosis in the U.S. from 1985 to 1992 was attributed, in part, to a decline in tuberculosis control programs and rising global cases.

The White House did not provide a comment in time for publication.

People with active TB usually develop a bad cough and chest pain. They may cough up blood and mucus and have difficulty breathing. Left untreated, the bacterial infection can damage the lungs and spread to other parts of their body such as the brain, kidneys and spine. It can be fatal for up to two-thirds of people with active cases who aren’t properly treated, according to the WHO.

But treatment is no quick matter: Tuberculosis patients must usually take antibiotics for six months, and stopping in the middle can lead a person to become resistant to the antibiotics, then spread that drug-resistant TB strain to others.

Until the recent cuts, USAID had been instrumental in conducting surveillance to identify new tuberculosis cases, improving supply chains to get medicine to sick patients, and investing in clinical trials for new therapies and diagnostic tests. In communities that lacked radiologists to read X-rays, USAID also funded portable X-ray systems that use artificial intelligence to make diagnoses.

Additionally, the agency helped countries procure drugs at lower costs, in part by funding the Global Drug Facility, a group that negotiates drug prices with suppliers.

Many of those efforts came to a halt when the Trump administration stripped the agency down to bare bones. After firing or furloughing contractors in January, the administration laid off 1,600 staffers, then placed thousands more on administrative leave last month. The State Department slashed nearly 5,800 of USAID’s foreign aid awards — more than 90% of the total — according to a lawsuit filed by nonprofits and businesses that receive USAID funding. The awards totaled $54 billion, according to The Associated Press.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a waiver in January allowing USAID’s lifesaving humanitarian programs — including tuberculosis prevention and treatment — to continue, despite a 90-day freeze on foreign aid. But in a memo to staffers last month, a USAID official said that nearly all of the funding needed to keep those programs going had been terminated.

The official warned of “preventable death, destabilization, and threats to national security on a massive scale,” then was placed on administrative leave after sending the memo.

The downsizing of USAID has been part of the broader effort to reduce federal spending led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk said on X last month that he was “feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” and that he and Trump agreed the agency should be shut down.

So far, federal judges have denied requests from USAID staffers and contractors to continue their work while lawsuits challenging their terminations play out. The Supreme Court on Wednesday, however, said the Trump administration had to pay USAID contractors $2 billion for work already completed.

The WHO has a goal to reduce tuberculosis cases by 80% and deaths by 90% by 2030. That was already aspirational but is even further out of sight now, said Dr. Priya Shete, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco.

USAID played a significant role in getting diagnostic tools and treatments over the “last mile” to patients, Shete said. That included finding ways to transport drugs when road conditions were poor and funding mobile clinics that offered X-rays and bacterial testing.

“The loss of resources to get across the finish line is what’s really disturbing to some people, and will end up costing millions of lives potentially,” she said.

Experts worry the disruption to clinical trials will also hinder the development of treatments for drug-resistant infections and of new ways to detect cases in children, who are often hard to diagnose.

“The innovations do come back and benefit the U.S. as well,” Davis said.

Law enforcement agencies claim ‘suicidal individual’ traveled to Washington D.C. from Indiana

The Secret Service has shot an armed 27-year-old man directly outside the White House grounds, the agency announced. 

An “armed confrontation” took place directly outside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House’s West Wing shortly after midnight on Sunday.

President Donald Trump was in Florida at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Palm Beach at the time of the shooting.

On Saturday, Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department relayed information to Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies that a “suicidal individual” may have been traveling to Washington from Indiana.

The bulletin warned that 27-year-old Andrew Dawson wanted to die by “suicide by cop” and was armed with a BB gun,The New York Times reports.

Secret Service agents saw the man in the warning’s vehicle parked near 17th and F streets before they spotted an individual matching police’s description nearby. An armed encounter followed near 17th and G streets, a spokesperson for the agency said.

During the confrontation, the man pointed a gun at himself and then turned it towards the Secret Service officers, law enforcement sources told CNN.

The individual ignored demands to drop his weapon and the officers opened fire.

The man was taken to the hospital. His condition was not immediately known.

“As officers approached, the individual brandished a firearm, and an armed confrontation ensued, during which shots were fired by our personnel,” according to a statement from Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi.

No Secret Service personnel was injured in the incident, which is now under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department, which declined further comment when contacted by Reuters.

The Independent has requested comment from Metropolitan Police and Secret Service.

Agents found another weapon in the man’s car, CNN reports.

There have been a series of incidents involving armed men being shot by security officers on or near the White House grounds over the years, including the 2016 shooting of a man who brandished a handgun at a White House security gate.

In May 2023, a 20-year-old Indian immigrant named Sai Varshith Kandula unsuccessfully tried to break through the White House’s protective barriers in a rented U-Haul truck.

Trump himself narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July, when a gunman fired at him during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding his ear.

In September, a second alleged attempt on his life was thwarted when a potential shooter was spotted hiding outside Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida.

Florida police arrested a man who allegedly claimed he wanted to assassinate the president and had control of missiles pointed at New York City, including Trump Tower.

 Aubrey Lay — a Fulbright scholar — was supposed to get paid for three months of work by the U.S. government through his teaching assistantship at a school for Ukrainian refugees in Estonia. Instead, he only got about one week's pay, and no word on when he might see the rest of his grant. 

 Lay is among scholars around the world who depend on State Department funding to participate in long-established programs like Fulbright and who say their payments have been abruptly cut off after getting a notice that officials were reviewing their activities. The move appears to be in line with the White House’s initiative to sharply slash government spending - a shakeup that has affected scores of federal agencies. 

 The government is facing even more dramatic changes in the coming weeks and months. President Donald Trump has directed agencies to prepare plans for widespread layoffs, known as reductions in force, that will likely require more limited operations at agencies that provide critical services. 

 The funding freeze has sparked panic among thousands of scholars who area stranded outside their home countries without clarity on the future of their programs or the money needed to support themselves. 

 In February, the U.S. State Department temporarily paused spending in an effort to review its programs and activities, according to NAFSA, an association of international educators. That included programs such as Fulbright, Gilman and Critical Language international scholarships. In the weeks since officials enacted the pause, some scholars and advocacy groups have said the flow of funds dried up for people's grants, yet there is no communication from U.S. officials on whether that will change. 

 The State Department did not comment on the funding freeze following an inquiry by the Associated Press over the weekend. 

 Lay found the lack of communication from U.S. officials troublesome. He was also left wondering about the future of the program that his grandmother also participated in decades ago. After it was established in 1946, the program has become a flagship for the U.S. government’s mission toward cross-cultural engagement. 

 “I don’t want to be one more thing that is changing and uncertain in their lives,” Lay said. “I can’t bear that thought."" 

 Lay said he will be OK for another month, but he worries about participants with no extra money saved. 

 “The clarity that I’ve gotten is that nobody knows what’s going on?"" he said. “The clarity that I’ve gotten is that every time I’ve asked anybody, they don’t know what’s happening, and they are just as confused as I am, as we all are.” 

 Thousands of scholars are in similar positions to Lay, according to the Fulbright Association, which is a nonprofit group comprising alumni. In a newsletter email, the association said the halt in funding impact “over 12,500 American students, youth, and professionals currently abroad or scheduled to participate in State Department programs in the next six months.” 

 Aside from U.S. citizens, the Fulbright Association also said the pause has cut funding for U.S. programs hosting more than 7,400 people. 

 Halyna Morozova, a Fulbright scholar from Kyiv teaching Ukrainian to students at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, said she was at the airport Feb. 28 after what felt like a never-ending day. President Donald Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier that day in an extraordinary Oval Office meeting. The future of her country along with her family back home weighed heavily on her mind. 

 Then she got an email from the Institute of International Education, commonly referred to as IIE, which administers the Fulbright scholarship. 

 “IIE is currently authorized to send you a partial stipend equivalent to one week of your anticipated upcoming stipend payment,” the email said. “We will update you on future payments as soon as possible.” 

 Morozova panicked. She usually gets $750 each month. Now, she has to stretch $187.50 to make ends meet. 

 “It was very scary, I would say, not just because I am lost in another country,” she said. “We don't know if we will ever get another stipend here, and if they have enough money to buy our tickets home. So there are a lot of things that are not clear and not certain.” 

 Olga Bezhanova, a professor who manages Morozova and two other scholars, said the exchange program has been in place for nearly two decades at her university, becoming a bedrock of their language education. Now, she is trying to see if her university will supplement the funds being withheld by the federal government. If that doesn't work out, she said she was unsure of what else could be done. 

 “I have to look into the faces of these wonderful people, and they’re asking me: ‘Is this America? What is this?’” she said. “This is a mess.”

 Syria's leader on Sunday vowed accountability and an investigation after the killing of Alawite civilians triggered an international backlash against the worst violence since Bashar al-Assad's overthrow. 

 In its latest toll, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said 830 Alawite civilians were killed in ""executions"" carried out by security personnel or pro-government fighters in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus. 

 The Mediterranean area is the heartland of the Alawite minority community to which Assad belongs. 

 United Nations rights chief Volker Turk said the killings ""must cease immediately"", while the Arab League, the United Nations, the United States, Britain and other governments have condemned the violence. 

 ""We will hold accountable, firmly and without leniency, anyone who was involved in the bloodshed of civilians... or who overstepped the powers of the state,"" Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa said in a video posted by state news agency SANA. 

 Earlier Sunday, the Syrian presidency announced on Telegram that an ""independent committee"" had been formed to ""investigate the violations against civilians and identify those responsible for them"", who would face the courts. 

 Fighting between the new security forces and loyalists of the former government erupted on Thursday, after earlier tensions, and escalated into reported mass killings. 

 Sharaa also appealed for national unity. 

 ""God willing, we will be able to live together in this country,"" he said in an separate address from a Damascus mosque. 

 The fighting has also killed 231 members of the security forces and 250 pro-Assad fighters, according to the Observatory, taking the overall death toll to 1,311.

 Images on social media showed Syrian security forces on pickups and trucks driving past thick black smoke that drifted over the road on their way into the city of Jableh, between Latakia and Tartus. 

 The interior ministry said on Sunday that government forces were conducting ""sweeping operations"" in an area of Tartus province to ""pursue the remnants of the toppled regime"". 

 SANA quoted a defence ministry source as saying there were clashes in Tanita village in the same area. 

 An AFP photographer in Latakia city reported a military convoy entering a neighbourhood to search homes. 

 In Baniyas, a city further south, resident Samir Haidar, 67, told AFP two of his brothers and his nephew were killed by armed groups that entered people's homes, adding there were ""foreigners among them"". 

 ""They gathered all the men on the roof and opened fire on them,"" Haidar said. 

 The mass killings followed clashes sparked by the arrest of a wanted suspect in a predominantly Alawite village, the Observatory said, reporting a ""relative return to calm"" in the coastal region on Saturday. 

 Chief US diplomat Marco Rubio said Syria ""must hold the perpetrators of these massacres against Syria's minority communities accountable"", while Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Damascus authorities ""must ensure the protection of all Syrians and set out a clear path to transitional justice"". 

 Germany's foreign ministry said the Syrian authorities had ""a responsibility to prevent further attacks"". 

 In Jordan, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said that, ""Anyone involved in this matter will be referred to the judiciary.""

 Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham , which led the toppling of Assad in December, has its roots in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda and remains proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many governments including the United States. 

 The group has sought to moderate its image in recent years. Since the rebel victory, it has vowed to protect Syria's religious and ethnic minorities. 

 The new government has received diplomats from the West and its neighbours. It is seeking an easing of sanctions along with investment to rebuild a country devastated by 13 years of civil war under the repressive rule of Assad. 

 Sharaa has said Syria must be built ""on the rule of law"". 

 The UN's Turk said in a statement there had been a ""continuous spike in hate speech both online and offline"" in Syria and insisted there was an ""urgent need for a comprehensive transitional justice process"". 

 Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, speaking to German newspaper Bild, said Europe ""must wake up"" and ""stop granting legitimacy"" to the new Syrian authorities who he insisted were still jihadists. 

 The Alawite heartland has been gripped by fear of reprisals for the Assad family's five-decade rule which included widespread torture and disappearances. 

 Social media users have shared posts documenting the killing of Alawite friends and relatives. 

 The Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, reported multiple ""massacres"" in recent days, with women and children among the dead. 

 During a sermon in Damascus, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch John X said Christians were among those killed and called on Sharaa to ""put a stop to these massacres... and give a sense of safety and security to all the people of Syria, regardless of their sect"". 

 Later on Sunday, Syrian security forces fired into the air to disperse rival protesters in Damascus who engaged in physical altercations over the killings in the coastal areas.

The Department of Homeland Security has begun performing polygraph tests on employees to determine who might be leaking information to the media about immigration operations, according to four sources familiar with the practice. 

The department’s plans to perform these tests was first reported by Bloomberg Government.

After the publication of this article, DHS said in a statement: “The Department of Homeland Security is a national security agency. We can, should, and will polygraph personnel.”

Border czar Tom Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have blamed lower-than-expected ICE arrest numbers on recent leaks revealing the cities where it planned to conduct operations.

In a video posted on X Friday, Noem said, “We have identified two leakers of information here at the Department of Homeland Security who have been telling individuals about our operations and putting law enforcement lives in jeopardy. We plan to prosecute these two individuals and hold them accountable for what they’ve done.”

It was not clear if those two employees Noem referred to had been identified through a polygraph test. It’s also not clear how many employees have been polygraphed or may face polygraph tests, but sources said the employees asked to take the tests so far have been in different agencies across DHS.

Polygraphs at the department are not new and have been used in the past, such as when Customs and Border Protection is screening new hires. But according to the sources familiar with the current use of polygraphs, the so-called lie detector machines are now being used to ask employees across the agency specific questions about leaking classified documents or sensitive law enforcement information on ICE operations.

U.S. Secret Service personnel were reportedly involved in a shooting overnight following an armed encounter with a person of interest near the White House. 

Authorities said the incident occurred after they were informed about a ""suicidal individual"" who was possibly traveling from Indiana to Washington D.C.

""Around midnight, members of the Secret Service encountered the individual's parked vehicle near 17th and F Streets, NW,"" the Secret Service said in a statement. ""They also saw an individual on foot matching the description nearby. As officers approached, the individual brandished a firearm and an armed confrontation ensued, during which shots were fired by our personnel. The suspect was transported to an area hospital and his condition is unknown.""

Most of the 80,000 federal workers responsible for researching diseases, inspecting food and administering Medicare and Medicaid under the auspices of the Health and Human Services Department were emailed an offer to leave their job for as much as a $25,000 payment as part of President Donald Trump's government cuts.

Workers cannot start opting in until Monday and have until 5 p.m. on Friday to submit a response for the so-called voluntary separation offer. The email was sent to staff across the department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and the National Institutes of Health as well as the Food and Drug Administration, both in Maryland.

The mass email went out to a “broad population of HHS employees,"" landing in their inboxes days before agency heads are due to offer plans for shrinking their workforces. HHS is one of the government's costliest federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion that is mostly spent on health care coverage for millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.

The agency oversees health insurance for roughly half the country through Medicare for older adults and Medicaid for disabled and poor Americans.

There was no immediate comment Sunday from HHS.

RELATED STORY | Trump's widespread federal layoffs could be felt across the country

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's health secretary, has hinted at plans at deep cuts to the staff. Last year, he promised to immediately clear out 600 employees at the NIH, the nation's biomedical research arm. He has not gone that far, but in an interview last month shortly after being sworn in last month, Kennedy said he wanted to remove some workers from the public health agencies.

“I have a list in my head,” Kennedy said of potential firings at the agency. He said some workers “made really bad decisions” on nutrition guidelines.

The Trump administration, with the help of billionaire Elon Musk, has been trying to push out federal workers in an effort to cut costs. In January, most federal employees received a deferred resignation offer that came with eight months of pay. Thousands of probationary employees, too, have been fired across federal agencies, including at HHS.

The latest move to reduce the number of federal health workers comes as the the CDC is assisting with a deadly measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico and as lawmakers are debating deep cuts to Medicaid in the federal budget.

HHS workers are directed in the email to reach out to their local human resources office to submit for the voluntary separation.

 MEXICO CITY, - Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told supporters in a massive rally on Sunday that dialogue and respect had prevailed in achieving a pause on U.S. tariffs and that the sovereignty of Mexico would always come first. 

 Sheinbaum, speaking to thousands of people who gathered in Mexico City's iconic Zocalo square for an event aimed at bolstering national pride, highlighted the economic contributions that Mexico and its people makes to the U.S. economy. 

 ""We cannot give up our sovereignty, nor can our people be affected by decisions made by foreign governments or hegemonies. In that case, we will always act immediately,"" Sheinbaum said, addressing the plaza packed with thousands of people waving flags and holding signs promoting Mexican pride and independence. 

 ""The common history of our countries is marked by numerous episodes of hostility but also by numerous episodes of cooperation and understanding,"" she added. 

 U.S. President Donald Trump, who said Mexico and Canada had failed to do enough to stem the flow of the deadly fentanyl opioid and its precursor chemicals into the United States, slapped goods from both countries with 25% tariffs on March 4. 

 In a cool-headed approach, Sheinbaum said she would wait to announce counter-measures against the United States, including retaliatory tariffs, until Sunday's event. 

 Two days later, however, Trump said that Mexico would not be required to pay tariffs on any goods that fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement trade deal until April 2 out of ""respect"" for Sheinbaum following a phone call between the two leaders. 

 Sheinbaum then said Sunday's rally would be a ""festival."" 

 ""So far it has yielded results and I think it will continue to do so,"" Sheinbaum said of the ""respectful dialogue"" with the United States. 

 ""However, we must be aware and informed in case it is necessary for us to again gather in this public square. Do you agree?"" she asked the crowd. 

 ""Yes!"" her supporters enthusiastically shouted in response.

Starting March 17, the Smokehouse BBQ Bacon Sandwich will come back to locations nationwide. This time, diners have their choice of original, spicy or grilled chicken fillets. Assorted Pineapple Dragonfruit beverages will also join the lineup for what is being described as a ""perfectly sweet pairing,"" but both are for a limited time, Chick-fil-A said in a press release.

These programs are not just about learning a trade; they are about building futures.As industries adapt to new technologies and shifting workforce demands, building a pipeline of skilled professionals has become essential for business success and economic resilience. One of the most critical yet often overlooked components of this development is Career and Technical Education (CTE). CTE programs provide the specialized training necessary to build a strong workforce, ensuring that businesses in Northern Arizona have access to skilled professionals in high-demand industries.

These programs are not just about learning a trade; they are about building futures.

CTE programs at CCC are designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in what we refer to as H-3 industries: high-demand, high-skill, high-wage careers. These programs are not just about learning a trade; they are about building futures. Graduates of CTE programs often find themselves in careers that offer competitive wages, stability and opportunities for growth. Importantly, these careers allow our graduates to stay in Northern Arizona, contributing to the communities they call home rather than being compelled to seek opportunities elsewhere.

For employers, a robust CTE system translates into a workforce that is trained, adaptable and ready to meet industry needs. In Northern Arizona, skilled trade shortages have been an ongoing challenge. CTE graduates provide local businesses with the talent they need to remain competitive while also reducing the need for companies to recruit from outside the region.

Consider the allied health professionals – the nurses, surgical technicians, radiologic technologists and respiratory therapists – who are essential to the well-being of our communities. Many of these individuals receive their training at community colleges before stepping into critical roles in hospitals and clinics. With Northern Arizona’s aging population, the demand for healthcare workers will only continue to grow, making workforce training more crucial than ever. This growing need underscores the vital role of workforce training in ensuring that communities have access to qualified medical professionals both now and in the future. 

Beyond health care, fields like construction technology, information technology and renewable energy are also expanding. As the housing market in Northern Arizona evolves, workforce shortages in skilled trades remain a concern, with community colleges helping to bridge the gap. Programs that train electricians, carpenters and HVAC specialists are not only vital for sustaining regional infrastructure but also drive innovative solutions to local challenges. For example, CCC’s initiative to build net-zero tiny homes on the Navajo Nation demonstrates how CTE can address both economic and environmental challenges while providing students with hands-on experience in sustainable construction practices.

Community colleges are more than educational institutions; they are engines of economic development and pillars of community resilience. By investing in CTE, communities are not just preparing students for jobs; they are ensuring the long-term sustainability and prosperity of their regions. Business and industry leaders have a critical role to play in this development by supporting CTE programs through mentorship, job placements and industry collaboration. 

By fostering strong connections between industry, community and education, Northern Arizona can ensure long-term economic stability and provide businesses with the skilled workforce they need to thrive. FBN

 On Friday and Saturday nights, live music is featured, and on Thursday evenings, there is karaoke.There’s always something stirring in Camp Verde, and just recently the talk is all about Bullpen Grill and Watering Hole, which has locals pretty excited.

 On Friday and Saturday nights, live music is featured, and on Thursday evenings, there is karaoke.

 With an opening date of mid-February, owner Justin Chambers, who is also a realtor and broker, is running the show, bursting with enthusiasm and a contagious energy that seems endless. 

“My wife and I moved to Camp Verde from Kingman in 2018. Our goal was to retire here when we got older, but then we decided to move in another direction. We had second thoughts and we purchased the historic Wingfield Plaza.” 

 The Wingfield Plaza is in downtown Camp Verde and is one of the oldest commercial buildings in the area. Its rustic structure and Western character is a nice reminder of the early 1800s. The east side of the building has housed a restaurant for several years.

 “When the previous restaurant closed, many locals were accustomed to having a restaurant there, so I thought, maybe this is something I can do,” said Chambers. “I hired a staff of 28 key employees who are super talented and who have experience working in this industry for many years. They are doing all it takes to make this work. I’m so proud of them.”

 With no restaurant experience, Chambers opened Bullpen Grill and Watering Hole. So far, it is charming customers with tasty meals in the Western-themed eatery.

 “It was great food and what I really liked about it is that there were healthy options. I had a salad and my husband had a burger and fries. We took my mother-in-law for her birthday. The service was really good and the food was prepared fast,” said Verde Valley Medical Center Speech Pathologist Shaylee Hoffman.

 Chambers was born in Kingman and attended college at Northern Arizona University (NAU), studying business management. He was about to pursue a career as a cameraman at a news station when he learned about real estate.

 “I was in a sales class and we had a guest speaker who mentioned how much she earned as a real estate agent. I knew I was pursuing the wrong field, so I worked toward my real estate license and my mom got hers at the same time.” Chambers has been working in real estate since he was 21 years old.

 “I’ve worked with Justin since 2005,” said Camp Verde Associate Real Estate Broker Michele Chaney. “He’s an upbeat, great guy to work with and always on the go! He’s not afraid to get his hands dirty. You might see him washing dishes or vacuuming. If something needs to get done, he’ll do it. Justin is also a wonderful family man and is dedicated to his wife and kids. He’s going to do great with his new restaurant.”

 Along with a colorful picturesque mural by famed Sedona artist Claudio Valdez, who creates under the name Quadrillion Miles, on the outside wall of the restaurant, Chambers replaced all appliances in the kitchen including the walk-in freezer and refrigeration. 

“We have all new booths, tables and chairs, bar stools, lighting, corrugated tin panels and we added pool tables in the spacious dining room. “I like playing pool and customers can play to their heart’s content,” he said. 

Tucked outside is an outdoor smoker where beef brisket and pork are roasted.

 Bullpen Grill and Watering Hole server Will Accomando is proud of the reviews. “The feedback has been great. I’ve seen comments online about the food and service and they have been fantastic.”

 “The food is top notch,” said local cowboy Frank Drake. “I had the braised rib roast and my wife had a New York strip steak. It was awesome.”

 “Justin gives us the opportunity to let us have our freedom in the kitchen,” said Lead Chef Joshua Senecal. “We play our music and have fun cooking. The menu showcases all my selections.” Senecal likes to refer to the Bullpen Grill and Watering Hole as a “gastropub,” a pub that specialize in serving high-quality food.

On Friday and Saturday nights, live music is featured, and on Thursday evenings, there is karaoke. FBN

A well-respected Great Barrier Reef Traditional Owner with a strong background in natural resource management and government relations will join the Board of Australia’s lead management agency for the Great Barrier Reef.



Mr Tibau Stanley (Stan) Lui’s five-year appointment as the new First Nations’ member to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Board follows a merit-based process.

Mr Lui is a Torres Strait Islander from Erub (Darnley Island) with academic qualifications in science and an extensive track record advising on policies for the sustainable use and safeguarding of marine ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef.

Reef Authority Board Chairperson Dr Ian Poiner welcomed Mr Lui’s appointment.

Stan Lui
“Traditional Owners have a close and enduring connection to the Reef and are important partners for the Reef Authority,” he said.

“I am looking forward to working with Mr Lui and the valuable perspectives he brings as our First Nations Board member.”

Mr Lui said he was passionate and committed to working for the future of the Great Barrier Reef and delighted to be appointed to the Board.

“This appointment allows me to draw on my knowledge and understanding of the environment and First Nations matters and make a positive contribution to helping protect and manage this global icon,” he said.

Mr Lui is the Director of an Indigenous environmental consultancy that covers all elements of natural resource management. He holds a Bachelor Science in Marine Biology and Aquaculture from James Cook University.

He was previously on the Boards for Reef and Rainforest Research Centre Ltd. and the Wet Tropics Biodiversity Foundation and has also held positions on several Commonwealth Government advisory committees.

Mr Lui was appointed as a part-time member of the Authority Board for five years from 23 January 2025.

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 outlines the role, functions, and membership for the Board.

The Board comprises a chairperson and five members, including a First Nations member with significant knowledge or experience of Indigenous matters relating to the Reef.

 (Bloomberg) -- First came a dry spell that parched the land, then a spark, followed by some wind. Suddenly, swaths of South Carolina were consumed by voracious flames. 

 More than 100 fires ignited in the state last weekend — an unusually high total even in the heart of fire season. It was the perfect combination of arid air, dry fuels and gusting winds that combined to spread the flames, said Doug Wood, a spokesman for the state’s Forestry Commission. 

 The South Carolina disaster is the latest high-profile example of compound weather, or two or more concurrent events that collectively yield a result worse than if each had occurred on its own. It’s a global phenomenon — and its prevalence in a warming world portends the risks ahead.  

 Malaysia recently struggled with devastating floods that killed at least five people, sent thousands fleeing their homes, crimped palm oil production and caused mudslides throughout the region. In January, a cascading series of weather disasters led to historic Los Angeles wildfires that killed 29. 

 Texas — the US epicenter of extreme weather — has been hit by a string of compound events in recent years. The great freeze in 2021 that killed at least 200 people has been tied back to a series of compound events, as has last year’s record Smokehouse Creek Fire that had its roots in a massive 2023 drought that hit the Great Plains. 

 As the planet heats up and weather whiplash spreads, compound weather events are poised to wreak even greater havoc: A study published last year in Nature projected climate damages could cost the global economy $38 trillion (in 2005 dollars) per year by mid-century. 

 Deborah Brosnan, a climate risk scientist who heads up Deborah Brosnan & Associates, said the Los Angeles fires sharply illustrate the danger of multiple weather events leading to a larger disaster. The Palisades, Eaton and other blazes hit after the state saw two winters in a row of plentiful rains that allowed abundant vegetation growth. Last year was one of California’s warmest on record, which dried out that vegetation and ushered in a flash drought across the state’s southern half. The drought spread from roughly 17% of the state in late December to nearly 32% in early January when the fires started. 

 “LA experienced normal fires, but compounded by prolonged drought and high temperatures — both of which are associated with climate change — the outcome was worse,” Brosnan said. (Research found climate change made Los Angeles 35% more primed to burn.) 

 Coming up with direct costs for cascading events can be difficult because damage is often tallied by individual storms or fires. California’s fires unleashed damage that’s projected to reach $164 billion. In comparison, the financial toll of the drought that preceded them has yet to show up in any US government assessments. The compound event didn’t end once the fires were put out, either: The region has seen heavy rains falling on burn-scarred land, resulting in mudslides. 

 “It’s a good example of how all these things can play together to exacerbate the hazards that we’re all facing,” said Lou Gritzo, chief science officer at industrial insurer FM. “And that was just the alignment of those kind of weather events. You can argue that had any one of those not been in place, the consequences would have been significantly reduced.” 

 A similar situation occurred in Australia, where drought from 2017 to 2019 was followed by the 2019-2020 Black Summer Fires that tallied insurance claims of up to $1.5 billion. 

 Compound events have outsized impacts and they are relatively rare, making it difficult to research them, said Doug Richardson, a weather and climate research scientist at the University of New South Wales. 

 “We need to develop our models to better account for these sorts of interactions between different climate hazards at a spatial resolution that allows us to consider how these hazards might interact,” and to build a larger sample to assess the frequency of potential compound events, he added. 

 Not all cascading weather ends in flames, though. Flooding can occur when rain saturates soil and loosens vegetation, setting the stage for subsequent showers to have a greater impact. This was part of the mechanics around the Malaysian floods, which also got an assist from extreme tides. 

 The states of Sabah and Sarawak saw more than 27 inches (70 centimeters) of rain in January, which left soils saturated. Yet another storm hit just as tides reached their highest levels due to the alignment of the sun, Earth and moon, said Nursalleh bin Kasim, principal assistant director of the research and technical development region at the Malaysian Meteorological Department. 

 One extreme event can also beget another. Drought, for example, saps the soil of moisture. With no excess water to evaporate, the sun’s energy is instead redirected to heating the air. The resulting hotter weather then makes the drought worse. 

 “There can be a feedback back to the atmosphere,” said Ronnie Abolafia-Rosenzweig, a project scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research. 

 Larger climate impacts, such as sea-level rise, add to the perils as does building in exposed areas, Brosnan said. Notably, deforestation leads to greater risk of landslides while destroying mangroves and coral reefs worsens coastal flooding. 

 Events can also be “spatially compounding,” striking multiple regions at once, said Jakob Zscheischler, a compound event researcher at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany. He pointed to the fall 2024 floods that struck multiple parts of Europe as a prime example. The flooding, fueled by record rainfall from Storm Boris, killed at least 29 people and caused widespread destruction across countries from Italy to Poland to Romania. Munich Re estimated the compound event caused around $4.3 billion in damage, roughly half of which was insured. 

 “Climate change has already led to an increase in the amount of rain during such events and will continue to do so,”  Zscheischler said, “which puts pressure on infrastructure and transnational flood management due to multiple countries being affected at the same time.” 

 Brosnan warned that siloed emergency management means “we deal poorly with complex events where impacts spread widely through a system.” There are precedents for non-weather disasters, though, that could prove useful if the world is to adapt to more compound events. 

 Bruce Chong, director of climate and sustainability at engineering firm Arup, said Japan's culture of earthquake preparedness is one model to turn to. 

 “They know there are earthquakes,” he said. “At the everyday level, they are already aware and prepared across multiple aspects, including how tasks are shared between local communities and the government. It's become something that everyone faces together.”

There have been many naysayers in the last three decades who criticised Indian IT for only trading on its vast pool of trained manpower and putting them on client projects onsite and offshore. The clamour to build products and intellectual property out of India has been louder after the recent launch of StarGate from US and DeepSeek from China and there is an expectation that Indian innovation will come to the fore with a slew of large language models and AI products and platforms emerging from Indian startups and incumbent services firms.

The national and industry hype about human-centric AI solutions from India has also generated optimism! However, a reality check will show that we are still far from converting this mirage into real dollars.

What we lack are three key enablers — very weak levels of core research with the overall national levels of 0.7% of GDP falling far short of global averages of 3%. The ecosystem to support entrepreneurs through all stages of capital needs is also missing with angels, venture capitalists and private equity wanting definite returns in three to five years. 

And finally, do we really have a new breed of entrepreneurs who will focus on deep tech and product thinking and stay the course without getting distracted by the easy and profitable revenues of services? Participating in a $300 billion IT industry with successful forays into small and narrow language models and agentic AI applications seems to be the easy way to start and scale and in the case of existing players, to pivot and grab opportunity share.

Cities like Tianjin in China and organisations like Alibaba have invested wider and deeper in AI than we have done as a nation. With a visionary MeitY and a keen interest shown by Nasscom and all industry players, it is never too late, but we must try harder and take this second chance to change the trajectory and performance metrics of our technology industry.

Jaspreet Bindra, Founder, Ai&Beyond, India and Tech Whisperer, UK

India’s IT sector stands at a critical inflection point. The transition from a services-oriented model to a product and intellectual property (IP)-centric ecosystem requires fundamental shifts across multiple dimensions. First, Indian IT firms must substantially increase R&D investments, particularly in emerging fields like AI, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. \

This means allocating a higher percentage of revenue to fundamental research rather than focusing primarily on implementation services. Companies like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro have begun this journey, but the investment intensity needs to match global technology leaders who typically dedicate 15-20% of revenue to R&D. Encouraging collaboration between academia, industry, and government institutions will also be critical, enabling India to develop homegrown technological solutions tailored to both domestic needs and global markets.

India must streamline IP processes to ensure quick, efficient, and cost-effective protection of innovations, thereby boosting investor confidence and incentivising companies and entrepreneurs to focus on product development rather than merely services. Talent transformation is another essential pillar. To build cutting-edge products, India needs a workforce skilled in emerging technologies. This demands a comprehensive overhaul of educational curricula as well as internal company training and massive reskilling and upskilling programs.

Established IT firms can drive transformation by creating innovation hubs that operate with startup-like agility while leveraging enterprise resources. These entities should function as independent subsidiaries with specialised compensation structures that attract top-tier research talent globally.

By far the most important part is that the industry requires cultural transformation, embracing calculated risk-taking and tolerating the inevitable failures that accompany breakthrough innovation. The path from services excellence to technology leadership won’t be linear, but by orchestrating these changes, India’s IT sector can emerge as a formidable creator of IP and technological advancement on the global stage.

The first-of-its-kind reserve will be anchored by a stash of Bitcoin the government already owns, estimated to be worth billions of dollars.

By David Yaffe-Bellany

David Yaffe-Bellany reports on the cryptocurrency industry.

Follow live updates on the Trump administration here.

President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to create a national stockpile of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, an audacious idea that has been widely criticized as a scheme to enrich crypto investors.

The basis of the stockpile will be a stash of Bitcoin, estimated to be worth as much as $17 billion, that the United States has seized in legal cases over the years.

The order also calls for federal agencies to develop strategies to buy more Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, as long as those purchases do not generate extra costs for taxpayers.

“This Executive Order underscores President Trump’s commitment to making the U.S. the ‘crypto capital of the world,’” said David Sacks, the White House’s crypto and A.I. policy czar, in a post on social media. He said the United States would not sell any Bitcoin in the reserve, which he likened to “a digital Fort Knox.”

Since Mr. Trump took office in January, his administration has moved rapidly to elevate the crypto industry, a volatile sector that had battled with federal regulators for years. The Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped lawsuits against two of the biggest U.S. crypto companies and halted investigations into several others. And on Friday, Mr. Trump is scheduled to host crypto executives at the White House for a first-of-its-kind “crypto summit.”

Mr. Trump has a personal stake in the success of the crypto industry, creating conflicts of interests that have raised alarms with government ethics experts. Last year he started a business, World Liberty Financial, that offers a cryptocurrency called WLFI. Just days before his inauguration, he also began selling a so-called memecoin — a type of cryptocurrency tied to an online joke or a celebrity figure.

Bitcoin advocate and JAN3 CEO Samson Mow has accelerated his Bitcoin price prediction. He suggested that it could reach $1 million earlier than his model’s original 2031 forecast.

Mow cites the unprecedented White House support for Bitcoin (BTC) as a catalyst for this new timeline.

“Since getting into Bitcoin, what I’ve consistently found is that everything always happens faster than I expect. And now we have the White House promoting Bitcoin,” Mow stated in response to the White House’s tweet that “America will be the Bitcoin superpower of the world.”

Since getting into #Bitcoin, what I’ve consistently found is that everything always happens faster than I expect. And now we have the White House promoting #Bitcoin. That’s why my prediction is for a fast run to $1.0M. I’m front-running my own model which indicates $1.0M in 2031. https://t.co/0np0k65XYs

“That’s why my prediction is for a fast run to $1.0M. I’m front-running my own model which indicates $1.0M in 2031,” he added.

Mow’s comments come on the heels of the White House’s crypto summit, which took place on March 7. 

It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will invite JAN3 to be as involved with Bitcoin initiatives in the U.S. as it has been with El Salvador. 

Currently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and global financial institutions have expressed skepticism about El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy, primarily due to potential impacts on financial stability and money laundering risks. 

While JAN3 was not directly targeted, the regulatory climate surrounding its work in El Salvador is not without controversy. However, Mow does have the support of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele who plans to continue acquiring Bitcoin.

In January, JAN3 raised $5 million in seed funding to accelerate the development and marketing of the AQUA Wallet, a new Bitcoin wallet leveraging advanced Layer 2 scaling technologies like the Lightning and Liquid Networks. This funding also aims to support JAN3’s nation-state initiatives.

Mow launched JAN3 in 2022 with about $21 million in financial backing.

All is well again between Myles Garrett and the Cleveland Browns. The two sides have agreed on a contract extension that will pay the defensive end an average annual salary of $40 million over four years and includes $123.5 million in guaranteed money, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported.

With the extension, which includes a no-trade clause, Garrett will now be the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. (Las Vegas Raiders pass rusher Maxx Crosby previously held that title for four days after getting a contract extension last Wednesday.)

The new contract ends a five-week saga during which Garrett requested a trade, saying he wanted to win a Super Bowl rather than be part of a rebuilding project. The Browns attempted to start talks on a contract extension, but Garrett cut off negotiations following his trade request.

Cleveland officially announced the extension on social media.

— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) March 9, 2025

Browns general manager Andrew Berry repeatedly said that the team had no interest in trading Garrett and wanted to extend his contract. Team owner Jimmy Haslem refused to meet with the 2023 NFL Defensive Player of the Year when Garrett wanted to discuss his future with the Browns. Obviously, something changed between the two sides.

Garrett, 29, finished second in the NFL with 14 sacks last season, his fifth consecutive season with 12 or more sacks. Additionally, he had 47 total tackles, 22 tackles for loss, 28 quarterback hits and 83 total pressures, playing in all 17 of the Browns games.

He was named first-team All-Pro for the second straight year and fourth time in the past five years, along with earning Pro Bowl honors for the fifth consecutive season.

Garrett was the No. 1 overall pick by the Browns in 2017 out of Texas A&M. In his eight NFL seasons, he's compiled 102.5 sacks and 352 total tackles in 117 games (114 starts).

However, Cleveland finished 3-14 last season and doesn't appear in position to improve much from that in the near future as the team attempts to solve its quarterback dilemma while attempting to fix the stranglehold that Deshaun Watson's contract has on its salary cap.

The Browns go into the offseason with only $4.3 million in cap space, according to Spotrac, which doesn't leave much room to make key additions.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Manchester United: Thousands of fans protest against club ownership,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y40x9nvk9o,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 17:37:41 GMT","

Manchester United fans have been protesting against the Glazer family since it bought the club in 2005

Thousands of Manchester United fans joined the biggest protest against the club's ownership since Sir Jim Ratcliffe took a near 30% stake last year before Sunday's Premier League fixture against Arsenal.

In scenes reminiscent of those in August 2022 before a home game against Liverpool, huge numbers joined a near mile-long march to Old Trafford.

Scores of flares were set off as fans sang pointed and abusive songs towards co-chairman Joel Glazer and Ratcliffe, who has spent £1.3bn for a 28.94% stake in the club. 

As part of the deal, Ratcliffe has been allowed the freedom to make significant decisions over the running of the club.

Last month, it was confirmed there would be a second round of redundancies at the club, which will result in up to 200 people losing their jobs in addition to the 250 who departed last year.

Fans also sang about the mid-season decision to increase the price of matchday tickets to £66, with no concessions.

Ratcliffe says the decisions, which he accepts are unpopular, are necessary in order to slash losses, which last year exceeded £113m.

After the 1-1 draw with Arsenal, United manager Ruben Amorim said: ""I think this club will never die, that is clear. You feel it in the streets, not just in the stadium. 

""This is a big business and maybe all the fans around the league feel it's harder to go to the game and pay for the tickets. In the Premier League we receive a lot of money and they have to address that.""

Banners saying ""we want our club back"" and ""£1bn stolen'', referring to the amount spent on servicing the debt loaded on to United when the Glazer family bought the club in 2005, were on display at the protest. 

United's current total debt, including £300m in outstanding transfer fees, is in excess of £1bn. In the last financial year they paid £37m in interest on the debt.

The noisy protest arrived at Old Trafford at 16:05 GMT, then made its way under the Munich Tunnel.

The scenes were the kind it was thought Ratcliffe, a self-confessed Manchester United fan brought up in nearby Failsworth, was going to solve when he bought into the club.

But Chris Haymes, of The 1958 group that organised the protest, said Ratcliffe is being tainted by his association with the Glazer family.

""Sir Jim has to make some tough decisions but he seems to be a shield for the Glazers at the moment,"" he added. 

""It seems to be a real issue. He had one chance to make a good impression and I am not sure that is what he has done.

""This [protest] has nothing to do with football and it hasn't been for 20 years. The way the Glazers bought the club has been a burden on our backs for 20 years. Jim Ratcliffe has been making people redundant but United also paid £37m to the Glazer debt.

""The solution is the Glazers leave the club. Jim Ratcliffe will never seal his legacy at this club unless he removes the Glazers. It is as simple as that.""

The round of 16 is officially underway in the UEFA Champions League with several teams halfway to a spot in the quarterfinals after first-leg action. Arsenal, Aston Villa and Real Madrid all carry advantages heading into next week's second leg, though some leads are bigger than others. The Gunners beat PSV 7-1 on Tuesday and all but have a spot booked in the next round, while Real Madrid's 2-1 lead over Atletico Madrid is no guarantee that they will win the tie. On Wednesday, four other teams earned first-leg advantages -- Inter, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Liverpool.

Away goals no longer count in the Champions League, while the possibility of a penalty kick shootout looms for each team if the aggregate score is deadlocked after 120 minutes in the second leg.

As the countdown to the second legs begins, here's what each team needs heading into next week's action.

First leg score: Feyenoord 0, Inter 2

Inter made the most of their business trip to Rotterdam, coming out with a two-goal win thanks to strikes from Marcus Thuram and Lautaro Martinez. The visitors could have had a third but Feyenoord goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther made a stop on Piotr Zielinski's second-half penalty, a play that could prove crucial if the Dutch side are able to mount a comeback in Italy next week.

Feyenoord second-leg scenarios: Feyenoord will need a two-goal win to send the game to extra time and a three-goal win to advance outright.

Inter second-leg scenarios: Inter will advance with a win, draw or one-goal loss.

First leg score: Bayern Munich 3, Bayer Leverkusen 0

Harry Kane gave Bayern the advantage after just nine minutes, but the hosts were able to pad their lead in the second half after a series of mistakes from Leverkusen. Within the span of 20 minutes, Leverkusen's goalkeeper Matej Kovar gifted Jamal Musiala a goal, Nordi Mukiele was sent off for going studs up on Kingsley Coman, and Edmond Tapsoba conceded a penalty just minutes after coming on.

Bayern Munich second-leg scenarios: Bayern Munich will advance with a win, draw or two-goal loss.

Bayer Leverkusen second-leg scenarios: Bayer Leverkusen need a three-goal win to send the game to extra time and a four-goal win to win the tie outright.

First leg score: Benfica 0, Barcelona 1

Barcelona went down to 10 after just 22 minutes through Pau Cubarsi's red card, but survived a flurry of chances from Benfica and benefitted from Raphinha's second-half goal to give them a narrow first leg advantage. In the end, Benfica outshot Barcelona 26 to 10 but the expected goal margin was narrower – Benfica had 1.9 expected goals, while Barcelona posted just 1.19.

Benfica second-leg scenarios: Benfica need a one-goal win to send the game to extra time and a two-goal win to advance outright.

Barcelona second-leg scenarios: Barcelona will advance with a win or a draw.

First leg score: Paris Saint-Germain 0, Liverpool 1

Paris Saint-Germain outperformed Liverpool in an impressive showing for the youth-focused side, taking 27 shots to the Reds' two. Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson made nine saves, though, to keep PSG at bay and then Harvey Elliott gave the visitors the win with a goal in the 87th minute – and through the team's only shot on target.

Paris Saint-Germain second-leg scenarios: Paris Saint-Germain need a one-goal win to send the game to extra time and a two-goal win to advance outright.

Liverpool second-leg scenarios: Liverpool need a win or draw to advance.

First-leg result: Club Brugge 1, Aston Villa 3

Club Brugge may have an argument for being the better team in Tuesday's first leg after outshooting Aston Villa 11 to seven, but the visitors benefitted from an own goal from Brandon Mechele and a penalty scored by Marco Asensio to carry a healthy lead into the second leg. Villa remain the favorites to advance out of this tie and make their first Champions League campaign in four decades a special one by reaching the quarterfinals.

Club Brugge second-leg scenarios: Club Brugge will need a two-goal win to send the game to extra time, and a three-goal win to advance outright.

Aston Villa second leg scenarios: Aston Villa can advance with a win, draw or a one-goal loss.

First-leg result: Real Madrid 2, Atletico Madrid 1

The two Madrid teams traded opportunities throughout the first half, with the teams going into the break with a goal each thanks to strong individual efforts from Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Atletico Madrid's Julian Alvarez. Los Blancos' Brahim Diaz, though, scored the game-winner shortly after the break and the reigning champions steadily closed the game out.

Real Madrid second leg scenarios: Real Madrid will advance with a win or a draw.

Atletico Madrid second leg scenarios: Atletico Madrid need a one-goal win to send the game to extra time and a two-goal win to advance outright.

First leg score: PSV 1, Arsenal 7

Arsenal were as efficient as it gets in front of goal in Eindhoven, putting seven past the hosts and taking all the pressure off them in the second half. The Gunners managed the high-scoring game despite generating just 1.96 expected goals, and Martin Odegaard was a standout with two goals and an assist.

PSV second leg scenarios: PSV need a six-goal win to send the game to extra time, and a seven-goal win to advance outright.

Arsenal second leg scenarios: Arsenal will advance with a win, draw or even a loss by as many as five goals.

First leg score: Borussia Dortmund 1, Lille 1

In the only deadlocked first-leg result from Tuesday, last year's finalists Borussia Dortmund were unable to preserve their first half over Lille, who were one of the surprise teams to earn a spot in the league phase's top eight. Both sides will have all to play for next week when Lille will host as they aim for their deepest-ever run in the Champions League.

Borussia Dortmund second leg scenarios: Borussia Dortmund need to win in order to advance outright.

Lille second leg scenarios: Lille need to win in order to advance outright.

BOWLING GREEN, Ohio (AP) — Bowling Green hired former NFL running back and Tennessee State coach Eddie George on Sunday as the Falcons' head coach.

George was a four-time NFL Pro Bowl running back and an All-Pro, and was the 1996 AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year after winning the 1995 Heisman Trophy at Ohio State. 

George was the head coach the last four years at Tennessee State, where he was named the Big South-Ohio Valley Conference Coach of the Year last season. George led the Tigers to a share of the league championship and a berth in the Football Championship Series playoffs. He also was a runner-up for the Eddie Robinson National Coach of the Year award. 

He's the 21st head coach in Falcons' history and replaces Scot Loeffler, who left Bowling Green after six seasons to become the Philadelphia Eagles' quarterbacks coach.

Bowling Green President Rodney K. Rogers said George has embraced innovation and growth throughought his career, both in and out of football. 

“Eddie is uniquely positioned to bring this mindset to our football program, leveraging our momentum and generating excitement in this shifting landscape of collegiate sports,” Rogers said in a statement. ""In addition to his experience as a successful DI head coach, Eddie brings a deep understanding of holistic student-athlete development both in sport and in life, and we are excited for his leadership of this program.” 

In his career, George has been an actor who appeared on Broadway in New York, along with other business interests. He also has taught as an adjunct professor at his alma mater Ohio State and Vanderbilt University. George interviewed with the NFL's Chicago Bears for their head coach opening in January.

He took over Tennessee State with the Tigers averaging just three wins a year over the previous four seasons. He led them to consecutive winning records in 2023 and 2024 for the first time since 2016-17. Tennessee State went 9-3 in 2024 for the most wins since 2013 and a No. 19 ranking nationally. He is 24-22 as a head coach.

“I am overwhelmed with excitement and joy for the possibilities this opportunity holds,” George said. ""I’m also thrilled to be back in the great state of Ohio, where I played my college football. I look forward to meeting the team, the coaches, everyone in the athletics department and everyone in the BGSU and Bowling Green community.” 

George spent the 2004 season with the Dallas Cowboys before retiring in 2006. He finished with 10,441 yards rushing with 268 catches for 2,227 yards and had 78 total touchdowns. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011. His wife Tamara “Taj” George is a member of the group Sisters with Voices (SWV) and they have two sons. 

Tennessee State athletic director Mikki Allen thanked George for the foundation he laid as they start a new search. Allen is handling interim coach duties until George's replacement is hired.

BYU baseball came from behind in both games of its Saturday double header with Stetson, winning the first game, 5-4, and the night cap, 7-5, to capture the four-game series, 3-1, at Miller Park.

With the win, BYU improves to 10-5 on the year, while Stetson falls to 8-8. The Cougars have now won eight of their last 10-games, including three-straight series wins over CSUN (2-1), Gonzaga (3-0) and Stetson (3-1).

BYU senior first baseman Cooper Vest singled to left center with one out in the bottom of the ninth to score Crew McChesney for a come-from-behind, 5-4, victory in Game 1 of Saturday’s double header.

Cougar starter Jaden Harris threw a season-high five innings, surrendering just two hits while notching five strikeouts and holding the Hatters scoreless.

BYU scored two runs off a walk and two hits in the bottom of the first for a 2-0 lead. Ryder Robinson singled to left field and advanced to third on a fielder’s choice by Cooper Vest. Luke Anderson then doubled to left field to score Robinson and Vest for an early lead.

After six scoreless innings, Stetson got on the board in the top of the eighth with a run on two hits and a Cougar defensive error to cut the BYU lead in half, 2-1.

After holding BYU scoreless in the bottom half of the eighth inning, the Hatters took a 4-2 lead in the top of the ninth with three runs on four hits and a walk.

BYU fought back in the bottom of the ninth with a leadoff single by Parker Goff, followed by a walk from Keoni Painter. Crew McChesney then singled to right field, scoring Goff and advancing Painter to third. Robinson then flew out to right field to score Painter and tie the game at 4-4.

A stolen base by McChesney, followed by a walk by Easton Jones set up the Vest heroics as the senior singled to left center for the walk-off win.

In Game 2, BYU senior second baseman Brock Watkins went 4-4 and scored three runs in the nightcap to lead the Cougars to a 7-5 win.

BYU took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the second inning off a groundball to short by Ridge Erickson that scored Watkins, who had singled to open the inning.

Stetson answered back with a five-run third to take a 5-1 lead. The Hatters combined for five hits in the inning, including a grand slam home run. BYU responded in the fourth with a sacrifice fly by Erickson to right field that scored Watkins who had again singled to open the inning.

After three and a half scoreless innings by Cougar relievers Brayden Marx and Nolan Ficklin, the BYU offense struck for five runs in the bottom of the eighth to come from behind for a 7-5 victory.

With one out, Watkins singled, for his fourth hit of the night. Hansen then walked and Erickson singled to left center to score Watkins and move Hansen to second. Keoni Painter then reached on a ground ball that scored Hansen and sent Erickson to second. Tate Gambill then reach on a fielder’s choice that sent Tu’alau Wolfgramm–who had entered the game to pinch run–to third base.

With two outs, Robinson singled to centerfield to score Wolfgramm and tie the game at 5-5, while Gambill advanced to third. A double to left center by Jones, scored Gambill and Robinson for the 7-5 lead.

BYU lefty closer Justis Reiser came on in the ninth to retire the three Hatters he faced with two strikeouts and a groundball for the save. Ficklin closed out the eighth inning for the win, his second of the season.

BYU dropped its second-straight match to No. 5 USC 3-0 (25-27, 24-26, 20-25) in its first three-set loss at the Smith Fieldhouse this season on Saturday night.

BYU hit a .305 clip overall but were outblocked 11-4 by USC. Despite both teams recording 45 kills each, the Trojans found momentum and overtook BYU’s set points in both the first and second sets.

Senior outside hitter Luke Benson had a season-high hitting percentage of .630 combined with a match-high 18 kills to lead the Cougars.

Tyler Herget earned a match-high 38 assists, with Miks Ramanis and Keoni Thiim each securing 12 kills on the night.

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 40 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Denver Nuggets 127-103 on Sunday in a matchup between the top two teams in the Western Conference.

Gilgeous-Alexander had eight assists and made all eight of his free throws for the West-leading Thunder, who won their seventh straight game and improved to 53-11. Jalen Williams added 26 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.

Denver's Nikola Jokic, who along with Gilgeous-Alexander is a top contender in the NBA MVP race, had 24 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists. He was coming off the league’s first 30-20-20 triple-double in his team's 149-141 overtime victory over the Phoenix Suns on Friday night.

Michael Porter Jr. had 24 points and 15 rebounds for the Nuggets.

Denver went up 10-0 early as it took the Thunder nearly three minutes to score, but Oklahoma City cut its deficit to 29-28 by the end of the quarter.

The Thunder led 61-60 at halftime and took an 86-83 lead into the fourth quarter.

In a key sequence, Oklahoma City’s Aaron Wiggins stole the ball from Denver's Russell Westbrook, then Chet Holmgren dunked at the other end to give the Thunder a 98-91 lead with just under nine minutes remaining. Denver coach Michael Malone was called for a technical foul, and Williams made the free throw. Oklahoma City controlled the game from there.



  Takeaways
 

Nuggets: Jokic, normally the bully on the court, seemingly got frustrated with Oklahoma's 7-footers, Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein. He put up numbers but wasn't as dominant or smooth as he often is.

Thunder: Oklahoma City played at full strength after resting its key players, including Gilgeous-Alexander, during Friday's win against Portland.



  Key mo
 



  ment
 

Williams stole the ball from Jokic to spark a fast break. Oklahoma City's Lu Dort went up for a one-handed dunk that would have ignited the crowd, but he missed. Williams collected the rebound, then found Dort open in the corner. Dort knocked down a 3 that put the Thunder ahead 112-99 with just over four minutes remaining.



  Key stat
 

The Thunder committed just five turnovers.



  Up next
 

The teams meet again Monday night in Oklahoma City.

Manchester United’s players produced one of their most spirited performances of the season after fan protests in the street to draw 1-1 with Arsenal in the Premier League

Man United Draws 1-1 With Arsenal After Brilliant Late Save Denies Bruno Fernandes

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — A stunning double save from David Raya denied Bruno Fernandes a dramatic late winner for Manchester United against Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday. 

Raya's heroics salvaged a 1-1 draw for Arsenal at Old Trafford but its Premier League title looks all but out of reach with runaway leader Liverpool 15 points clear at the top of the standings. 

“I don’t want to say that, but today the frustration is that we haven’t won our game. We know the urgency and we are obligated to win every single match,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said after watching his team drop points for a third straight league game. 

And it could have been worse for second-placed Arsenal if not for Raya's brilliance. In added time the goalkeeper flung himself in front of Fernandes' effort from close range and then leapt to his feet to claw the spinning ball away just before it crossed the line.

Chelsea moved up to fourth in the standings after a 1-0 win against Leicester and Tottenham battled back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Bournemouth. 



  United fight
 

After fan protests in the street, United's players produced one of their most spirited performances of the season to draw with Arsenal. 

Thousands of United supporters marched in unity to protest the club's ownership before kickoff. But on the field Ruben Amorim's team produced a unified display of its own.

Fernandes fired home a free kick from around 20 yards in first-half added time and only a slew of missed chances stopped United from extending its lead after the break, with Joshua Zirkzee and Noussair Mazraoui forcing saves from Raya. 

Arsenal leveled through Declan Rice in the 74th, but needed Raya again to prevent Fernandes late on. 

Amorim accepted that United, which was forced to cede possession for much of the game, will have to be more adventurous if he is to achieve his goal of returning the 20-time champion to the summit of English and European soccer. 

And he believes there's another way to bring the good times back to Old Trafford. 

“What I can say is we need more Brunos, that is clear,” the United head coach said. “Not just the quality and the character, he makes some mistakes, but in this league the availability is so important and he is so decisive with and without the ball.”

The draw moved United up to 14th in the 20-team standings on 34 points. Last season the once dominant United endured its worst league campaign in 34 years when it finished in eighth place. It is currently eight points off 10th-placed Fulham. 



  Chelsea rises
 

Marc Cucurella struck a 60th-minute winner against Leicester at Stamford Bridge after Cole Palmer’s first-half penalty was saved. 

Victory boosted Chelsea’s chances of a return to the Champions League next season, moving it ahead of four-time defending champion Manchester City, which lost 1-0 to Nottingham Forest a day earlier.

The 2021 Champions League winner has not qualified for European club soccer's top competition for the last two years. 

But Enzo Maresca’s team took full advantage of City’s latest loss by edging out relegation-fighting Leicester and climbing into the top four. 

Cucurella’s long-range effort was drilled low into the corner to beat Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. 

Earlier, Hermansen had been the visitors’ hero when diving low to save Palmer’s penalty in the 22nd. It was the first time Palmer had failed to score from the spot in the league in 13 attempts. His 100% record from his previous 12 was a league record, according to the competition’s stats provider Opta. 



  Spurs fightback
 

Son Heung-min’s late penalty completed an unlikely comeback after Champions League-chasing Bournemouth had dominated the chances at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Marcus Tavernier gave the visitors the lead in the 42nd and Evanilson doubled the advantage in the 65th, while Justin Kluivert also hit the post. 

Pape Sarr’s miss-hit cross caught out Bournemouth goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and flew into the back of the net in the 67th to give Spurs hope. 

And it was Kepa’s error — bringing down Son in the box — that led to the equalizer from the penalty spot. Son stepped up and converted.

The Oklahoma City Thunder struck first Sunday in the first of a two-game series between the West's top two teams featuring the NBA's leading MVP candidates.

The Thunder rode a 9-0 fourth-quarter to open up a close game, then held off the Denver Nuggets for a 127-103 win. Oklahoma City outscored Denver by 21 points in the fourth quarter of what was previously a back-and-forth game between the Western Conference contenders.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 40 points, eight rebounds, five assists and three blocks to lead the Thunder effort. He scored seven straight Thunder points in a 1:20 span late in the fourth quarter to squash any hope of a Nuggets rally.

The 40-point game was the 11th of the season for Gilgeous-Alexander, who's seeking his first MVP award while leading the Western Conference-leading Thunder. He put up the big numbers in the first game since Nikola Jokić 's historic 31-point, 22-assist, 21-rebound effort against the Suns on Friday night that was the first 30-20-20 game in NBA history.

That game reasserted Jokić's place in the MVP conversation as he seeks the fourth MVP trophy of his career. Jokić had another strong effort with 24 points, 13 rebounds an nine assists on Sunday. But he struggled with his shot after appearing to tweak his right elbow in the first quarter as Gilgeous-Alexander and the Thunder got the best of his Nuggets.

Jokić had a wrap around his elbow on the bench after hitting it on the floor after a foul. It didn't limit his availability as he finished the game with 41 minutes. He had ice on his elbow in the postgame locker room, but head coach Michael Malone told reporters that his elbow was fine.

Nuggets forward Aaron Gordon left the game early with calf tightness and didn't return. His status moving forward wasn't clear after the game.

Jokić scored 14 of his 24 points in the first quarter as the Nuggets opened a 29-28 lead. The game remained close through the end of the third quarter as Oklahoma City entered the fourth with an 86-83 lead. But the fourth quarter was all Thunder.

Oklahoma City rode a 9-0 run to extend its lead to 103-91 with 7:28 remaining. Then Gilgeous-Alexander capped a personal 7-2 run with a 3-pointer that extended Oklahoma City's lead to 119-101 and put the game to bed with 2:14 remaining.

Eddie George is officially getting a chance to coach at the top level of college football.

George and Bowling Green have agreed to terms for the former NFL running back to become its next head coach. The deal is for five years, per ESPN. The Falcons were forced into an early 2025 coaching search when Scot Loeffler left to take an assistant coaching position with the Philadelphia Eagles.

""I am overwhelmed with excitement and joy for the possibilities this opportunity holds,"" George said in a statement released by the school. ""I'm also thrilled to be back in the great state of Ohio, where I played my college football. I look forward to meeting the team, the coaches, everyone in the athletics department and everyone in the BGSU and Bowling Green community.""

George has been the head coach at Tennessee State for the past four seasons. The Tigers were 9-13 in his first two seasons before moving to 6-5 in 2023 and jumping to 9-4 in 2024. Tennessee State made the FCS playoffs a season ago after tying for first in the Big South-OVC but lost in the first round to Montana.

George is a native of Philadelphia but a legend in the state of Ohio after starring at Ohio State from 1992-95. George capped off his Ohio State career with the Heisman in 1995 following a 1,826-yard season that included 23 rushing touchdowns along with 44 catches for 399 yards. George, a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, had 3,768 rushing yards with the Buckeyes and ranks fourth all-time in school history behind Archie Griffin, J.K. Dobbins and Ezekiel Elliott.

After George won the Heisman, he was a first-round pick of the Houston Oilers in 1996 before the franchise moved to Tennessee a season later. He rushed for over 1,000 yards in seven of his eight seasons with the franchise and had 64 total touchdowns.

He played the final season of his career with the Dallas Cowboys before retiring after the 2004 season. George finished his career with 10,441 rushing yards and 78 total touchdowns.

George’s hire is similar to Colorado’s move to hire Deion Sanders from FCS-level Jackson State. The Pro Football Hall of Famer has energized the Colorado football program. Bowling Green was 7-6 in 2024 and lost the 68 Ventures Bowl. The Falcons have gone to bowl games in each of the past three seasons but haven’t won a bowl game since the 2014 season.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Luke Loucks is returning to Florida State to take over as the coach of the Seminoles

Luke Loucks Returning to Florida State to Take Over as Seminoles Coach

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Luke Loucks is returning to Florida State to take over as the coach of the Seminoles.

Florida State announced the hire on Sunday. The 34-year-old Loucks is replacing Leonard Hamilton, who is stepping down at the end of this season.

A Clearwater native, Loucks played at Florida State from 2008-12. He averaged 7.1 points and 3.3 rebounds as a senior and was part of a Seminoles team that defeated Miami, Duke and North Carolina on consecutive days to win the ACC Tournament title in March 2012.

Loucks had been an assistant coach for the NBA's Sacramento Kings since 2022. He also has worked for the Golden State Warriors, helping the team win NBA titles in 2017 and 2018, and Phoenix Suns.

Loucks has not been a head coach at the college or NBA level. But his experience working with NBA coaches like Steve Kerr and Mike Brown, along with his knowledge of the challenges of Florida State’s job, made him an attractive candidate.

“We will have a standard that we stick to on and off the court that will help build a championship-level culture,” Loucks said. “I am privileged to have seen firsthand what winning feels like at Florida State, and I am hungry for more.”

After playing pro basketball for three seasons in Europe and one in the NBA’s developmental league, Loucks has focused on player development in his three NBA stops. In Sacramento, he was in charge of the Kings’ defense — an area that Hamilton prioritized during his 23 seasons as Florida State’s coach.

“Luke was an exceptional Seminole player who played a key role in leading Florida State to its first ACC championship,” said Hamilton, 76. “I’m very proud to see him return as head coach of a program he helped elevate to such great heights.”

Florida State (17-14, 8-12) is the No. 11 seed for the ACC tournament, playing on Tuesday in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Athletic director Michael Alford said the search included college coaches and assistant coaches with extensive experience. But administrators opted not to pay a significant buyout to a college coach and chose Loucks in a search that ramped up after Hamilton announced his plans on Feb. 3.

“Luke will bring a unique combination of qualities to our program, and I’m excited to begin the next chapter of our basketball history under his leadership,” Alford said. “Throughout basketball at both the professional and collegiate levels, Luke has earned a reputation as one of the rising stars in coaching.”

Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday he’s confident local communities can make their own decisions about whether to let trans athletes participate in women’s sports in a way that is “safe” and “fair” to young people.

“Look, I played in sports. Our kids played in sports. I want all young people to have the experience of playing in sports, every young person,” Schiff told ABC News’s Jonathan Karl on “This Week.”

“And I want those sports to be fair,” he continued. “I want those sports to be safe, and I have confidence that local schools and local communities can make those decisions without the federal government making them for them.”

Schiff’s remarks come as California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has made waves for bringing conservative media pundit Charlie Kirk on his new podcast and saying he agrees that it’s “deeply unfair” for trans women to compete in women’s sports.

While Schiff said the issue should be left to local communities to decide, he also said Democrats would be making a big mistake to focus on it instead of issues of the economy and affordability that matter more to constituents.

“We need to keep the focus on what matters most to the American people, and that is the economy,” Schiff said. “We need to be talking to people about how we’re going to improve their quality of life, and we can make sure that if they’re working hard, they’re earning a good living, to the degree that … we get away from focusing on those things I think it’s a mistake.”

Conference tournament previews: ACC | Big Ten | Big 12 | SEC

St. John's, not UConn, is in the driver's seat at Madison Square Garden this week.

Here’s everything you need to know about the Big East tournament.

Just like that, Rick Pitino is back and dominating in the Big East again. The Red Storm clinched their first Big East title since 1985 while climbing into the top 10. They ended the regular season winning 16 of their last 17 games, with the lone loss coming in a two-point battle at Villanova, and they survived at Marquette with a wild game-winner in overtime Saturday. Nobody seemed able to really compete with them in the conference slate.

Pitino has led St. John’s to a place it hasn’t been in decades. He’s now in a prime position to not only run the Big East, but contend for a national title once again during the comeback stage of his career.

The Huskies started out the season looking like a legitimate three-peat contender after dominating the sport over the last two years. The dream of a third consecutive title, however, is on life support.

UConn will enter the Big East tournament with just a 22-9 record and as the No. 3 seed. The Huskies plummeted out of the national rankings completely in February after suffering several bad losses, including twice to St. John’s, and to Xavier, Villanova and Seton Hall. It’s hard to count Dan Hurley and the Huskies out given their recent track record, but the back half of this season has not been kind to UConn. Without a dominant run at Madison Square Garden this week, it’s going to be hard to believe it can run it back a third time in the NCAA tournament.

Both Villanova and Xavier need some help this week to make the tournament. The Wildcats went just 18-13 this season, though they grabbed big wins over ranked St John’s, UConn and a 15-point blowout over Marquette late in the year. But they are still on the outside looking in entering the Big East tournament. Without a few solid wins at Madison Square Garden, they could miss the tournament for the third straight season under coach Kyle Neptune — which could very well cost him his job.

Xavier is in a similar boat. The Musketeers, after a rough start to Big East play, ended the year winning seven straight to get to 21-10 and finish tied for fourth in the conference. They also beat both UConn and Marquette, but those are really their only big wins. A run this week would solidify a trip back to the NCAA tournament after missing it last season.

Russell Henley’s dry spell is finally over.

Henley overtook Collin Morikawa late with a perfect eagle chip-in to grab a one-shot win at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill Club and Lodge in Florida on Sunday afternoon. It marked his fifth career win on the PGA Tour, and his first in more than two years. He posted a final-round 70 to get to 11-under on the week.

As a result, Henley took home a $4 million check.

The Arnold Palmer Invitational was the fourth signature event of the PGA Tour season. Those events carry a $20 million purse, which is among the highest offered this season and in line or greater than the major championships. The Players Championship, which returns next week at TPC Sawgrass, had the largest purse last season at $25 million.

Hideki Matsuyama won The Sentry to kick off the season, and then Rory McIlroy won the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in the second signature event. Both guys took home $3.6 million for their wins. Ludvig Åberg then won $4 million for his win at The Genesis Invitational.

Here’s a look at how much Henley and the rest of the field earned this week at Bay Hill Club and Lodge.

Conference tournament previews: ACC | Big East | Big 12 | SEC

Michigan State enters the Big Tournament as regular-season champions seeking to double dip as tournament champions after starting the season unranked.

Meanwhile, a handful of Big Ten teams will be sweating the NCAA tournament bubble. Here’s what to know about and what to watch for at the Big Ten tournament, including matchups, game times and TV channels.

After starting the season unranked, Michigan State has emerged as one of the nation's best teams and enters conference tournament play on a seven-game winning streak that includes five wins over ranked teams, two of them over rival Michigan.

The Spartans appear locked into a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament and will hope to make a case for a No. 1 seed in Indianapolis. It's a long shot that will require some significant help from the SEC tournament. Either way, the Spartans are playing their best basketball at the right time and are red hot entering tournament play.

Meanwhile, Michigan has been spiraling. After a 14-3 start to Big Ten play, the Wolverines have lost three straight and four of their last six, including Sunday's lopsided loss to Michigan State in the regular-season finale.

The Wolverines are slipping in NCAA tournament bracket projections and will look to re-find their footing with a run in Indianapolis.

Ohio State and Indiana enter Big Ten tournament play on the NCAA tournament bubble. Indiana appears to be the safer bet after beating Ohio State in their regular-season finale. Nebraska, meanwhile, appears to have played itself out of contention with five straight losses to end the season that left it out of the Big Ten tournament field.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news,The fabricated panic over antisemitism in the U.S. medical community conceals an attack on Palestinians,https://mondoweiss.net/2025/03/the-fabricated-panic-over-antisemitism-in-the-u-s-medical-community-conceals-an-attack-on-palestinians/,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

In 2024, I was disinvited from presenting a lecture on the health and human rights consequences of the Israeli assault on Gaza, by unnamed administrators at Harvard University, who (I was told) accused me of being an antisemite. At Geisel, the medical school affiliated with Dartmouth, I was also invited and then met with an “indefinite postponement” for a similar presentation. It is clear these have not been isolated events.

Two recent pieces provide an illustration of the current ideological battle taking place with in the U.S. healthcare community. First, a recent report on the suppression of speech at UCLA’s medical school shows the real-world harm antisemitism witch hunts are creating on medical campuses across the country. And then an error-riddled article from the Journal of Religion and Health provides a perfect illustration of how false charges of antisemitism are constructed and gives us a perfect case study in how to debunk the smears.

A January 2025 report prepared by the UCLA Task Force on Anti-Palestinian, Anti-Arab, and Anti-Muslim Racism offers a sobering picture of the growing suppression of speech and actions in medical schools and hospitals where there is support for Palestinian human rights and criticism of the genocidal assault on Gaza and the West Bank. The report reviews data from UCLA where over 24 medical students, residents, and faculty in the David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM) experienced intense targeting, gaslighting, harassment, doxxing, death threats, and job loss from both inside and outside the medical school in well-organized campaigns to suppress freedom of speech and to uphold the IHRA definition of antisemitism. The IHRA definition, which is highly contested in academic and progressive circles, defines antisemitism with the usual anti-Jewish tropes but then lists examples that are various forms of criticism of Israel and Israeli policies. These social media attacks quickly rose to the attention of high-level administrators, the media, and ultimately the U.S. Congress, threatening the targets’ mental and physical safety. 

UCLA courses on Structural Racism and Health Equity (SRHE) and Global Health, as well as classes on race and health inequities, were all vulnerable to attacks, particularly if they focused on Palestinian human rights. This repression and retaliation extended to other academic inquiries on racial justice, health inequities, and DEI initiatives and often targeted women of color. People were confronted in response to social media posts as well as for curricula, protests, statements, and buttons, and lectures were illegally recorded and weaponized. 

The administration from DGSOM and UCLA initially responded to the October 7 attack with a full-throated statement in support of Israel and subsequently refused to support academic freedom for students and faculty critical of Israeli policies. They also refused to condemn those who were making the attacks, reducing the ability of students to learn and understand health inequities and the social determinants of health, the impacts of race and class, etc. The repression often took the form of increased levels of surveillance and weaponized accusations of antisemitism, particularly when students described the assault on Gaza as a genocide.  

This pattern of behavior pre-dated the events of October 7. In 2021, a vigilante group titled the Jewish Faculty Resilience Group (JFRG) targeted instructors working in the Structural Racism and Health Equity course (SRHE) with accusations of antisemitism.  They were joined by a group called Do No Harm, a group self-described as “a national association of medical professionals combating the attack on our healthcare system from woke activists” and “protecting healthcare from the disastrous consequences of identity politics.” Much of this occurred under the pretense of preventing students from feeling “uncomfortable.”

The DGSOM administration repeatedly responded sympathetically to the antisemitism accusations while ignoring credible evidence of racism against Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims, and people supportive of Palestinian rights, as well as the well-documented violations of international law, statements from the UN, International Criminal Court, and the International Court of Justice. The Task Force noted that this behavior violates the faculty codes of conduct for both institutions. 

This is all particularly consequential because the repression and retaliation are not only designed to threaten and punish the targets immediately but also to impact their training and professional employment options in the future. This also creates a hostile learning environment that includes anti-Palestinian racism and hostility towards other races and social justice activities. As the Task Force stated: “UCLA DGSOM continues to maintain a toxic, discriminatory and psychologically unsafe work environment,” which creates an “inability for students to discuss their positionality when exploring racial justice…[and] leads to harassment and self censorship and loss of critical discussion.”

It was thus with particular curiosity that I read an opinion piece titled “Social Media, Survey, and Medical Literature Data Reveal Escalating Antisemitism Within the United States Healthcare Community,” in a somewhat obscure publication, Journal of Religion and Health. What I found was profoundly disturbing, but not unexpected. And provides a perfect illustration of the framing and definitions, of both antisemitism and Jewishness, that provide fodder for ideological battles and weaponization of the charge of antisemitism. 

The authors in the Journal of Religion and Health reported that antisemitism has been rising for decades in the US and has dramatically increased in the medical community as well. “Most surveyed US medical students [19 responses] and healthcare professionals [138 plus 6 residents or fellows] experienced Jew-hatred and reported a marked increase following October 7, 2023…nearly 90% of Jewish healthcare professionals and students reported exposure to antisemitism within their work or school environment after October 7, 2023. Similar results were seen in independent surveys of Jewish high school students, 71% of whom reported experiencing antisemitism.”

The investigators reviewed quantitated publications about antisemitism, social media posts, and disseminated a survey to members of Jewish medical organizations to which they received 170 responses. They found a two to more than five-fold increase in antisemitic postings and tropes. 75.4 % of Jewish-identifying students and professionals reported exposure to antisemitism, up from 49.3% pre-October 7, 2023. Jewish students and faculty reported feeling frightened, threatened, and silenced at work 

Antisemitism is a serious form of bigotry that has repeatedly been found to be rising in this country, mostly in the context of the explosion of rightwing fascism and hatred of Jews, women, LGBTQI folks, and people of color. Nonetheless, there are several serious flaws in this paper.

Who did they survey? The authors surveyed Jewish-identified health care providers, and in particular, named three groups: JPN, (Jewish Physicians Network), JOWMA, (Jewish Orthodox Women’s Medical Association), and Orthodocs, (Orthodox/Shomer Shabbos Jewish physicians and medical students). Half of these people reported experiencing antisemitic incidents in their lives pre-October 2023, which seems unusually high for the general Jewish population, in my personal experience working in a variety of health care environments.  While these folks represent a segment of Jews in the US, (approximately 10% of the Jewish population are Orthodox), it cannot be assumed that they represent all Jews. It seems the authors deliberately omitted Reconstructionist, Reform, and Conservative Jews, cultural Jews, unaffiliated Jews, and politically progressive, left-of-center Jews, such as members of Jewish Voice for Peace and If Not Now.  By failing to include less religiously inclined Jews who are still strongly identified with their Jewish heritage and prophetic traditions, Israeli Jews studying in the US, and anti-Zionist Jews, the authors have not reflected the diverse, complex, and sometimes contradictory Jewish community in the US and their perceptions of antisemitism.   

What definition of antisemitism did they use? The authors used the IHRA definition of antisemitism. This definition fails to situate antisemitism in right wing fascist ideology where it is currently exploding. 

The consequence of this is that anyone who criticizes the genocidal behaviors of the Israeli government and military since October 7, who places the Hamas attacks within the context of decades of severe Israeli oppression, occupation, and siege, who calls out the Israeli destruction of Gazan hospitals, universities, housing, water and sanitation infrastructure, the imprisonment and torture of Gazan health care providers, the weaponization of food aid and rising levels of starvation, the enormous numbers of injured and dead, 2/3 women and children, the highest number of child amputees per capita in the world… all of these folks are, by the IHRA definition, antisemites.

What experts did they quote? The authors used the FBI and ADL who in turn use the IHRA definition of antisemitism. As an example, they stated: “ADL Based on FBI crime statistics, the Anti-Defamation League has reported a more than 300% increase in antisemitic incidents between October–December 2023.” None of this has validity because the initial definition is deeply flawed. The ADL has also repeatedly been found to be an apologist for Israel masquerading as an anti-hate, civil rights organization.

What assumptions did they make?  The authors stated there has been a “Dramatic increase in campus antisemitism since the Hamas assault,” echoing the analysis from pro-Israel groups, Israeli hasbara organizations, and folks from Jewish organizations to college presidents to congresspeople who are all using the IHRA definition of antisemitism. 

Once again, the college students living in tent encampments calling attention to extremely disturbing Israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity reaching the level of genocide as defined by international human rights law and organizations, and the International Criminal Court, and International Court of Justice, were not engaged in antisemitic speech.  They were exercising their first amendment rights condemning a horrific bombing and killing campaign in Gaza with US-made planes, drones, weapons, and surveillance equipment. They were criticizing the politics and behavior of a country, not a people with a particular religious affiliation or attachment. Their calls for boycott, divestment, and sanction of Israel or US war-related industries were also not reflective of Jew hatred, but a desire to put pressure on Israel to stop destroying Palestinian lives and livelihood with total impunity, supported militarily and politically by the US government and our taxes. To dismiss voices of protest as “Hamas supporters” is highly inaccurate and misleading.

Who was left out of this analysis?  This focus on rising levels of supposed Jew hatred and Jewish fear is particularly concerning in the face of all the not-so-Jewish folks who were left out, who suffered verbal and physical assaults, doxxing, school expulsion, job suspension and loss, including medical students and faculty. The Institute for the Understanding of anti-Palestinian Racism has also documented high levels of racism against Palestinians, people perceived to be Palestinian, other Arabs, and allies who support Palestinian human rights and self-determination. This racism is layered onto the pervasive Islamophobia that is part of the US psyche and inflamed by the rhetoric of the current government. 

There will obviously be real antisemitic incidents, mostly from the extreme right as well as MAGA Republicans, less often from the left, as antisemitism persists in the brew of bigotries that flourish in the US.  But the distrust, discrimination, and hatred of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims is a far greater issue for our society. Accurately identifying these kinds of hatreds and separating antisemitism from principled criticism of Israel, will produce a more knowledgeable and tolerant society that will make lives for Palestinians as well as Jews safer in the future.  

What finally destroys this paper? The authors include this extraordinary sentence:

“Between 2014 and 2023, conflicts between Israel and Hamas have sparked false claims including accusations that Israeli and/or Jewish health professionals practice organ harvesting, withhold medical care from Palestinian Arabs, and deliberately target Palestinian healthcare workers and/or ambulances.” 

Newsweek, NBC, and other mainstream outlets reported that the Israeli military admitted to harvesting Palestinian organs from dead Palestinians without consent in the 1990s. The withholding of medical care from Palestinians and the deliberate targeting of Palestinian health workers and ambulances has been widely documented for years by many international and local human rights and health care organizations and became a defining characteristic of the latest attacks on Gaza and the West Bank.  If the authors question these established, factually well-documented pieces of information, then the credibility of the entire opinion piece is seriously called into question as anything beyond a piece of right wing Jewish and Israeli propaganda. 

Ultimately, I am inspired that despite the severe repression that folks in the healthcare world are facing from those using the accusation of antisemitism to silence critics of Israeli policy, health workers are still speaking up. They are using their experience and credibility to reject those accusations and to speak out against the blatant and internationally recognized violations of human rights that Israel is imposing on the Palestinian people. They are protesting in their white coats, advising and protecting students, challenging academic pushback, and living up to their obligation to heal not only patients but also the societies in which they live. 

Critiquing Israeli policies that have been condemned internationally, and the naming of war crimes and genocide where it exists, is part of our work and obligation as healers. It is also grounded in the teachings of prophetic Judaism and the work to create a more just world for everyone. Jewish exceptionalism is not a Jewish value. It bears repeating that never again means never again for everyone.

Prince Frederik of Luxembourg, the son of Prince Robert of Luxembourg and Princess Julie of Nassau, has died at the age of 22.

Prince Robert shared the news in a statement on the website for the POLG Foundation, an organization started by Frederik to help with treatments and a cure for the illness.

Frederik was born with PolG mitochondrial disease, a rare genetic condition.

""It is with a very heavy heart that my wife and I would like to inform you of the passing of our son,"" Prince Robert wrote in the statement, sharing that Frederik had died on March 1.

The day before on ""Rare Disease Day,"" Prince Robert shared that Frederik spoke with his family, including his brother Alexander and sister Charlotte, as well as cousins and other extended family, ""one last time.""

""After gifting each of us with our farewells – some kind, some wise, some instructive – in true Frederik fashion, he left us collectively with a final long-standing family joke. Even in his last moments, his humor, and his boundless compassion, compelled him to leave us with one last laugh… to cheer us all up.""

He also wrote that Frederik asked, ""Papa, are you proud of me?""

""He had barely been able to speak for several days, so the clarity of these words was as surprising as the weight of the moment was profound. The answer was very easy, and he had heard it oh so many times, but at this time, he needed reassurance that he had contributed all that he possibly could in his short and beautiful existence and that he could now finally move on,"" his father wrote.

The statement continued, ""Frederik knows that he is my Superhero, as he is to all of our family, and to so very many good friends and now in great part thanks to his POLG Foundation, to so very many people the world over. Part of his superpower was his ability to inspire and to lead by example.""

Prince Robert explained that Frederik was born with PolG mitochondrial disease.

Frederik wasn’t diagnosed until he was 14, ""when his symptoms were showing more clearly and when the progression of his disease had become more acute.""

The disease causes ""such a wide range of symptoms and affects so many different organ systems, it is very difficult to diagnose and has no treatments much less a cure. POLG disease is a genetic mitochondrial disorder that robs the body’s cells of energy, in turn causing progressive multiple organ (brain, nerves, liver, intestines, muscles, swallowing and ocular function, etc.) dysfunction and failure. One might compare it to having a faulty battery that never fully recharges, is in a constant state of depletion and eventually loses power.""

Prince Robert said Frederik ""jumped"" at the opportunity to create a foundation to find a cure.

""Though he always made it very clear that he did not want this dreadful disease to define him, he nonetheless immediately identified with and helped define the mission of The POLG Foundation.""

According to his father’s statement, Frederik created the look for the charity in the United States, and launched a MITO clothing line, encouraged by Donna Karan.

He also ""actively and literally gave of himself to develop multiple mouse models and cell lines in Switzerland, the United States, and Europe and to make these available to further facilitate research into POLG.""

Prince Robert concluded, ""On behalf of Frederik, Julie, Charlotte, Alexander, Mansour and the entire global POLG community, we thank you for helping this worthy cause that will honor our son. We will be resolutely focused on alleviating suffering for the POLG community and other diseases and conditions far beyond, associated with mitochondrial diseases.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Indian Wells star retires 10 minutes into match after bizarre nosebleed delay,https://www.express.co.uk/sport/tennis/2024788/Indian-Wells-Alex-Michelsen-Daniil-Medvedev-retirement,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 21:56:00 GMT","



Daniil Medvedev's match against Alex Michelsen was cut drastically short when the American retired after going 0-2 down. There was a bizarre start to the tie when, just six minutes in, play was paused as Medvedev started having a nosebleed. Both players headed to their benches while the No. 5 seed saw the physio.

However, it was Michelsen who was looking ropey during the delay. Play resumed but, just minutes later, the 31st seed approached the net and decided to call it quits. Medvedev later relayed that his opponent was likely suffering from food poisoning.

Medvedev was serving at 1-0 15-0 when he suddenly started marching to his bench, alerting the umpire that his nose was bleeding. The 29-year-old said he needed ""three, four, five minutes"" and asked for a napkin to stuff up his nose before the physio was called to the court.

""Medvedev gets immediate attention from Pierre, the very experienced tour physio, as he has a nosebleed,"" commentator Jonathan Overend said on Sky Sports, branding it the ""most peculiar"" start to the match.

Miles Maclagan added: ""Not much you can do about that. For some people it’s just the dry air, isn’t it? I think I remember this happening to Medvedev before. He’ll just take a couple of minutes. He didn’t seem completely surprised by it.""

Play resumed a few minutes later and, when cameras cut back to the action, the commentators noticed Michelsen looked under-the-weather during the break.

""What was quite interesting there, during the treatment for Medvedev, you spotted Miles, the camera cutting to Michelsen who was slumped forward in his chair,"" Overend remarked.

""That might be a suggestion that he is not feeling well. That might explain the way he played the first game.""

Maclagan, who is one of Andy Murray's old coaches, replied: ""It just might, and it was just his body language as well, we sort of half-joked, the big sigh after five points which is not exactly positive.""

Medvedev held serve, clearly unbothered by his nosebleed, and Michelsen played one more point, hitting a double fault before giving up.

""I think he's giving up, I think this is an early reitrement from Alex Michelsen. And that is not going to go down well with the crowd,"" Overend exclaimed.

""But it was the most bizarre couple of games from the talented young American, who has clearly got nothing to offer here and clearly not feeling well, not well enough to continue the match beyond two games and one point. The irony of it is, it's Medvedev who has received the visit from the tour trainer in the middle of that! I mean, poor guy.""

It's a disappointing early end to Michelsen's run in Indian Wells. The American was seeded at a Masters 1000 tournament for the first time and would have enjoyed the chance to test himself against two-time finalist Medvedev.

After the abrupt end, Medvedev addressed the crowd and admitted he was also excited to face the 31st seed. ""I played a very good first round so I was looking forward to playing Alex. I like the way he plays. I think it could be an interesting match,"" the former world No. 1 said.

""Unfortunate for him to get food poisoning or something like this. In team sports you get another guy replacing you. In individual sports, if you don’t feel good that day, there’s nothing to do. Hope he feels better soon. Looking forward to my next match.""

Medvedev will now face another American, 10th seed Tommy Paul, in a mouthwatering round of 16 clash.

In addition to winning 19 Grand Slam titles, including two singles championships, he was a coach, a club pro and a television commentator.

By Richard Sandomir

Fred Stolle, a popular Hall of Fame Australian tennis player who won 19 Grand Slam titles, including two singles championships, during a golden age for his countrymen internationally, died on March 5 at his home in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 86.

His granddaughter Sydney Bose said the cause was cardiac arrest. 

Stolle had his greatest success in the 1960s when he and other Australian players, like Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Roy Emerson and John Newcombe, dominated the sport in the pre-open era before professionals were allowed to join amateurs in 1968 to play in major tournaments.

Stolle was on the strong Australian squad that won the Davis Cup, the international men’s team event, from 1964 to 1966. 

But Stolle also lost three consecutive Wimbledon singles finals, twice to Emerson, from 1963 to 1965. Stolle once said that Emerson was a better athlete than he was and a “bit quicker around the net.”

Stolle won his first singles title at the 1965 French Championships (now the French Open), where he rebounded from losing an error-filled first set, 3-6, to overcome a fellow Aussie, Tony Roche, 6-0, 6-2 and 6-3 in the next three games.

COLUMBIA, S.C. – The University of Kentucky women’s tennis team suffered a 4-0 defeat to No. 25 South Carolina in an SEC matchup at the Carolina Tennis Center on Sunday. The Wildcats were unable to secure a victory in either singles or doubles as the Gamecocks dominated the match.

In doubles play, South Carolina won two of three matches. The Gamecocks’ top pairing of No. 36 Kaitlyn Carnicella and Sarah Hamner defeated Kentucky’s No. 87 fifth-year Lizzy Stevens and senior Ellie Eades 6-2. The third doubles match saw Helena Buchwald and Lauren Friedman beat junior Ellie Myers and freshman Tess Bucher 6-3. The second doubles match between freshman Asuncion Jadue and sophomore Julia Zhu and South Carolina’s Bella Larsson and Olympe Lancelot was left unfinished at 4-3 in favor of the Gamecocks.

In singles, Kentucky’s top player, Zoe Hammond, battled hard against No. 19 Sarah Hamner, but the match went unfinished with Hamner leading 6-1, 4-6, 1-0. On court two, Julia Zhu was edged out by South Carolina’s No. 92 Kaitlyn Carnicella, who came back after dropping the first set 2-6 to win the second 6-2. The match was also left unfinished. Kentucky’s Lizzy Stevens fought in a tough match on court three singles against Olympe Lancelot, but Lancelot led 7-6 (7-3), 3-0 when the match was called due to South Carolina securing the win.

The Gamecocks clinched the victory with wins at four, five, and six singles. Misa Malkin defeated Tess Bucher 6-1, 6-1, while Bella Larsson dominated Ellie Myers 6-1, 6-0. At six singles, Helena Buchwald closed out Asuncion Jadue 6-4, 6-3.

The loss drops Kentucky to 5-6 overall. The Wildcats will look to bounce back when they travel to Norman, Oklahoma to take on the Sooners on Friday.

Men's Tennis
3/9/2025 2:17:00 PM


MALIBU, Calif. — If the Pepperdine men's tennis team was rusty, it certainly didn't show it.

Making their return from a 10-day break from dual match action, the No. 28 Waves routed the No. 39 Vanderbilt Commodores 5-1 at Ralphs-Straus Tennis Center on Sunday afternoon.

After taking the doubles point, the Waves (8-5, 1-0 WCC) got straight-set wins from David Fix, No. 47 Maxi Homberg and No. 69 Edward Winter to win the match. From there, only two matches were played out: Vanderbilt got on the board with a win on court five, then Lasse Poertner wrapped up the match with his straight-set win on court four.

Unlike last year's match between the two teams, which Homberg clinched in a 4-3 win, Sunday's match was relatively one-sided. The biggest challenge Pepperdine had to overcome was in doubles play, which saw Vanderbilt take a lead on court one and hang around on the other courts before the Waves seized control late.

Pepperdine's doubles wins came from familiar places. On court three, the freshman duo of Pisaric and Poertner traded breaks with Henry Ruger and Giuseppe Cerasuolo before the Waves broke the Commodores on deciding point for a 4-2 lead. The match was played on serve from that point forward, and the Waves wrapped up their 6-3 win when Pisaric's serving set up an easy overhead from Poertner at the net.

Moments later, the Waves' veteran team of No. 72 Linus Carlsson Halldin and Homberg clinched the doubles point with their 6-4 win over Pablo Martinez-Gomez and Danil Panarin. A break point winner from Pepperdine in the third game was the difference, as both teams served out the match. Despite Vanderbilt saving a match point on deuce point in the ninth game, Carlsson Halldin served out the 6-4 win, which Homberg clinched on an overhead at the net.

Not letting up in singles play, the Waves won four first sets en route to winning four straight-set matches. On court six, David Fix broke Hugo Coquelin in the fourth game and blazed through his first set to win 6-1 in less than 25 minutes. Fix promptly went up a break in the second set before a love hold from Coquelin got the Commodore sophomore on the board. After Fix broke Coquelin on deuce point for a 4-1 lead, Coquelin eventually climbed back in the match, tying the score at four games all. But Fix broke Coquelin in the ninth game and served out his 6-1, 6-4 win — his fifth victory of the year.

The next 10 minutes were a barrage of match points.

Over on court two, No. 47 Maxi Homberg served out his 6-3, 6-1 win over Danil Panarin. After winning his first set, Homberg rattled off five-consecutive games in the second set before Panarin broke Homberg on deuce point to get on the board. But Homberg returned the favor in the next game, breaking Panarin at deuce by working his way up to the net and winning a 12-hit rally.

Moments later, No. 69 Edward Winter broke Nathan Cox on court one to clinch the match with his routine 6-2, 6-1 win. In the second set, the Pepperdine sophomore broke Cox in the first game before taking a double-break lead in the fifth game. In Cox's final service game, Winter went up 40-30 before Cox double-faulted on match point, handing the match to Pepperdine.

Two of the remaining matches were played out. Henry Ruger helped Vanderbilt avoid the sweep on court five with his straight-set win, then Lasse Poertner capped off his 6-2, 6-1 victory over Michael Ross on court four.

Pepperdine stays in Malibu for another ranked match against #46 Middle Tennessee State on Tuesday. First serve is at 2 p.m.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn.– Despite a trio of singles wins, including No. 121 Jack Loutit’s second top 30 win in three days, Kentucky (9-6, 2-3 SEC) dropped its second Southeastern Conference road match of the weekend, falling 4-3 at No. 19 Tennessee (11-6, 2-3 SEC).

In doubles action, Tennessee jumped out to early leads on all three courts and never looked back. Shunsuke Mitsui and Alan Jesudason bested Charlelie Cosnet and Jaden Weekes 6-2 on court two. The Vols clinched the opening point with a 6-4 win from Jan Kobierski and Jose Garcia over Martin Breysach and Matt Rankin on court three.

In singles play, the Cats rallied from some early deficits to take four of the six first sets, including a pair of tiebreakers from Cosnet and Loutit.

No. 25 Mitsui doubled the home team’s lead with a 6-3, 6-2 win over No. 53 Weekes on the top court, but a quick 6-2, 6-2 win from Rankin at No. 5 earned the Cats first win of the match and pulled the visitors back within one.

Loutit would help pull the match even with a straight sets win over No. 29 Alex Kotzen at No. 2. Already taking down No. 27 Ryan Colby of Georgia on Friday, Loutit carried the momentum to Knoxville and turned around early break deficit and never looked back, winning 7-6 (3), 6-3.

Three third sets would decide the match, as Cosnet, Eli Stephenson, and Eric Crivei all had to play deciding sets. Cosnet was able to give the Cats their first and only lead of the match, as he rebounded from losing all six games in the second frame to blast Garcia in the third frame and take the 7-6 (3), 0-6, 6-2 victory.

Needing only one more point to clinch the victory, the Cats were unable to win either of the remaining matches. Playing in his first career SEC match, Crivei responded strongly to a first set defeat to send the match to a third, but ultimately fell 6-3, 4-6, 6-0.

The dual would come down to Stephenson at No. 4, but the Louisville native was unable to hold his lead and seal the deal. Taking the first set, the sophomore was pushed to a third set that remained tied until a break from Garcia in the ninth game. Stephenson had two break points in the next game to extend the match, but dropped the 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 decision.

Kentucky will return to the Boone next week, hosting LSU on Thursday, March 13 at 5 p.m. ET and Vanderbilt on Saturday, March 15 at 1 p.m. ET. Admission to all home matches is free.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Florida women’s tennis falls to reigning NCAA champs in unusual dual match,https://www.alligator.org/article/2025/03/florida-women-s-tennis-falls-to-reigning-ncaa-champs-in-unusual-dual-match,"Sun, 09 Mar 2025 20:07:00 GMT","

UF freshman tennis player Talia Neilson-Gatenby talks about her childhood.

Games moved indoors at the last second, the lights going out in the indoor courts and only singles matches being played, are all unusual events for a typical dual match. But, in Sunday’s meet against No. 3 Texas A&M, all of the above occurred.

Florida women’s tennis’ match against the Aggies was scheduled for noon but began an hour earlier due to inclement weather. However, the delay proved not enough. At around 10:50 a.m. it began to rain during warmups, forcing all activities to shift into the Penny Indoor Facility in Gainesville, which only has three courts, compared to the six outside.

Since only three singles matches could occur at once, the umpires decided to have the teams compete in singles first and then use doubles as a tiebreaker, if needed. While things seemed to settle down, the lights on courts two and three went out, causing a five-minute delay for all three matches.

Sunday’s chaos-filled match was ultimately controlled by the Aggies, who took care of the Gators in Gainesville, sweeping UF 4-0. Florida has now lost six of its last eight contests, which includes a 1-4 run against SEC opponents. 

The Aggies have continued their success from last season, where they won the 2024 NCAA Team National Championship. Texas A&M came into Sunday with an overall record of 14-1 and a perfect 4-0 in conference play. The No. 3 ranked team took down No. 6 Auburn 4-3 on the road, despite trailing 3-1 at one point.

In Florida’s last outing on Friday, it unexpectedly took down No. 9 Texas at home. With the scores tied at three points a piece, freshman Nikola Daubnerova won her singles match in three sets to secure Florida’s first SEC victory of the season. The victory was much needed for Florida as it looked to improve on its early season form and continue its fiery momentum against No. 3 Texas A&M.

Florida showed great struggles in singles. Two of the four matches were decided in straight sets, with the Aggies winning nine of the 11 completed sets. Of the nine lost for UF, two were decided by two or fewer games. 

Still dealing with back and wrist pain, junior Rahcel Gailis took on A&M’s No. 3 senior Mary Stoiana. Gailis was troubled by her injury all match, as she was forced to serve underhand, which she did against Texas as well. 

That Florida junior showed some fight in the first set while tying things at three, but would lose 6-3. Stoiana then secured the second set comfortably 6-1 to earn a straight-sets victory. For Gailis, the loss was her first in singles since Feb. 4 against No. 7 Michigan.

On court three, freshman Talia Neilson-Gatenby faced No. 51 junior Mia Kupres. Despite losing the first set 6-1, Neilson-Gatenby fought back to take the second set 6-3. However, Kupress took control in the third set, defeating the UF freshman 6-1. 

The Aggies grabbed their third point on court two where Floria’s senior Alicia Dudeney competed in a three-set thriller against A&M’s No. 15 junior Nicole Khirin. 

Despite falling behind 4-1, Dudeney forced a tiebreaker in the opening set. Still, Khirin would go on to win. Dudeney bounced back, fighting off Khirin to take the second set 7-5. However, Dudeney was out of gas by the third set, as she lost to the top-15 opponent 6-0.

To finish the dual match, A&M’s No. 57 sophomore Luciana Perez took down Daubnerova in straight sets. After losing the first set 6-1, Daubnerova showed fight by taking a 3-1 lead in the second set. Perez finished the job, claiming the second set 6-4 to secure the contest victory for the Aggies.

With this result, the Aggies maintain a perfect 5-0 record against SEC opponents, while the Gators are now 1-5 in  SEC play. 

Florida is 4-6 on the year and will head back on the road starting Friday to take on No. 22? Mississippi State.

Georgia Southern men's tennis senior Laurent Julia Calac has been named the Sun Belt Conference Men's Tennis Player of the Week, announced earlier this week by league officials.

Calac was unbeaten in singles and doubles as the Eagles had a perfect weekend in Birmingham. He teamed with Aaron James Williams to defeat Samford's No. 1 doubles team, 6-3, for the duo's ninth consecutive win, then collected a straight-set win over Sebastian Harrison in Georgia Southern's 5-2 victory over the Bulldogs. 

The Reutlingen, Germany, native then collected another straight-set singles win on Sunday, beating UAB's Hoan Mouret in the Eagles' 6-1 victory over the Blazers. It was his third straight singles win.

Calac is the third Georgia Southern men's tennis player to earn a Sun Belt Player of the Week accolade this season, joining Aaron James Williams (January 22) and Pierre Mouesca (February 19). It is the first career honor for the senior.

ORLANDO, Fla. – The TCU women's tennis team suffered its first defeat in Big 12 play on Sunday afternoon as the Horned Frogs fell to No. 23 UCF, 4-1, at the USTA National Campus.

LEE'S THOUGHTS

""Tough battle today. Really proud of the team for how we responded after the doubles. It wasn't our best doubles performance of the year, and we could've easily lost confidence after that point and let it impact singles. But we came out strong, took three first sets, and had chances on the other three courts as well. It always hurts to lose, but I think this was one of those matches where we really built belief in ourselves. I'm confident that if and when we face them again, we will be successful. We have a top-15/20 matchup this Friday at home, and we are pumped for this opportunity.""

THE RUNDOWN

In doubles, the Frogs fell on courts one and two. Olivia Lincer and Hannah Rylatt took down No. 23 Jade Otway and Isabel Pascual on court one, 6-1. The Knights' pair of Aya El Aouni and Sophia Biolay defeated Helena Narmont and Yu-Chin Tsai, 6-1, on court two to clinch the doubles point.

In singles, Tomi Main put the Frogs on the board with her straight-set win on court five, defeating Olivia Bergler 6-4, 6-3.

Yu-Chin Tsai and Cayetana Gay both won their first sets and were in the third set when the match was called.

ORLANDO - Led by a dominating front-three performance in singles, the No. 23 UCF women’s tennis team took care of business against No. 40 TCU at the USTA National Campus on Sunday afternoon.

Dawning the Citronaut Blue for the second match this season, the ‘Nauts took flight early and never looked back, moving to a perfect 4-0 in Big 12 play with wins over a trio of top-40 teams.

A key feature of the Knights’ vibrant start to conference play has been through some incredible doubles displays, with today’s performance no different. While TCU garnered the first point in each of their first three Big 12 matches, the Knights never let the Horned Frogs gain any momentum with early breaks throughout.

Sophia Biolay and Aya El Aouni set the tone with their fourth-consecutive win on court two, defeating Helena Narmont and Yu-Chin comfortably, 6-1. Minutes later, Olivia Lincer and Hannah Rylatt tallied their second-straight top-25 win on court one, defeating No. 23 Jade Otway and Isabel Pascual, 6-1.

Ranked in the first preseason poll, the tandem look primed to return to the field, with their wins leading the Knights’ display highlighting a 10th doubles point of the season.

In singles, each first set reached the 10-game mark as the team’s split favors. Unsurprisingly, the Knights jumped out to lead on the front three, a common hallmark of the squad’s 27-2 record on courts one through three entering this afternoon’s contest.

Not to leave Orlando empty-handed, TCU leveled the match with a win on court five, as Olivia Bergler couldn’t find her footing against Tomi Main. The shift in momentum was short-lived and insufficient, though, nixed by Olivia Lincer’s seventh win of the season, besting TCU’s Raquel Caballero-Chica, 7-5, 6-4. 

After claiming the program’s first Big 12 Player of the Week honor after a dominating weekend on the road, El Aouni had to bounce back for the first time in her collegiate career. After being handed her first loss of the season against No. 15 Baylor, the Moroccan was emphatic in her triumph over Jade Otway today, taking the duel in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.

The front-three sweep and clinch came from Biolay as the senior dropped just four games en route to her 6-3, 6-1 victory over TCU’s Isabel Pascual. 

On six, Rylatt responded after a first-set defeat to push her bout to a third, while Jade Psonka was up 5-4, looking to do the same.

UP NEXT

The Knights will conclude their four-match homestand as it welcomes No. 59 Iowa State on Friday, March 14, before facing No. 49 Kansas on Sunday.
