As earnings season begins, filings to the SEC point to uncertainty from the current administration as potential trouble for business.

Elon Musk’s sweeping makeover of the federal government in recent weeks is reverberating across the private sector, where companies have started expressing fear and uncertainty about disruptions these changes  might inflict on their businesses.

As the year’s first earnings season kicks off, dozens of companies in health care, technology, real estate and defense — industries that  might have expected rising profits from President Donald Trump’s business-friendly campaign posture — are warning investors in their quarterly reports and conference calls that the effects of rapid change in Washington are unpredictable and could hurt their bottom lines.

“I hope over time that DOGE can potentially become a tailwind for companies like us who are focusing on the federal government,” Carl Eschenbach, CEO of human-resources software maker Workday, said at an investor conference Tuesday.  “But right now, there is a lot of uncertainty, and I don’t know when that’s going to tip.”

The concerns come as Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service, which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, cuts a chaotic path through the government to reduce spending. Large numbers of federal workers have been fired and reinstated, contracts have been canceled then restored and lawsuits challenging DOGE’s actions have put some initiatives on hold and allowed others to go through.

Federal government contractors say they are still unclear which parts of their businesses may be on the chopping block. The administration is seeking to cut nonessential contracts from every department, according to an email the acting GSA administrator sent to all agency heads last month, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post.

The uncertainty has spread even to some companies that don’t directly rely on government contracts. For example, some drugmakers warned that cuts to the Food and Drug Administration could slow drug approvals. And two real estate businesses with large footprints in Washington, D.C., said that mass firings of federal workers could decrease demand for their properties.

Investors are paying attention. Since November, the stock prices of a group of companies with the most potential exposure to DOGE underperformed the S&P 500 index by 20 percent, according to an analysis last month by the investment bank Barclays.

“What do you do right now? Do you invest? Probably you want to wait a little bit to see exactly what happens at the end of the day,” Dominique Toublan, head of U.S. credit strategy at Barclays, said in an interview. “Even on its own, we know uncertainty, risk, ambiguity, can feed on itself and create a slowdown in the economy because people have a hard time deciding how they want to spend, how they want to invest.”

Businesses have mostly stayed quiet about DOGE until recently, when warnings started appearing under legally mandated sections of their quarterly investor reports. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires all publicly traded companies to list significant risks to their businesses. These so-called “risk factors” include shifts in competition, regulation and consumer tastes.

Trump campaigned on a business-friendly agenda, including plans to pare  environmental regulations and further slash the corporate tax rate, which he cut during his first term from 35 percent to 21 percent. Weeks into his second term, business groups have applauded his steps toward expanding oil and gas production and lifting  SEC rules they saw as onerous.

But a review of SEC filings and earnings transcripts shows the corporate view of the administration is mixed. In addition to the warnings about DOGE, business groups including the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce have urged Trump to back off his plan for tariffs, saying they raise the costs of doing business.

Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that Trump has worked to help businesses by lowering taxes, rolling back regulations and driving “historic investments” in the country.

A spokesman for DOGE did not respond to requests for comment.

Some executives have struck an optimistic tone in public remarks, emphasizing that the products and services they provide government agencies are essential and likely to be spared from cuts. In SEC filings, though, a number expressed worries.

“DOGE is a huge win for us,” Eric DeMarco, CEO of military drone-maker Kratos, said during a call with analysts Feb. 26. But in a Feb. 5 filing with the SEC,  the company said: “The potential impact of DOGE and the President’s potential intentions on the Defense and National Security industry, and the Company, if any, is unknown at this time.” Kratos, which reported $762 million in sales from U.S. government customers last year, did not respond to a request for comment.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered subordinates to submit plans for a potential 8 percent budget cut in each of the next five years, with limited exemptions.

John Heller, CEO of technology and engineering firm Amentum, told analysts on Feb. 5, “We still have to deliver services to 330 million citizens, and doing that in a more efficient way should create opportunities for companies that have the ability to deliver more efficient methods and processes and technology.” But in a filing the same day the Chantilly, Virginia-based company warned that a decline in defense spending “could have an adverse impact on our business.”

Amentum derived more than $5 billion in revenue from U.S. defense and intelligence contracts last fiscal year, according to company filings, but DOGE said it canceled contracts for Amentum and its subsidiaries worth $35.3 million in recent weeks.

Chanel Mann, a spokeswoman for Amentum, acknowledged losing almost 1 percent of the company’s revenue “as a result of the new administration initiatives,” but declined to discuss other specifics around DOGE.

Marc Steinberg, a law professor at  Southern Methodist University and former enforcement attorney at the SEC, said in an interview that it’s not uncommon for executives to present a more rosy picture in earnings calls, where they are more free to use “puffery” than in required SEC disclosures, which protect companies from investor lawsuits.

“What happens with some frequency is in these earnings calls, there is an upbeat tone of optimism, irrespective of some of the surrounding circumstances,” Steinberg said. “In the SEC filings, more precise disclosure is called for.”

Still, not all companies are reporting risks from the new administration, even within the same industry.

Drugmakers ImmunityBio, PMV Pharmaceuticals, Rezolute and Ventyx Biosciences said in filings that cuts in federal staffing could hurt their business plans, which hinge on getting the FDA to approve their new products within a predictable time frame. The Trump administration fired hundreds of FDA probationary employees — though some were rehired — and the agency faces the prospect of further cuts.

“Disruptions in how the FDA operates due to these policies may materially adversely affect our business,” read a public filing last month by Rezolute, which makes drugs for people with hypoglycemia.

But Eli Lilly, the most valuable U.S. health-care firm, and some other larger pharmaceutical companies have said they are not overly worried. In an interview with The Post on Feb. 26, Dave Ricks, Eli Lilly’s CEO, said the FDA is insulated from deep staffing cuts because half of its $7.2 billion budget comes from “user fees” from companies seeking approval for their prescription drugs and medical devices.

“Almost all of the innovative drug personnel are funded through user fees, not taxpayer dollars,” Ricks said. “So it’s not like the government saves money if they eliminate the people.”

Marty Makary, Trump’s nominee to lead the FDA, said during his confirmation hearing Thursday that he would conduct his “own independent assessment of personnel.”

Encompass Health, one of the nation’s largest operators of rehabilitation hospitals, disclosed in its annual securities filing  Feb. 28 that it “cannot predict” whether DOGE and other regulatory changes could result in cuts to Medicare spending, which makes up a large portion of the company’s revenue.

Trump has insisted he won’t cut benefits to Medicare, the federal program providing health insurance to seniors, and Medicaid, which provides health coverage to Americans with low incomes and disabilities. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that the only way to meet a directive in the proposed House GOP budget, passed Feb. 25, to cut at least $880 billion from health care spending over 10 years would be to cut Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

“We are in a period of great uncertainty with headwinds in the health care provider space,” Mark Ordan, CEO of Pediatrix Medical Group, a national physician network, told financial analysts Feb. 20.

An analyst on the call responded with a quip: “All of us are checking Twitter on a daily basis for sort of nebulous headwinds.”

The technology industry, with close ties to Musk, is one of the few sectors sounding widely upbeat about DOGE. Tech executives have effused that the efficiencies Musk says he hopes to achieve at federal agencies will only be possible with their products.

At a Morgan Stanley conference this month, Brian Robins, finance chief for San Francisco-based software maker GitLab, said GitLab is aligned with the goals of DOGE, because the company’s software tools aim to help people do more with less.

“What the Department of Government Efficiency is trying to do is what GitLab does,” Robins said.

At the same conference, Mark Lynch, the chief financial officer at Appian, a McLean,  Virginia, developer of software tools, expressed some optimism that his company will keep its federal agency customers, which include the Commerce, Defense, Education and Energy departments.

“There's a hurricane going on in the federal government right now, and we're in the basement,” Lynch said, “So we're kind of protected, but, you know, we're still not immune to it.”

Apple Health, KanCare, ARHOME, Med-QUEST, and Medi-Cal: What do these have in common?

They're all Medicaid programs.

States, which administer Medicaid after receiving federal funds, often change the name of the program, sometimes even branding it to reflect state pride, such as Husky Health in Connecticut or SoonerCare in Oklahoma. They also change the name of the federally funded CHIP healthcare program for children, at times with cutesy names like PeachCare for Kids in Georgia and CubCare in Maine.

Some Medicaid programs even have a private insurer's name attached to it because many states farm out contracts to managed care organizations, or MCOs, to administer the programs.

Those changes, though, can cause confusion. A pair of recent studies noted that state-specific names and MCO plan designs can prevent people from realizing they are receiving a public benefit.

That disconnect adds to the larger confusion over Medicaid itself, who it covers, and why. It simply isn't a poor people's program, a stigma that motivates states to change the name in the first place. It covers our children, grandparents, and Americans with disabilities.

As cuts to government healthcare programs become a real possibility, experts say it's crucial for Americans to understand the scope and necessity of the Medicaid program.

"It's one of those situations where our best intentions can backfire," said Jessica Calarco, a sociologist and professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

"When we change the way these programs operate, when we refuse to use words like welfare, it makes it more difficult for people to understand who is and who isn't benefiting from these programs and to see the benefits that they themselves are getting as well."

While Medicaid is a joint federal-state program, "states administer Medicaid programs fairly independently," Melissa Hafner, a health policy researcher at the American Institutes for Research, told Yahoo Finance.

Certain groups must be eligible for the program, and specific core benefits must be included under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, which established Medicaid.

"But beyond that, states have a lot of flexibility in the scope of their Medicaid program," she said.

That includes who's eligible, what services enrollees can receive, what states will pay for Medicaid services, and how states pay — either directly to healthcare providers or through MCOs, which are often private health insurers.

The federal government provides a portion of the funding to a state’s Medicaid program. States with higher rates of poverty receive a higher federal match.

Nationally, 1 in 5 people are on Medicaid, according to KFF. That includes nearly 2 in 5 children, 1 in 6 adults, over 1 in 4 adults with disabilities, almost 1 in 2 children with special healthcare needs, and 5 in 8 nursing home residents.

In fact, Medicaid is the only federal program that offers Americans long-term care insurance. Medicare does not, and the need for this type of care is only becoming more acute as the baby boomers age and can no longer care for themselves.

Medicaid also covers 41% of all births in the US, 29% of non-elderly adults with mental illness, and 40% of non-elderly adults with HIV. One in 5 people on Medicare also receive extra coverage from Medicaid.

And yes, it covers our most financially vulnerable Americans — over 8 in 10 children in poverty, and almost half of adults in poverty are on Medicaid.

"This is likely something that helps someone you know or love actually make ends meet," said Lauren Rivera, a sociology professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University who started a discussion over Medicaid names on social media. "I would say that every person in this country — if they're not already receiving Medicaid — is one step away from needing it."

Most experts I spoke to think the reason many states drop the "Medicaid" from their program names is to reduce a stigma and encourage more people who are eligible for the assistance to sign up. While surveys show high support for Medicaid funding overall, enrolling in the program itself on a personal level can bring up mixed feelings.

Consider this account from Calarco, who interviewed 250 women from pregnancy through their first couple of years postpartum for her recent book "Holding it Together: How Women Became America’s Safety Net."

One mother, Erin, and her husband were struggling to afford childcare, both working split shifts to watch their children. Exhausted by that arrangement, Erin dropped out of the workforce to stay at home with their kids, but the couple was going broke trying to afford health insurance at the same time. When Medicaid was expanded in her state, Erin was reluctant to sign up.

"She felt like 'it's not for people like us,'" Calarco recounted, saying that they weren't poor enough to need it.

There's also an othering factor around Medicaid, said Rivera. It's a program for this group or that group, one "that is different from me. Attempts to rename the programs try to make them more friendly, more appealing, more palatable."

Signing up for TennCare or Healthy Connections in South Carolina may not sting as much, and that's exactly the point. The drawback, according to a 2024 study, is the effort "may muddle understanding of the program as a government-provided benefit."

"The inner workings of how programs like Medicaid are funded is far too complex for the average person to understand," Calarco said. "It's hard for people to parse out that when we talk about your state Medicaid program, that's connected to and deeply dependent on federal Medicaid funding."

There's a similar concern for the 75% of Medicaid enrollees who sign up for a plan managed by an MCO.

For example in Georgia, those eligible for Medicaid register for the Georgia Families program, which then provides members a choice of three health plans managed by an MCO for adults. The three health plans are provided by Amerigroup Community Care, CareSource, or Peach State Health Plan. Absent from these plan names? Medicaid.

Another study published in 2018 found that Medicaid recipients are less likely to self-report that they are on the program when MCO plans are designed to obscure government involvement. Enrollees are less able to recognize how they personally benefit from Medicaid, the study found, making it more difficult for them "to engage in the civic sphere as informed advocates for their self-interest."

And that there is the rub.

Senate lawmakers are set later this month to vote on which parts of the government should be slashed to reach the $880 billion in spending reductions the House GOP advanced in its budget resolution last week.

The resolution itself didn't state those cuts must come from Medicaid, but the reductions must come from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the program and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

"When it comes to mobilizing for this much-needed part of our social safety net, it complicates things if people don't necessarily know that they're on it," Rivera said. “It is really important for people to have a clear understanding that programs like Medicaid are essential for a functioning society."

No matter what it's called.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is dismissing business concerns over the uncertainty caused by his planned tariffs on a range of American trading partners and the prospect of higher prices, and isn't ruling out the possibility of a recession this year.

After imposing and then quickly pausing 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada that sent markets tumbling over concerns of a trade war, Trump said his plans for broader "reciprocal" tariffs will go into effect April 2, raising them to match what other countries assess.

“April 2nd, it becomes all reciprocal,” he said in a taped interview with Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.” “What they charge us, we charge them.”

Asked about the Atlanta Fed's warning of an economic contraction in the first quarter of the year, Trump seemingly acknowledged that his plans could affect U.S. growth. Still, he claimed, it would ultimately be "great for us.”

When questioned whether he was expecting a recession in 2025, Trump responded: “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing.” He then added, “It takes a little time. It takes a little time."

On Wall Street, it was a tough week with wild swings dominated by worries about the economy and uncertainty about what Trump's tariffs.



Trump brushed aside concerns from businesses seeking stability as they make investment decisions. He said that “for years the globalists, the big globalists have been ripping off the United States" and that now, "all we’re doing is getting some of it back, and we’re going to treat our country fairly."

“You know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up and, you know, I don’t know if it’s predictability,” the Republican president said.

Trump last week lifted the Mexico and Canada tariffs on American car manufacturers, and then virtually all imports to the U.S., but kept them on goods from China.

More tariffs are coming this week, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling NBC's “Meet the Press” that 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will take effect Wednesday. Lutnick said Trump's threatened tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber though would wait until April.

“Will there be distortions? Of course,” Lutnick said. “Foreign goods may get a little more expensive. But American goods are going to get cheaper, and you’re going to be helping Americans by buying American.”

Sauce and smoke return to Chick-fil-A sandwiches next week, and some new, fruity beverages can help customers wash them down.

Starting March 17, the Smokehouse BBQ Bacon Sandwich will come back to locations nationwide. This time, diners have their choice of original, spicy or grilled chicken fillets. Assorted Pineapple Dragonfruit beverages will also join the lineup for what is being described as a "perfectly sweet pairing," but both are for a limited time, Chick-fil-A said in a press release. 

The Smokehouse BBQ Bacon Sandwich pairs chicken with "crispy bacon hand-tossed in a brown sugar and black pepper blend, topped with Colby Jack cheese, green leaf lettuce and a smoky BBQ sauce, served on a toasted, buttery, sweet yeast bun."

The sandwich will be available at participating restaurants through June 7, while supplies last, Chick-fil-A said. It has not been offered since 2022, according to Food & Wine magazine.

The available Pineapple Dragonfruit beverages are frosted lemonade, lemonade, iced tea and Sunjoy, which is a combination of Chick-fil-A's lemonade and sweetened iced tea. 

"As warmer weather approaches, our guests are craving flavors that are reminiscent of longer, brighter days and time spent outside with family and friends," Allison Duncan, director of menu and packaging at Chick-fil-A, said in a statement.

UK appears to be out of US eyeline for now but it would not be immune to slowdown triggered by rising tariffs

Forget the “Trump put”, as financial analysts called the bet that the US president’s policies would unleash a winning era for the nation’s stock markets. By Friday, the chat was of the “Merz spurt”.

The decision by Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor-in-waiting, to cut a deal on ditching Germany’s debt brake – still to be confirmed by the outgoing parliament – marked a seismic shift.

The EU country most associated with strict fiscal discipline is now contemplating what could in principle be unlimited borrowing to fund Europe’s defence.

Lifting the brake, widely regarded by experts as an unnecessarily tight constraint on public spending in an economy sorely in need of stimulus, cheered European markets.

Bond yields rose, as investors contemplated the extra borrowing Germany is now expected to undertake; but so did the euro and European stocks, on the assumption the move would be positive for growth.

Merz’s abrupt about-turn, after arguing for spending restraint during the recent election campaign, is part of a dramatic EU-wide push to “ReArm Europe” – a slogan it was depressing and disorientating to see on official communications last week, in the EU’s trademark blue and yellow branding.

The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, suggested as much as €800bn (£671bn) could ultimately be mobilised to create a bulwark against Russia, as the US withdraws.

In other words, Donald Trump’s isolationist turn has had a dramatic galvanising effect on the EU, smashing through its cumbersome decision-making structures.

The German decision is the right one – although Merz’s insistence on trying to pass it in the outgoing parliament is hardly democratic best-practice.

As US markets turned sour last week against the backdrop of Trump’s chaotic trade policy, it may have been tempting for the Europeans to feel a touch of schadenfreude – an appropriately German word.

Yet while EU countries have rapidly drawn up plans to deal with the new, less cooperative US in the security sphere, they must also brace themselves for the impact of Trump’s other great project – smashing up the global trading system and rebuilding it in the US’s favour.

The barely credible fact that Trump had slapped 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, countries with which he negotiated a free trade agreement in his first term, almost got lost in the maelstrom of history-making news last week.

As Canadian liquor stores stripped their shelves of American bourbon, and US carmakers warned that prices could rocket, the president offered a temporary carve-out, and then a broader reprieve.

But the administration remains strongly wedded to the idea of tariffs. Trump even argued on Saturday that the prospect of a trade war with Canada and Mexico would spice up next year’s football World Cup, which the the two countries are jointly hosting with the US. “Tension is a good thing … It makes it much more exciting,” he said.

It is usually a mistake to try to read too much logic into Trump’s approach, which owes as much to personal gripes and grudges as to theory. But he and his henchmen do seem determined to ditch the rules-based world trading system, in favour of something much more Hobbesian.

Just as the administration is using the language of liberty and free speech to clothe its attacks on many aspects of US public life, the aim of the tariffs policy is apparently to enforce “fairness”.

As the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, put it on Friday: “What we are trying to do is make free trade fair trade, because the trading systems have become incredibly imbalanced. You see it with these gigantic trade deficits that we run.”

The next wave of import taxes is due to be imposed on steel, aluminium and derivative products – everything from vehicle parts to kitchen sinks – this Wednesday, and analysts at Global Trade Alert estimate that more than $20bn (£15.5bn) of EU exports will be affected.

When it comes to the “reciprocal” tariffs Trump has threatened to impose on 2 April, with higher rates for countries the US deems to be trading unfairly, the EU appears to be firmly in his sights.

Trump described the bloc in a typically bellicose statement on Friday as a “terrible abuser” of the current system.

Recent analysis by Aslak Berg at the Centre for European Reform, suggested a 20% tariff on all EU exports would lead to a decline in exports to the US of $200bn a year. “Given the weakness of the European economy, this would certainly cause a recession,” he said.

The EU has a toolkit of retaliatory instruments ready to go, including the ability to slap tariffs on US products, as it did in response to steel tariffs in Trump’s first term. These are understandably aimed at bringing Trump to the negotiating table, but in the interim they will just add to the chaos.

The UK appears to be out of the US president’s eyeline for the moment, after Keir Starmer’s trip to Washington, and Britain does not have the trade surplus in goods that Trump tends to read as a sign of some underlying inequity.

But the US may still zero in on other UK policies, such as the digital services tax, expected to raise £800m this year from tech companies – and as the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has made clear, Britain would not be immune to a global slowdown triggered by rising tariffs.

The most important news this last week was that Trump 2.0 has made Europe a much more dangerous place, but it would be a mistake to lose sight of the wrecking ball he continues to wield over the global trading system. The next few weeks and months look likely to be, as some headlines had it last week, “tariffying”.</p>

Christine McVie's former London penthouse is now up for grabs.

The late Fleetwood Mac singer and keyboardist's former home in the Belgravia neighborhood of London is on the market for $8.9 million, in partnership with Beauchamp Estates, which holds the listing.

"With a private roof garden, this penthouse has all the layout advantages of a house with entertaining on the lower level and the private bedrooms on the upper floor," Jeremy Gee, managing director of Beauchamp Estates, said in a statement. "Bright and airy with a superb specification and tastefully decorated, this wonderful penthouse offers contemporary living in Belgravia at its very best." 

McVie purchased the penthouse in 2015, after which she refurbished it with the help of a developer, making changes to the flooring and completely customizing the kitchen to her liking.

Following her death in 2022, much of her personal property, including her artwork, was auctioned off, with the proceeds going towards various music-related charities, including MusiCares.

The 2,674-square-foot penthouse takes up the top two floors of the building, with the common rooms all spread out throughout the lower level and the three bedrooms occupying the upper level.

"Offering elevated living on Eaton Place, the London penthouse of the late Christine McVie of legendary British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac provides privacy and security, and we anticipate the proposed sale will attract global interest from discerning buyers from around the world," Gary Hersham, founding director of Beauchamp Estates, said in a statement.

Upon entry, guests will find a grand double reception room, which features two separate seating areas, with oak parquet flooring throughout. One side features a white marble wood-burning fireplace, with artwork of kimono hanging above it and a full-length mirror on either side.

A gray couch sits in front of one of the many windows in the room and is accented by two black and white armchairs sitting across from it.

On the other side of the double reception room is a large sectional sofa, perfect for hosting a large party, which sits under a large painting. Both sides of the room feature a white carpet with various designs.

Separating the reception room from the dining room are wooden double doors with custom floor-to-ceiling built-in shelving, which currently hold vases and other various decorative knickknacks, but can be used to house a small library.

On the other side of the shelves is the spacious dining room, which has enough space for a table large enough to seat 10 guests.

The room also features built-in cabinetry which can be used as storage for fine china and other utensils, as well as a wood-burning fireplace and a large window, bringing in natural light and providing views of the street surrounding the home.

Through another door in the dining room, guests will have access to the home's kitchen. The cozy shaker kitchen was fully customized by McVie when she bought the home in 2015, as she added oak worktops, timber-paneled units and cupboards, warm yellow ceramic wall tiles and a breakfast bar.

In addition, the kitchen boasts white tiled flooring, a small flat-screen TV mounted on the wall and a window looking out onto the street. During the remodel, McVie also added in many top-of-the-line appliances, including a sub-zero refrigerator. 

Rounding out the lower level is the Bohemian living room, featuring multiple pieces of artwork on the walls, including tapestries and paintings, as well as many pieces of wooden furniture with intricate designs engraved onto them.

Aside from the bedrooms, the upper level also contains the family room, which not only boasts a window looking out to the street, but also a skylight, which brings in additional natural light.

In addition, the room also features a large blue entertainment center, which houses a flat-screen TV and can be used to store video games, board games and other fun activities. The TV sits across from a leather couch and two white armchairs, providing plenty of space for the whole family to gather together.

Another highlight of the home is the luxurious ensuite bathroom, which features blue tiles on the floor and the walls, with some of the walls and cabinets painted blue as well. The room features a large white marble sink, as well as a soaking tub and a stand-up shower.

The exterior of the home is just as enviable as the inside, as it features a private terrace with an outdoor dining area and a small dipping pool.

Here are five things in business tech news that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?

Meta has launched a pilot program introducing AI-powered customer service agents to assist businesses on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. These agents can interact with customers in real-time, handling tasks such as managing returns, providing product recommendations, and processing purchases. Utilizing data from a business's Meta footprint – including previous posts and customer service messages – agents can answer customer inquiries directly on ad pages or through direct messages. Agentic AI is enhancing CRM platforms like Salesforce which recently introduced AgentExchange – a new marketplace for AI agents in enterprise software. Launching with over 200 partners – including Google Cloud, DocuSign, Box, and Workday – pre-packaged agent solutions are being developed for businesses that can implement them without extensive technical expertise. Unlike traditional AI tools focused on text generation, these specialized AI agents are designed to perform complex tasks autonomously within business systems, effectively increasing labor capacity. (Source: Fast Company; VentureBeat)

2025 is the year of the agent. I’ve written about this before and will be revisiting this topic for another Forbes column soon. The takeaway is that finally – finally – generative AI will evolve this year to only provide information but also perform tasks to help us run our businesses more productively. The focus is on customer service. My advice is to lean in heavily and perhaps use some of these tools to build your own solutions.

The latest PayPal scam alert involves Docusign's Application Programming Interface (API). Scammers are exploiting the software to enhance the credibility of their phishing emails targeting PayPal users. By setting up Docusign accounts, these fraudsters utilize available templates to send legitimate-looking PayPal invoices. Recipients are notified of unauthorized transactions and prompted to contact a provided phone number to secure their account and process a refund. Since these emails originate from Docusign, they can bypass many security filters. Red flags include the use of Gmail addresses for PayPal customer support and the absence of documents requiring signatures – which is unusual for Docusign communications. Docusign has stated that it investigates and shuts down suspicious accounts within 24 hours of detection or reporting. (Source: Finextra)

I’ve been getting a ton o PayPal scam emails recently, requesting payment or asking me to confirm a payment made to my company. This is a new twist and using Docusign is a pretty savvy way to dupe businesses and individuals into giving away confidential information. Make sure your employees are aware of this, be extra vigilant, get training for your company and report anything you see to both PayPal and Docusign.

Lucas Mearian of Computerworld highlighted a significant increase in electronic employee monitoring as reported in a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The study found 80 percent of companies are monitoring remote or hybrid workers with 74 percent using software to log web browsing and 62 percent tracking screen activity. This surge in surveillance is linked to heightened worker stress, reduced job satisfaction, and potential declines in productivity. The proliferation of monitoring tools – such as RFID badges and biometric scanners – has raised ethical concerns regarding privacy and the potential for discriminatory practices. Experts caution that while these tools aim to boost productivity, they may inadvertently harm employee well-being and trust in the workplace. (Source: Computerworld)

I’m an opponent of employee monitoring. I realize that in some situations – cases where there’s valuable inventory, a higher risk of theft or even instances of potential harmful employee behavior – where monitoring can help a business. But for the most part I see my clients spending too much monitoring the minutia of an employee’s day – even when working from home – rather than running their business. You hire adults. Give them the respect of being adults. Stop spending so much time on something that likely has much lower risk to the overall profitability of your business and instead focus on growing your business and making your employees better.

Reddit is becoming an optimal platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to enhance their search engine optimization (SEO) efforts, engage with local communities, and build brand trust. Reddit content often appears prominently in Google search results, with users actively seeking out Reddit discussions for authentic reviews and insights. Example – when searching for services like a personal trainer in Brooklyn – users might include "Reddit" in their queries to find genuine community feedback. Unlike other social media platforms that frequently change their algorithms, Reddit maintains a consistent forum-style structure, allowing businesses to connect directly with niche audiences through specific communities known as subreddits. This direct engagement can lead to increased visibility and credibility. (Source: Search Engine Land)

I’m active on the r/CRM subreddit and have even received a few leads from it. But here’s the secret: don’t use Reddit as a leadgen tool. I like to go on the CRM subreddit to learn more about the industry, engage with users and even offer advice. I often get great advice there. Yes, I sometimes pitch our solutions, but usually it’s just an education and helpful engage which builds credibility and relationships. I never even considered the fact that this activity might showing up in online searches but that’s just a plus. I strongly recommend business owners pick a subreddit in their industry or expertise and engage with that community on a regular basis.

Alaina Yee of PCWorld reminded readers of why maintaining robust security for your PC is crucial in today's digital landscape. (Source: PCWorld)

Essential practices include Activating Built-in Antivirus Protection and Utilizing Third-Party Security Suites. For example, Avast One expands upon the company's free security suite, offering upgraded defenses against online threats and additional features. Yee also suggests Implementing Comprehensive Security Measures. Beyond the standard antivirus software, incorporating additional safeguards such as firewalls, browser extensions, password managers, and VPNs, will enhance your system's security. Keep Software Updated. Regularly update your operating system and all installed applications to patch vulnerabilities that cybercriminals might exploit.

Every week I round up five business tech news stories that will impact your business and give a few thoughts why.</p>
