Environment secretary Steve Reed said: “After years of failure, our rivers, lakes and seas are awash with pollution. New laws will strengthen regulation to ensure water bosses face personal criminal liability for law breaking. Water firms will also be required to install monitors at every sewage outlet, with data independently scrutinised by regulators. Environmental campaigners wanted an amendment in the new bill to ensure all future fines imposed on water firms would be ringfenced for restoration projects. Charles Watson, chair of the charity River Action, said any money for restoration was welcome but £11m was a small amount compared with the billions of pounds paid out in dividends.</p>

Musk, a high-profile figure in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, said in a post on his X social media platform on Sunday, that Ukraine's "entire front line would collapse if I turned it off". The U.S. government has already revoked some access to satellite imagery for Ukraine and paused intelligence sharing, piling pressure on Kyiv as Trump seeks a swift end to the war, now in its fourth year after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Starlink's parent company SpaceX did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment outside normal business hours. Shares in Franco-British satellite operator Eutelsat soared as much as 650% during the week ending March 7, due to speculation the company could replace Starlink in providing internet access to Ukraine.

In his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy’s fence-mending efforts. “I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don’t have the cards,” Trump said. “In terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.” Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. “It’s not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal,” Trudeau said.</p>

Once empowered by the regime, many Alawites now face reprisals from rebel factions and displaced Sunni populations who suffered under Assad's rule. Revenge attacks have already killed over 1,000 people, including hundreds of Alawites, as power dynamics in Syria shift violently. The clashes, which erupted Thursday, are a major challenge to Syria's new rulers, who took power three months ago after removing Assad. During their rule, Alawites held significant positions in the military and government, leading to perceptions of preferential treatment. After Assad's ousting, armed Sunni factions, reportedly loyal to the new government, launched revenge killings against Alawites, further deepening Syria's sectarian divide.</p>

Trump, for his part, has labeled her “toxic” — an insult that she is wearing as a badge of honor. But analysts say the former finance minister may struggle to differentiate herself from Trudeau and his unpopular economic record. Opposition parties have vowed to bring down the government after a new session of Parliament begins on March 24. Trudeau has stepped aside, and his potential successors have said they’ll scrap the consumer carbon tax.</p>

On Saturday, about 55,000 Yoon supporters rallied in Seoul’s main districts, while 32,500 people demonstrated against him near the constitutional court, Yonhap news agency reported, citing unofficial police estimates. The public, however, remains largely anti-Yoon, with 60% of respondents saying he should be removed from office and 35% opposing removal, according to a Gallup Korea poll on Friday. Yoon was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January over his 3 December martial law decree, which plunged the country into political turmoil. Yoon’s lawyers have accused the investigative agency that detained him before his formal arrest of lacking legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions but that does not cover grave charges like rebellion and treason.</p>

Syrian state news showed a convoy of more fighters heading toward the south from Idlib overnight. “However, should the aim be the dismantlement of Iran’s peaceful nuclear program to claim that what [former president Barack] Obama failed to achieve has now been accomplished, such negotiations will never take place,” Iran’s mission said. … Iran will definitely not accept their expectations,” Khamenei told senior Iranian officials at a meeting Saturday, Reuters reported.

Homeland security secretary pledges lie detector tests for employees she suspects are passing information to press “There is, yes, a plan to use the facility at Fort Bliss for detention,” she said. The secretary also warned that her department has “just weeks” before running out of money for its mass deportation mission unless Congress ups funding. White House officials have previously expressed frustration with the pace of deportations, blaming it in part on recent leaks revealing cities where authorities planned raids. The leadership changes come after Ice’s acting director Caleb Vitello was reassigned on February 21 for failing to meet anti-immigration expectations, Reuters reported.</p>

Frequent sleep disruptions, and confusing clock resets- daylight saving time has long been a source of frustration for several Americans. Here's a look at the ongoing debate and why it's so difficult to do away with daylight saving time. While signing executive orders on Thursday, Trump acknowledged the ongoing debate, calling it a "fifty-fifty issue." Over 1.3 million people participated, with 58% voting for a later shift and 42% favouring an earlier one. While the debate over daylight saving time continues, Trump's evolving stance suggests that any potential change remains uncertain.</p>

The winter sun hasn’t yet risen above Inuvik’s jagged horizon of black spruce trees, but already, more than 150 nervous soldiers have gathered in a community recreation centre. Few have traveled this far north before, more than 200 kilometres above the Arctic Circle in Canada’s Northwest Territories. The national defence minister, Bill Blair, warned on Thursday that climate change was upending the region and providing “growing access to Arctic resources and shipping lanes that, unfortunately, is enticing other adversarial nations to engage in heightened competition”. In recent weeks, Donald Trump has threatened to make Canada the 51st US state, an idea roundly condemned by all Canadian political leaders. He said the Inuvialuit Petroleum Corporation’s M-18 project, which aims to convert an estimated 278bn cubic feet of gas into into usable natural gas and synthetic diesel, would help a people who have long seen their lands used by outsiders.</p>

Last week, Arab leaders unveiled a competing plan for Gaza’s reconstruction — one that does not include the displacement of Palestinian civilians. But right-wing Israeli lawmakers and experts who support the plan to remove Palestinians said at Sunday’s hearing that emigration from Gaza would be voluntary and that polls indicate most Gazans would choose to leave the territory if they could. The idea from Trump and Israelis to relocate Gaza’s residents abroad is realistic, Rothman argued, because they need jobs and many aging countries around the world need to import young laborers.

HONG KONG (AP) — An unannounced trip by former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to Hong Kong set off speculations on Sunday that he may be trying to evade a possible arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court over his bloody crackdown on drugs while in power. “I did everything in my time so Filipinos can have a little peace and tranquility.” Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the sensitive issue.

Dogs that are in pain, terminally ill, or pose a health risk to humans will be euthanised. Rana El Selci died after being attacked by a pack of stray dogs in Konya, central Turkey, on Friday. A criminal investigation was launched following her death as municipal workers began rounding up dogs in Konya. Animal lovers fear the legislation will lead to dogs being killed or ending up in neglected, overcrowded shelters. There have also been protests across Europe, as people warned the law could dissuade tourists from visiting Turkey.</p>

They demanded an immediate ceasefire in Gaza that would enable all the remaining hostages to be released. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used “starvation as a method of warfare” when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, “You never know.” He added: “I think something could come together within weeks,” and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only the American ones.

Germany will not develop or acquire nuclear weapons, incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said, while calling for deeper cooperation with France and the UK on deterrence. In an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio broadcaster on Sunday, Merz stressed that “Germany will not be able or allowed to possess nuclear weapons itself,” noting that Berlin is banned by law from doing so. His remarks came amid tensions between European NATO members and the administration of US President Donald Trump over Ukraine. Trump has also repeatedly insisted that European NATO members should do more to protect themselves, rather than relying on the US. Macron has also urged EU member states to significantly boost their defense spending while declaring Russia a “threat.”</p>

Trump may call her a “very wonderful woman,” but his administration hasn’t ruled out U.S. military strikes on fentanyl targets in Mexico. But she has been criticized as a brainy technocrat who moved in lockstep with López Obrador, even imitating his country-boy drawl. The Mexican government “built off that pressure without having to actually put out their own measures,” said John Creamer, a former senior U.S. diplomat in Mexico. Morena holds majorities in both houses of Congress and a virtual lock on power, thanks largely to López Obrador’s popularity. Luis Ramirez, 74, an electrician from Michoacán state who attended, said Sheinbaum “has all of our support.” But the negotiations with Trump continue.</p>

A prominent French journalist has said he is stepping down from his role as an expert analyst for broadcaster RTL after provoking an uproar by comparing French actions during colonial rule in Algeria to a second world war massacre committed by Nazi forces in France. Leaving a chilling memorial for future generations, the village was never rebuilt. His comments had prompted a flurry of complaints to audio-visual regulator Arcom, which has opened an investigation. Historians from both sides have over the last years documented numerous violations including arbitrary killings and detention carried out by French forces and the history still burdens French-Algerian relations to this day. The far right in France has long defended French policies in those years with Algeria War veteran Jean-Marie Le Pen, who co-founded the National Front (FN) party and died earlier this year, drawing much support from French settlers who had to return after independence.</p>

Dogs that are in pain, terminally ill, or pose a health risk to humans will be euthanised. Animal lovers fear the legislation will lead to dogs being killed or ending up in neglected, overcrowded shelters. The issue has proven to be divisive in Turkish society, with at least one former government minister having professed his admiration for "man's best friend".

A jazz pianist turned shopkeeper, Harold moved his family in 1935 to Port Elizabeth, an urban industrial town that remained Fugard’s main home and most regular dramatic setting for the next nine decades. As a major Fugard scholar, Professor Dennis Walder, has pointed out, it was yet another horror of the system that the writer could only work with colleagues of colour at his home by registering them, for bureaucratic purposes, as his domestic staff. But a majority black co-operative run by a white man subsequently raised issues of “appropriation” to which Fugard was alert: editions of The Island and its companion play, Sizwe Banzi Is Dead (1972), in which someone takes on the identity of a dead man in order to use his “pass book” (ID papers), have the credit “devised by Athol Fugard, John Kani and Winston Ntshona”, with royalties split three ways. The circumstances in which Fugard’s early plays were made now sound like something from dystopian fiction. Fugard, though, wrote plays that effectively reflected the country’s “truth and reconciliation” phase of attempted restorative justice.</p>

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has repeatedly voiced skepticism over Western support for Ukraine, declaring that Bratislava wouldn't provide military or financial assistance to Kiev and advocating for an immediate ceasefire. Fico has also criticized Kiev’s Western backers for pursuing “peace through force,” arguing that “Ukraine will never be strong enough to negotiate from a position of military power.” Tensions between Slovakia and Ukraine were exacerbated after Kiev declined to renew a gas transit agreement with Moscow that expired at the beginning of this year.</p>

The attack left several civilians dead and “a lot” wounded, Saldo said, citing preliminary data. Dozens of civilians were at the market when at least two projectiles fired from a US-supplied M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launcher struck the location, according to a Telegram post by Saldo, which included images from the aftermath. The photos show one building badly damaged, with thick smoke billowing from it. Footage circulating online shows a destroyed van ablaze outside of the market, with an injured – or possibly dead – person lying next to it. The systems, once touted as a key tool for striking high-value Russian assets, have routinely been used by Kiev for indiscriminate strikes on civilian targets deep beyond the frontline.</p>

Referring to the US president's push to impose reciprocal tariffs on other nations, Ramdev claimed Trump has been bullying the poor and developing nations by unleashing a new “era of intellectual colonisation”. Amid this, ever since Donald Trump rose to power, he created a new world record of 'tariff terrorism'. In such a case, India needs to develop... All Indians should unite to build a strong nation and answer all these destructive powers," he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI in Maharashtra's Nagpur. Since taking office less than two months ago, Trump has rolled out hefty import taxes on goods coming from America's three biggest trading partners — Mexico, Canada and China. However, after talks, Trump granted a one-month exemption on his new tariffs impacting goods from Mexico and Canada for US automakers.</p>

Doctors in London and Cambridge have developed the innovative treatment, which is called targeted thermal therapy (TTT) or endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation. “It’s very exciting when people who’ve had uncontrolled high blood pressure for years have this procedure and come home the same day and find that their blood pressure is back to normal literally the next day.” There are potentially many individuals living with high blood pressure that may benefit from this new treatment.”</p>

Russian Telegram channels showed pictures of special forces in gas masks and lights, some using colourful Russian curses, along the inside of what looked like a large pipe, according to Reuters. Ukraine Ukraine’s General Staff had also confirmed on Saturday that Russian “sabotage and assault groups” used the pipeline in a bid to gain a foothold outside the town of Sudzha.

No, I’m not going to defend them," Bloomberg quoted Trump as saying at the Oval Office. European Union leaders met in Brussels for an emergency summit last week to massively increase defense spending. “In the last weeks, we’ve seen what I would call quite a turbulent development. It’s still not perhaps very clear what finally will be the American strategy," EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius told Bloomberg.</p>

Hamas on Sunday condemned Israel's decision to cut off electricity supply to the strife-torn Gaza, accusing it of "cheap and unacceptable blackmail" over its move which, the militant group said was made in an effort to pressure them into releasing hostages. Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas' political bureau said in a statement, "We strongly condemn the occupation's decision to cut off electricity to Gaza, after depriving it of food, medicine, and water." The truce deal's initial phase concluded on March 1 and both sides have refrained from returning to an all-out war, even though violence including an air strike struck Sunday that Israel said targeted militants. Israel said that it prefers extending phase one until mid-April, and paused aid to Gaza over the impasse. On Sunday, Energy minister Eli Cohen said in a video statement, "I have just signed the order to stop supplying electricity immediately to the Gaza Strip.</p>

KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Thousands of supporters greeted Nepal’s former king in capital Kathmandu on Sunday and demanded his abolished monarchy be reinstated and Hinduism brought back as a state religion. An estimated 10,000 supporters of Gyanendra Shah blocked the main entrance to Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport as he arrived from a tour of western Nepal. But many Nepalis have grown frustrated with the republic, saying it has failed to bring about political stability and blaming it for a struggling economy and widespread corruption. Nepal has had 13 governments since the monarchy was abolished in 2008. Despite growing support for the former king, Gyanendra has slim chances of immediately returning to power.</p>

He has frequently criticized US support for Kiev, while in general advocating reducing federal spending on foreign assistance. Musk did not elaborate on how exactly such a move would impact the conflict. Most of the above-listed individuals have contributed to Kiev’s war effort.

Once complete, the cultural colossus, named after Georges Pompidou, France’s conservative president between 1969 and 1974, is to be reopened with a new exhibition space, offering what museum bosses have called a “multidisciplinary perspective” with new spaces for children and young people, as well as an enlarged library. Art lovers have until 9pm on Monday to take a final stroll through the permanent collection. French visitors and foreign tourists were among those to take advantage of the last weekend, for which entrance was free, with workshops, art performances and DJ sets contributing to a lively atmosphere. Her Portuguese friend Luis Fraga said he was a regular visitor to the museum and was keen to lap up and “enjoy as much as possible” the artworks “before they are no longer here”. For that project, estimated to cost €700-800m, which involves creating a new, more accessible entrance and putting the Mona Lisa in a separate room with its own means of access, the museum will not be closed, though some individual rooms will be, temporarily.</p>

Many demonstrators at the Paris rally criticized Macron for prioritizing military matters over domestic issues. Another accused Macron of pursuing conflict while leaders such as Trump and Putin are talking about peace. His party opposes what it perceives as unnecessary military interventions and advocates for a more independent French foreign policy. Critics argue that these measures would burden middle-class families, small business owners, and retirees already struggling with rising costs. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has rejected calls for public consultation on major defense policies, insisting such decisions are the government’s responsibility.</p>

German policymakers are growing increasingly concerned over the possibility that the US could remotely disable F-35 fighter jets being delivered to Berlin in the event of a crisis, mirroring its recent decision to freeze intelligence and military support to Ukraine, Bild reported on Saturday. However, some German policymakers fear that US President Donald Trump, who has been at odds with the EU over a number of issues, could use a ‘kill switch’ to ground the aircraft if Washington and European capitals diverge in their approach to a potential conflict with Russia, the article said. Others, meanwhile, suggested that a kill switch would essentially be redundant due to the sophistication of modern fighter jets and dependence on the vendor. “Most European militaries depend heavily on the US for communications support, for electronic warfare support, and for ammunition resupply in any serious conflict,” Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told the FT. So far, more than 1,100 have been produced, with many supplied to US allies.</p>

Displaced Palestinians make tea at a school run by UNRWA, the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees, west of Gaza City, Sunday, March 9, 2025. Executive director Tania Hary said that it’s expected to run on generators and produce around 2,500 cubic meters per day, about the amount in an Olympic swimming pool. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used “starvation as a method of warfare” when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. He added: “I think something could come together within weeks,” and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones.</p>

But Friedrich Merz cautions such a move could not replace the US’s existing protective shield over Europe Germany’s chancellor-to-be, Friedrich Merz, has said he will reach out to France and Britain to discuss the sharing of nuclear weapons, but cautioned that such a move could not be a replacement for the US’s existing protective shield over Europe. Merz, an erstwhile passionate transatlanticist who has spoken out in recent weeks on Donald Trump and Europe’s need to be “independent”, said he hoped the US nuclear shield would remain in place, and that a European shield should be viewed as a “complement” to it. In a guarded reference to Trump, Merz said: “The changed global security situation now necessitates that we Europeans discuss this matter together.” “We want European solidarity … but Germany also of course has a right to defend its own security and order,” he said.</p>

Washington has declined to renew a sanctions waiver that allowed Iraq to buy electricity and gas from neighbouring Iran, a spokesperson for the US embassy in Baghdad said Sunday.  

"On March 8, the US Department of State did not renew the waiver for Iraq to purchase Iranian electricity," the spokesperson said, adding that the decision "ensures we do not allow Iran any degree of economic or financial relief".

The United Russia party in the northern Murmansk region posted photos on social media showing officials smiling as they visited bereaved mothers with gifts of flowers and boxed meat grinders for International Women’s Day on Saturday, which is widely celebrated in Russia. Russia is often accused of throwing its frontline soldiers into a “meat grinder” with scant regard for their lives. The mayor, Maxim Chengayev, who took part in the handover of gifts, said that meat grinders were not originally intended to be included but “one woman asked for it and we of course could not say no”, United Russia said. Russia has rarely given any figures for its losses in Ukraine and the true toll is unknown, but independent media put it at many tens of thousands. The president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in February that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and about 380,000 wounded.</p>

Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Sunday that US President Donald Trump's plan to remove Palestinians from war-battered Gaza was "taking shape", despite widespread rejection by governments in the region. "This plan is taking shape, with ongoing actions in coordination with the administration," Smotrich told an event in the Israeli parliament, adding that preparations were underway to form a managing body that would oversee displacement. Experts have said that forcibly removing Gazans would amount to a violation of international law. Last week, an Arab counterproposal to Trump's plan was put forward, with several Islamic nations and European governments endorsing it. The Arab proposal aims to rebuild Gaza without displacing Gazans, who endured more than 15 months of devastating war before a fragile ceasefire took effect on January 19.</p>

Greenland is the world's largest island -  it's larger even than France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, and Belgium combined. But many also see the global spotlight on them as an opportunity to promote their longstanding push for independence from Denmark, which is a key issue in Tuesday's legislative elections. Just hours after Trump declared in his speech to a joint session of Congress that he intends to gain control of the island “one way or the other," Greenland’s prime minister  Múte Bourup Egedeposted a simple message on Facebook : “Greenland is ours.” And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before,” he added.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Chaos broke out in Romania’s capital Sunday evening as incensed supporters of the far-right populist Calin Georgescu protested the electoral body’s decision to reject his candidacy in a presidential election redo. The Central Election Bureau, also known by its Romanian acronym BEC, had 48 hours to register or reject it. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside BEC’s headquarters to express anger over its decision, with many waving Romanian flags and chanting: “The last resort is another revolution!” Some protesters threw broken paving stones and other objects at the scores of riot police dispatched to the area, overturned a news vehicle and set a bush ablaze. Last month, prosecutors launched a criminal investigation against Georgescu, accusing him of “incitement to actions against the constitutional order,” supporting fascist groups and false declarations of electoral campaign funding and asset disclosures. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will follow on May 18.</p>

A prominent Palestinian activist who helped lead Columbia University’s student encampment movement was arrested on Saturday night by federal immigration authorities who claimed they were acting on a state department order to revoke his green card, according to his attorney. One of the agents told Greer by phone that they were executing a state department order to revoke Khalil’s student visa. The authorities declined to tell Khalil’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, why he was being detained, Greer said. “We have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,” Greer told the AP. An immigration court can revoke a green card but government departments do not have that power.</p>

PANAMA CITY (AP) — After weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism, Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after being deported from the United States, telling them they have 30 days to leave the Central American nation. Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution. Upon being released Saturday night, human rights lawyers identified at least three people who required medical attention.

Ukraine launched a daring cross-border incursion into Kursk in August, marking the largest attack on Russian territory since World War II. But months after Ukraine’s thunder run, its soldiers in Kursk are weary and bloodied by relentless assaults of more than 50,000 troops, including some from Russian ally North Korea. In an interview with Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump was asked about a warning from Polish President Andrzej Duda “that without American support, Ukraine will not survive” and whether he was “comfortable” with that outcome. In an interview with the La Tribune Dimanche newspaper, Lecornu said Paris will send new 155 mm artillery shells and glide bombs for Mirage 2000 fighter jets it previously gave to Ukraine.

Actor Shah Rukh Khan has secured a big victory in a dispute with the Income Tax authorities, with the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal or ITAT delivering a verdict in his favour. The department calculated his tax as Rs 84.17 crore, more than four years later. The assessing officer had failed to demonstrate "any fresh tangible material warranting a reassessment beyond the four-year statutory period," ITAT said. Under Mr Khan's agreement with the Red Chillies Entertainment, 70 per cent of the film's shooting was to take place in UK and so an equal percentage of his income would be subject to UK taxes. The IT Department contended that such an arrangement caused revenue loss to India and the officials refused his claim for foreign tax credit.</p>

The New York Post reported, citing sources, that Ukrainian forces in the region could wrap up their incursion within as little as two weeks due to supply shortages and deteriorating battlefield conditions. Ukraine invaded Kursk Region last August, and while it initially made some gains, the advance was soon halted. A source in Zelensky’s government told Time that the loss of US intel has had major consequences beyond Kursk. The halt in intelligence sharing has also weakened Ukraine’s ability to launch long-range and intermediate-range strikes against Russian military positions, as these operations rely heavily on precise targeting information from US reconnaissance data, Time added. US officials have said the suspension of aid will remain in place until Kiev shows a commitment to holding peace talks.</p>

Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin criticized the decision, stating it contravenes international law. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the time that “this money was stolen from us. Our assets have been frozen absolutely illegally, against all norms and rules.” He added that Russia would exhaust all legal avenues to protect its property and rights. While Kiev has long been pressing its Western backers to outright expropriate the frozen Russian assets to finance its military and reconstruction efforts, a number of EU member states, most notably Germany, France, and Italy, have been reluctant to do so, citing legal concerns.

Most are being held either in army camps controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force, or repurposed scam compounds, where many have been since early February. An unconfirmed list provided by authorities in Myanmar says they’re holding citizens from 29 countries including Philippines, Kenya and the Czech Republic. Dozens of Indonesians were bused out one morning last week, pushing suitcases and carrying plastic bags with their meager possessions as they headed to Bangkok for a flight home. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. “My friends are in really bad condition, we can’t survive here,” he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards.</p>

Since becoming president, Trump has upended the US approach to Ukraine and treated Moscow more as an ally Russian officials have said that preparations are under way for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin. The talks in Riyadh, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, marked a tectonic shift in Washington’s approach to Moscow and a dramatic break with Joe Biden’s efforts to isolate Russia. Trump appeared to blame Kyiv for Moscow’s invasion and said he was “disappointed” that Zelenskyy complained about being left out of US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. The Guardian reported that the Trump administration has publicly and privately signaled that it does not believe Russia represents a cyber threat against US national security or critical infrastructure, marking a radical departure from longstanding intelligence assessments.</p>

The Spanish rail company Evolyn has previously announced plans to start a high-speed service linking the British and French capitals, which is called a “strategic and high-demand” route. However, both projects aiming to break Eurostar’s monopoly on the cross-Channel rail route have been set back by a dispute over access to the depot in Leyton, east London, where Eurostar stores and maintains its trains.</p>

Elon Musk is the idea's most vocal proponent, saying that a "more accurate measure of GDP would exclude government spending." But the fact that Musk is pushing it amid his DOGE work — another Trump official has gone further by suggesting that it might be possible to pick and choose government spending — has raised questions about whether this is primarily an attempt to minimize some of the negative effects from Musk's efforts. JPMorgan Chase recently revised its first quarter GDP prediction from 1.5% to 1% in part because of the trade tensions.

The US wants to get its hands on critical minerals — whether through a deal (now in limbo) with Ukraine or domestic production. "The Chinese understood very early that critical minerals, including rare earths, are going to be the building blocks for most advanced manufacturing going forward," said Pini Althaus, mining executive and founding partner of Cove Capital. It can take, on average, more than 15 years to turn a deposit into an operating mine where extractions are taking place. On Tuesday in front of Congress, Trump said he received a letter from Zelensky saying Ukraine is "ready to sign" the minerals agreement. "It would be a start to America’s involvement in the rare earths race, however," he added.</p>

“If they're short-lived, then this is just an opportunity to buy stocks for the long term.” “Tariffs add uncertainty but it doesn't change the demand cycle,” Wedbush's Dan Ives told me on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. Ives reiterated his stance that Mag Seven stocks Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) remain companies to own, along with Palantir (PLTR) and Salesforce (CRM), arguing “any weakness is a buying opportunity given the fundamental demand picture.” But unlike others, Kaiser isn’t buying into the Mag Seven names just yet, arguing positioning in those stocks remains crowded.

Bots continue to be an issue for X users within the cryptosphere as they battle spam, impersonation accounts, and phishing links. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) urged Elon Musk to ban bots — automated accounts that spam the social media site and are used to amplify content or for coordinated attacks — from the X platform. "If someone uses Grok, ChatGPT, or DeepSeek to generate a tweet and copy and paste it here, fine, but API posting should be disabled," CZ wrote in a March 9 X post. In a separate comment, the Binance founder differentiated automated social media bots from AI agents, saying that the latter was helpful in real-world applications such as booking hotels or writing code without having to socialize with them. Automated bots are a well-documented problem on X that spam the site and are particularly active in the crypto sphere of influence — plaguing users with scam messages advertising fake tokens, phishing links to malicious sites, and pump-and-dump schemes.</p>

One crypto sector, in particular, needs clarity on how it’s meant to operate without incurring the wrath of regulators: decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). Companies are left guessing at what constitutes compliance without clear rules governing token issuance, data privacy and infrastructure deployment. If we have explicit rules in place, DePIN startups will be free to build innovative infrastructure that solves critical, real-world problems, rather than frittering away resources on lawyers and litigation. Without it, projects are forced to tiptoe around vague guidelines, channeling their resources toward legal compliance instead of innovation. Policymakers must align these frameworks so that hardware deployment, spectrum usage and other logistical considerations don’t transform into prohibitively complex legal labyrinths.</p>

While questions may linger around this facet of elephant behavior, they show several other intriguing death-related practices. Asian elephants have been observed carrying dead infants for hours or days and are known to stand vigil around the bodies of deceased herd members. "We felt that [they were mourning], but it's always difficult to anthropomorphize such behavior in a natural science journal," Roy said. This idea is especially tantalizing because it seems to echo the kind of reflection that humans would show in a graveyard, "a place where the dead reside, and where we actually go out of our way to visit them as well," Proops said.

The Adobe sRGB score of 70% is more in line with its rivals but we would not recommend this machine for tackling serious Photoshop workloads. One of the best features here is that you can monitor all your laptop's performance metrics, and it includes a clever booster tool. ❌ You're on the go a lot: Battery life isn't brilliant, which might rule out playing more graphics-intensive games for long periods The Vortex Optics 10x36 Monocular is superbly capable for birdwatching, outdoor activities and even basic astronomy — it now has a $50 saving in this deal</p>

Trae Young is one of the NBA’s best free throw shooters. Young sank the first free throw to give Atlanta a two-point lead. For his second free throw, Young put up a comically high-arcing shot that just barely grazed the rim. This is your reminder that NBA stars are comically good at their jobs. The NBA should allow Young to keep his free throw streak going.</p>

The Bills are releasing veteran pass rusher Von Miller. The move, which will be made official this week, comes as no surprise: Miller would have had a $23.814 million salary cap hit if he had stayed on the Bills under his current contract, and that wasn't feasible. That doesn't necessarily mean Miller is done in Buffalo: It's possible that he and the Bills could agree to a return at a lower salary. Miller, who will turn 36 this month, is one of the best pass rushers of his era, a Super Bowl MVP and a three-time first-team All-Pro. He's not playing at that level anymore, but he'll draw interest from NFL teams who think he can still contribute, and can be a valuable veteran presence.</p>

Here’s everything you need to know about the SEC tournament. The Tigers, who fell at Texas A&M before losing to Alabama in overtime on Saturday, have 16 Quad 1 wins this season — which is way more than any other team in the country. The Crimson Tide were right there, too, though they dropped two of their last three to Tennessee and Florida before beating Auburn on Saturday. Keep an eye on both Georgia and Oklahoma this week in Nashville. Both teams could use a solid win or two to solidify their spots in the tournament.</p>

The two sides have agreed on a contract extension that will pay the defensive end an average annual salary of $40 million over four years and includes $123.5 million in guaranteed money, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported. (Las Vegas Raiders pass rusher Maxx Crosby previously held that title for four days after getting a contract extension last Wednesday.) The Browns attempted to start talks on a contract extension, but Garrett cut off negotiations following his trade request. Browns general manager Andrew Berry repeatedly said that the team had no interest in trading Garrett and wanted to extend his contract. However, Cleveland finished 3-14 last season and doesn't appear in position to improve much from that in the near future as the team attempts to solve its quarterback dilemma while attempting to fix the stranglehold that Deshaun Watson's contract has on its salary cap.</p>

They closed out the regular season with 10 straight wins, including over both Iowa State and Texas Tech, and they’ve lost just once since the end of November. The Cougars haven’t let a team score more than 65 points during their 10-game win streak, too. But lately, the team has been dealing with both significant injuries and illness, which has caused it to drop three of its last five games to close out the season. Houston held the Cyclones to just 59 points in their only matchup last month, too. If there is any hope of that left, it will likely take a run to the Big 12 title game in order for the Jayhawks to get their confidence back.</p>

The Buffalo Bills are releasing outside linebacker Von Miller, NFL Network reports. Cutting him will save the Bills $8.5 million on their salary cap. Last season, he served a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy amid accusations of domestic violence. Two years after signing a six-year, $120 million free-agent deal and sustaining the ACL injury, Miller agreed to a contract restructuring that reduced his base salary by half to save the Bills $8.645 million. Bills general manager Brandon Beane needed to push those salary cap savings even further for 2025 with Miller's production in decline.</p>

Things are not so simple in this round of 16 tie, though, with Liverpool looking pretty vulnerable heading into their home leg. As a result, it's difficult to know which version of Liverpool will show up on Tuesday. Real Madrid's season of inconsistency means last season's uncanny ability to win even in imperfect circumstances has not been equally as present this campaign, but they may have looked like their vintage selves in their 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid last week. It was undoubtedly a closely contested game, with both sides having meaningful spells of possession and impactful goalscoring chances. Barcelona may have a first leg advantage over Benfica, but last week's outing was far from their best.</p>

In the NBA, most super-duper stars have some sort of magical power that no one has ever seen before, but Tatum doesn’t. Victor Wembanyama could surpass Tatum one day in all six skills, but who knows if he’ll blossom into an all-world passer? There is no good reason why those guys can’t define the league going forward, with Tatum continuing to dominate in his own way.</p>

Miller, who turns 36-years-old on March 26, has just six sacks across the last two seasons, but he and the Bills are open to a return on a new deal ahead of his 14th NFL season, per NFL Media. Plus, he's reportedly interested in returning to his NFL home of the last three seasons despite them releasing him. He wouldn't even have a ton on his plate playing behind five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Danielle Hunter and 2023 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson Jr. That would be an ideal role Miller, one where he could be the veteran mentor while subbing in predominantly on clear passing downs. A return to the home of Miller's second Super Bowl win could make some sense. Miller could be a nice veteran addition to an edge rusher group led by 2022 first-round pick George Karlaftis III.</p>

LeBron James exited Saturday's much-anticipated rivalry clash between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics with a groin strain. Lakers head coach JJ Redick didn't have any additional details after the game, but conceded there was "obvious concern" about James' health. ESPN's Dave McMenamin also reported the initial thought is James will be out weeks rather than days. Yet he acknowledged that consulting with trainer Mike Mancias for more tests and imaging was necessary. "Ive been there before and know what type of injury we're dealing with," he explained and said that he expects to stay with the Lakers through the remaining three games of their road trip.</p>

After a month in which Garrett requested a trade and the Browns said he wasn’t going anywhere, an agreement has been reached: Garrett will sign a new contract with the Browns that makes him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history, according to Adam Schefter of ESPN. The full details of the contract are not yet known, but it reportedly includes $123.5 million guaranteed and will pay him an average of $40 million a year. Garrett’s trade request gave him leverage with the Browns, who didn’t want to lose their best player but recognized he wasn’t happy. With the 29-year-old Garrett now apparently planning to play out his prime in Cleveland, either he thinks the team is closer to a turnaround than it appears, or he is accepting that if the Browns can’t make him a champion, they can make him rich.

This time, it was a bit more clear as Gaethje earned the unanimous decision against an opponent making his return from injury on 12 days' notice. Ankalaev landed a hard left late that stung Pereira and seemed to take his legs before the horn sounded. That is one tough son of a b--ch," Gaethje said in his post-fight interview, praising Fiziev's performance on late notice.

George is set to replace former Bowling Green coach Scot Loeffler, who recently left to become the quarterbacks coach with the Philadelphia Eagles. Loeffler posted a 27-41 overall record in six seasons at Bowling Green and led the program to three straight bowl appearances from 2022-24. George just finished his fourth season at Tennessee State, leading the Tigers to a career-best 9-4 record capped by a Big South-Ohio Valley Conference co-championship and an appearance in the FCS playoffs. Tennessee State has upped its win total each year since 2022 under George. Tennessee State gave George his first career coaching appointment in 2021.</p>

This deal will certainly impact other non-quarterbacks whose agents are popping bottles while negotiating extensions for their superstar clients. Wide receivers still dominate the highest-paid non-quarterbacks list based on average per year salary, as six of them are in the top 10 with Hill and Aiyuk tied for 10th. All the money below is cash each respective player will see. These two charts hammer home why Garrett's deal will set the barometer for Watt, Parsons, Hendrickson, and other pass rushers seeking extensions.

If almost any team acquired him, he would arrive in his new city with extreme fanfare. Kyrie Irving tore an ACL, knocking him out not only for this season, but at least part of next year as well. And while Davis was stellar in his Dallas debut, he hasn't played since because of an abdominal injury. But he's fighting an uphill battle because fandom is more complex than that. He's someone they watched grow a teenager adjusting to life in a new country into one of the very best basketball players in the world, someone who could occupy a similar place in their community to Dirk Nowitzki, who famously played 21 years for the Mavericks without ever wearing another NBA uniform.</p>

Injury issues still plague the Arsenal attack but they haven't gone three Premier League games without a goal since August 2021. Manchester United: Patrick Dorgu is serving his suspension after a red card against Ipswich, complicating Amorim's options at left wing back, where defensive solidity will be needed to quell Arsenal's bright young spark Ethan Nwaneri. Toby Collyer returned to action against Real Sociedad in midweek but both Harry Maguire and Manuel Ugarte were missing because of knocks. "We have to recover, be really smart during the game against Arsenal," said Amorim, who must keep one eye on Thursday's Europa League round of 16 second leg at Old Trafford. Still it seems likely he'll keep his place in a team that might change little from Tuesday night.</p>

Criticisms Mount That Biden Is A 'Shadow' Of Himself After Disastrous Debate: 'Not The Same Man' From Vp Era Lies About Biden's Age, Health During His Presidency Is A 'Scandal Of Epic Proportions,' Scott Jennings Says Republican Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey sent a letter to the Department of Justice on Wednesday of last week demanding an investigation be opened into whether Biden’s "cognitive decline allowed unelected staff to push through radical policy without his knowing approval." Given President Biden's decision to revoke Executive Privilege for individuals advising Trump during his first Presidency, this is a knowable fact that can be determined with the correct legal process?"

As New Scientist reports, astrophysicists have discovered that the Radcliffe wave — a 9,000 light-year-long structure full of stars and the gas and dust needed to form new ones — seems to have swept over our entire Solar System around 14 million years ago. Now, University of Vienna doctoral student Efrem Maconi thinks that our whole Solar System may have passed through this incredible structure. On a geological and even evolutionary scale, that's incredibly recent; the dinosaurs are believed to have gone exstinct around 66 million years ago. According to Ralph Schoenrich, an associate climate and physics professor at University College London, that may be a stretch. "A rule of thumb is that geology trumps any cosmic influence," Schoenrich, who was not involved in the research, told New Scientist.</p>
