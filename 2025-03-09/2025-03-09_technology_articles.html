Here are five things in business tech news that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?

Meta has launched a pilot program introducing AI-powered customer service agents to assist businesses on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. These agents can interact with customers in real-time, handling tasks such as managing returns, providing product recommendations, and processing purchases. Utilizing data from a business's Meta footprint – including previous posts and customer service messages – agents can answer customer inquiries directly on ad pages or through direct messages. Agentic AI is enhancing CRM platforms like Salesforce which recently introduced AgentExchange – a new marketplace for AI agents in enterprise software. Launching with over 200 partners – including Google Cloud, DocuSign, Box, and Workday – pre-packaged agent solutions are being developed for businesses that can implement them without extensive technical expertise. Unlike traditional AI tools focused on text generation, these specialized AI agents are designed to perform complex tasks autonomously within business systems, effectively increasing labor capacity. (Source: Fast Company; VentureBeat)

2025 is the year of the agent. I’ve written about this before and will be revisiting this topic for another Forbes column soon. The takeaway is that finally – finally – generative AI will evolve this year to only provide information but also perform tasks to help us run our businesses more productively. The focus is on customer service. My advice is to lean in heavily and perhaps use some of these tools to build your own solutions.

The latest PayPal scam alert involves Docusign's Application Programming Interface (API). Scammers are exploiting the software to enhance the credibility of their phishing emails targeting PayPal users. By setting up Docusign accounts, these fraudsters utilize available templates to send legitimate-looking PayPal invoices. Recipients are notified of unauthorized transactions and prompted to contact a provided phone number to secure their account and process a refund. Since these emails originate from Docusign, they can bypass many security filters. Red flags include the use of Gmail addresses for PayPal customer support and the absence of documents requiring signatures – which is unusual for Docusign communications. Docusign has stated that it investigates and shuts down suspicious accounts within 24 hours of detection or reporting. (Source: Finextra)

I’ve been getting a ton o PayPal scam emails recently, requesting payment or asking me to confirm a payment made to my company. This is a new twist and using Docusign is a pretty savvy way to dupe businesses and individuals into giving away confidential information. Make sure your employees are aware of this, be extra vigilant, get training for your company and report anything you see to both PayPal and Docusign.

Lucas Mearian of Computerworld highlighted a significant increase in electronic employee monitoring as reported in a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The study found 80 percent of companies are monitoring remote or hybrid workers with 74 percent using software to log web browsing and 62 percent tracking screen activity. This surge in surveillance is linked to heightened worker stress, reduced job satisfaction, and potential declines in productivity. The proliferation of monitoring tools – such as RFID badges and biometric scanners – has raised ethical concerns regarding privacy and the potential for discriminatory practices. Experts caution that while these tools aim to boost productivity, they may inadvertently harm employee well-being and trust in the workplace. (Source: Computerworld)

I’m an opponent of employee monitoring. I realize that in some situations – cases where there’s valuable inventory, a higher risk of theft or even instances of potential harmful employee behavior – where monitoring can help a business. But for the most part I see my clients spending too much monitoring the minutia of an employee’s day – even when working from home – rather than running their business. You hire adults. Give them the respect of being adults. Stop spending so much time on something that likely has much lower risk to the overall profitability of your business and instead focus on growing your business and making your employees better.

Reddit is becoming an optimal platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to enhance their search engine optimization (SEO) efforts, engage with local communities, and build brand trust. Reddit content often appears prominently in Google search results, with users actively seeking out Reddit discussions for authentic reviews and insights. Example – when searching for services like a personal trainer in Brooklyn – users might include "Reddit" in their queries to find genuine community feedback. Unlike other social media platforms that frequently change their algorithms, Reddit maintains a consistent forum-style structure, allowing businesses to connect directly with niche audiences through specific communities known as subreddits. This direct engagement can lead to increased visibility and credibility. (Source: Search Engine Land)

I’m active on the r/CRM subreddit and have even received a few leads from it. But here’s the secret: don’t use Reddit as a leadgen tool. I like to go on the CRM subreddit to learn more about the industry, engage with users and even offer advice. I often get great advice there. Yes, I sometimes pitch our solutions, but usually it’s just an education and helpful engage which builds credibility and relationships. I never even considered the fact that this activity might showing up in online searches but that’s just a plus. I strongly recommend business owners pick a subreddit in their industry or expertise and engage with that community on a regular basis.

Alaina Yee of PCWorld reminded readers of why maintaining robust security for your PC is crucial in today's digital landscape. (Source: PCWorld)

Essential practices include Activating Built-in Antivirus Protection and Utilizing Third-Party Security Suites. For example, Avast One expands upon the company's free security suite, offering upgraded defenses against online threats and additional features. Yee also suggests Implementing Comprehensive Security Measures. Beyond the standard antivirus software, incorporating additional safeguards such as firewalls, browser extensions, password managers, and VPNs, will enhance your system's security. Keep Software Updated. Regularly update your operating system and all installed applications to patch vulnerabilities that cybercriminals might exploit.

Every week I round up five business tech news stories that will impact your business and give a few thoughts why.</p>
