                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A group of unconventional antiheroes has jumpstarted the summer box office. Disney and Marvel's "Thunderbolts*" tallied an estimated $76 million during its domestic opening weekend, the third highest debut of 2025. Including international ticket sales, the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe flick snared an estimated $162.1 million globally. "With the debut of 'Thunderbolts*,' May is shaping up to be one the best on record," said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. Last year, the summer box office — which kicks off the first weekend in May and runs through Labor Day — struggled at the start, with Universal's "The Fall Guy" only snapping up $28 million in its first three days. Marvel films have struggled in recent years to live up to the record-setting achievements of "Avengers: Endgame" in 2019. For every box office hit there was a major miss, and audiences bemoaned the studio's quality inconsistencies. Even in the last year, "The Marvels" and "Captain America: Brave New World" underwhelmed, while "Deadpool & Wolverine" overperformed. "Every franchise movie faces its share of tailwinds and headwinds, inherent and external factors that dictate what audience anticipation and response will be," said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. "But there's no doubt 'Thunderbolts*' is a moment worth a victory lap for Marvel after several years of wildly varying sentiment toward multiple films and streaming series." While $76 million is middle of the pack for the MCU, it's a strong performance for "Thunderbolts*," box office analysts told CNBC. "To launch an ensemble of junior varsity characters unfamiliar to many outside the core fan base, and to do so with some of the best word of mouth the MCU has seen from critics and audiences in years, is a fresh reminder of what Marvel is capable of when the creative engine fires on all cylinders," Robbins said. "Thunderbolts*" currently holds an 88% "Fresh" rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, from 257 reviews and a 94% rating from audiences. "[It] looks to follow in the tradition of 'A Minecraft Movie' and 'Sinners,' with long-term playability." In recent weeks, Warner Bros.' "A Minecraft Movie" and "Sinners" have consistently lured in moviegoers, with smaller-than-average weekly attendance drops. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.

Israel's security cabinet was set to meet on Sunday to approve an expansion of military action in Gaza and discuss aid deliveries ahead of a planned visit to the Middle East this month by President Donald Trump. 

The new ground operations will likely involve taking control of additional territory while stopping short of a full siege, according to two Israeli officials who spoke on condition on anonymity on matters they were not authorized to discuss publicly. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump took credit for the "good parts" of the economy in an exclusive interview with NBC News airing Sunday, but said that the "bad parts" are former President Joe Biden's economy. Trump defended his tariffs, even amid the economic uncertainty stemming from the sweeping announcement. "Ultimately, I take responsibility for everything, but I've only just been here for a little more than three months," Trump said. "The tariffs have just started kicking in. The tariffs are going to make us rich. We're going to be a very rich country," he added. It's not the first time that Trump has tried to shift blame to his predecessor. Trump also doubled down on comments he made during a Cabinet meeting earlier in the week, when he dismissed concerns that his tariffs would lead to supply shortages. "I don't think a beautiful baby girl needs – that's 11 years old – needs to have 30 dolls," Trump said. "Look, yeah, it's — everything's OK. What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we're going to do fantastically," he told Welker. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bela Bajaria has had an incredible nine-year run at Netflix. She joined in 2016 to oversee unscripted and scripted series, led the streaming giant's push into live events and sports, and worked her way up to becoming the company's chief content officer. But before then, she has what she calls a "big public failure" which turned out to be "the greatest learning lesson": She was fired from her job as president of Universal Television after a five-year tenure and big accomplishments, including building a strong comedy roster with top creators like Tina Fey and Mike Schur. "There's amazing books and quotes and all this stuff about [how] you learn so much from failure, and failure is important, and you're not trying hard enough if you're not failing," Bajaria told CNBC's Julia Boorstin at the recent 2025 Changemakers Summit in Los Angeles. "And all of that is true, but then when you fail, nobody wants to talk about it." There's plenty of gendered stigma that keep women from discussing their firings, Bajaria added, "because we're supposed to be perfect" and a dismissal is "a blemish." The first few months after her firing were especially tough, she said. We had a lot of success — it meant nothing." The actual response to her firing challenged that, she said. I thought it was really a great, successful run," she added. Bajaria was quick to note that coming to terms with her firing, and finding the upside of it, is easier after nearly a decade of distance. "The first three months were really rough," she said. "In retrospect I am so grateful that it happened," Bajaria said. Under Bajaria's leadership, Netflix has become a destination to watch live events including comedy specials, awards shows, WWE programming and NFL games.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More often than not, they crumble under the weight of small missteps that quietly accumulate — until they become too heavy to manage. As a psychologist who studies couples, I've seen many versions of this. Partners come into my office thinking their problem has something to do with frequent fights or arguments. There's one phrase I've seen come up in these exchanges that's more damaging than you think: "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" If you use this toxic phrase, your relationship is in trouble. What couples fail to recognize is that the person named is actually irrelevant, whether it's an ex, a best friend's girlfriend, or even "how you used to be." The real message will always remain the same: "You're not enough, and someone else — anyone else — could do a better job at being my partner." Over time, this kind of comparison can give rise to irreparable insecurity issues. Rather than feeling loved for who they are, the person on the receiving end will start questioning their worth and constantly wonder if they're living up to expectations. DON'T MISS: How to successfully change careers and be happier at work Relationships can't thrive when we ask our partner to be someone they're not. That's why this phrase itself isn't the real problem. According to one study, when a partner feels uncertain about the relationship, or unsure of how their partner will respond, they're more likely to hold back. Rather than just saying outright, "I feel disconnected when we don't spend quality time together," they compartmentalize it. These moments only pile up over time, until the day comes that they inexplicably blurt out something like, "Why can't you be more like Sarah's husband? It's not necessarily that they want a different partner; it's that they don't feel safe enough to voice their needs plainly. Instead of pointing to someone else as a model, turn the spotlight inward. And why are you so afraid to ask it plainly? He never blows up over small things," give these a try instead: Notice how these versions are rooted in your own experience, not someone else's behavior.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Panama Canal has spent the past few years battling extreme weather, with the El Niño phenomenon and severe drought leading to a water-level crisis. A critical passage for U.S. East Coast bound ocean freight container traffic, the Panama Canal is facing a potential business slump as a result of Trump's China tariffs and a rapid decline in manufactured goods being ordered by U.S. shippers. Forty percent of all U.S. container traffic travels through the Panama Canal every year, and in all, $270 billion in cargo annually. The Panama Canal Authority's revenue hit $3.38 billion last year, despite drought conditions, and revenue has increased every year since 2017. The trade war uncertainty and Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese goods — which will start to hit goods arriving from China to U.S. ports on May 27 based on the four to six weeks it takes for ocean freight to reach the U.S. from Asia — has already resulted in a massive pause on U.S. imports bound from China. According to data from supply chain intelligence firm Project44, there has been a 300% increase in blank sailings (cancelled freight vessels) from China to the United States since Trump's so-called "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement on April 2. West Coast ports in the U.S. are already being hit and the impact on East Coast ports is expected to increase, with the pullback in vessels a result of the decrease in manufacturing orders for Chinese factories: less products manufactured translates into less shipping containers for ocean carriers. For the Asia to North America East Coast trade route, Sea-Intelligence has recorded a cumulative blanked capacity of 261,822 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs.) This decrease in containers and vessels can impact Panama Canal revenue. "Since close to 75% of our cargo goes to or from the United States, any recession worldwide or in the United States will impact somehow the Panama Canal," said Boris Moreno, vice president of operations for the Panama Canal Authority. Trump has claimed the canal's key ports are being controlled by China, and has threatened to reassert U.S. control over the canal, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates. China, along with government of Panama, have denied those claims. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth both visited with Panamanian government officials in recent months. "I think that Panama over the last five years has inched closer and closer to China and away from the United States," Federal Maritime Commissioner Louis Sola said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year. "I've seen China and Brazil take away $20 billion with direct contracts. We definitely need to at least have a game there." Ricaurte Vasquez, administrator for the Panama Canal Authority, tells CNBC that with the U.S. being the world's largest economy, it is reviewing Trump's concerns. "We try to stay cool, calm and collected." He added, "It is not true that we are run by Chinese. It is not true that we differentiate rates. Everyone that wants to sail sails through the Panama Canal. And we are open to the world. In March, an investment group led by U.S. firm BlackRock announced it was trying to purchase two ports at either end of the canal, as well as about 40 others from Hong Kong based-CK Hutchison. The outcome of that deal remains unclear. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In some U.S. cities, it now takes more than twice the income to afford a median-priced home than to afford a median-priced apartment — and the gap keeps growing. The figures are based on the standard assumption that housing costs shouldn't exceed 30% of gross income, a common affordability benchmark. The estimates reflect national and metro-level data for the three months ending in February 2025, comparing median home sale prices with median asking rents for newly listed apartments in buildings with five or more units. That's largely due to soaring home prices and high mortgage rates, while rent growth has mostly stalled. "It has become increasingly challenging for American renters to make the shift to homeownership thanks to the triple whammy of rising home prices, high mortgage rates and a shortage of houses for sale," writes Redfin senior economist Elijah de la Campa. For buyers, demand has far outpaced supply in recent years, as a pandemic-era slowdown in construction worsened an already tight housing market. For rentals, prices have remained flat over the past two years, driven by a wave of new apartment construction that has boosted supply, according to Redfin. In 13 of the 42 largest U.S. metro areas, the income required to afford a median-priced home is now more than double what's needed to rent a median-priced apartment. Big cities tend to have higher home costs because they attract people for jobs and opportunity, driving up demand and pushing home prices higher — especially when supply is limited. The steepest disparity is in San Jose, where buyers need to earn $408,557 annually — more than three times the income required to rent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine said it shot down two Russian fighter jets with naval drones, describing it as the "first time in history" the technology had destroyed a crewed combat aircraft. The Su-30 fighter jets are estimated to cost about $50 million per unit. The GUR shared a video of an aircraft in the sky that appears to have been shot from below, which shows an aircraft-shaped object breaking apart and falling. The GUR said the strike was carried out by a missile launched from a Magura naval drone platform, which can carry missiles that the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence previously said would target Russian aircraft. The Su-30 is a multirole fighter that can do both air-to-air and air-to-ground attacks. Ukraine has destroyed others in its fight back against Russia's invasion. Ukraine has also launched attacks on Novorossiysk. Ukraine has developed a fleet of naval drones that have menaced Russia's navy. They, along with Ukraine's other weaponry, have allowed Ukraine to largely neutralize Russia's Black Sea Fleet without having any real navy of its own. Ukraine said in December that it destroyed a Russian helicopter with a naval drone for the first time, saying a Magura was used in that attack too. A spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Defence did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You could call Maulik Suchak something of a résumé expert. His résumés have gotten him to final-round interviews at Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Atlassian, and led to multiple offers, including at Yelp, Microsoft, SurveyMonkey, and the Magnificent 7 company he's been at for nearly five years out of his 14-year career. But, as the 34-year-old lead software engineer told Business Insider, "My deep dive into résumés didn't start because I was job hunting — it started because I was building a product." In 2013, at 23 years old, Suchak co-created a résumé-building platform, CVsIntellect, with another engineer. Their vision was to make the résumé-creation process easier by offering a tool that didn't just generate résumés, but helped guide users toward stronger content and structure. This side project became Suchak's crash course in résumé content. "This gave me deep insights into both the content and presentation side of résumés: what stands out, what gets ignored, and how different audiences interpret the same information," he said. Two years after launching CVsIntellect, while working as a software engineer in India, Suchak leveraged his learnings to finesse his own job-search materials. "I knew how to write in a way that hiring managers would respond to, because I'd spent so much time thinking like one," Suchak said. Crafting a breakthrough résumé was about storytelling, positioning, and clarity — skills that ultimately helped him first break into Big Tech and later nab a role at his current Magnificent 7 company. His efforts led to multiple job offers from companies such as Microsoft and Yelp. In just under five years at Yelp, Suchak grew to lead a team of 14 software engineers as an engineering manager. In this capacity, he  gained hiring responsibility, which gave him another foray into résumé review. "Whenever someone reaches out for feedback on their résumé, I try my best to help," Suchak said. Suchak followed his natural curiosity about how people at top companies present their experience. "I've spent a lot of time reading LinkedIn profiles, GitHub READMEs, and personal portfolios to understand how engineers craft their narratives — especially those in roles I admire," he said. He reached the final round interviews at Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Atlassian, and SurveyMonkey, again receiving several offers. In 2020, he accepted the job at his current Magnificent 7 company. He attributes much of this success to the first impression his compelling résumé set. Here's the exact résumé that helped Suchak achieve these victories — and five strategies he feels played a major role in ensuring his résumé told a persuasive enough story to open the right doors. Every bullet point on his résumé included a tangible result — metrics or improvements that demonstrated real impact. This framed his work as meaningful and effective, not just functional. "For example, instead of saying 'Worked on improving Yelp Cash Back sign-up page,' I wrote 'Improved Cash Back sign-up pages with various A/B tests with Python and JS resulted in 2X higher conversion.'" "Each role built logically on the previous one, and I highlighted progression — either in scope, skillset, or leadership," he said. "The idea was to show momentum and intentional career moves rather than random hopping around." When building his résumé platform, Suchak often saw résumés that were three or more pages, filled with every job, internship, or online course candidates had ever done. "Each bullet was one to two lines max, and I avoided buzzwords," he said. "This made it easier for a recruiter or hiring manager to scan quickly and still get a full picture of my strengths." He even mentioned one of his projects in a Magnificent 7 interview, he said, "because it showed initiative, technical depth, and a bit of product thinking." A "last but not least" job-search principle Suchak believes in is that even the best résumé content can be overlooked if the formatting is messy. He opted for clean fonts, consistent spacing, and clear section headers. He also avoided dense blocks of text and added just enough white space to make for a comfortable reading experience. "Looking back, if I could change anything about the résumé that got me into my Mag 7 job, I'd highlight more personal projects with shorter descriptions of each," he said. "I'd also try to add even more impact and numbers." While many career experts suggest customizing your résumé for each job and company you apply to, Suchak didn't tweak his résumé at all for the job he ended up landing. He now recognizes the value in tailoring résumés to the position you want, studying job descriptions, and integrating keywords from them to get past ATS filters. "Instead of sending the same generic résumé everywhere, I'd now match my experience to each role," Suchak said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York's Letitia James is easily the most aggressive state attorney general in the country when it comes to suing President Donald Trump. She's on the front lines of 15 legal actions brought by coalitions of Democratic AGs, all seeking to block executive orders and DOGE cuts, Her $454 million fraud verdict against Trump and his real estate company remains on appeal in Manhattan. But James' most daring excursion into Trumpworld may be one she has yet to formally announce. It's an ongoing inquiry into potential insider trading by the president's inner circle, centered on last month's markets-roiling tariff policies. James' so-called inquiry — the formal name for a kind of probe that falls short of a full-blown investigation — has rounded its second month, an AG spokesman confirmed to Business Insider, declining to divulge details beyond saying the office is "looking at" possible insider trading. Business Insider asked a half-dozen legal experts, including three former high-level financial-fraud prosecutors from the New York AG's office. Some pointed to the perennial concerns over insider trading by members of Congress. They called James' inquiry a proper, even necessary, exercise of the power vested in an attorney general whose Manhattan office sits three blocks north of the Stock Exchange. Others called her inquiry a politically motivated boondoggle that's doomed to fail. "There's been nothing like this," said Manhattan attorney Armen Morian, a former financial crimes prosecutor for the New York AG's office who helped defend Trump during James' fraud case. The inquiry is empowered by New York's Martin Act, a 104-year-old statute that gives state attorneys general extraordinary powers to police Wall Street. It allows the AG to issue subpoenas, grill suspects under oath, and file civil lawsuits or criminal charges. It prosecutes securities and real estate frauds and is used only rarely for insider trading, which is the illegal profiting off of stock tips not available to the public. Legal experts and three veterans of the AG's office who have brought prosecutions under the Martin Act say they've never heard of it being used to investigate insider tips involving government policy, in this case, Trump's on-and-off tariffs. The novelty of James' inquiry does not, in itself, doom her effort, said a former financial crimes prosecutor who asked not to be named, citing work constraints against speaking to the press. "There is a body of Martin Act insider trading law — just not on these exact facts — that has been developed over decades," the former prosecutor said. "And remember, the facts of every case are always novel." An "inquiry" is what the New York AG's office calls the earliest stage of a probe — before subpoenas go out, explained former Executive Attorney General Manisha M. Sheth. Now a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Sheth oversaw the AG's Division of Economic Justice. Securities inquiries can be sparked by whistleblower tips or by allegations that surface publicly in the press or a lawsuit, she told BI. There, prosecutors working with the AGs' research analysts and data scientists would begin by reviewing raw trading data, she said. Were there spikes in trading, for instance, on April 9, in the hours before Trump posted on Truth Social, "THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!" "Such letters can ask for documents, data, or information," she said. Cooperating at this early stage is completely voluntary. If a case advances to the point that subpoenas are issued, an inquiry will have graduated to an investigation, Sheth said. "I do think it's going to start with using trading data to show that no reasonable person would have engaged in these trades without that non-public information," said Anthony Capozzolo, a former federal and state prosecutor. "You're going to want to, at the least, build an initial case that shows it's very likely that the only motivating factor for these trades was this allegedly inside information." Compiling trading data will be tougher these days, predicted Capozzolo, a partner at Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss in Manhattan and a former federal and state-level prosecutor. Pre-Trump, the AG would routinely and easily ask the Securities and Exchange Commission for trading data that's not already publicly available. Identifying suspicious-seeming trading patterns is only the beginning, legal experts said. Say, solely as a hypothetical, that a Trump insider reaped a small fortune by buying the dip in Apple stock right before Trump announced the tariff carve-out for electronics from China that sent the stock soaring. That's not enough to prove insider trading, legal experts said. "But the difficulty is a lot of these things may have happened in the presence of very upper-level Trump and MAGA acolytes." "You'll see an immediate challenge," said Morian, who helped prosecute AIG CEO Hank Greenberg in the longest Martin Act case in the AG's history. Suing, charging, or subpoenaing Trump is a non-starter, given executive privilege and presidential immunity, which bars prosecution for official acts, Morian said. (He predicts presidential immunity would extend to civil cases as well someday, "If that ever gets to the Supreme Court.") State AG subpoenas issued to members of the executive branch — cabinet members and the like — could also be challenged on executive privilege grounds. "If you overreach too far, you could easily see a private litigant taking this up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court limiting the jurisdiction of state attorneys general in ways we've never seen before," he said. James is being probed by the DOJ for alleged mortgage fraud, an allegation she has called baseless and which her attorney, Abbe Lowell, has called "improper political retribution," according to CBS. Should her insider-trading inquiry advance, James, a Democrat who campaigned for AG on a promise of investigating Trump, would herself would face accusations of political retribution and bias. Over the years, Trump has decried James' investigations into his finances and business as baseless, "racist," and part of a "political witch hunt." How can anyone call it insider trading if thousands of investors are making similar trades for benign reasons, based on hunches, past experience, or dumb luck, he asked. "When the markets are this volatile, people make and lose money second to second, for any number of reasons," agreed Morian.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett stunned the audience at his annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday when he announced his plan to resign at year's end after a nearly six-decade run as the leader of the trillion-dollar empire. Reactions have poured in from business leaders who know and admire the billionaire investor. One person who is more familiar with Buffett's life than most is Alice Schroeder, a journalist who wrote the 2008 bestselling biography of Buffett, "The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," after spending a decade getting to know him and his family. She spoke with Business Insider about the iconic investor's legacy amid news of his planned resignation. This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. My initial reaction is: For heaven's sake, he deserves to retire at 94 years old from the day-to-day responsibilities of being a CEO, which are quite considerable. I'm sure he's going to remain involved and will be consulted by those who want his advice — and who wouldn't want his advice? I have not been in contact with him in a few years, not because of any issue, but because he's at an age where he's not chit-chatting on the phone with everybody he knows all the time. I knew that he would remain CEO as long as he could, but he would not remain CEO beyond a certain point where he either wasn't enjoying having that responsibility, or for any other reason — I'm not going to speculate about anything related to his health because I don't know enough, but anybody at age 94 has got some things going on. So this day was going to come sooner or later. What do you think this means for the future of Berkshire Hathaway? I've been thinking about this since Warren was in his 60s because he's literally not replaceable, and so, of course, Berkshire Hathaway will be different. That said, I have never believed Berkshire's decentralized leadership style would survive Warren stepping down as CEO. Warren has been very candid in saying: Don't expect the company's results to be that much better — or necessarily any better — than the market as a whole over the long term after he's gone. Well, the long term has arrived, and now a lot of things are going to change. So I think those who own the stock should not be worried because the business side could be almost put on autopilot, but there's a certain element of magic that is departing now, of course. Or do you think he's built something steady that is going to survive this moment of economic turmoil and well into the future? Warren's business career began during the Great Depression when he was a child and has spanned Vietnam, various financial crises, and the pandemic. He has done everything possible to construct a robust business that could survive what I would call normally foreseeable events. Can you think of a black swan that might disrupt the business? Sure, but they'd be very one-off scenarios, and I think you'd have to go many standard deviations away from even extreme outcomes for that to happen. What about advice for Buffett's likely successor, Greg Abel? I think it would be pretty presumptuous for me to give advice that Warren Buffett hasn't given, but with that caveat, his greatest focus for his successor has always been that his successor would allocate capital wisely, not go on a merger spree, overpay for other businesses, start divesting businesses, or repurchase stock at excessive valuations. I believe he has actually hammered that into people's heads, and it's unlikely to happen. With that said, Berkshire has been, for some time, generating much more capital than it can use. So I think that the possibility of a dividend could be there under someone other than Warren. But I wouldn't expect Berkshire to change its approach to managing risk or asset liability management or anything like that. I don't think a dividend will be announced in the short term. But what I think will steady investors is seeing that nothing remarkable happens without Warren in the CEO role, because there is a magic to him and the things that he says, of course, and there will be a reaction to him not being in the day-to-day role. So we'll have to go through a period where he's not in the day-to-day role and see that the businesses actually are robust. You can't predict how investors will react, and I do know that most investors would agree that he's irreplaceable, but we also have known that this was coming for a long time as he's gotten older, so hopefully, people are prepared. How long do you think it'll take for that confidence to return? Right now, predicting anything in the market would be foolish. I mean, he's 94 — it's reasonable for him to step down. And if that truly was a major factor, I think he would have identified it. Looking back at your relationship with him, what lessons did he share with you that you think of now, in light of him taking this step? I learned almost everything I know about dealing with people, managing people, and negotiating from him, including in my personal life. I credit him with making a major change in my marriage, and I'm now very happily married to my second husband, and that is directly, directly due to Warren Buffett. That's how much I trust his judgment about people. He is amazing at dealing with people, but there are also the timeless kinds of things that he has hammered home over and over: what makes a good business, how to compare two businesses and know which one is better, how to manage risk personally in your portfolio. Do you have a favorite Buffett-ism, either personally or something he's shared with the world, that particularly resonates with you? One thing that he has said to me, in a number of different ways, is that if you are talking to someone, and you say 99 things about them that are positive, and throw in one small criticism, the only thing they'll remember is the criticism — and that's how he manages people. I did not really understand that until I spent so much time with him, but I've seen it since in life, over and over, that you really have to give undiluted praise if you want people to feel it, and if you have something negative to say, tell them privately. You attract a lot of correspondence if you're as famous as he is, and, of course, some people are unhinged. In fact, that was one of the most important things that he taught me: Being both rich and famous is a terrible curse. He's always wanted his legacy to be as a teacher. I think his shareholder letters, all the amazing quotes and stories that are in my book, or things other people have written about him, those are his body of work, and his teachings will have an enduring value. He initially started out wanting to teach investors, but he increasingly branched into the personal, how to live your life — you don't want to wind up being somebody that, if you had a heart attack while you were giving a speech and fell off the stage, nobody would call 911, and he told me about people he knew that were in that situation. If you really look at it, he's spent almost his whole life teaching people, so I think that will be his greatest legacy.</p>
