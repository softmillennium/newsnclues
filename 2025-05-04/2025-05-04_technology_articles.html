                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. The revving of an F1 car's power unit can reach up to 140 decibels. That's like standing next to a firework as it's exploding. Now imagine there's twenty of them, twenty fireworks going off simultaneously as the cars roar past you at 200 mph. It's exactly that visceral experience that Lego wanted to tap into when, last year, it partnered with Formula 1 to create ten full sets of teams and drivers for its Speed Champions line. This year, it's taking that a step further, and making them an awesome, full-sized reality. Over the course of eight months, a team of 26 Lego engineers took about 22,000 hours total to build the brick-based fleet. This took the total cooperation of each Formula 1 team. Lego designer Marcel Stastny noted that each F1 team provided complete IP with approvals for faithful reproduction. “We had great cooperation,” Stastny said, which, beyond the engineering, was a coup given that Formula 1 teams guard the car's designs so closely. I had the opportunity to get inside the McLaren car, which is made from the exact same standard Lego bricks that your kids can buy at home, made with Lego's famously tight tolerances. It feels … well, as solid as a brick, which makes sense given that the car weighs over 3,000 pounds. It might not have a real V6 engine (in fact, each car can only go 12 mph), and the drag reduction system (DRS) might not work either, but those are real F1 Pirelli tires set in a Lego hub. F1 superfan and Lego ambassador Nicole, who goes by the name GirlBricksALot, concurs. Last year, McLaren driver Lando Norris took a Lego Technic P1 all the way around the course at Silverstone. Each one of these is, of course, a masterful marketing operation, with Lego keen to promise this level of attention to detail has filtered down to the versions that you can build at home for $30—bringing racing fans closer to the cars they might never see in real life. A bit like Drive to Survive, it feels that Lego Speed Champions is serving as an entryway into a sport that has been opaque and inaccessible to so many for most of its history—something Nicole says she experienced as a young fan. “[As a kid], I would follow F1 with articles or YouTube snippets,” she said. Today, the sport doesn't feel as inaccessible. For a sport that has traditionally catered to such a wealthy clientele, it requires a surprising amount of physical endurance, whether that's walking 11,000 steps to get from the gate to your section, broiling in the sun in your seat, or surviving for 8 hours on ice cream with chocolate sauce because you (I) refuse to wait in any more lines. There are way more people wearing funny hats shaped like cars or wings than I expected, way more kids shrieking at the vibrations in the turn bridges. When it started raining during the practice rounds, I hid under an umbrella until I noticed fans gathering around the turns cheering whenever a driver threw up a high sheet of water, like Shamu. It was especially easy to notice during the driver's parade that both are just … fun. My 7-year-old son might not be able to tolerate the heat and walking that a Grand Prix requires (I can barely tolerate it, and I'm in my 40s) but he's currently on his 6th Formula 1 set and counting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's SpaceX is getting its own official company town. Residents of an area around SpaceX's Starbase launch site in southern Texas voted overwhelmingly on Saturday to incorporate as a city — also named Starbase. According to results posted online by the Cameron County Elections Department, there were 212 votes in favor and only six against. The new city's residents are believed to mostly be SpaceX employees. Musk — who recently said he would be reducing his role with the Trump administration's controversial Department of Government Efficiency to a “day or two” per week — announced last year that he was moving SpaceX's headquarters from El Segundo, California to the Starbase facility in Texas. At the time, Musk said he'd “had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building” and that the “final straw” was a California bill that prohibits schools from disclosing students' sexuality or gender identity without consent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A dating app that, just this week, announced a creepy new wearable, has been found to have publicly exposed users' data. The data was granular and personal, including their approximate locations. The app, Raw, says it is dedicated to promoting “real and unfiltered love” through its unique user interface, which resembles BeReal (it utilizes the front and back cameras of your phone), but for dating. Unfortunately, it would appear that Raw has also been promoting something else in quite an “unfiltered” fashion: users' data. TechCrunch reports that due to a lack of basic digital security protections, Raw was accidentally leaving users' personal information open to public inspection. Indeed, prior to this week, anyone with a web browser would have been able to access detailed app user information, including their date of birth, display names, sexual preferences, and quite specific “street-level” location data. Raw was downloaded onto a virtualized Android device, and then TC staffers used a network monitoring tool to observe the data being transmitted to and from the app. TC also notes that, while Raw claims to protect users with end-to-end encryption, it found no evidence that E2EE was present. In practice, that meant anyone could access any other user's private information by using a web browser to visit the web address of the exposed server — api.raw.app/users/ followed by a unique 11-digit number corresponding to another app user. Changing the digits to correspond with any other user's 11-digit identifier returned private information from that user's profile, including their location data. This kind of vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a type of bug that can allow someone to access or modify data on someone else's server because of a lack of proper security checks on the user accessing the data. Gizmodo reached out to Raw for more information. It's not uncommon for companies to poorly secure user data. Strange as it may sound, security is not a particularly huge priority in the software industry. It can be time-consuming, expensive, and may slow down other parts of production, so many companies simply don't bother with it. With a dating app, however—a business which is dedicated to handling users' most intimate (literally) and sensitive data—it obviously pays to spend a little bit more time locking stuff down.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As it goes with every Marvel movie, Thunderbolts ends twice: first before the end titles, and again after the credits have rolled. Both closers are pretty important for what's next for the team and their upcoming appearance in Avengers: Doomsday, and director Jake Schreier's discussed about how the post-credits came about. Schreier told Variety that scene was shot about a month ago (prior to its mid-April premiere), and by Doomsday directors Joe and Anthony Russo in London. The team was already confirmed to be among that film's cast back in March, and for those keeping track, this post-credits makes the brothers' first scene they shot since they exited the MCU with Avengers: Endgame. Schreier may not have directed his former Thunderbolts, but he looked at the scene's scripts and collborated on it “to make sure it was honest to where our characters were. [We're] giving them over to this whole new world and new scope, and [we] want them to function in that way.” Being there on set was “very fun to watch your buddies go on to this grander scale…and see them directed in another context and on a different level of scope than we had been treating it.” Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Backstage, a project it open-sourced in 2020, has been adopted by more than 2 million developers across 3,400 organizations, including Airbnb, LinkedIn, Twilio, and American Airlines. Backstage helps companies build customized “internal developer portals” (IDPs), bringing order to their infrastructure chaos by combining all their tooling, apps, data, services, APIs, and documents in a single interface. Want to monitor Kubernetes, view cloud costs, or check your CI/CD status? The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which accepted Backstage as an incubating project in 2022, reports that Backstage was one of its top 5 projects last year in terms of velocity and activity. Companies can already use the core Backstage product for free, including an array of open source plugins that extend its functionality. And last year, Spotify got serious about its dev tools business play, announcing Spotify Portal for Backstage in beta: a premium, oven-baked incarnation for those lacking the resources (or inclination) to set everything up themselves. “We discovered that there were a lot of different customer profiles,” Tyson Singer (pictured above), Spotify's head of technology and platforms, explained to TechCrunch in an interview at KubeCon last month. “Our original theory was that Backstage was going to be bigger for mid-size to large enterprises dealing with a lot of complexity, but we found that small companies also see these same problems. Spotify also teased a couple of new premium Portal plugins at KubeCon, including AiKA (“AI knowledge assistant”), which is basically a chatbot initially developed internally for its own employees. So rather than bombarding support channels in Slack, employees can just ask AiKA, which is trained on its own internal documents and data. Singer also says that AiKA's utility — providing instant answers to questions — motivates employees to make sure all their documents are up-to-date because it makes AiKA smarter. If someone doesn't get a good response to a question, they can see what source was used in the response, and provide feedback to ensure the source document is improved. But also it creates this very positive fly-wheel between quality and discovery.” Spotify has confirmed that an alpha version of AiKA is set to launch for third parties imminently. And while it won't be at feature parity with its own internal version initially, it should go some way toward bolstering Backstage's stickiness as a premium product in the long run. Some 20 months ago the company announced Confidence, an A/B experimentation platform that has remained in stealth ever since. According to Singer, Spotify will have more to say about Confidence later this year, though he did hint at potential synergies between Confidence and Portal in the form of a plugin that brings some simple feature-flagging functionality into Portal. When all is said and done, creating a developer tooling side-hustle on top of its day job as an online music emporium has surely been a major undertaking. But there has been good reason for all of this. “When you have a product that gets replaced by an external product, particularly an open source one, that migration cost is just tremendous,” Singer said.

With listed reads of 14.9 GB/s, this should be the fastest consumer PCIe 5.0 SSD, at least if we're talking about on-paper specifications. In theory, this should extend to Western Digital's acclaimed WD Black lineup, though end-users are unlikely to experience any significant changes. The bottom line is that Sandisk will probably be responsible for bringing the SN8100 to market, handling everything from launch to customer support, but it will be marketed with Western Digital's well-known WD label. That being said, Western Digital did show off a prototype 15 GB/s SSD last year at FMS 2024, which leveraged an in-house controller, with comparable power draw. We'll know for sure when Sandisk provides a complete technical datasheet. The NAND ICs employ a TLC (Triple Level Cell) design with CBA technology, likely sourced from 8th generation (218-layer) NAND jointly developed by Sandisk and Kioxia. The SN8100 is said to launch in 1TB to 4TB capacities, but as of writing, only the 1TB model is listed for pre-order. In terms of pricing, the 1TB variant is listed at $225 (€199.99), or about 22.5 cents per Gigabyte. This is significantly more expensive than PCIe 4.0 options, which currently average around 6-7 cents per gigabyte; even less during sales. Bearing that in mind, German users can pre-order this SSD at Amazon, with deliveries scheduled to begin on May 30. Hopefully, we will see an official announcement by then.

The third side is the rear panel, which includes a Sync button to pair the satellites, two 2.5 GbE ports, a 2.5 GbE WAN port, and a proprietary barrel-style port for power. There are also latches on the back for attaching the satellites to a wall with included wall mounts. This is an appreciated and surprising addition from MSI, as satellite wall mounts are often available as an optional add-on from the manufacturer or as a third-party aftermarket accessorIncluding of the mounts in a mesh router system that costs just over $200 is admirable. The top triangular portion of each satellite is home to ventilation slits to keep the electronics inside cool. MSI recommends that you complete the initial configuration of the Roamii BE Lite using its smartphone app, which is appropriately called MSI Roamii. The Roamii BE Lite satellites come pre-paired, so you don't have to go through any additional steps during the setup process. This is a welcome change compared to similarly priced mesh routers like the Deco BE5000 and the Eero 7, which feature app-only controls. You get charts for CPU and memory utilization along with a traffic analyzer. You'll also see the network topography, connected nodes, and internet status. There are comprehensive controls for wireless settings, including wireless mode (i.e., 802.11 a/n/ac/ax/be mixed mode), WPA2/WPA3 security, and a "soft" activation for Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). An IoT network can be enabled, with further settings to only give connected devices access to the internet, with no private network access. You can even prevent IoT devices from talking with each other on the network. For families, MSI includes a Child Network option, which allows you to schedule times when a child can access the internet on their device. So, if you don't want your elementary-school-age kids accessing content on their tablets after bedtime, you can lock them down here. When it comes to added security, MSI provides its FortiSecu software, which Trend Micro powers. This security suite comes free of charge with the Roamii BE Lite, which is a nice add-in considering that Amazon required you to sign up for Eero Plus to get this kind of protection on its Eero routers. As we mentioned in the introduction, the Roamii BE Lite already has one hand tied behind its back regarding performance – it lacks the high-performance 6 GHz band, which we've seen allow some flagship mesh routers, like the Asus ZenWiFi BQ16 Pro, to surpass 3.5 Gbps in our throughput tests. With that said, the Roamii BE Lite does leverage other benefits of the Wi-Fi 7 spec, like 4K-QAM and multi-link operation (MLO). As always, our Wi-Fi client testbed is a Windows 11 desktop with an MSI Pro B650M-A Wi-Fi motherboard, AMD Ryzen 5 7600 CPU, 32GB of DDR5, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, and an MSI Herald-BE Wi-Fi 7 PCIe adapter. All these devices use the most recent software, BIOS, firmware, and drivers (where applicable). The iPerf3 throughput tests are conducted with our Windows 11 server equipped with an onboard 10 Gbps wired network card connected to the 1 Gbps LAN port on the primary Roamii BE Lite node. Wireless tests are then performed multiple times at 6-foot and 25-foot distances. Wireless tests are initially run with the network free of added traffic from other clients. Next, the tests are repeated with simulated traffic from additional users accessing the network (for our testing, we use six clients streaming 4K video from YouTube Premium). The Deco BE5000 fell to 472 Mbps, while the Eero 7 plummeted nearly a third of its 6 feet performance to 346 Mbps. This strong, long-distance performance (against its rivals) would echo in later tests. The Eero 7 and Deco BE500 were far behind in both metrics. Overall, I saw consistent performance from the Roamii BE Lite, with no hiccups in our testing. MSI's Roamii BE Lite was a strong performer across the board in our Wi-Fi throughput tests, and it proved to be stable with multiple devices connected (at one point, I had over 40 Wi-Fi devices connected across the two satellite nodes). My main hangup with the Roamii BE Lite echoes what I've said about previous dual-band Wi-Fi 7 routers – they aren't fully compliant with the spec, which leads to confusion among consumers shopping to upgrade their older routers. The Roamii BE Lite is limited in performance by not including the 6 GHz band, although its 5 GHz performance is competitive with its peers. It would also have been nice if MSI could include 2.5 GbE across the board, not just for the WAN port. The Deco BE5000 and Eero 7 include at least one 2.5 GbE port for LAN on each satellite. The Roamii BE Lite is priced at around $225 online. Given its performance credentials, I'd consider that competitive pricing. Brandon Hill is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware.

Bradford Smith is just the third patient to be fitted with a Neuralink Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) yet, impressively, advancements in the technology have allowed him to edit and post a YouTube video using just his thoughts. Smith is affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or ALS, a disease wherein the nerves that control his muscles degenerate, which has led to him being unable to move and talk. However, Elon Musk's investments in Neuralink are finally paying off, and the patient was able to make so many advancements that were previously unheard of. It was just February last year that the first human Neuralink implantee was reportedly able to move a mouse around by just using their brain. In July 2024, Alex, who suffered from a spinal cord injury, received the BCI implant. It was implanted into his brain by a robot, ensuring that no blood vessels were damaged during the process. Bradford said that he doesn't think about his tongue when moving the cursor, much like how you don't think about moving your arm or wrist when operating a mouse. Bradford and his team used old video and audio recordings, from before his ALS diagnosis, to train a speech synthesis AI. This allows us to hear him once again, narrating a video which he created himself — something that would've been impossible just over a year ago. Elon Musk's firm isn't by any means the only one working on it. For example, a Chinese company was reportedly working on a competing tech called Neucyber in April last year with the backing of Beijing. The government has even started working on a plan to standardize the technology, which would hopefully make it easier for different companies to cooperate. Advancements in BCIs are helping paralyzed patients get some control over their lives back, allowing them to use computers without external assistance. And as this tech matures even more, maybe we will have a future where ALS and other debilitating diseases would no longer be a life sentence for those affected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These smaller Snapdragon X powered devices are expected to become official on Tuesday. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. It's important to note that these smaller variants are not a new generation, but rather expand the existing Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 product lines. Information about technical details, pricing, and availability remains in the dark, but Microsoft is expected to reveal more on Tuesday. Microsoft offers a range of Surface devices, designed for various use cases. The Surface Pro family features 2-in-1 tablets that can function both as a tablet and a laptop with the detachable keyboard (purchased separately). Starting in June 2024, Microsoft revealed the Surface Laptop 7 (15-inch and 13.8-inch) and Surface Pro 11 (13-inch) families, initially equipped with Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X chips, for the mainstream. Variants with Intel's Lunar Lake followed, targeted towards business users. In terms of display, we're looking at a PixelSense Flow LCD panel (likely IPS), though the refresh rate has not been specified. Microsoft claims 16 hours of local video playback, but real-world usage will vary. The leaked press slides only mention two USB Type-C ports for data transfer, charging, and hooking up external displays. Display-wise, Microsoft will continue to use a PixelSense Flow LCD panel, but the refresh rate has reportedly been lowered from 120 Hz to 60 Hz. Just like the new Surface Pro model, this device also, allegedly, uses the same 8-core Snapdragon X Plus X1P-42-100 SoC from Qualcomm, with 16GB of RAM and 256GB/512GB of UFS-based storage. These laptops are said to use an Island-style keyboard with a glass trackpad. Windows Hello login is facilitated by a built-in fingerprint reader next to the keyboard.
