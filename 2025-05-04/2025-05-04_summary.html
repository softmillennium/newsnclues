            French police rescued the father of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur from his kidnappers Saturday night, but found he'd had one of his fingers severed – the latest in a spate of abductions tied to cryptocurrency.
    


            The victim, who has not been publicly identified, was forced into a van by four men wearing ski masks on a street of Paris Thursday morning. He was held hostage in an Airbnb 12 miles south of the French capital for two days before being rescued.
    


            The kidnappers contacted the victim's son, sending a video of the mutilated victim and demanding millions of euros in ransom money, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV.
    


            Five people between the ages of 23 and 27 were brought into police custody following the raid, according to the Paris Prosecutor's office.
    


            The kidnapping shares striking similarities with other recent kidnappings tied to crypto currency in France and surrounding countries.
    


            In January 2025, David Balland, cofounder of the crypto wallet company Ledger, was kidnapped with his wife from their home in central France.
    


            Before the couple was freed by police, the assailants cut off Balland's finger, sending a video of the severed appendage to his business partner Eric Larchevêque and demanding ransom money.
    


            In December 2024, the wife of crypto investor and influencer Stéphane Winkel was kidnapped from the couple's home in Belgium. She was rescued after her kidnapper crashed his car in a dramatic police chase, Winkel wrote in a post on X.
    


            It is unclear whether the recent spate of crypto kidnappings are connected or not.
    


            “Obviously there's at least a link in the modus operandi. Now, whether it's the same team or not is for the investigators to say.” said internal security expert Guillaume Farde speaking on French television Sunday.
    


            Police have opened an investigation into the latest kidnapping, including for extortion by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy, the Paris Prosecutor's office told CNN.

Commons leader had appeared to suggest Reform commentator was using a political ‘dog whistle'

No 10 has backed the cabinet minister Lucy Powell after she apologised for appearing to suggest it was a “dog whistle” issue to discuss grooming gangs.

Powell, the leader of the House of Commons, faced calls from the Conservatives to resign after she made the remarks on Friday night.

In a radio discussion, Tim Montgomerie, a Reform commentator, asked Powell if she had seen a Channel 4 programme about five girls who were sexually abused by grooming gangs.

In response, Powell, who is the MP for Manchester Central, responded: “Oh, we want to blow that little trumpet now, do we? Yeah, OK, let's get that dog whistle out.”

She apologised on Saturday, saying: “In the heat of a discussion on AQ [Any Questions], I would like to clarify that I regard issues of child exploitation and grooming with the utmost seriousness.

“I'm sorry if this was unclear. I was challenging the political point scoring around it, not the issue itself. As a constituency MP, I've dealt with horrendous cases. This government is acting to get to the truth and deliver justice.”

Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said on Sunday that everyone makes mistakes and it was time to move forward after Powell had said sorry for her lack of clarity.

Asked if Powell's job was safe, he told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News: “Yes. I think she's made a genuine mistake. She's owned up to it, she's said sorry and we'll move on.”

Reform said Keir Starmer should consider whether Powell was still fit to serve in her job.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, went further by calling on Powell to resign.

“This shocking outburst from a Labour cabinet minister belittles the thousands of girls and women who were raped by grooming gangs over decades,” he said. “We have consistently called for a national inquiry in parliament, which has been blocked by Labour ministers who don't seem to know or care about the disgusting crimes which have been perpetrated.

“Anyone who has seen the shocking Channel 4 documentary will know that it is clearer than ever that this is not a ‘dog whistle'. To dismiss thousands of victims who were raped and the cover-up that followed is sickening. She should resign.”

The Channel 4 documentary has led to renewed calls for an inquiry into the grooming gang scandal, which has led to accusations of failures in the police and social services.

Starmer said on Wednesday there had already been an inquiry and its recommendations would be implemented. He told parliament that Labour was “delivering truth and justice for victims”.

            It's Saturday night at a rooftop bar in downtown Atlanta, and the band Orden Activa is about to launch into a Mexican ballad.
    


            What seemed like a shy and reserved audience suddenly transforms as the opening chords of the trotting polka begin. The crowd rises to its feet and sings in Spanish as the dance floor dissolves into a sea of cowboy hats:
    


“I'm the ruler of the roostersOf the Jalisco cartel.I've got fighting cocksWho duel for my crew.”



            With their gently bobbing heads, matching leather jackets and knowing smiles, their act hardly screams controversy – or at least not to the casual observer.
    


            Yet last month, a group that sang the very same song – “El del Palenque” (“He of the Cockfighting Arena”) – was barred from the United States in an unprecedented move that critics say raises troubling questions about free speech in America.
    


            Their transgression, according to the State Department? “Glorifying (a) drug kingpin.”
    


            The song is a narcocorrido: a ballad about the drug trafficking underworld. The band that wrote it – Los Alegres del Barranco – landed in hot water with both US and Mexican authorities recently when they performed the tune in the Mexican city of Zapopan.
    


            That performance, in which the group sang about the exploits of El Mencho, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, in front of a cartoon portrait of him, not only ended the band's plans for a US tour but left them the subject of a criminal investigation on their home turf.
    


            As one of six Mexican drug cartels the Trump administration has declared Foreign Terrorist Organizations, the Jalisco cartel is at the center of growing US-Mexico tensions over cross-border crime. Authorities in both countries took exception when video of the concert went viral.
    


            The venue where Los Alegres del Barranco performed swiftly apologized; the Jalisco prosecutor's office vowed to investigate; and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum warned the band may have broken the law. Then the US State Department revoked their visas.
    


            “The last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists,” said US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau in a post on X. “In the Trump administration, we take seriously our responsibility over foreigners' access to our country.” The band apologized on Facebook the next day.
    


            While songs about the drug trade have been censored on and off in Mexico for years, observers say increasing pressure from the Trump administration to clamp down on cartels has fueled a new wave of bans on public performance of narcocorridos in several Mexican states. Even more worryingly, they say, are signs that Mexican bands are beginning to self-censor in the fear that upsetting US authorities could compromise their ability to tour.

            The action against Los Alegres del Barranco is the first time the State Department has punished a Mexican band in this way, according to Elijah Wald, author of an English-language guide to the genre. Some critics paint it as the latest anti-Mexico move by the Trump administration, which has already strained ties with its immigration crackdowns and tariff policies.
    


            “(These bands) have been saved up to now by the fact that nobody spoke Spanish,” Wald said. “And when I say ‘nobody,' I mean the people who are enforcing this kind of silliness. The revoking of visas obviously has very little to do with the songs. It has to do with a politics of revoking visas.”
    


            Asked about Los Alegres del Barranco, the State Department told CNN they could not discuss individual cases.
    


            The State Department's rebuke may have ruined Los Alegres del Barranco's planned US tour, but it has done little to dent the popularity of either the band or the genre. If anything, it gave both a boost.
    


            Figures from Billboard show the band subsequently gained over 2 million new listens on streaming services, proof if any were needed of the enduring modern appeal of a genre rooted in 19th century folk music that has long romanticized outlaws, outcasts and underdogs.
    


            Early corridos or ballads celebrated the exploits of “famous bandits, generals, sometimes horses, sometimes fighting roosters as well,” according to Sam Quinones, a writer who covers music and the drug trade in Mexico and California.
    


            “It was almost like a musical newspaper,” Quinones said. “This became a very common kind of entrenched genre of popular music.”
    


            During Prohibition in the 1920s, a new subgenre – the narcocorrido – emerged to tell the tales of those smuggling illicit alcohol from Mexico to the United States, explained author Wald.
    


            A century later and that subgenre is still booming. The most popular musical artist among US YouTube users in 2023 was not Taylor Swift, but the narcocorrido singer Peso Pluma.
    


            But experts say a cultural shift took place when drug traffickers began paying musicians to write songs about themselves in the mid-1980s, when the legendary “King of Corridos” Chalino Sanchez began accepting commissions.
    


            “He wasn't necessarily the first, but he was the key figure in that shift, which significantly changed the economics of the business,” Wald said. “It meant anybody with money could commission a laudatory corrido.”
    


            Since then, many singers and groups “have been sponsored by or have performed for specific figures in the narco-world, and are thought of as being aligned with particular cartels,” Wald said, leading to a situation that's “definitely dangerous for the artists.”
    


            Case in point: Chalino Sanchez was shot dead after a concert in Sinaloa in 1992. His murder remains unsolved.
    


            Some fans, like Quinones – who is writing a biography of Sanchez – are critical of this shift.

            “The corrido used to be about a simple man going up against power, knowing he was doomed, knowing he was going to die and fighting anyway,” Quinones said. “It became corrupted, in my opinion, when it became in praise of power, in praise of these bloodthirsty men with enormous power who killed wantonly.”
    


            Others, though, dismiss the notion that narcocorridos encourage the violence and crime they portray, likening them to gangster-rap, video games or films like The Godfather.
    


            “People say, ‘Oh, parents, don't let your kid play Call of Duty, or your kid's gonna grow up to be a shooter!'” said Ray Mancias, a 19-year-old guitarist who performed after Orden Activa at the show in Atlanta.
    


            “I think that's the way they're seeing (narcocorridos) as well. They think if all these kids keep listening to it, that they're going to get influenced by it and they're going to start doing it. But at the end of the day, the way you grow up is your parents. No music is going to change that.”
    


            Noel Flores – one of Orden Activa's two singers – suggests authorities that try to ban narcocorridos risk shooting themselves in the foot.
    


            “That's just gonna make people want it more,” Flores said.
    


            While some Mexican states have tried to ban the songs, and the US State Department their singers, Mexico's President Sheinbaum has taken a softer approach – ruling out a nationwide ban and proposing instead that the government promote music about peace and love as an alternative – a position that has led to some ridicule.
    


            “She's trying the rather comical alternative of trying to sponsor nice music that people will listen to instead, which is charming,” Wald said. “But no, that's not going to work.”
    


            Of course, if authorities can't find a way through the debate, it's not only the bands that will lose, but fans in both Mexico and the US.
    


            “With everything going on with (Trump), as a Mexican, cancelling corridos makes us feel more ‘less,'” said Emmanuel Gonzalez, who attended the concert in Atlanta.
    


            Other fans have been rowdier about the idea of cancelling corridos.
    


            When the singer Luis R. Conriquez refused to play drug-themed music at an April concert in Texcoco, Mexico, citing a local ban, he told the booing audience, “There are no corridos tonight. Should we just go home?”
    


            They answered by trashing the stage. (Conriquez later defended his decision, saying he “must follow the new rules the government has set regarding corridos.”)

            Oswaldo Zavala, a professor of literature and expert on narcoculture, says many musicians are  self-censoring not out of deference to Mexican authorities, but “in response to Donald Trump's presidency… the fear that (Trump) may revoke their visas that allow them to perform and produce their music in the US.”
    


            A few days after their Atlanta concert, Orden Activa posted a video of their performance  alongside the caption: “Let's see if they don't take away our visa. Don't believe it's a joke.”
    


            Still, amid the fears there are those that take comfort in the irony that driving underground a form of music that has always celebrated outlaws will likely make it only more popular.
    


            As another member of the audience in Atlanta, Violet Uresti, puts it: “I like the vibe. I like the way it brings people together. If they ban it, we're still gonna listen to it.”

Advocacy groups called Tom Homan's threat against Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers a “chilling attempt to normalize fascism.”

A coalition of advocacy organizations on Saturday expressed support for Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and warned that the Trump border czar's threat against the Democratic leader marks a “dangerous escalation” of the administration's assault on the rule of law across the United States.

The groups — including All Voting Is Local and the ACLU of Wisconsin — said in a joint statement that Evers' guidance to state officials on how to handle being confronted by federal agents was “a prudent measure aimed at ensuring compliance with state and federal laws while protecting the rights of state employees.”

The suggestion by Tom Homan, a leader of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign, that Evers could be arrested for issuing such guidance undermines “the foundational principles of our democracy, including the separation of powers, the rule of law, and the right of state governments to operate without undue federal interference,” the groups said Saturday.

“To threaten our governor over his legal directive is gross overreach by our federal government, and it is not occurring in a vacuum,” they continued, warning that the administration's rhetoric and actions represent a “chilling attempt to normalize fascism.”

“Similar occurrences are happening across the nation, including within our academic systems,” the groups added. “If we do not reject these actions now, states and other institutions will only lose more and more of their autonomy and power. This is exactly why we underscore Gov. Evers' claim that this event is ‘chilling.'”

The threats against Gov. Evers in Wisconsin undermine the foundational principles of our democracy: the separation of powers, the rule of law, and the right of state governments to operate without undue federal interference. We must reject this overreach.allvotingislocal.org/statements/w…

Trump administration officials and the president himself have repeatedly threatened state and local officials as the White House rushes ahead with its lawless mass deportation campaign, which has ensnared tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants and at least over a dozen U.S. citizens — including children.

In an executive order signed late last month, Trump accused “some state and local officials” of engaging in a “lawless insurrection” against the federal government by refusing to cooperate with the administration's deportation efforts.

But as Temple University law professor Jennifer Lee recently noted, localities “can legally decide not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.”

“Cities, like states, have constitutional protections against being forced to administer or enforce federal programs,” Lee wrote. “The Trump administration cannot force any state or local official to assist in enforcing federal immigration law.”

Administration officials have also leveled threats against members of Congress, with Homan suggesting earlier this year that he would refer Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to the U.S. Justice Department for holding a webinar informing constituents of their rights.

During a town hall on Friday, Ocasio-Cortez dared Homan to do so.

“To that I say: Come for me,” she said to cheers from the audience. “We need to challenge them. So don't let them intimidate you.”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Ukrainian military intelligence claims Su-30 destroyed over waters near Russian port city of Novorossiisk, drawing no comment from Moscow. What we know on day 1,166

Ukraine has destroyed a Russian Su-30 fighter jet using a missile fired from a seaborne drone, according to Ukraine's military intelligence agency, in what it said was the world's first downing of a combat plane by a maritime drone. The GUR's statement on social media on Saturday said the fighter had been shot down by a military intelligence unit called Group 13 on Friday over waters near Novorossiisk, a major Russian port city on the Black Sea. The Russian defence ministry did not comment on the Ukrainian claim, but an authoritative Russian blogger believed to be close to the ministry said the jet had been shot down. “The pilots ejected and were picked up by civilian sailors,” the blogger, who goes by the name Rybar, said on Telegram. Meanwhile, the mayor of Novorossiisk declared a state of emergency on Saturday after local authorities said a Ukrainian drone attack had damaged a grain terminal and several residential buildings, injuring five people.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has dismissed a three-day truce ordered by Vladimir Putin as theatrics but said Kyiv was ready for a full ceasefire. “This is more of a theatrical performance on his part, because in two or three days it is impossible to develop a plan for the next steps to end the war,” the Ukrainian president said on Friday in remarks embargoed until Saturday. Moscow claimed the truce, set to coincide with its second world war commemorations on 9 May, was aimed at testing Kyiv's “readiness” for long-term peace. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, said on Saturday that nobody could guarantee Kyiv would survive to see 10 May if Ukraine attacked Moscow during the 9 May celebrations. Zelenskyy said Ukraine would not be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin's exit from isolation on 9 May”. The Kremlin has rejected calls by Kyiv and Washington for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.

A Russian overnight drone attack on Kyiv  injured at least 11 people, including two children, and set several residential buildings throughout the city on fire, the military and officials of the Ukrainian capital said on Sunday. Falling debris from destroyed drones sparked fires at buildings in Kyiv's Obolonskyi and Sviatoshynskyi districts, the head of Kyiv's military administration said on social media. Timur Tkachenko added that several cars throughout the city also caught alight. Ukraine's emergency service said 76 firefighters were involved in putting out the fires.

Russian shelling killed two people in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region on Saturday, while a drone strike on the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson left one other person dead, regional officials said. In the central region of Cherkasy, a Russian drone attack late on Saturday sparked several fires, said the governor, Ihor Taburets. Ukraine's emergency service said one person was injured.

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

A Patriot air defense system based in Israel will be transferred to Ukraine after refurbishment, the New York Times reported on May 4, citing four unnamed current and former U.S. officials.

According to the publication, Western allies are also discussing the logistics of supplying additional systems from Germany or Greece as Russia escalates its attacks across Ukraine.

The sources declined to go into detail about U.S. President Donald Trump's stance on the decision or clarify whether the move was initiated before he took office, during former President Joe Biden's administration.

The move comes amid a sharp increase in Russian strikes that have caused numerous casualties in Kryvyi Rih, Sumy, Odesa, Kharkiv, and Kyiv.

Kyiv has consistently pressed Western partners to bolster Ukraine's air defenses, warning that its current capabilities are insufficient to counter the scale of Russian missile and drone assaults.

The Patriot system, a U.S.-made surface-to-air missile platform, is widely recognized for its high-precision detection, tracking, and interception of aircraft, cruise, and ballistic missiles.

According to the New York Times, Ukraine currently has eight Patriot systems, of which only six are operational. The remaining two are reportedly undergoing refurbishment.

President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated Ukraine's urgent need for air defenses in an April 13 interview with CBS News, saying Kyiv is ready to purchase 10 U.S.-made Patriot systems for $15 billion to shield densely populated cities. 

"We will find the money and pay for everything," Zelensky said, emphasizing Ukraine's intention to buy, not request, additional systems.

Despite Kyiv's appeals, Trump dismissed the request on April 14, accusing Zelensky of "always looking to purchase missiles" and falsely blaming Ukraine for instigating the war. 

Trump's tone on Ukraine has shifted in recent weeks. On April 24, he criticized a Russian strike on Kyiv that killed at least nine civilians and injured 87, calling it "not necessary" and urging Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the attacks.

Shortly after taking office, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force negotiations, saying "we can do it the easy way or the hard way," though no measures have materialized so far.

Trump has recently questioned Russia's intentions to seek peace, as Moscow continues to reject a complete ceasefire agreement, intensifying attacks against Ukrainian civilian areas.

PDF metadata revealed a letter circulated in the House was written by Paragon Health Institute President Brian Blase.

A letter that a group of 20 far-right House Republicans released earlier this week as part of a campaign in support of slashing Medicaid appears to have been authored by the head of a research institute with ties to the Koch network.

Politico reported Friday that “digital metadata embedded in a PDF copy” of the letter that was circulated inside the House of Representatives “lists the author as Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute.”

InfluenceWatch notes that in 2021, Paragon received a nearly $2 million donation from Stand Together, “a right-libertarian funding organization that acts as the umbrella organization for the political network that is largely funded by right-leaning businessman and political donor Charles Koch.”

Paragon recently urged federal policymakers to require states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks for Medicaid recipients in a purported effort to root out improper payments. Health policy advocates say such a change would make it more difficult for eligible enrollees to keep their Medicaid coverage.

The letter signed by Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and other House Republicans aligns with Paragon's objectives, claiming that “political abuse” of Medicaid “is helping to bankrupt the federal government” and calling for “structural Medicaid reform” in the party's forthcoming reconciliation package.

Tony Carrk, executive director of the watchdog group Accountable.US, said in a statement that “you'd be hard pressed to find a more shameless example of congressional Republicans taking their cues from special interests at the cost of the American people than Chip Roy copying and pasting a letter directly from… special interests.”

“This remarkably blatant kowtowing to conservative billionaires is a sad reflection of the congressional Republicans' willingness to make devastating cuts to Americans' healthcare to pay for lower taxes for the richest,” said Carrk.

The letter was released as congressional Republicans grappled internally with how and how much to cut Medicaid as they seek to offset the massive projected costs of another round of tax breaks for the rich.

Earlier this week, as Common Dreams reported, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said he would not accept more than $500 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade. Cuts of that magnitude would still be the largest in the program's history and would strip health coverage from tens of millions of people.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Romanians are casting ballots Sunday in a critical presidential election rerun after last year's annulled vote plunged the European Union and NATO member country into its worst political crisis in decades.

Eleven candidates are vying for the presidency and a May 18 runoff is expected. Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and will close at 9 p.m.

By 5 p.m. 7.1 million people – about 39.6 per cent of eligible voters – had cast ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau, with 799,000 votes cast at polling stations set up in other countries.

Romania's political landscape was shaken last year when a top court voided the previous election in which the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped the first round, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied.

As in many EU countries, anti-establishment sentiment is running high in Romania, fuelled by high inflation and cost of living, a large budget deficit and a sluggish economy. Observers say the malaise has bolstered support for nationalist and far-right figures like Georgescu, who is under investigation and barred from the rerun.

While data from local surveys should be taken with caution, a median of polls suggests that hard-right nationalist George Simion will enter the runoff, likely pitting him against Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, or the governing coalition's candidate, Crin Antonescu.

Appearing with Georgescu at a polling station in the capital, Bucharest, on Sunday morning, Simion told reporters: “We are here with one mission only: the return to constitutional order, the return to democracy. I have no other goal than first place for the Romanian people.”

Georgescu called the vote rerun “a fraud orchestrated by those who have made deceit the only state policy,” but said he was there to “acknowledge the power of democracy, the power of the vote that frightens the system, that terrifies the system.”

Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician and former anti-corruption activist who founded the Save Romania Union party (USR) in 2016, is running on a pro-EU “Honest Romania” ticket. After casting his ballot, he said he voted “for hope and a new beginning” for Romania. “I voted with realism, because Romania is going through a difficult time,” he said.

Antonescu, 65, a veteran centrist who campaigned on retaining Romania's pro-Western orientation, said Sunday that he voted for “a united Romania, for a strong Romania, for a dignified Romania.”

Victor Ponta, who was prime minister from 2012-2015, has also pushed a MAGA-style “Romania First” campaign and boasts of having close ties to the Trump administration.

Another hopeful, Elena Lasconi, came second in last year's first round ballot and is participating in the rerun. She has positioned herself as a staunchly pro-Western, anti-system candidate, railing against what she describes as a corrupt political class.

Distrust in the authorities remains widespread, especially for those who voted for Georgescu, a sizable electorate that Simion has sought to tap into.

“The anti-establishment sentiment is not like an anarchic movement, but is against the people who destroyed this country,” Simion, who came fourth in last year's race and later backed Georgescu, told the Associated Press days before the rerun. “We are not a democratic state anymore.”

Rares Ghiorghies, 36, who works in the energy sector and voted for Simion, says he hopes that if he secures the presidency, Romania can “return to the basic principles of democracy, regain our confidence.”

“What happened in December 2024 is definitely a dark chapter in the history of this country, and we can no longer accept it,” he said. “I'm hoping things will get back to normal.”

Simion said that his hard-right nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians party is “perfectly aligned with the MAGA movement,” capitalizing on a growing wave of populism in Europe after U.S. President Donald Trump's political comeback. AUR rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election, proclaims to stand for “family, nation, faith, and freedom,” and has since doubled its support.

Retiree Done Chiritoi says he feels robbed of his previous vote, which has left him with “only bad words” for the political class. “If my vote gets cancelled again or if the one I chose won't get elected, I'll take to the streets,” he said.

The election redo is a crossroads moment for Romania as it seeks to restore its democracy and retain its geopolitical alliances, which have become strained since the cancelled election fiasco.

The decision to annul the election and the ban on Georgescu's candidacy drew criticism from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and Russia, which publicly supported his candidacy in the rerun.

The presidential role carries a five-year term and significant decision-making powers in national security and foreign policy.

            US President Donald Trump posted an AI image of himself as the pope, prompting accusations of poor taste in the Roman Catholic community just days before the conclave to elect Pope Francis's successor is due to begin.
    


            Trump, who days prior joked that he would “like to be pope”, posted the digitally doctored image of himself wearing a white cassock and papal headdress, with his forefinger raised, to his Truth Social platform late Friday. It was then reshared by the White House on its official X account.
    


            It came less than a week after Trump, who is himself not a Catholic, attended Francis's funeral last month. An official period of mourning for the pope is still being observed by the Vatican.
    


            While no one suggests that the image is a serious distraction from the task of choosing the next leader of the world's 1.4 billion Roman Catholics – Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to comment on the matter – it has raised eyebrows on social media and drawn criticism, including from cardinals who are in Rome for conclave next week.
    


            “Not funny, Sir,” the 66-year-old Filipino Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David wrote in a post on Facebook.
    


            Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, was also critical when questioned by journalists ahead of delivering a Mass in Rome on Sunday.
    


            Asked whether he was offended by the image, Cardinal Dolan – who Trump hinted he favors for the next pope - replied, “Well, it wasn't good.”
    


            Similarly, Father Gerald Murray, a priest of the Archdiocese of New York who was attending the Mass at Cardinal Dolan's church Sunday, said that Trump's post was “silly … you don't do that.”
    


            Italy's former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, condemned the image as offensive to those of Catholic faith. “This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,” he wrote on X.
    


            Trump's post caught the attention of Italy's media. “Infantile” was the word used by Italian daily La Repubblica, accusing the president of “pathological megalomania.”

            In St. Peter's Square, CNN asked several groups of American tourists what they thought, and while none wanted to give their names, their reactions ranged from “absurd” to “typical.”
    


            The office of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, an international ally of Trump, said they would not comment on the matter.
    


            The image also prompted backlash among Catholic groups in the US. The New York State Catholic Conference, which describes itself as representing bishops in New York, said in a post on X; “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President.
    


            “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.”
    


            But the White House defended Trump as pro-Catholic.
    


            “President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects for Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said when asked to respond to the criticism.
    


            Others in Trump's circle stressed it was a joke.
    


            “I'm Catholic. We've all been making jokes about the upcoming Pope selection all week. It's called a sense of humor,” far-right activist Jack Posobiec  wrote on X.
    


            This is not the first time Trump has triggered controversy with AI-generated imagery. He faced backlash after posting footage imagining war-ravaged Gaza as a Gulf state-like resort featuring a golden statue of himself.

Traffic is down at America's busiest port complex – and anxious dock workers are fearful of further economic harm

Southern California may be known for celebrities and glitz, but the true action has long been about 40 miles away from Hollywood, in a place where high-visibility coveralls and hardhats dominate.

For the past 25 years, the San Pedro Bay port complex – comprised of the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach – has been the celebrity of the shipping world and an economic driver of California's massive economy. The busiest seaport in the western hemisphere and one of the busiest in the world, approximately 15,000 longshore workers usually pull shifts around the clock, moving billions of dollars' worth of cargo in cars, agriculture, auto parts, toys, clothes and furniture.

This week, however, the port is shining a little less brightly. As a result of the Trump administration's decision to subject imports to a minimum 10% tariff (and levies far higher for goods from 57 countries), roughly a third of the traffic at the port has ground to a halt, according to Eugene Seroka, the chief executive officer of the Port of Los Angeles.

With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA's waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13.

“One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA's Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected.

What happens in the port doesn't stay in the port, echoed long-time labor activist and former Los Angeles harbor commissioner Diane Middleton. “One way or the other, cargo that comes in here goes to all 435 US congressional districts. Everyone in the US will feel this.”

The port, which handles 40% of all containerized imports into the country, is widely seen as a bellwether for the entire US economy. For months leading up to the election and inauguration, the docks were abuzz. Large retailers especially were front-loading – stocking up on merchandise in fear of what might be to come. Now that the tariffs are here, experts say the front-loaded stock will only last six to eight weeks.

Trump, who meted out the harshest tariffs to China, Vietnam and Cambodia, has referred to his 2 April announcement as “liberation day”. To those immediately affected, however, chaos and anxiety are better ways to describe it.

Trump has made dizzying statements, sometimes even suggesting certain tariffs may not last, Middleton noted. “He's saying, ‘I'm negotiating 200 deals. There'll be a deal with China in no time,'” said Middleton. “And the Chinese are saying, ‘We're not talking to anybody.' So there are contradictions, and who do you believe?”

Vivian Malauulu, a night-shift longshore worker, believes what she sees. “When ships are docked on our berths, we're busy – there's manning, dispatch activity, job orders, and 24-hour operations across day, night, and what we call “hoot” shifts.” Now there are “fewer imports, and fewer vessels calling at our terminals”, said Malauulu, who is also a local 13 officer.

Workers who previously clocked full work-weeks have already been slashed to three or four shifts. She and co-workers, all accustomed to good-paying union jobs, are now tightening their purse strings – eliminating luxuries like family outings and entertainment. “There's definitely concern on the docks,” said Malauulu.

The west coast-based ILWU has a long history of backing progressive ideas. ILWU vice-president Brandi Good, along with a handful of other labor union representatives, spoke briefly at Bernie Sanders' recent “Standing Up to Oligarchy” rally in downtown Los Angeles.

But Malauulu said that not all individual members rebuffed Trump. Neither did the ILWU's counterpart on the east coast – the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA). ILA president Harold Daggett had a well publicized visit with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.

“Some members, like many working-class Americans across the country, were drawn to Trump because he sounded like he was speaking directly to them,” said Malauulu. Messaging about “bringing jobs back”, being “tough on China” and protecting American industries felt like it aligned with labor values, she said. Malauulu says too many people did not take the time to really dig into Trump policies and the potential effects. Now they are experiencing the result.

Herrera hopes, however, that the focus among port workers can remain on strength and unity. Because of California's location, the ports here get more traffic from Asia. But all US ports and longshore workers will be negatively impacted. They need to stick together, he says.

“We are the most resilient workforce in the world. During the Covid pandemic, we kept moving the world's cargo because we couldn't work remotely. Now, with this situation, we're all just hoping that there's some type of resolve because at the end of the day it's about the American worker, the blue-collar worker, that's being hurt – and the consumer and the communities.”

The situation on the waterfront, however, does not appear to be resolving any time soon. In mid-April, the Trump administration announced new rules that will also phase in port fees on many ships built in China. Jamieson Greer, the head of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), which formulated the rules, said the fees are designed to “reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the US supply chain and send a demand signal for US-built ships”.

The USTR action says that in the first phase, the charge will be $50 per net ton per US voyage, increasing incrementally to $140 per net ton by 17 April, 2028. The fees, which could amount to millions, will be charged up to five times per year per vessel. The charges have been dialed back since they were first floated by the Trump administration and there may be additional carveouts, but Beijing has nonetheless vowed to retaliate.

The Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach have tripled the number of projected blank sailings – or canceled ships. The ports are projecting 30 combined blank sailings for this month, up from 10 in April.

Getting caught up on a week that got away? Here's your weekly digest of the Globe's most essential business and investing stories, with insights and analysis from the pros, stock tips, portfolio strategies and more.

Mark Carney led the Liberals to election victory this week, giving the party its fourth consecutive term since 2015. There's no shortage of challenges for the new prime minister, but the main task ahead is to tackle U.S. President Donald Trump's's trade war. Canada's business leaders and top executives see a window of opportunity for Mr. Carney to push through big changes for Canada's economy while voters are united on the need to bring a strong hand to negotiations with Mr. Trump – but they want to see results quickly. It's a long cry from just a few months ago when the country's business leadership had all but given up on the Liberals. During his first public address since winning the election, Mr. Carney said he will travel to Washington to meet Mr. Trump at the White House on Tuesday.

A growing number of businesses are starting to make significant changes in order to avoid crushing U.S. tariffs. Some are rerouting U.S.-bound shipments from China to Canada and storing goods in Canadian warehouses – a move that, experts says, risks flooding the Canadian market and raising competition for already scarce warehouse storage. Automakers in Canada are also an early sign of how Trump's trade policies will upend the North American industry. Stellantis plans to shift some vehicle production and revamp its parts supply lines to avoid paying U.S. tariffs. The company also announced that the Stellantis NV auto assembly plant in Windsor, Ont., will close for a week beginning on May 5, putting 3,800 workers on temporary layoff. General Motors Co. also said this week it will cut one of three shifts at its pickup-truck plant in Oshawa, Ont., by the fall.

New Canadian graduates are being confronted with a harsh reality: This is the worst job market for graduates in decades. The average unemployment rate for recent grads in the first quarter of 2025 was 11.2 per cent, according to an analysis of Statistics Canada data from Brendon Bernard, senior economist at job-search site Indeed Canada. That's the highest jobless rate to start the year in at least two decades, excluding the pandemic. Matt Lundy takes a closer look at the numbers in this week's Decoder series.

A Telus Health drug report published this week said patient claims submitted to insurers soared last year following the introduction of weight-loss drug Wegovy in Canada. The total claims paid out by Canadian insurers for weight management drugs nearly doubled, climbing to $77-million in 2024 from nearly $38-million a year prior. The growing popularity of these drugs poses a problem for private benefit plans, which are funded by employers and have a direct impact on companies' bottom line, Clare O'Hara reports. “The stakes are high for employee health and the long-term sustainability of private drug plans,” said benefits industry veteran Paul Sabat. He said if coverage continues to expand, so will the strain on benefit plans.

Prime Minister Mark Carney will have his work cut out for him as Canadians face the financial impact of the trade war and ongoing cost-of-living concerns. Meera Raman and Mariya Postelnyak share a breakdown of the major personal finance promises the party made during the election campaign (from retirement to child care to cost of living), and how they could impact your bank accounts.



b. Shopify, the Ottawa-based e-commerce company, was eager to recruit Mr. Carney in 2020, when he stepped down as governor of the Bank of England. However, he decided to go in a different direction and instead joined Brookfield Asset Management.

Pro-Russian demonstrators staged an Immortal Regiment rally in Washington, D.C, on May 3 to mark 80 years since the end of World War II, representatives of NFO Ukrainian Cultural Front D.C. reported on Facebook.

It was the first Immortal Regiment rally in the U.S. capital in six years. Ukrainian nationals staged a protest in response.

The Immortal Regiment was originally a grassroots campaign launched in 2012 to honor WWII veterans. Its members have complained that it has since been co-opted by the Kremlin and transformed into a political spectacle.

While officially commemorating relatives who fought in World War II, the march reinforces narratives of Russian military glory and is used to legitimize Moscow's current military actions, including the war against Ukraine.

The rally, held ahead of Russia's Victory Day on May 9, began at Lafayette Square Park near the White House and ended at the World War II Memorial. 

Washington police blocked streets and guarded the march's participants.

"That's the crazy reality. We have a Russian march in the middle of Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States... Justifying war crimes seems fine," Marichka Hlyten, an activist with the Ukrainian Cultural Front D.C., said in a video posted on Facebook.

Ukrainian protesters carried flags and posters that read "(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is wanted for genocide," "Honor the dead, bring Russia to justice," and "Putin = Hitler." 

They also displayed a photo of Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, tortured in Russian captivity, according to the Ukrainian Cultural Front DC NGO.

An activist told the Ukrainian broadcaster News.LIVE that the Russian media covering the event kept their distance from the Ukrainian protest to skew coverage for domestic audiences.

Victory Day, celebrated on May 9, is a cornerstone of Putin's nationalist narrative. By glorifying the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, Putin aims to rally support, display military power, and frame Russia as a heroic nation resisting Western aggression.

The Sleep Whisperer is a new series of columns offering insights and advice about sleep health. It is not a substitute for seeking professional medical care.

A quick consult about sleep hygiene with “Dr. Google” yields an eclectic range of do's and don'ts dictating how people should get their zzz's. The advice ranges from drinking warm milk before bedtime to ensuring the bedroom temperature is 18.3°C. But can any of that really cure insomnia?

Sleep experts like myself are increasingly concerned. “Sleep hygiene has become a catch-all for everything, including advice for which there is no scientific evidence,” said Dr. Penny Corkum, a psychologist and professor at Dalhousie University.

The term sleep hygiene was popularized in the 1970s by psychologist Dr. Peter Hauri, who created a new sleep-disorders treatment that involved a set of rules such as eating a light snack before bedtime and keeping bedroom light levels low. Despite subsequent research, which showed such practices do not cure chronic insomnia, the concept of sleep hygiene stuck around in the popular consciousness.

Today, the consensus among sleep experts is that sleep hygiene on its own is insufficient to treat chronic insomnia in adults – defined as difficulty falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a period of at least three months. Although education about healthy sleep practices can be effective for children and teens, its effects in adults are so minimal that most research on insomnia uses “sleep-hygiene therapy” as a placebo comparator.

Nevertheless, many people with chronic insomnia get obsessed with sleep hygiene rules, clinging to them in an attempt to control their sleep. This often fuels the perception that slumber cannot happen unless all conditions are absolutely perfect (e.g. “I am running out of milk for my nightcap, for sure I won't be able to sleep”). “The sleep-hygiene mindset can get people to develop all-or-nothing approaches to sleep,” said Dr. Elizabeth Keys, a registered nurse and professor at the University of British Columbia.

Put simply, breaching sleep-hygiene rules is rarely the root cause of sleep disorders. Chronic insomnia does not develop because one fails to eat a light snack before bedtime or forgets to adjust the thermostat. Rather, it typically stems from how we react to a bad night (which everyone faces from time to time). If sleep difficulties take the centre stage of our worries, we gradually start to believe that our sleep system is broken. Some people then put in place strategies aimed at getting more sleep, such as going to bed earlier, staying in bed later and napping.

The problem is that these strategies can worsen sleep quality and expand the amount of time we spend frustrated and anxious about sleep while in bed. Our brain gradually associates the bedroom with these feelings and being awake; eventually, just entering the bedroom can trigger sleep anxiety, which makes it harder to doze off. Our fear of being unable to sleep becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that perpetuates insomnia over time and pushes us to “try harder” to sleep. These changes in sleep-related thoughts and behaviours are what converts the occasional bad night, a perfectly normal phenomenon, into chronic insomnia disorder.

So what does work? Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as the first-line treatment. It notably involves progressive personalized changes in sleep schedules to strengthen our sleep drive. This is combined with techniques to break down associations between the bedroom environment and the dread of a sleepless night it can provoke. Ultimately, CBT-I targets the specific factors leading to persisting sleep issues.

Although CBT-I has been shown to be effective in addressing the root causes of chronic insomnia, many people – including doctors – seem to focus on sleep hygiene instead.

“People can go for like 10 years without getting effective treatment for insomnia,” said Dr. Colleen Carney, a psychologist and professor at Toronto Metropolitan University. Rather than being offered CBT-I, Dr Carney said, people are often told to work on their sleep hygiene – such as avoiding sleeping in a noisy, brightly lit environment. “I do find it a little insulting. They're not sleeping under those conditions – their sleep hygiene is typically pristine.”

A recent study in the Canadian Journal of Medicine indicates that 98 per cent of primary care providers treating patients with insomnia review sleep hygiene with them first; only 58 per cent discuss CBT-I with their patients. Initiatives like Health Quality Ontario's new care standards for chronic insomnia, which stresses that CBT-I should come first, will hopefully better support health care practitioners and guide patients to seek appropriate care.

The bottom line: If you have been struggling to fall asleep or stay asleep for at least three nights per week over at least three months, you may have chronic insomnia – consider speaking to your health care provider and asking for a CBT-I referral. The Canadian Sleep Research Consortium has compiled a list of providers who offer this treatment.

If you do not have chronic insomnia and simply want to optimize your sleep, these healthy sleep practices (not to be confused with strict sleep hygiene rules) could help:

1. Avoid extreme sleep yo-yos

Keep a regular sleep schedule whenever possible. Regular bedtimes and wake-up times have been associated with better sleep, a stronger biological clock, and healthier mind and body.

2. Transition from active days to restful nights

Be active during the day to build a strong sleep drive and secure some time for winding down before bedtime. Doing pleasant calm activities will get you in a good headspace for sleep.

3. Don't sleep-shame …

When you have a bad night, don't dwell on it – let it go. People who move on after a poor night's rest do better than those who focus on it and try to lock in rigid sleep hygiene rules.

Dr. Rébecca Robillard, PhD, is a clinical neuropsychologist and Associate Professor at the School of Psychology at the University of Ottawa. She also leads clinical sleep research at The Royal. Dr. Robillard's main area of work focuses on interactions between mental health, the sleeping brain and the sleeping heart. She co-chairs the Canadian Sleep Research Consortium, a national hub of sleep scientists and clinicians.

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) shot down two Russian Su-30 fighter jets using air-to-air missiles fired from Magura-7 sea drones near Novorossiysk on May 2, HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov told the War Zone on May 3.

The operation marks the first time in history that fighter jets have been downed by unmanned boats. Initially, reports confirmed the destruction of only one jet, but Budanov later clarified that two aircraft were hit. 

"It's a historical moment," he told the publication.

According to HUR, Group 13, a special operations unit within the agency, executed the strike. A video of the first downed Su-30 was released and widely shared on social media, though no visual evidence of the second strike has emerged. 

World first: On May 2, 2025, the @DI_Ukraine special operations unit, in coordination with the Security Service of Ukraine and Defence Forces of Ukraine, eliminated a russian Su-30 fighter jet in the Black Sea.🔗 https://t.co/DXhg74AKcg pic.twitter.com/Z4fP5CFRb8

Budanov said the crew of the first jet survived and was rescued by a civilian vessel, while the second crew is believed to have been killed.

The Sukhoi Su-30 is a $50 million twin-engine, two-seat multirole fighter designed by Russia's Sukhoi Design Bureau. HUR claimed that the aircraft were hit midair and crashed into the Black Sea.

The Kyiv Independent can't independently verify all the claims.

The Magura-7 drone, deployed in this operation, is an air defense type of the Magura-5, which previously downed two Russian Mi-8 helicopters on Dec. 31. 

Ukraine has repeatedly used maritime drones to inflict heavy losses on Russian assets in the Black Sea. The Magura drones sank the Russian patrol ship Sergey Kotov on March 5, 2024, and the landing ship Caesar Kunikov on Feb. 14, 2024.

NEW DELHI, May 4. /TASS/. Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh may not attend the Victory Parade in Moscow this year as planned, the PTI news agency reported, citing sources in the government.

It is possible that his deputy, State Minister of Defense Sanjay Seth, will attend in his place.

According to the sources, this decision was made due to escalated tensions between India and Pakistan following the deadly terror attack in the popular tourist town of Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir where 26 individuals were killed.

On April 22, armed militants opened fire on tourists in the town of Pahalgam in northern India (Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir), killing 25 Indian nationals and one tourist from Nepal, and wounding many more. The perpetrators managed to flee the scene.

Earlier, an invitation to attend the Victory Parade in Red Square in Moscow was sent to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists that Modi will be unable to attend and the country will be represented at the event by other officials.

The White House on May 2 shared a $1 trillion military budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 and some congressional Republicans have said the funding doesn't quite add up.

Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), the Senate Armed Services Committee chair, was quick to dispute Vought's budget.

The White House reached its $1 trillion defense budget figure by combining this $892.6 billion budget request for fiscal year 2026 with a $119.3 billion that's part of a supplemental defense spending plan that's currently advancing through Congress as a reconciliation bill.

Wicker said it's not the plan he wants to see through the reconciliation process.

“The Big, Beautiful Reconciliation Bill was always meant to change fundamentally the direction of the Pentagon on programs like Golden Dome, border support, and unmanned capabilities—not to paper over OMB's intent to shred to the bone our military capabilities and our support to service members,” he said.

Though the spending plan comes from the White House, Wicker cast the proposal as one at odds with Trump's true intent.

“President Trump successfully campaigned on a Peace Through Strength agenda but his advisers at the Office of Management and Budget were apparently not listening,” Wicker wrote.

Wicker said more military funding is necessary to ensure that Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping “does not launch a military war against us in Asia.” He also raised concerns about existing security challenges from countries such as Russia and Iran, and from Hamas and the Houthis; terrorist groups based in Gaza and Yemen, respectively.

Collins also expressed disapproval of the White House plan.

Beyond military spending, Collins also raised objections to White House plans to cut funding or outright eliminate other programs including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the Department of Education's TRIO programs, and other programs related to biomedical research.

Introducing its budget plan on Friday, the White House said it has proposed the lowest level of non-defense spending since 2017, achieving savings by “eliminating radical diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and critical race theory programs, Green New Scam funding, large swaths of the Federal Government weaponized against the American people, and moving programs that are better suited for States and localities to provide.”

Under the White House plan, the Department of Homeland Security would also receive a 65 percent funding increase. The White House said the increase would help “ensure that our military and other agencies repelling the invasion of our border have the resources they need to complete the mission.”

The Epoch Times reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive a response by publication time.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

12:49 JST, May 4, 2025

The government decided Saturday to continue to press the United States to review its extra tariffs on Japanese automobiles during bilateral talks aimed at scrapping the Trump administration's tariff measures.

Washington has excluded automobiles and other key items from the scope of the talks. In response, Tokyo has insisted that it will make no concessions as it presses for a complete overhaul of each of the duties imposed Saturday, including those on auto parts.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the day met at the Prime Minister's Residence with economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa, who had just returned from the second round of ministerial talks in the United States, and instructed him on the government's next steps based on the outcome of the talks.

“There is still a wide gulf between [Japan's and the United States'] positions, and no common ground has emerged,” Ishiba told reporters after the meeting. “We are [pushing to negotiate] all the tariffs, including those on automobiles, steel and aluminum.” Ishiba also called the new duties on auto parts “extremely regrettable” and said Japan would “continue to demand that they be reversed.”

Akazawa likewise told the press that Tokyo “has consistently requested a total rollback of the tariff package, and [the two countries] cannot reach an agreement unless that element is included.”

The United States has limited the scope of the ministerial talks to the extra “reciprocal tariff” surcharge — 14% for Japan — and excluded the additional levies on automobiles, steel and aluminum, materials which Tokyo regards as essential. Unlike the reciprocal tariffs, the automotive duty is a flat 25% rate applied equally to every country, and it is said that Washington will not grant Japan special treatment.

Automobiles, however, are Japan's core industry, with an extensive supply chain for parts makers, and leaving the tariffs in place could cause the entire Japanese economy to stall. On Saturday, Ishiba ordered Akazawa and other officials to plan their negotiating strategy “swiftly and meticulously.”

Japan and the United States have agreed to hold an intensive series of ministerial meetings starting in mid-May. Speaking to reporters at Haneda Airport immediately after landing on Saturday, Akazawa revealed that working-level talks had already begun in the United States on Friday local time, stressing that “discussions on individual issues and technical details are also extremely important.”

Warren Buffett on May 3 urged long-term investors not to be shaken by short-term swings and focus on fundamentals amid recent market volatility.

“What has happened in the last 30, 45 days … is really nothing,” Buffett told shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on May 3 in Omaha, Nebraska. “This is not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort.”

Buffett made clear that wild market swings, while unsettling in the moment, are nothing to panic about.

“If it makes a difference to you whether your stocks are down 15 percent or not, you need a somewhat different investment philosophy,” he said. “The world is not going to adapt to you. You're going to have to adapt to the world.”

He reminded attendees that Berkshire Hathaway's stock has dropped by 50 percent three times in its history, and each time, the fundamentals of the company remained sound.

“People have emotions,” he said. “But you got to check them at the door when you invest.”

The massive cash pile—larger than the GDP of many countries—reflects not just Buffett's trademark caution but also the challenge of finding investment opportunities in an uncertain economic environment.

Markets have shown signs of stabilizing. The S&P 500 capped its longest winning streak since 2004 last week, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 560 points on Friday.

In its quarterly filing, Berkshire warned that “considerable uncertainty remains” due to “ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events,” including tariffs, supply chain inefficiencies, and fluctuating customer demand. “It is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences on most, if not all, of our operating businesses,” the company noted.

Beyond markets, the 94-year-old Buffett also revealed that he plans to retire at the end of the year.

“I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the Chief Executive Officer of the company at year end,” Buffett said, referring to Berkshire vice-chairman Greg Abel. Four years ago, Buffett picked Abel to be his successor at the helm of Berkshire, but prior to Saturday's announcement, he gave no indication when he would retire.

Buffett also weighed in on broader policy issues, particularly trade and energy.

“Balanced trade is good for the world,” he said. “In the United States, we should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We want a prosperous world.”

He also noted that America's fragmented energy infrastructure poses challenges and called for smart policies.

“It is important that the United States have an intelligent energy policy, just as it was important during World War II that we learned how to make ships instead of cars extremely fast,” he said. “And we figured out the answer. We combined private enterprise with ... the power of ... government,” he said.

“To date, the Aurora Driver has completed over 1,200 miles without a driver,” said the statement. “The milestone makes Aurora the first company to operate a commercial self-driving service with heavy-duty trucks on public roads.”

“Aurora plans to expand its driverless service to El Paso, Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona, by the end of 2025.”

Aurora's launch customers are logistics companies Uber Freight and Hirschbach Motor Lines, both of which have had “long-standing supervised commercial pilots with Aurora.”

Aurora Driver is reportedly an SAE L4 self-driving system that is being deployed for long-haul trucking for the first time.

At the L4 level, the features of the driverless system can “drive the vehicle under limited conditions and will not operate unless all required conditions are met,” according to the SAE website.

Pedals and steering wheels may or may not be installed in SAE L4 vehicles. The automated features of the system won't require a person sitting inside the vehicle to take over driving.

“We founded Aurora to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly,” said Chris Urmson, CEO and co-founder of Aurora. “Riding in the back seat for our inaugural trip was an honor of a lifetime—the Aurora Driver performed perfectly.”

Meanwhile, autonomous trucks pose a critical employment issue for truck drivers.

The bill requires that all commercial vehicles weighing over 26,000 pounds have a trained human safety operator behind the wheel.

“For Big Tech companies to think they can come into any state and replace the jobs of hardworking union members with this dangerous and inferior technology is an insult to professional drivers everywhere,” said Peter Finn, president of Teamsters Joint Council 7.

“SB 395 is critical to protecting the middle class. That is why we are demanding that Nevada lawmakers vote in favor of this legislation.”

“In over four years of supervised pilot hauls, the Aurora Driver has delivered over 10,000 customer loads across three million autonomous miles,” the company said.

“It has also demonstrated extraordinary capabilities, including predicting red light runners, avoiding collisions, and detecting pedestrians in the dark hundreds of meters away.”

Before beginning operations, Aurora had completed a “safety case” for its vehicles. A safety case is a documented assurance of the vehicle maintaining safety.

The company said it had briefed several government entities about Aurora Driver's readiness for driverless operations, including the National Transportation Safety Board, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Texas Department of Public Safety, and Texas Department of Transportation.

Specifically, the agency will expand the Automated Vehicle Exemption Program to domestically-produced automated vehicles (AVs) as well. The program currently only applies to imported AVs.

Advocacy group Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety criticized the decision, saying that “troubling incidents” involving automated vehicles have already occurred in multiple cities.

If proper safety regulations, safeguards, transparency, and accountability are not maintained regarding the issue, the deployment of AVs could result in “deadly consequences,” it said.

“Yes, we've got to move smartly and safely. But this announcement shows the administration is also proceeding with a sense of urgency, so we don't cede AV leadership to China and other countries. Time is of the essence,” he added.

            A failed interception of a missile fired from Yemen forced Israel to briefly shut down its main international airport on Sunday, exposing the country's vulnerabilities and the Houthi rebels' continued ability to strike distant targets despite a sustained US military campaign.
    


            Flights were halted at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv for about 30 minutes on Sunday morning after a missile landed in the airport's vicinity, following what the Israeli military said were “several attempts” at interception. “The results of the interception are under review,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
    


            The military fired its long-range Arrow interceptor at the incoming missile, an IDF spokesperson said. The US also has an advanced THAAD anti-missile system deployed in Israel.

            The Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was carried out “in rejection of (Israel's) crime of genocide” against the people of Gaza.
    


            The strike appears to be the first time Israel's international airport has been successfully targeted by the group.
    


            “The American and Israeli defense systems failed to intercept the missile aimed at Ben Gurion Airport,” Yahya Saree, the group's spokesperson, said in a statement, adding that the airport was targeted with a “hypersonic ballistic missile.”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed further attacks against the Houthis.
    


            “We acted before, we will act in the future too. I can't elaborate all of that. The US, in coordination with us, is also operating against them. It's not ‘one and done' - but there will be hits,” he said in a video address posted on social media.
    


            In a post to X later, he also promised a response to Iran: “Israel will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters.”
    


            Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that the response would be “sevenfold.”
    


            Israel's security cabinet convened on Sunday afternoon to discuss the incident, according to an Israeli official.
    


            The incident marks a major security breach at one of the most heavily protected sites in the country, and is likely to raise questions about Israel's ability to intercept such attacks despite its vaunted missile defense system.
    


            Trains to and from the airport were also halted and police asked the public to refrain from arriving in the area.
    


            Pictures from the scene showed debris from the impact of the missile on the grounds of the airport, littering the road toward the main terminal. A video shared on social media appeared to show the impact of the missile at the airport and a cloud of black smoke rising from the strike.
    


            Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings suspend flights to and from Tel Aviv until after Tuesday, May 6, a Lufthansa Group spokesperson told CNN.
    


            Amir Bar Shalom, the military affairs analyst for Israel's Army Radio, said the missile showed both tremendous accuracy and the ability to penetrate Israel's air defenses.
    


            “They were very accurate, and to be very accurate if you're launching from 2,000 kilometers, it's impressive,” Bar Shalom told CNN. “And you have to take this threat seriously. We have to check whether it's our mistake or whether we have a new kind of threat here.”

            Iran is developing long-range missiles capable of maneuvering to evade air defenses, Bar Shalom said, though it remains unclear whether such advanced technology has been transferred to the Houthis. He added that the military will analyze all of the aspects of the failed interception attempts, including when sensors detected the incoming projectile, which systems identified it, and how close interceptors came to the missile.
    


            “There are so many parameters that may be relevant to the result that have to be analyzed,” he said.
    


            The Palestinian militant group Hamas praised the attack, calling Yemen “the twin of Palestine, as it continues to defy the most brutal forces of oppression, refusing submission or defeat despite the aggression it faces.”
    


            Sunday's strike marks the third consecutive day of missile launches from Yemen toward Israel, according to the IDF.
    


            The Houthis claim their hypersonic missiles have stealth technology, a range of 2,150 kilometers (1,335 miles), high maneuverability and can travel up to speeds of Mach 16.
    


            Since Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza started in October 2023, the country has come under fire from missiles and rockets from Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, who claim to strike Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. Almost all of the projectiles have been intercepted by Israel's air defenses.
    


            But in December, a Houthi missile hit Israel's commercial capital Tel Aviv after a failed interception, leading to more than a dozen injuries. The Houthis said they fired a hypersonic ballistic missile labeled “Palestine 2” at an Israeli military target in the Jaffa area. And in July, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a deadly drone attack in Tel Aviv – the first such strike on the city by the group.

            Israel has launched several strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, including the targeting of a power plant and maritime ports in January.
    


            But the US military has carried out far more extensive strikes on targets in Yemen in recent weeks, aiming to weaken the group, whose attacks on Red Sea shipping have significantly disrupted global trade.
    


            The campaign is also aimed at stopping launches targeting Israel, as well as commercial and US Navy vessels operating in the Middle East. Early last month, the cost of US the effort had approached $1 billion in just three weeks, including the deployment of B-2 stealth bombers and the use of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of high-end munitions.
    


            But it has largely failed to disrupt the Houthis' ability to launch ballistic missiles against Israel. The country's vaunted missile defense system routinely intercepts the launches, but some have gotten through.

House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes, D-Conn., joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss Mike Waltz's move from National Security advisor to U.N. ambassador, President Donald Trump working to end the war in Ukraine and border security. 

The U.S. could withdraw from peace talks with Ukraine and Russia if the two sides can't make progress toward ending their three-year war, President Donald Trump said.

Trump made the comments during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press" that aired Sunday, telling host Kristen Welker that there is "tremendous hatred" between Ukraine and Russia.

The president says he remains hopeful a peace deal is possible, but confirmed that the U.S. would not remain a mediator indefinitely.

"I do believe we're closer with one party. And maybe not as close with the other, but we'll have to see," Trump said. "Five thousand soldiers a week on average, are dying. They're not American soldiers. But I want to solve the problem."

"How long do you give both countries before you're going to walk away?" Welker asked.

"Well, there will be a time when I will say, okay, keep going, keep being stupid," Trump replied.

"Maybe it's not possible to do," he added. "There's tremendous hatred. Just so you understand, Kristen, we're talking tremendous hatred between these two men and between, you know, some of the soldiers, frankly, between the generals, they've been fighting hard for three years. I think we have a very good chance of doing it."

The interview comes just days after Trump blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioning whether his Russian counterpart has any interest in peace.

TRUMP INSISTS UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE DEAL IS CLOSE, BUT MISTRUST IN PUTIN LEAVES EXPERTS SKEPTICAL

Trump spoke up on social media last week after Russian forces launched missiles into Ukrainian cities.

"There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days," Trump wrote. "It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking' or ‘Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!"

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also appeared to temper expectations for a major peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia last week.

Rubio argued it was "silly" to put a specific date or timeline on when the U.S. might pull out from mediation, but he said this will be "a very critical week."

WNBA star Sophie Cunningham spoke to Fox News Digital about her offseason trade to the Indiana Fever and her hopes for the upcoming season.  

The heat was turned up a notch as the Indiana Fever and the Washington Mystics squared off in the first preseason game of the year on Saturday.

At one point, Cunningham went up for a defensive rebound over Mystics rookie Kiki Iriafen. The veteran guard was tossed to the ground and got into the face of the former USC standout. Fever guard Lexie Hull had to step in between the two players.

Mystics guard Morgan Jones put her arm around Iriafen as the 6-foot-3 turned her back away from Cunningham and smiled. Iriafen was hit with a Flagrant 1 foul.

It wasn't the only incident during the game.

Cunningham was also getting held by Brittney Sykes as she tried to make herself available for a DeWanna Bonner pass. Sykes pushed Cunningham to the ground and was met with Bonner's intensity.

"Sophie's a dawg," Fever head coach Stephanie White said, via Indy Star. "She's a competitor. She's versatile. She allows us to do different things. She plays with such toughness. She's huge, and she's going to be for us all season long.

"What she brings, from an energy standpoint, she raises the level of play of everybody around her as soon as she steps foot on the floor, hell, even on the sideline. I mean, her communication, everything, she's definitely an X factor."

Indiana won the game 79-74 in overtime.

The Mystics made have had one of the worst records in the WNBA last season but made clear in the preseason that they weren't going to be pushed around by any team.

            Brazilian police said on Sunday that they had thwarted a bomb attack planned for Lady Gaga's historic concert that drew over 2 million people to Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday.
    


            The Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro state, working in coordination with the Justice Ministry, said the plot was orchestrated by a group promoting hate speech and the radicalization of teenagers, including self-harm and violent content as a form of social belonging.
    


            According to the Rio city hall, 2.1 million people attended the concert of the American pop icon.
    


            “The suspects were recruiting participants, including minors, to carry out coordinated attacks using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails,” the police said in a statement.
    


            The Justice Ministry said the recruiters identified themselves as members of Gaga's global fan base, known as the “Little Monsters.”
    


            The operation was based on a report by the ministry's Cyber Operations Lab following a tip-off from Rio state police intelligence, which uncovered digital cells encouraging violent behavior among teenagers using coded language and extremist symbolism.
    


            A man described as the group's leader was arrested in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul for illegal possession of a firearm, while a teenager in Rio de Janeiro was detained for storing child pornography.
    


            Authorities carried out over a dozen search and seizure warrants across the states of Rio de Janeiro, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo.

            For many people, the term “mummy” usually brings to mind images of Egyptian sarcophagi.
    


            But the history of mummies is much more complex and spans cultures around the world.
    


            Such well-preserved remains have enabled scientists to reconstruct the faces of those who lived in bygone centuries, such as the Incan “Ice Maiden.”



            Each mummy has their own story to tell, and this week, researchers have uncovered the truth behind an enigmatic figure from a remote Austrian village.
    


            A water leak in the church crypt of St. Thomas am Blasenstein presented an opportunity for scientists to delve into the secrets of an unusual mummy. Called the “air-dried chaplain” by village locals, the remains belonged to an 18th century clergyman who had served as the parish vicar, the research team determined.
    


            The mummy's incredible condition, including intact skin and tissue, may be due to the presence of zinc chloride, wood chips and embroidered fabric found inside the body — a technique never described before in scientific literature, according to the new study.
    


            The chaplain's cause of death has long been shrouded in mystery due to a capsule-shaped object revealed by an X-ray. But the new research has pulled back the curtain on his ultimate cause of death — and the true identity of the glass sphere.
    


            Geoscientists discovered a magma cap beneath Yellowstone National Park, which harbors the world's largest active volcanic systems. See how the unique feature acts like nature's pressure-release valve.
    


            Astronomers detected an invisible molecular cloud surprisingly close to Earth. The cosmic phenomenon could provide a window into understanding how stars and planets form.
    


            The cloud, named Eos after the Greek goddess of the dawn, measures about 40 moons across and its mass is 3,400 times that of the sun, according to the researchers.
    


            They found Eos by searching for ultraviolet light emitted by hydrogen within the cloud, which is made of gas and dust clumps that collapse and trigger the birth of stars.
    


            Separately, a signal traced in 20-year-old telescope data could shed light on an unlikely celestial object that may be connected to the formation of gold across the universe.
    


            A new analysis of a fossil could upend what's known of the evolution of two of the most oddball creatures alive today: the echidna and the platypus.
    


            Both animals, known as monotremes, are the only mammals that lay eggs. The amphibious platypus spends much of its time in the water, while the echidna, often called a spiny anteater, is at home on land.
    


            A team of scientists now believe the only known fossil of a monotreme relative, named Kryoryctes cadburyi, may represent a common ancestor of both animals that lived more than 100 million years ago.
    


            Some of the fossil's features suggest monotremes might have evolved from living in the water to land — and could explain the bizarre, backward feet echidnas have today.
    


            When immunologist Jacob Glanville came across stories about Tim Friede, a California man who injected himself with deadly snake venom hundreds of times and gained immunity to several neurotoxins, he wanted to analyze Friede's blood.
    


            Now, the pair and a team of scientists have shared their latest research about an antivenom that can protect mice against the toxins of 19 species of poisonous snake. The antivenom is based on a venom-blocking drug, as well as antibodies in Friede's blood sample — and researchers hope to conduct human clinical trials with it one day.
    


            “However, we strongly discourage anyone from trying to do what Tim did. Snake venom is dangerous,” said Glanville, who is CEO of biotech company Centivax.
    


            A fresh fiery image is showcasing the sun's complexity like never before.
    


            The image, the first taken by the US National Science Foundation Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope's new Visible Tunable Filter, showcases a highly detailed and 3D view of the sun's roiling activity. The instrument is near the summit of Maui's Haleakalā volcanic mountain.
    


Continent-size sunspots appear to swirl near the heart of the sun's inner atmosphere in the close-up. The image was taken in December — shortly after scientists announced the sun is experiencing the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle — and it could help researchers gain new insights into solar weather and how it could impact our planet.
    


            Take a closer look:
    


            — Amazon launched the first batch of internet-beaming satellites for Project Kuiper, a plan to create a giant constellation that will compete with SpaceX's Starlink satellites, which already serve at least 4.6 million customers across the globe.
    


            — Archaeologists discovered the true identity of two shipwrecks in shallow waters off Cahuita National Park, on Costa Rica's southern Caribbean coast, that were long thought to be pirate ships.
    


            — Perhaps a toadstool house isn't just a fairy tale. Researchers in Montana grew a framework for a living, self-repairing building material from mycelium, or the rootlike structures that connect fungal networks, and it could eventually be used to build homes in the future.
    


            And before you go, look up for this weekend's celestial show. Here's how you can watch the peak of the Eta Aquariid meteor shower.

A college admissions worker in Boston was arrested Friday after he was accused of offering $400 to a 17-year-old prospective student in exchange for sex, federal officials said.

Jacob Henriques, 29, used his position as an assistant admissions director at Emmanuel College to gain access to the personal information of at least four potential students before contacting them, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts alleged.

Henriques met with at least three such students on April 25. He is accused of contacting them afterward with offers to "pay them for some fun," along with offering them and sending them pornography, officials said.

Henriques contacted a fourth victim after she formally committed to attending the school on April 25, the attorney's office said. He allegedly offered to pay her for "some fun" before sending her pornographic videos.

Henriques contacted one prospective student, a 17-year-old high school girl, within hours of finishing a tour of the college on or about April 25, federal officials said. 

Henriques allegedly used the phone number the girl provided on her admissions form to text her with offers to pay her $400 for "some fun" and said he could send her pornography. 

The 29-year-old continued to text the girl that night, refusing to identify himself or tell her how he obtained her phone number, according to officials.

After Henriques allegedly sent the 17-year-old five pornographic videos, prosecutors said he asked if she wanted to participate in a "gangbang" and if she wanted to have sex with him.

Despite the girl rejecting Henriques multiple times, he continued to text her, saying he "would buy her anything she wanted" if she changed her mind, the attorney's office said.

Between April 25 and April 28, Henriques allegedly accessed the girl's profile 47 times. After she blocked his number, Henriques started emailing her, federal officials said.

Henriques was charged with one count of attempted sex trafficking of a minor. 

An Emmanuel College spokesperson told WBZ-TV that Henriques has since been fired after an internal investigation.

"[We are] saddened, angered, and shocked by these serious federal allegations that have been brought against a former employee," the spokesperson said. "They are an affront to our core values, and we stand with any victimized by this incident." 

The FBI said it is seeking other potential victims who Henriques may have targeted between 2024 and 2025. (iStock)

Henriques is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Boston on Monday. He faces up to life in prison if found guilty.

ATLANTA (AP) — The billionaire heir and the former bartender.

Many Democrats have been in and out of the spotlight as the party looks for effective counters to President Donald Trump and his second administration. But two disparate figures, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have seen their national profiles rise by delivering messages that excite a demoralized and fractured party. 

The governor, a 60-year-old heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, and the congresswoman, the 35-year-old with working-class roots, both won their first elections in 2018. Both have urged mass resistance and accused their party of not fighting more. Each has stood out enough to draw sharp retorts from Trump loyalists. 

But as messengers, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez could not be more different. And their arguments, despite some overlap, are distinct enough to raise familiar questions for Democrats: Should they make their challenges to Trump about threats to democracy and national stability, as Pritzker has done, or portray him as a corrupt billionaire exacerbating an uneven economy, as Ocasio-Cortez does? And beyond the message itself, what qualities should the best messenger have?

What links them, said one prominent Democrat, is “assertiveness.”

“People want Trump and Trumpism to be met with equal passion and force,” said National Urban League President Marc Morial, a former New Orleans mayor deeply connected in Democratic politics. On that front, he added, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez “are both effective national figures –- but in very different ways.”

Pritzker was born at the bridge of the baby boomers and Generation X into a sprawling family now entrenched in Democratic politics. Like Trump, he inherited great wealth, but he lambastes the president as a poser on working-class issues.

He chaired Illinois' Human Rights Commission before running for governor. In office, he has signed an Illinois minimum-wage increase and is an ally of unions. His family's hotels are unionized, making them regular options for official Democratic Party events. 

When Democratic President Joe Biden exited the 2024 campaign, Pritzker was floated as a replacement. He made no visible moves, quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris and acted as the de facto host of her nominating convention in his home state.

“Take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity,” Pritzker said in Chicago. 

Since Harris' defeat, Pritzker has behaved like a future candidate. One of the nation's highest-profile Jewish politicians, he fired up liberals by comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich. 

“If you think I'm overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,” the governor said his joint budget and State of the State address on Feb. 19. “All I'm saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.”

Addressing party faithful in the traditional early nominating state of New Hampshire, Pritzker bemoaned “do-nothing” Democrats, called for party honchos to set aside “decades of stale decorum” and urged voters into the streets.

“Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption, but I am now,” he said. Democrats, he added, “must castigate (Republicans) on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.”

It was enough for senior Trump aide Stephen Miller to accuse Pritzker of inciting violence. Pritzker wasted no time returning the volley, calling it “terrible hypocrisy” for Trump allies to complain given the Capitol siege on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump's pardons of the rioters. 

Ocasio-Cortez is a millennial progressive who earned degrees in international relations and economics and worked as a waiter and bartender before entering politics. With support from the progressive Working Families Party, she ousted a top House Democrat, Joe Crowley, in a 2018 primary. 

Like Trump, she leverages millions of social media followers. Also like Trump, she is an economic populist. But she comes from the left wing of U.S. politics and without the anti-immigration and cultural conservatism of Trump's right wing or the alliances with billionaire business and tech elites. 

She has recently headlined “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a two-time presidential candidate. The tour has drawn tens of thousands of people across the country, notably including reliably Republican states, often with overflow crowds outside many stops. 

Ocasio-Cortez's next political move seems less certain than Pritzker's. She is seen as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, and she only recently became old enough to be constitutionally eligible for the presidency. But she appears poised to inherit the mantle of the 83-year-old Sanders' movement.

She freely criticizes Trump. But she leans more heavily into broader economic and social critiques that she's made since her first House bid and that Sanders has offered for decades. 

“For years we have known that our political system has slowly but surely become dominated by big money and billionaires and time after time we have seen how our government and laws are more responsive to corporations and lobbyists than everyday people and voters,” she said in Folsom, California. She advocated for “living wages … stable housing … guaranteed health care,” and blasted “the agenda of dark money to keep our wages low and to loot our public goods like Social Security and Medicare.”

She also played up her roots: “From the waitress who is now speaking to you today, I can tell you: impossible is nothing.”

Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker are allied against a common opponent, Trump, and not each other. Advisers to Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker did not respond to questions.

Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, argues Pritzker could be more attractive as a “traitor to his class” in the tradition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. An East Coast patrician, Roosevelt authored the New Deal's federal expansion to combat the Great Depression of the 1930s.

“How powerful would it be if a billionaire was the one helping to lead the charge against corrupt billionaires and corrupt billionaire corporations that are trying to crack the Constitution and loot the American people?” Green said, adding that “continued silence” on “billionaire issues” should disqualify Pritzker. “We have to be speaking to the shake-up-the-system vibe that people want to see.”

Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, which typically backs centrist Democrats, countered that Pritzker could bring a “more stable” version of Trump's argument that his wealth and success is an asset. Trump's biggest liability, Bennett said, is “chaos” that negatively affects people's lives.

“People are very mad at Elon Musk, but not because he's rich,” Bennett said of the Tesla CEO who is leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. “They're mad at him because he's vandalizing our government and doing it in a destructive way.”

A relative of the governor, Rachel Pritzker, chairs Third Way's board of trustees.

Ocasio-Cortez is often criticized by more moderate Democrats, including Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who has also positioned herself as a thought leader in the party. Slotkin recently suggested the word “oligarchy” didn't resonate with working-class voters. It was an implicit rebuke of the Ocasio-Cortez-Sanders' tour. 

Shortly after Slotkin's comments about oligarchy, Ocasio-Cortez posted on X: “Plenty of politicians on both sides of the aisle feel threatened by rising class consciousness.” 

Bennett said Democrats who emerge as party leaders, including the 2028 nominee, will be those who offer solutions for voters' frustration “over their needs not being met.” It's a notion that Green insisted is indistinguishable from criticizing the billionaire class, along with the tax and labor policies that drive wealth and income gaps in the U.S. 

Whatever direction Democrats choose, Bennett said, Ocasio-Cortez has secured her place as a national voice.

“She's very good at what she does. She's formidable,” he said. “And anybody on the center-left who denies that is just kidding themselves.”

Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital that he found gun shops in the U.S. to be "fascinating."

A Houthi missile struck Israeli soil near Tel Aviv's largest airport on Sunday, causing multiple international airlines to cancel flights to Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation for the attack Sunday and will participate in several defense meetings throughout the day. The missile reportedly evaded both Israeli and U.S. missile defenses, according to Israeli media.

"Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold," said Defense Minister Israel Katz.

Lufthansa, Swiss, and Air Europa were among the airlines to cancel flights to Israel, though they expect to resume service on Monday.

At least 8 people were injured in the missile strike, though none of the injuries were life-threatening. Israel has not yet confirmed any specific military retaliation.

Over the weekend, the Israeli Air Force says it struck over 100 terror targets in the Gaza Strip, including terrorist cells, tunnels, underground infrastructure sites, and other military structures.

IDF troops operating in southern Gaza also located weapons caches in the area, dismantled dozens of terrorist infrastructure sites, and eliminated a number of terrorists.

The missile strike comes days after Israel was forced to cancel its independence day celebrations due to wildfires raging throughout the country.

Massive wildfires broke out near Jerusalem on Wednesday, forcing road closures and mass evacuations that paralyzed the country. Israel traditionally celebrates its independence with a torch-lighting ceremony. It instead broadcast footage of the rehearsal ceremony.

Jerusalem District Fire Department Commander Shmulik Friedman told the press on Wednesday that the wildfires may be "the largest fire ever in the country" and warned that high winds could exacerbate the blaze later in the day. He also warned that Israel was "far from control" of the fires.

            Like the other ceremonies and traditions that accompany the advent of a new pope, his newly chosen name will be imbued with centuries of Catholic history and dissected for its many layers of meaning.
    


            Changing his name is one of the first actions the new pope takes as head of the Roman Catholic Church and can play a hugely symbolic role in setting the tone for his pontificate.
    


            It is a precedent that was set in the early Middle Ages and, while there is no doctrinal reason for a pope to choose a new name, it has become part of the election process.
    


            So, how did this tradition come about, what are the meanings behind different papal names, what name could the next pope choose and how will it be announced?
    


            St. Peter, the first pope and one of the 12 apostles, was renamed from his birth name of Simon by Jesus, but this was before he became head of the church.
    


            Another 500 years would pass before Pope John II, who was head of the church from 533 to 535, started the papal tradition when he shed the name Mercurius, which he thought was too like the name of the pagan god Mercury.
    


            The next pope to change his name was Peter Canepanova in the 10th century, who became John XIV to avoid being called Peter II (more on that below), said Liam Temple, assistant professor in the history of Catholicism at the Centre for Catholic Studies at Durham University.
    


            After the 10th century, taking a different name became common practice for popes once they had been elected, as popes from countries such as France and Germany adopted more Italian-sounding names to mimic their predecessors.
    


            And that then became the custom, with only a handful of popes keeping their baptismal names since, including Marcellus II and Adrian VI, who both served as head of the church in the 16th century.
    


            Each name is steeped in its own history and connotations, linked to the achievements or failings of the previous popes or saints who carried it.
    


            “Linking to the names of previous popes who weathered crises, inspired reform, or were incredibly popular can often, although not always, play a role in the choosing of a name,”  Temple told CNN.
    


            For example, Pope Francis chose his papal name to honor St. Francis of Assisi, with his love for peace and nature, as well as his care for the poor and focus on cooperation between different sects of the church. These associations established the priorities for Francis' papacy.
    


            His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, chose his papal name to show his commitment to peace and reconciliation by honoring St. Benedict and Pope Benedict XV, who was head of the church during World War I, Temple said.
    


            One name that the new pope definitely won't adopt is Peter, out of respect for the first pope, St. Peter the Apostle – but also perhaps because of a centuries-old prophecy that Peter II will be the last pope to serve.
    


            There are other names that aren't necessarily off-limits but are less likely to be chosen because of their associations with the most recent pope who bore them, said Temple.
    


            He identifies the name Urban as an unlikely candidate for the new pope because it would “harken back to Urban VIII, who started the trial of Galileo Galilei, and would not sit well in modern debates about science, faith and religion.”
    


            In a similar vein, the name Pius would evoke memories of Pius XII, whose role during World War II has been increasingly criticized, Temple added.
    


            If the new pope wishes to continue on a reforming path, Temple said that names like Leo, referencing Leo XIII who was known for his dedication to social justice, fair wages and safe working conditions, or Innocent, referencing Innocent XIII who sought to root out corruption, might be appropriate choices.
    


            A new pope who is elected from the Global South, like Pope Francis, may also choose a name adopted by early non-Italian pontiffs such as Gelasius, Miltiades or Victor, who all hailed from the African continent, Temple added.
    


            Over the centuries, there have been 44 papal names used only once – most recently Pope Francis' own.
    


            His decision to choose  a unique name had “massive historical ramifications,” Temple said, for “it had been around 1,100 years since the last uniquely named pope in the form of Pope Lando, whose pontificate lasted less than a year in the 10th century.”
    


            John is the most popular name, with 21 popes choosing to adopt it – although, somewhat confusingly, the last pope to take that name was John XXIII, after historians accidentally misnumbered the popes after John XIV.
    


            Gregory and Benedict are also popular pontifical names with 16 and 15 uses, respectively, while Innocent and Leo come close behind with 13 uses each. (Benedict X was declared an antipope, and expelled from the papal throne, hence the discrepancy in numbering for subsequent Benedicts.)
    


            After white smoke has risen from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel and the bells of St. Peter's have rung, the newly elected pope's name will be conveyed to the world in a Latin pronouncement.
    


            The senior cardinal deacon will step onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, accompanied by two priests, and will deliver the iconic announcement: “Habemus Papam” (“We have a pope”).
    


            The new pope's name, as well as his baptismal names, will be translated into Latin in the announcement but his former surname will remain in his native language.
    


            For example, when Pope Francis was elected in 2013, his given names of “Jorge Mario” were delivered as “Giorgio Marium,” but his surname “Bergoglio” remained the same.
    


            His papal name was announced as “Franciscum” and was the last word of the proclamation, as is customary.

President Donald Trump added yet another twist to the monthslong saga to fill the role of United Nations ambassador, forcing Republicans to relive the Signalgate controversy as they usher Mike Waltz's nomination through the Senate.

Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee, the panel weighing Waltz's nomination, are expected to heavily litigate his judgment after he mistakenly added the Atlantic‘s editor-in-chief to a Signal group chat detailing sensitive military plans.

Trump removed Waltz from his post as national security adviser on Thursday, which was viewed as a firing prompted by the controversy. However, the president simultaneously named Waltz ambassador to the U.N. Waltz's deputy, Alexon Wong, is also reportedly being removed.

The move capped off weeks of uncertainty and drama surrounding the ambassadorship, the only unfilled position of Trump's 22-member Cabinet. He previously nominated and then pulled Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) from consideration due to concerns over Republicans' slim House majority.

Stefanik has since returned to a post in House leadership as she eyes a run for governor of New York.

Waltz, a former House member, has enjoyed support from within the party, and on Thursday, Republicans suggested he would have no trouble filling the vacancy.

“I think most Republicans in the Senate know Mike and like him and have confidence in him,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), an adviser to GOP leadership and Foreign Relations Committee member, told the Washington Examiner. “Obviously, the president still has confidence in him in order to put him in this key role.”

However, Waltz's involvement in the Signal debacle, in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive information about impending strikes in Yemen, promises to bog the party down in negative confirmation hearing headlines.

News of Waltz's nomination caught Republican senators off guard as they departed the Capitol following the final Senate vote of the week on Thursday.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who was informed by reporters of the nomination, quipped that perhaps Stefanik should switch with Waltz and become national security adviser. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is temporarily filling the role.

“Poor Elise Stefanik,” Hawley said.

Cornyn said it was important to “get to the bottom” of the Signal security lapse, but he added that he prefers the Department of Defense's inspector general to continue handling the investigation.

Hawley also projected confidence in Waltz when asked about his prospects: “Unless there's something I'm really missing here, I think [Waltz] would be perfectly fine.”

Lawmakers are increasingly anxious to fill the U.N. post, which has been vacant for three months in Trump's second term. Senators on both sides of the aisle have, in recent days, felt a pressing need to confirm an ambassador as Trump clashes over trade and tries to broker an end to foreign conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war.

“Clearly, the sooner the better,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), another Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee. “The U.N. has a lot of challenges in terms of terrible policies that we see coming out of the U.N., and the sooner we have a strong leader … the better off America is going to be. And the world, frankly.”

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the top committee Democrat, described Trump's withdrawal of Stefanik as “unfortunate” because it was based on “political considerations, not on qualifications.”

“We really need to be pushing back against China and the Russian Security Council,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), another panel Democrat. “It's not good to have us not fully represented by a confirmed ambassador.”

Trump announced his intent to nominate Waltz for the U.N. post via his Truth Social platform. He praised Waltz's former military experience, time serving in the House, and short stint as national security adviser.

TRUMP MOVES EMBATTLED MIKE WALTZ FROM NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO UN

“From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,” Trump said. “I know he will do the same in his new role.”

Waltz responded on social media that he was “deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation.”

British counterterrorism officers arrested several Iranian men over an alleged plan to attack an undisclosed location in London, the London Metropolitan Police announced Sunday.

Five men between the ages of 29 and 46 were taken into custody on Saturday in various parts of England on suspicion of preparing a terrorist act.

Four of the men are Iranian citizens, while investigators are still working to determine the nationality of the fifth.

In a separate investigation, three other Iranian men, aged 39, 44 and 55, were arrested in London on suspicion of a national security offense.

All the suspects are being questioned at police stations but have not yet been charged. Police are searching several properties in London, Manchester in northwest England and Swindon in western England.

Police said the attack plot targeted a single location, which the agency said is not being revealed "for operational reasons."

Commander Dominic Murphy, who leads the police force's Counter Terrorism Command, said investigators are still working to establish a motive "as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public."

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the arrests were "serious events that demonstrate the ongoing requirement to adapt our response to national security threats."

"The government continues to work with police and intelligence agencies to support all the action and security assessments that are needed to keep the country safe," she said.

In October, the head of Britain's MI5 domestic security service, Ken McCallum, said his agents and police have identified 20 "potentially lethal" plots backed by Iran since 2022, with most targeting Iranians in the U.K. who oppose the country's authorities.

McCallum said at the time there was the risk "of an increase in, or broadening of, Iranian state aggression in the U.K." if conflicts in the Middle East intensified.

The U.K.'s official terror threat level stands at "substantial," which falls in the middle of a five-point scale, meaning an attack is likely.

"MobLand" stars Tom Hardy and Paddy Considine tell Fox News Digital what it was like working with Pierce Brosnan and Helen Mirren on the show.

Tom Hardy's road to stardom hasn't always been easy. From battling addiction to navigating on-set feuds, the 47-year-old British actor, best known for roles in TV and film projects such as "Peaky Blinders," "Venom," "Inception" and "Mad Max: Fury Road," has proven he has what it takes to overcome adversity and become one of Hollywood's leading men. 

From an early age, Hardy, who stars alongside Pierce Brosnan and Helen Mirren in the Paramount+ series "MobLand," faced a wave of challenges. 

As a young teen, the London native found himself often at odds with the law and quickly developed an addiction to alcohol and crack.

"What I have is indiscriminate, like a bullet. If you are an alcoholic, that is what you are," Hardy told The Mirror in 2014. "If I had four pints of lager and half a bottle of vodka, I could turn this room into an absolute f---ing nightmare in about three minutes. I could destroy everything in my life I have worked so hard for."

Hardy, who made his big-screen debut in 2001 with his role in "Black Hawk Down," checked himself into a rehab center after wrapping "Star Trek: Nemesis" in 2002. 

"I didn't want anyone to know I was out of control, but I couldn't hide it," he told The Mirror.  "I went in thinking I'd do it for a little bit until I can go out and drink and people forgive me. But I did my 28 days, and after listening to people who had been through similar circumstances, I realized I did have a problem.

"I did something particularly heinous that allowed me to wake up," added Hardy, whose rock-bottom included waking up in a pool of his own blood and vomit. "I had to lose something. Sometimes you have to lose something that is worth more to you than your drinking."

Despite the challenging road ahead, Hardy, a father of three, said he found a way to use his troubling past as a stepping stone in his career. 

While discussing his role in the 2011 film "Warrior," in which he plays the son of an alcoholic former boxer, Hardy said his experiences helped with character development. 

"In the [alcohol abuse] scenes with Nick Nolte, if you've been to those depths, experience allows you to think ‘this is right' or ‘this is wrong' and know how to react," Hardy, sober since 2003, told ShortList at the time. 

"There's only so much imagination you can use before you have to go out and live life again. You see these kid actors who work from 10 to 21 and then, all of a sudden, they disappear for a bit. They've got nothing to draw upon apart from a life of working, so you need to go out and catch up and then come back in again."

Hardy's past is what pushed him to pursue acting in the first place.

"In the end, there was nothing else I could do. I had a busy head, and I didn't really want to do things that I found boring," he told The ShortList in 2011. "The only thing that kept my attention was to play and have fun and manipulate. I've always been a liar, always been able to manipulate. I pretty much get whatever I want.

"Acting really is a mixture of bulls---ng and manipulating and the study of action-reaction," he added. "And camouflage — hiding yourself in other languages, bodies and shapes. Acting channeled me into something. I found some self-esteem and thought, ‘I'm actually quite good at something.'"

And he enjoys playing the villain. 

"I play a lot of scary blokes, and there are probably a few reasons why," he told The Hollywood Reporter in 2017. "First, villains are much more interesting than hero leads, who are, for the most part, really boring. The thought of going into work day in and day out to play someone who is just mind-numbingly boring fills me with dread, so I don't bother.

"Another part of it is when I was younger I remember being frightened a lot, of being small and skinny and vulnerable and feeling that I could have been preyed upon easily. So, everything that I play is what scared me."

Throughout his run in Hollywood, however, Hardy has gotten some press for being difficult on set. 

According to "Blood, Sweat & Chrome," a book that sheds light on "Mad Max: Fury Road," Hardy once sent co-star Charlize Theron into a rage after showing up late to set. 

Camera operator Mark Goellnicht alleges in the book that Hardy "was notorious for never being on time in the morning. If the call time was in the morning, forget it. He didn't show up."

After arriving three hours late to set, Theron allegedly ripped into Hardy at the time, calling him "disrespectful."

"She jumps out of the War Rig, and she starts swearing her head off at him, saying, ‘Fine the f--king c--- $100,00 for every minute that he's held up this crew,' and ‘How disrespectful you are!'" Goellnicht claimed. "She was right. Full rant. She screams it out. It's so loud, it's so windy — he might've heard some of it, but he charged up to her and went, ‘What did you say to me?' [Hardy] was quite aggressive. She really felt threatened, and that was the turning point."

"It was like two parents in the front of the car. We were either fighting or we were icing each other — I don't know which one is worse — and they had to deal with it in the back," Theron explained in an excerpt, according to Vanity Fair. "It was horrible. We should not have done that; we should have been better. I can own up to that."

"In hindsight, I was in over my head in many ways," Hardy told Esquire in 2020 about the confrontation. "The pressure on both of us was overwhelming at times. What she needed was a better, perhaps more experienced partner in me. … I'd like to think that now that I'm older and uglier, I could rise to that occasion."

Hardy once told THR he's fully aware of the rep he's earned.

"There's this myth, which is quite asinine, that circulates about me — usually by those who haven't worked with me," he told THR. "There's only one thing worse than being talked about and that's not being talked about in this game. So, I'd rather it be that, I guess. But there are other people who I work with consistently who know that's not the case, who just wouldn't risk having somebody like that in their midst because there's too much at stake. Obviously, you're going to rub people the wrong way … and I've been a d---. But then, who hasn't?"

These days, Hardy's most important role is being a dad to his three children — Louis, 17, whom he shares with ex-girlfriend and casting director Rachael Speed, and his two children he shares with wife Charlotte Riley. 

"There is no harder and more important job on the planet than parenting," he told Esquire in 2018. "You've got the military, police, doctors, service personnel — massive respect, huge consequences — but parenting? It's beyond a job, isn't it.

"In trying to protect my children, I'll probably give them their own dose of problems," he said. "But I don't want them to go through what I went through."

            The judge tasked with weighing in on the government's reach into higher education in Harvard University's recent lawsuit against the Trump administration is an experienced prosecutor and jurist with a history of taking on tough cases – including those involving both the Ivy League and the president.
    


            “95% of life is showing up,” US District Court Allison Dale Burroughs quipped Monday morning inside a Boston courtroom where she is overseeing Harvard's legal battle against the Trump administration over $2 billion in ﻿frozen federal funds.
    


            The hearing was supposed to be streamed on Zoom, but courthouse technology staff struggled to get it working. Burroughs sat for 15 minutes on the bench, noting “81 unhappy people” were waiting to get in. After the attorneys for each side said they were ready to proceed, she started the hearing sans-Zoom.
    


            Harvard has asked for an expedited final decision rather than an immediate order to restore the money, leaving $2 billion in federal grants and contracts the university says is critical to important research hanging in the balance. The university's lawyers specifically asked in a court filing that Burroughs be assigned to this case, citing her involvement in a related case over federal research funding brought by the Association of American Universities, which includes Harvard.
    


            Burroughs “is a brilliant jurist and I think she'll give everyone a fair shake,” Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard, told CNN on Monday.
    


            “It looks like the parties are trying to advance this case as quickly as possible,” Burroughs said Monday. At the 15-minute hearing, she scheduled oral arguments for July 21.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House, Burroughs and Harvard University for comment.
    


            Burroughs was working as a partner in Nutter McClennen & Fish LLP, a law firm co-founded by former Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, when President Barack Obama nominated her as a district court judge in the summer of 2014.
    


            Burroughs graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont before receiving her law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1988.
    


            She spent time in the early 1980s waitressing at a longtime pub on Capitol Hill and working as a congressional intern for Democratic Congressman Matthew McHugh, Burroughs told the Senate Judiciary Committee, before starting her law career clerking for Judge Norma Shapiro, the first female judge in the Third Circuit's Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
    


            She then spent about 17 years prosecuting criminal cases for the federal government as a US attorney in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, taking on emerging criminal gangs, drug offenders, economic crime and technology-focused cases.
    


            Donald Sterling, former US attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said hiring Burroughs as an assistant US attorney years ago was an easy decision. Even then, she was a star, he told CNN.
    


            “Allison was never shy about speaking her mind but usually did so with a sense of humor,” Sterling said, describing Burroughs as “hard working, balanced, smart and highly ethical.”
    


            “Allison was a no-nonsense prosecutor but always listened to what defense counsel had to say. When making a prosecution decision, she was guided wholly by the facts and the law,” he added.
    


            Obama said he was confident Burroughs would “serve the American people with integrity and a steadfast commitment to justice,” in a statement around the time of her nomination.
    


            As part of her confirmation process, the Senate Judiciary Committee asked Burroughs to list her 10 most significant cases. Among those she listed were one of the first cases in the nation tied to the Patriot Act – enacted after the September 11 terror attacks to broaden the government's surveillance powers; a complex offshore money laundering scheme; large-scale telemarketing fraud; an enforcer for a violent crack cocaine trafficking organization; and a Maine state trooper accused of stealing and selling championship baseball rings from Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams.
    


            “I am fully committed to putting aside any personal views that I might have and being fair to all who might appear before me,” Burroughs told the committee. “During my career I have litigated effectively on behalf of both the U.S. government and individual defendants.”
    


            She was sworn in as a US district judge for the District of Massachusetts in January 2015.
    


            This isn't Burroughs' first high-profile case involving Harvard University. As a federal judge in 2019, she upheld the Ivy League's admissions process in an affirmative action case – a decision the US Supreme Court later overturned.
    


            She ruled that while Harvard's admissions process was “not perfect,” she would not “dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster, solely because it could do better.”
    


            Race-conscious admissions hold “an important place in society and help ensure that colleges and universities can offer a diverse atmosphere that fosters learning, improves scholarship, and encourages mutual respect and understanding,” the judge said in her decision.
    


            The case prompted nationwide scrutiny of university admissions practices, and in 2023, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision saying universities could no longer take race into consideration in admissions decisions. The decision overturned long-standing precedent that has benefited Black and Latino students in higher education.
    


            As a federal district judge, Burroughs has put guardrails on the Trump administration before.
    


            As hordes of protesters descended on US airports where travelers were being detained under Trump's 2017 travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order blocking the removal of individuals from those countries. Boston Logan International Airport became a de facto shelter for many of those families.
    


            During the coronavirus pandemic, Burroughs oversaw a case brought by Harvard and MIT against the Trump administration, which insisted international students at schools offering online-only classes would need to leave the United States. The administration walked back that policy before a ruling was made.
    


            And two weeks ago, Burroughs issued another temporary restraining order blocking Department of Energy cuts to federal research funding in the lawsuit brought by the Association of American Universities.

THANE, India (AP) — It's early morning at a traffic intersection in Thane, a city on the outskirts of Mumbai, the bustling financial capital of India that's home to more than 20 million people. The roads are already crowded with commuters, while engines and horns fill the air with noise that's amplified by the highway overhead.

About a dozen young children are forming little splashes of color on the gray tarmac as they cross a busy road helped by two men. They are arriving to attend an innovative school operated by the NGO Samarth Bharat Vyaspeeth, using shipping containers under the highway as classrooms.

Children will bathe, change into a uniform, and have their morning meal of tea and porridge before filing into air-conditioned shipping containers for lessons. They learn to read and write in the local Marathi language and English; practicing using computers; and conduct simple experiments in a science lab. In between lessons, they play soccer and traditional sports like kabaddi.

The school is a day-time sanctuary, promising some of the city's poorest children a safe environment and three nutritious meals. In the evening they will return to homes on the fringes of the metropolis, many improvised from scavenged corrugated iron sheets, plywood boards and tarpaulins.

“If I had not been to school, I would have been married by now, or just wandering around. I want to become a doctor or a nurse.”Sonali Gautam Gayakwad, 14.



“Teacher teaches me how to draw in school. I want to be a painter.”Vaishali Ramesh Pawar, 10.



“If I hadn't come to this school, I would have also become a ragpicker and collected garbage from the streets.”Harshida Pradeep Kudya, 12.



“I don't know what I would be doing if I had not joined this school. I want to start a beauty parlour in the future”Neelam Krishan, 11.



Vaishali Pawar, 10, and her two siblings attend Signal Shala, named after its location near a traffic signal.




“My elder brother has never been to school and is an auto driver. One sister has got married but I want to become an artist,” says Pawar.

Her parents were reluctant to send the children but were talked into it by the school.

Since 2016, the school is preparing children like Vaishali to appear for formal examinations conducted by the state education board. According to its webpage there are 57 students enrolled in the school which strives “to bring such children into the mainstream of society by addressing not only their educational needs but also their health and emotional well-being.”

Sonali Gautam Gayakwad, 14, says that If she had not joined the school, she would have been married off by now.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump proposed sending American troops into Mexico to help her administration fight drug trafficking but that she rejected it. 

Her remarks to supporters in eastern Mexico came in response to a Wall Street Journal article published the day before, describing a tense phone call last month in which Trump reportedly pressured her to accept a bigger role for the U.S. military in combating drug cartels in Mexico. 

“He said, ‘How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you.' And you know what I said to him? ‘No, President Trump.'” 

She added: “Sovereignty is not for sale. Sovereignty is loved and defended.” 

White House National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt said in a statement later Saturday that Trump has worked closely with Mexico's president “to achieve the most secure southwest border in history.”

“Dangerous Foreign Terrorist Organizations, however, continue to threaten our shared security and the drugs and crime they spread threaten American communities across the country,” the statement said. “The President has been crystal clear that Mexico must do more do combat these gangs and cartels and the United States stands ready to assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries.”

The U.S. military presence has increased steadily along its southern border with Mexico in recent months, following Trump's order in January to increase the army's role in stemming the flow of migrants.




The U.S. Northern Command has surged troops and equipment to the border, increased manned surveillance flights to monitor fentanyl trafficking along the border and sought expanded authority for U.S. Special Forces to work closely with Mexican forces conducting operations against cartels.

Trump designated many of the gangs and cartels smuggling drugs into the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations on Feb. 19, restricting their movements and lending law enforcement more resources to act against them.

But Sheinbaum's hardline stance Saturday signaled that U.S. pressure for unilateral military intervention would put her and Trump on a collision course after months of cooperation on immigration and trade. 

“We can work together, but you in your territory and us in ours,” Sheinbaum said.

Buck Wehrbein, NCBA President and rancher, sounds the alarm on the return of the screwworm and urges action from Mexico while crediting strong pressure from the Trump administration and Secretary Rollins for recent progress.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum publicly confirmed she rejected U.S. military assistance from President Donald Trump, who was looking to help the country fight drug trafficking and violent cartels.

Responding to a Wall Street Journal report Friday that detailed the offer, Sheinbaum confirmed "it's true."

Trump reportedly called Sheinbaum and asked, "How can we help you fight drug trafficking?"

She told Trump the country will "never accept" the presence of the U.S. Army in its territory.

"No, President Trump, our territory is inalienable, sovereignty is inalienable," Sheinbaum said. "We can collaborate. We can work together, but with you in your territory and us in ours. We can share information, but we will never accept the presence of the United States Army on our territory."

In a written statement to Fox News Digital Saturday, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly highlighted coordinated efforts with Mexico to address border security.

"President Trump has worked with President Sheinbaum to advance border security collaboration with Mexico to the highest levels ever," Kelly wrote. "This robust cooperation and information sharing is delivering tangible results, including the removal of numerous cartel leaders to the U.S. to face justice and creating the most secure border in history."

Since taking office, Trump has continued to use CIA drones to conduct surveillance flights over the country in coordination with the Mexican government.

He has also formally named drug cartels "foreign terrorist" groups.

However, Kelly said Mexico must do more to protect Americans from dangerous foreign terrorist organizations and "the drugs and violence they flood into communities on both sides of the border."

"We will continue exploring ways to enhance our efforts across the region to dismantle these transnational criminal organizations," she wrote. "We will make America safe again."

The Heritage Foundation, a top conservative group, released a report in January detailing how Trump could use the military to confront the border crisis.

It argued that Mexican cartels are continuing to grow, illegal immigration and narcotics smuggling have accelerated and U.S.-Mexico security cooperation has deteriorated.

However, the report noted direct military action against cartels should be a "last resort," preferring joint military action with Mexican coordination, Fox News Digital previously reported.

"In the appropriate context, unilateral U.S. military action may be employed to disrupt cartel activity and prompt cooperation from a resistant Mexican government," the group wrote.

The foundation claimed Mexico was unlikely to change its stance when Sheinbaum was elected despite the escalating threat from cartels.

A group of unconventional antiheroes has jumpstarted the summer box office.

Disney and Marvel's "Thunderbolts*" tallied an estimated $76 million during its domestic opening weekend, the third highest debut of 2025.

Including international ticket sales, the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe flick snared an estimated $162.1 million globally.

"With the debut of 'Thunderbolts*,' May is shaping up to be one the best on record," said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.

Last year, the summer box office — which kicks off the first weekend in May and runs through Labor Day — struggled at the start, with Universal's "The Fall Guy" only snapping up $28 million in its first three days. It was the first year since 2009 that a Marvel film wasn't on the slate to start the season.

Marvel films have struggled in recent years to live up to the record-setting achievements of "Avengers: Endgame" in 2019. For every box office hit there was a major miss, and audiences bemoaned the studio's quality inconsistencies. Even in the last year, "The Marvels" and "Captain America: Brave New World" underwhelmed, while "Deadpool & Wolverine" overperformed.

"Every franchise movie faces its share of tailwinds and headwinds, inherent and external factors that dictate what audience anticipation and response will be," said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. "But there's no doubt 'Thunderbolts*' is a moment worth a victory lap for Marvel after several years of wildly varying sentiment toward multiple films and streaming series."

While $76 million is middle of the pack for the MCU, it's a strong performance for "Thunderbolts*," box office analysts told CNBC.

"To launch an ensemble of junior varsity characters unfamiliar to many outside the core fan base, and to do so with some of the best word of mouth the MCU has seen from critics and audiences in years, is a fresh reminder of what Marvel is capable of when the creative engine fires on all cylinders," Robbins said.

"Thunderbolts*" currently holds an 88% "Fresh" rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, from 257 reviews and a 94% rating from audiences.

"The opening weekend performance of 'Thunderbolts*' is just the beginning for this well-reviewed crowd-pleaser," said Comscore's Dergarabedian. "[It] looks to follow in the tradition of 'A Minecraft Movie' and 'Sinners,' with long-term playability."

In recent weeks, Warner Bros.' "A Minecraft Movie" and "Sinners" have consistently lured in moviegoers, with smaller-than-average weekly attendance drops. The hope is that "Thunderbolts*" will continue that trend.

Israel's security cabinet was set to meet on Sunday to approve an expansion of military action in Gaza and discuss aid deliveries ahead of a planned visit to the Middle East this month by President Donald Trump. 

The new ground operations will likely involve taking control of additional territory while stopping short of a full siege, according to two Israeli officials who spoke on condition on anonymity on matters they were not authorized to discuss publicly.

President Donald Trump took credit for the "good parts" of the economy in an exclusive interview with NBC News airing Sunday, but said that the "bad parts" are former President Joe Biden's economy.

Trump defended his tariffs, even amid the economic uncertainty stemming from the sweeping announcement.

"Ultimately, I take responsibility for everything, but I've only just been here for a little more than three months," Trump said.

"The tariffs have just started kicking in. ... The tariffs are going to make us rich. We're going to be a very rich country," he added.

It's not the first time that Trump has tried to shift blame to his predecessor. Just last week, he put the onus on Biden for the U.S. economy contracting in the first quarter of the year.

Trump also doubled down on comments he made during a Cabinet meeting earlier in the week, when he dismissed concerns that his tariffs would lead to supply shortages.

"I don't think a beautiful baby girl needs – that's 11 years old – needs to have 30 dolls," Trump said.

"I'm just saying [children] don't need to have 30 dolls, they can have three, they don't need to have 250 pencils, they can have five," he added.

In the interview, Trump also downplayed the possibility of long-term negative impacts from his tariffs on the U.S. economy, even if the U.S. experiences a recession in the short term.

"Look, yeah, it's — everything's OK. What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we're going to do fantastically," he told Welker.

Bela Bajaria has had an incredible nine-year run at Netflix. She joined in 2016 to oversee unscripted and scripted series, led the streaming giant's push into live events and sports, and worked her way up to becoming the company's chief content officer.

But before then, she has what she calls a "big public failure" which turned out to be "the greatest learning lesson": She was fired from her job as president of Universal Television after a five-year tenure and big accomplishments, including building a strong comedy roster with top creators like Tina Fey and Mike Schur.

"There's amazing books and quotes and all this stuff about [how] you learn so much from failure, and failure is important, and you're not trying hard enough if you're not failing," Bajaria told CNBC's Julia Boorstin at the recent 2025 Changemakers Summit in Los Angeles. "And all of that is true, but then when you fail, nobody wants to talk about it."

There's plenty of gendered stigma that keep women from discussing their firings, Bajaria added, "because we're supposed to be perfect" and a dismissal is "a blemish."

The first few months after her firing were especially tough, she said. She found it hard to separate her personal identity with her professional status and she wondered if the hard work she put into her career was worthwhile.

Bajaria recalled thinking: "All those amazing shows, all these great relationships I built; I treated people so fairly. We had a lot of success — it meant nothing."

The actual response to her firing challenged that, she said. "I quickly realized, as the phone rang and I got job offers, and everybody reached out, and people were really supportive — it all mattered. The way I treated people, what I had done, the impact I left — it all mattered," Bajaria said.

"I knew I could always look at myself in the mirror and [think] I liked what I had done. I didn't have any shame around what I did. I thought it was really a great, successful run," she added.

Bajaria was quick to note that coming to terms with her firing, and finding the upside of it, is easier after nearly a decade of distance. "The first three months were really rough," she said.

"In retrospect I am so grateful that it happened," Bajaria said. "I'm not scared of getting fired. It's very liberating, actually."

Under Bajaria's leadership, Netflix has become a destination to watch live events including comedy specials, awards shows, WWE programming and NFL games.

Netflix films and series like "Bridgerton" and "Emily in Paris" have become global phenomena and boosted economies by hiring massive crews and encouraging tourism to the shows' settings.

Last year, Netflix received the most nominations for a single studio at both the Oscars and the Emmys with 107 nominations across 35 series, TV movies and specials.

Relationships don't fall apart overnight. More often than not, they crumble under the weight of small missteps that quietly accumulate — until they become too heavy to manage.

As a psychologist who studies couples, I've seen many versions of this. Partners come into my office thinking their problem has something to do with frequent fights or arguments. But when we dig deeper, we often find the same root cause: what they say to each other in their arguments.

There's one phrase I've seen come up in these exchanges that's more damaging than you think: "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?"

If you use this toxic phrase, your relationship is in trouble. 

At first glance, it might seem like a throwaway line or a sigh of frustration in the middle of an argument.

What couples fail to recognize is that the person named is actually irrelevant, whether it's an ex, a best friend's girlfriend, or even "how you used to be." The real message will always remain the same: "You're not enough, and someone else — anyone else — could do a better job at being my partner."

Over time, this kind of comparison can give rise to irreparable insecurity issues. Rather than feeling loved for who they are, the person on the receiving end will start questioning their worth and constantly wonder if they're living up to expectations.

DON'T MISS: How to successfully change careers and be happier at work

Relationships can't thrive when we ask our partner to be someone they're not. Happiness can only be achieved when we communicate what we need clearly, without shame or comparison.

That's why this phrase itself isn't the real problem. It's usually a symptom of a much deeper dysfunction: the fear of openly speaking up.

Research helps explain why some partners might not express their frustrations openly — at least, not at first. According to one study, when a partner feels uncertain about the relationship, or unsure of how their partner will respond, they're more likely to hold back. 

Rather than just saying outright, "I feel disconnected when we don't spend quality time together," they compartmentalize it. These moments only pile up over time, until the day comes that they inexplicably blurt out something like, "Why can't you be more like Sarah's husband? He actually plans dates." 

It's not necessarily that they want a different partner; it's that they don't feel safe enough to voice their needs plainly. The more secure and emotionally close a person feels in their relationship, the more likely they are to communicate directly. 

Instead of pointing to someone else as a model, turn the spotlight inward. What are you really asking for? And why are you so afraid to ask it plainly?

If you catch yourself about to say, for instance, "Why can't you be more like Alex? He never blows up over small things," give these a try instead:

Notice how these versions are rooted in your own experience, not someone else's behavior. This makes them bids for connection, instead of a sweeping accusation of failure.

Relationships require the willingness to love each other as real, flawed, irreplaceable humans — not as comparisons to someone else. Similarly, they require the courage to speak openly, as well as the trust that your openness will be met with respect.

The Panama Canal has spent the past few years battling extreme weather, with the El Niño phenomenon and severe drought leading to a water-level crisis. Now, it's President Trump's trade war that is threatening the global trade gateway. A critical passage for U.S. East Coast bound ocean freight container traffic, the Panama Canal is facing a potential business slump as a result of Trump's China tariffs and a rapid decline in manufactured goods being ordered by U.S. shippers.

Forty percent of all U.S. container traffic travels through the Panama Canal every year, and in all, $270 billion in cargo annually. The U.S. and China are the top users of the Panama Canal, and its role in global shipping has increased in recent years due to the disruption of global supply chains. The Panama Canal Authority's revenue hit $3.38 billion last year, despite drought conditions, and revenue has increased every year since 2017.

The trade war uncertainty and Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese goods — which will start to hit goods arriving from China to U.S. ports on May 27 based on the four to six weeks it takes for ocean freight to reach the U.S. from Asia — has already resulted in a massive pause on U.S. imports bound from China. According to data from supply chain intelligence firm Project44, there has been a 300% increase in blank sailings (cancelled freight vessels) from China to the United States since Trump's so-called "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement on April 2.

West Coast ports in the U.S. are already being hit and the impact on East Coast ports is expected to increase, with the pullback in vessels a result of the decrease in manufacturing orders for Chinese factories: less products manufactured translates into less shipping containers for ocean carriers.

For the Asia to North America East Coast trade route, Sea-Intelligence has recorded a cumulative blanked capacity of 261,822 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs.) over the last six weeks. This decrease in containers and vessels can impact Panama Canal revenue. The Panama Canal makes its money off of the number of vessel transits and containers moving through the waterway.

"Since close to 75% of our cargo goes to or from the United States, any recession worldwide or in the United States will impact somehow the Panama Canal," said Boris Moreno, vice president of operations for the Panama Canal Authority. "That's for sure."  

One of the "Seven Wonders of the Modern World," according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the canal has been a lightning rod for controversy in recent years in the battle for global supremacy between the U.S. and China. Trump has claimed the canal's key ports are being controlled by China, and has threatened to reassert U.S. control over the canal, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates. China, along with government of Panama, have denied those claims.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth both visited with Panamanian government officials in recent months.

"I think that Panama over the last five years has inched closer and closer to China and away from the United States," Federal Maritime Commissioner Louis Sola said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year. "I've seen China and Brazil take away $20 billion with direct contracts. We definitely need to at least have a game there."

Ricaurte Vasquez, administrator for the Panama Canal Authority, tells CNBC that with the U.S. being the world's largest economy, it is reviewing Trump's concerns.

"Whatever is said in Washington has repercussions all over," said Vasquez. "We try to stay cool, calm and collected."

He added, "It is not true that we are run by Chinese. It is not true that we differentiate rates. It is not true that 38,000 people die in the construction of the Panama Canal. Everyone that wants to sail sails through the Panama Canal. And we are open to the world. That is the neutrality treaty. We have to remain open."

In March, an investment group led by U.S. firm BlackRock announced it was trying to purchase two ports at either end of the canal, as well as about 40 others from Hong Kong based-CK Hutchison. The outcome of that deal remains unclear.

In some U.S. cities, it now takes more than twice the income to afford a median-priced home than to afford a median-priced apartment — and the gap keeps growing.

Nationwide, a recent Redfin analysis finds that U.S. homebuyers must earn $116,633 to afford such a home — 82% more than the income needed to cover the cost of a median-priced rental. The figures are based on the standard assumption that housing costs shouldn't exceed 30% of gross income, a common affordability benchmark.

The estimates reflect national and metro-level data for the three months ending in February 2025, comparing median home sale prices with median asking rents for newly listed apartments in buildings with five or more units. Homeownership calculations assume a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 15% down payment and a 6.84% interest rate, and also factor in insurance and property taxes.

Since 2021, the income needed to afford a home has climbed at a much faster pace than what's needed to rent — with the gap between the two more than quadrupling. That's largely due to soaring home prices and high mortgage rates, while rent growth has mostly stalled.

"It has become increasingly challenging for American renters to make the shift to homeownership thanks to the triple whammy of rising home prices, high mortgage rates and a shortage of houses for sale," writes Redfin senior economist Elijah de la Campa.

For buyers, demand has far outpaced supply in recent years, as a pandemic-era slowdown in construction worsened an already tight housing market. With too few homes available to buyers, prices surged 43% from 2020 to 2025, per Redfin's data.

For rentals, prices have remained flat over the past two years, driven by a wave of new apartment construction that has boosted supply, according to Redfin.

In 13 of the 42 largest U.S. metro areas, the income required to afford a median-priced home is now more than double what's needed to rent a median-priced apartment.

Big cities tend to have higher home costs because they attract people for jobs and opportunity, driving up demand and pushing home prices higher — especially when supply is limited.

Here are the metros with the widest income gaps between what's required to buy and rent:

The steepest disparity is in San Jose, where buyers need to earn $408,557 annually — more than three times the income required to rent. The smallest gap is in Pittsburgh, where buyers need to earn just $66,350 to afford a home — only 14.4% more than what's required to rent.

Investors with concerns about the risks facing the economy may want to add some stable income to their portfolio in the form of dividend-paying stocks.

To this end, Wall Street experts' recommendations can help pick lucrative dividend stocks that have the ability to make consistent payments despite near-term pressures.  

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This week's first dividend stock is telecom giant AT&T (T). The company recently reported first-quarter results, driven by strong postpaid phone and fiber net subscriber additions. The company retained its full-year guidance and stated that it plans to commence share buybacks in the second quarter, given that its net leverage target of net debt-to-adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is in the 2.5-times range.

AT&T offers investors a quarterly dividend of $0.2775 per share. With an annualized dividend of $1.11 per share, AT&T stock offers a dividend yield of 4.0%.

In reaction to the company's Q1 print, RBC Capital analyst Jonathan Atkin raised his price target for AT&T stock to $30 from $28 and reiterated a buy rating. The analyst noted that the company exceeded estimates even after excluding $100 million of one-time EBITDA benefits.

Atkin added that AT&T's revenue surpassed expectations, thanks to the strength in both wireless and wireline businesses. Among other positives, the analyst noted that the company promptly addressed the slowdown seen in January and delivered robust postpaid phone net additions of 324,000, with gross additions growing 13% and helping to overcome higher churn.

"Management signaled confidence in its execution amidst a challenging environment by reiterating guidance and introducing a buyback program that commences in Q2," said Atkin.

Atkin ranks No. 85 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.3%. See AT&T Hedge Fund Trading Activity on TipRanks.

We move to Philip Morris International (PM), a consumer goods company that is focused on transitioning completely to smoke-free alternatives from cigarettes. The company reported solid results for the first quarter of 2025, driven by strong demand for its smoke-free products.

Philip Morris rewarded shareholders with a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share. At an annualized dividend of $5.40 per share, PM stock offers a yield of nearly 3.2%.

Encouraged by the results, Stifel analyst Matthew Smith reaffirmed a buy rating on PM stock and increased the price target to $186 from $168, noting strong momentum across the board. The analyst said that three growth engines – smoke-free product mix, pricing and volume growth – boosted Philip Morris' Q1 performance and drove a 10% rise in organic revenue, 340 basis points of gross margin expansion and 200 basis points of increase in operating profit margin.

"Each of these engines support durable growth in 2025 and beyond as smoke-free continues to increase as a portion of PMI's portfolio, now over 40% of revenue and gross profit," said Smith.

The analyst expects 170 basis points of operating profit margin expansion in 2025, driven by smoke-free products, including Iqos and Zyn. In particular, Smith noted that Zyn's Q1 U.S. volumes benefited from robust demand and earlier-than-anticipated improvement in supply chain capacity. He now expects 824 million cans for 2025, reflecting a 42% growth. Also, Zyn's capacity is expected to reach 900 million cans this year, supporting potential upside to his estimates, especially in the second half of the year when inventories are expected to normalize.

Smith ranks No. 642 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 15%. See Philip Morris Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

This week's third dividend stock is Texas Instruments (TXN), a semiconductor company that designs and manufactures analog and embedded processing chips for several end markets. The company's first-quarter earnings and revenue easily surpassed Wall Street's estimates, reflecting strong demand for its analog chips despite the threat of tariffs. Also, TXN's guidance for the June quarter was better than the consensus estimate.

Meanwhile, Texas Instruments pays a quarterly dividend of $1.36 per share. At an annualized dividend of $5.44 per share, TXN stock's dividend yield stands at 3.3%.

Reacting to the strong Q1 results, Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated a buy rating on TXN stock with a price target of $248, saying, "We're buyers of TXN post a beat and raise 1Q25 print." He stated that TXN remains a top analog pick for Evercore.

Lipacis contended that while bears will argue that the upside to Texas Instruments' Q1 results and Q2 2025 outlook were due to tariff-driven order pull-ins, his analysis shows that the company's inventories have overcorrected in the supply chain. In fact, numerous checks by his firm indicate that many entities in the supply chain have now taken their inventories well below normal levels.

The analyst expects TXN to be early into the upward revision cycle, given that it was the first large-cap analog company to enter the inventory correction phase. He expects the company to deliver upside surprises through 2025 and into 2026. Additionally, he expects TXN stock to sustain a premium price-earnings multiple as it is exiting its capital expenditure cycle, which will drive its free cash flow per share higher from a trailing 12 months' trough of $1 to $10.30 by 2027.

Lipacis ranks No. 69 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.4%. See Texas Instruments Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

A missile launched by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen on Sunday briefly halted flights and commuter traffic at Israel's main international airport after an impact left a plume of smoke and caused panic among passengers.

The Houthi rebels have been striking Israel throughout the war in Gaza in solidarity with Palestinians. The attack on Ben-Gurion International Airport came hours before top Israeli Cabinet ministers were set to vote on whether to intensify the country's military operations in the Gaza Strip. The army, meanwhile, began calling up thousands of reserves in anticipation of a wider operation in Gaza, officials said.

The missile launch Sunday set off air raid sirens in multiple parts of Israel. A plume of smoke was visible at the airport, according to footage shared by Israeli media. Passengers were heard yelling and scrambling for cover.

It was not immediately clear whether the projectile, which landed in a field near an access road leading to airport parking lots, was the missile or its fragments, or an interceptor from Israel's air defense systems. It left a deep crater in the ground and a nearby road was littered with dirt.

Police said that air, road and rail traffic were halted following the attack. The traffic resumed after about an hour, Israel Airports Authority said. Israel's paramedic service Magen David Adom said four people were lightly wounded.

Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said in a video statement that the group fired a hypersonic ballistic missile at the airport.

Houthi rebels have been firing at Israel since the war with Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, and the missiles have mostly been intercepted, although some have penetrated Israel's missile defense systems, causing damage.

Israel has struck back against the rebels in Yemen and the U.S., Israel's top ally, also launched a campaign of strikes in March against them.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed retribution for the airport attack: "Whoever harms us, we will harm them sevenfold."

An Israeli official said the influential security Cabinet would meet on Sunday evening to vote on plans to expand the fighting. A military official said the country was calling up thousands of reserves. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, in an interview with Israeli Army Radio, said he wanted to see a "powerful" expansion of the war, but did not disclose details as to what the new plans would entail.

"We need to increase the intensity and continue until we achieve total victory. We must win a total victory," he said. He demanded that Israel bomb "the food and electricity supplies" in Gaza.

The plans to escalate fighting in Gaza more than 18 months after the war there erupted come as a humanitarian crisis in the territory deepens.

As part of its efforts to pressure the militant group Hamas to negotiate on Israel's terms for a new ceasefire, Israel in early March halted the entry of goods into Gaza. That has plunged the territory of 2.3 million people into what is believed to be the worst humanitarian crisis since the war began.

An eight-week-long ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that brought a lull in fighting and freed Israeli hostages collapsed in March. Israel resumed its strikes on Gaza on March 18 and has captured swaths of the coastal enclave. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the fighting resumed, according to local health officials.

At least seven Palestinians including two parents and their two children, ages 2 and 4, were killed in Israeli airstrikes in southern and central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medics said. Asked about the strikes, the Israeli military had no direct comment.

The Israeli military said Sunday that two soldiers were killed in combat in Gaza, bringing the number of soldiers killed since fighting resumed in March to six.

The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. Israel says 59 remain in Gaza, although roughly 35 are said to be dead.

Israel's offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children according to Palestinian health officials, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count.

The fighting has displaced more than 90% of Gaza's population, often multiple times. Hunger has been widespread and the shortage of food has set off looting.

Ukraine said it shot down two Russian fighter jets with naval drones, describing it as the "first time in history" the technology had destroyed a crewed combat aircraft.

A Defence Intelligence of Ukraine (GUR) special operations unit said on Saturday that it destroyed a Russian Su-30 fighter jet in the Black Sea on Friday by using a missile launched from a naval drone.

Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the GUR, then told The War Zone that a second Russian Su-30 was also downed by the missiles from the naval drones in the attack. The Su-30 fighter jets are estimated to cost about $50 million per unit.

The GUR shared a video of an aircraft in the sky that appears to have been shot from below, which shows an aircraft-shaped object breaking apart and falling.

The GUR said the strike was carried out by a missile launched from a Magura naval drone platform, which can carry missiles that the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence previously said would target Russian aircraft.

Budanov told The War Zone that Ukraine used the Magura-7 version of the naval drone and that it used AIM-9 Sidewinder infrared-guided air-to-air missiles.

The Su-30 is a multirole fighter that can do both air-to-air and air-to-ground attacks. Ukraine has destroyed others in its fight back against Russia's invasion.

The GUR said the jet on Friday "was engulfed in flames mid-air before crashing into the sea" after the attack, which was done in coordination with the Security Service of Ukraine and the Defence Forces of Ukraine.

It said the strike happened near Russia's Novorossiysk port in Western Russia. Russia previously moved many of its vessels there from Sevastopol, the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian region of Crimea, as Ukraine damaged so many of its vessels there with attacks.

Ukraine has also launched attacks on Novorossiysk.

Ukraine has developed a fleet of naval drones that have menaced Russia's navy.

They, along with Ukraine's other weaponry, have allowed Ukraine to largely neutralize Russia's Black Sea Fleet without having any real navy of its own.

The naval drones have also caused problems for Russia in the skies. Ukraine said in December that it destroyed a Russian helicopter with a naval drone for the first time, saying a Magura was used in that attack too.

A spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Defence did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.

You could call Maulik Suchak something of a résumé expert.

His résumés have gotten him to final-round interviews at Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Atlassian, and led to multiple offers, including at Yelp, Microsoft, SurveyMonkey, and the Magnificent 7 company he's been at for nearly five years out of his 14-year career.

But, as the 34-year-old lead software engineer told Business Insider, "My deep dive into résumés didn't start because I was job hunting — it started because I was building a product."

In 2013, at 23 years old, Suchak co-created a résumé-building platform, CVsIntellect, with another engineer. The idea came from wanting to solve a very real problem; Suchak and his cofounder noticed their peers struggling to craft strong résumés, especially those without access to mentors or design tools.

Their vision was to make the résumé-creation process easier by offering a tool that didn't just generate résumés, but helped guide users toward stronger content and structure. This side project became Suchak's crash course in résumé content.

"I wasn't just writing my own résumé — I was reviewing hundreds of others," he said.

The platform grew rapidly, attracting thousands of users worldwide and surpassing over 100,000 résumés reworked via the site.

"This gave me deep insights into both the content and presentation side of résumés: what stands out, what gets ignored, and how different audiences interpret the same information," he said.

Two years after launching CVsIntellect, while working as a software engineer in India, Suchak leveraged his learnings to finesse his own job-search materials.

"I knew how to write in a way that hiring managers would respond to, because I'd spent so much time thinking like one," Suchak said. Crafting a breakthrough résumé was about storytelling, positioning, and clarity — skills that ultimately helped him first break into Big Tech and later nab a role at his current Magnificent 7 company.

His efforts led to multiple job offers from companies such as Microsoft and Yelp. He accepted the Yelp offer and relocated to San Francisco, California, at the end of 2015.

In just under five years at Yelp, Suchak grew to lead a team of 14 software engineers as an engineering manager. In this capacity, he  gained hiring responsibility, which gave him another foray into résumé review.

He also began mentoring other aspiring engineers. "Whenever someone reaches out for feedback on their résumé, I try my best to help," Suchak said. "Every résumé I read adds to my mental library of patterns — what works and what doesn't, what stands out visually and what falls flat, and how different people articulate their strengths."

Suchak followed his natural curiosity about how people at top companies present their experience. "I've spent a lot of time reading LinkedIn profiles, GitHub READMEs, and personal portfolios to understand how engineers craft their narratives — especially those in roles I admire," he said. 

His research furthered his understanding of the language and structure common to strong résumés for Big Tech roles.

In 2019, Suchak moved to Silicon Valley and began applying to a flurry of Big Tech jobs, including several Magnificent 7 companies.

He reached the final round interviews at Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Atlassian, and SurveyMonkey, again receiving several offers. In 2020, he accepted the job at his current Magnificent 7 company.

He attributes much of this success to the first impression his compelling résumé set. "With my résumé, I not only effectively initiated a lot of connections with recruiters and hiring managers, but I landed a job that I'm really proud of," Suchak said.

Here's the exact résumé that helped Suchak achieve these victories — and five strategies he feels played a major role in ensuring his résumé told a persuasive enough story to open the right doors.

Every bullet point on his résumé included a tangible result — metrics or improvements that demonstrated real impact. This framed his work as meaningful and effective, not just functional.

"I always asked myself, 'What changed because I did this?'" Suchak said. "For example, instead of saying 'Worked on improving Yelp Cash Back sign-up page,' I wrote 'Improved Cash Back sign-up pages with various A/B tests with Python and JS resulted in 2X higher conversion.'"

Suchak treated his résumé like a narrative. In describing the roles he'd held earlier in his career, he focused on smaller-scale project impact; in his more recent roles, he showcased how he led product decisions or mentored others.

"Each role built logically on the previous one, and I highlighted progression — either in scope, skillset, or leadership," he said. "The idea was to show momentum and intentional career moves rather than random hopping around."

When building his résumé platform, Suchak often saw résumés that were three or more pages, filled with every job, internship, or online course candidates had ever done.

But when he realized most recruiters review résumés for less than 10 seconds, he wanted to do it differently.

"Each bullet was one to two lines max, and I avoided buzzwords," he said. "This made it easier for a recruiter or hiring manager to scan quickly and still get a full picture of my strengths."

In Suchak's early career, he spent a lot of time collecting technical certifications that he now feels didn't mean much. Over time, he shifted his strategy to emphasize actual working projects over just any certificate.

"In my résumé, I made sure to link to real-world projects, ideally hosted live or on GitHub," he said. He even mentioned one of his projects in a Magnificent 7 interview, he said, "because it showed initiative, technical depth, and a bit of product thinking."

Suchak has also tried to highlight independence. "I'd done a lot of projects on my own from end-to-end, which my employer now really appreciated," he said.

A "last but not least" job-search principle Suchak believes in is that even the best résumé content can be overlooked if the formatting is messy.

"A readable résumé feels more professional, even before a single word is read," Suchak said.

He opted for clean fonts, consistent spacing, and clear section headers. He also avoided dense blocks of text and added just enough white space to make for a comfortable reading experience.

He even printed his résumé out first to see how it looked on paper before submitting it online.

"Looking back, if I could change anything about the résumé that got me into my Mag 7 job, I'd highlight more personal projects with shorter descriptions of each," he said. "I'd also try to add even more impact and numbers."

While many career experts suggest customizing your résumé for each job and company you apply to, Suchak didn't tweak his résumé at all for the job he ended up landing.

He now recognizes the value in tailoring résumés to the position you want, studying job descriptions, and integrating keywords from them to get past ATS filters.

"This is one I learned the hard way — while I received multiple offers, I also used to get a lot of rejections," he said. "Instead of sending the same generic résumé everywhere, I'd now match my experience to each role," Suchak said.

New York's Letitia James is easily the most aggressive state attorney general in the country when it comes to suing President Donald Trump.

She's on the front lines of 15 legal actions brought by coalitions of Democratic AGs, all seeking to block executive orders and DOGE cuts, Her $454 million fraud verdict against Trump and his real estate company remains on appeal in Manhattan.

But James' most daring excursion into Trumpworld may be one she has yet to formally announce.

It's an ongoing inquiry into potential insider trading by the president's inner circle, centered on last month's markets-roiling tariff policies.

James' so-called inquiry — the formal name for a kind of probe that falls short of a full-blown investigation — has rounded its second month, an AG spokesman confirmed to Business Insider, declining to divulge details beyond saying the office is "looking at" possible insider trading.

What would an inquiry involve? And, more importantly, what are its odds?

Business Insider asked a half-dozen legal experts, including three former high-level financial-fraud prosecutors from the New York AG's office.

Opinions range wildly.

Some pointed to the perennial concerns over insider trading by members of Congress. They called James' inquiry a proper, even necessary, exercise of the power vested in an attorney general whose Manhattan office sits three blocks north of the Stock Exchange.

Others called her inquiry a politically motivated boondoggle that's doomed to fail. "This is a story of politics, not a story of law," said Richard Epstein, a law professor at New York University.

But there was unanimity on two points. Proving insider trading is notoriously difficult. And whatever is happening behind the scenes is unprecedented.

"There's been nothing like this," said Manhattan attorney Armen Morian, a former financial crimes prosecutor for the New York AG's office who helped defend Trump during James' fraud case.

The inquiry is empowered by New York's Martin Act, a 104-year-old statute that gives state attorneys general extraordinary powers to police Wall Street.

Legal experts call the Martin Act the most powerful state securities-fraud law in the country. It allows the AG to issue subpoenas, grill suspects under oath, and file civil lawsuits or criminal charges.

In a 2018 essay, Epstein called the Martin Act "an 800-pound gorilla," a term he said he still stands by.

It prosecutes securities and real estate frauds and is used only rarely for insider trading, which is the illegal profiting off of stock tips not available to the public.

Legal experts and three veterans of the AG's office who have brought prosecutions under the Martin Act say they've never heard of it being used to investigate insider tips involving government policy, in this case, Trump's on-and-off tariffs.

The novelty of James' inquiry does not, in itself, doom her effort, said a former financial crimes prosecutor who asked not to be named, citing work constraints against speaking to the press.

"There is a body of Martin Act insider trading law — just not on these exact facts — that has been developed over decades," the former prosecutor said. "And remember, the facts of every case are always novel."

An "inquiry" is what the New York AG's office calls the earliest stage of a probe — before subpoenas go out, explained former Executive Attorney General Manisha M. Sheth. Now a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Sheth oversaw the AG's Division of Economic Justice.

Securities inquiries can be sparked by whistleblower tips or by allegations that surface publicly in the press or a lawsuit, she told BI.

They are handled by the state investor protection bureau, one of the six divisions Sheth once supervised, she said. There, prosecutors working with the AGs' research analysts and data scientists would begin by reviewing raw trading data, she said. They'll look for suspicious patterns.

Were there spikes in trading, for instance, on April 9, in the hours before Trump posted on Truth Social, "THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!" triggering a market upswing?

At some point, the bureau would send out a flutter of "inquiry letters," authorized by the bureau's chief or deputy chief and signed by the assistant attorney general handling the matter, Sheth said.

"Such letters can ask for documents, data, or information," she said. "Sometimes the recipient of an inquiry letter may volunteer to meet with the office to provide the requested information."

Cooperating at this early stage is completely voluntary. If a case advances to the point that subpoenas are issued, an inquiry will have graduated to an investigation, Sheth said.

"I do think it's going to start with using trading data to show that no reasonable person would have engaged in these trades without that non-public information," said Anthony Capozzolo, a former federal and state prosecutor.

"You're going to want to, at the least, build an initial case that shows it's very likely that the only motivating factor for these trades was this allegedly inside information."

Compiling trading data will be tougher these days, predicted Capozzolo, a partner at Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss in Manhattan and a former federal and state-level prosecutor.

Pre-Trump, the AG would routinely and easily ask the Securities and Exchange Commission for trading data that's not already publicly available.

"Now, the SEC is controlled by the Trump administration, and he could potentially instruct the SEC not to cooperate," leading to a subpoena battle, Capozzolo predicted.

Identifying suspicious-seeming trading patterns is only the beginning, legal experts said.

Say, solely as a hypothetical, that a Trump insider reaped a small fortune by buying the dip in Apple stock right before Trump announced the tariff carve-out for electronics from China that sent the stock soaring.

That's not enough to prove insider trading, legal experts said. For that, James would need witnesses willing to testify that specific investments were prompted by improper insider tips.

"They try to force people to tell them who was present in rooms," Capozzolo said of prosecutors. "But the difficulty is a lot of these things may have happened in the presence of very upper-level Trump and MAGA acolytes."

And anyone in Trump's circle would certainly fight an inquiry letter or subpoena — and do so loudly.

"You'll see an immediate challenge," said Morian, who helped prosecute AIG CEO Hank Greenberg in the longest Martin Act case in the AG's history.

"It'll be lock and load. The minute any subpoena goes out, I would immediately intervene if I were in the Justice Department, and say 'Nope. Can't do it. Sorry.'"

Suing, charging, or subpoenaing Trump is a non-starter, given executive privilege and presidential immunity, which bars prosecution for official acts, Morian said. (He predicts presidential immunity would extend to civil cases as well someday, "If that ever gets to the Supreme Court.")

State AG subpoenas issued to members of the executive branch — cabinet members and the like — could also be challenged on executive privilege grounds. And investigating the stock trades of members of Congress would result in challenges as well, Morian predicted.

"If you overreach too far, you could easily see a private litigant taking this up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court limiting the jurisdiction of state attorneys general in ways we've never seen before," he said.

James is being probed by the DOJ for alleged mortgage fraud, an allegation she has called baseless and which her attorney, Abbe Lowell, has called "improper political retribution," according to CBS.

Should her insider-trading inquiry advance, James, a Democrat who campaigned for AG on a promise of investigating Trump, would herself would face accusations of political retribution and bias.

Over the years, Trump has decried James' investigations into his finances and business as baseless, "racist," and part of a "political witch hunt." A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on James' tariff-trade inquiry on Friday.

Then there is the inherent difficulty of proving insider trading — of teasing out any illegality from the chaos of sudden, trillion-dollar market swings.

"There's a huge amount of market turmoil whenever there's a major tariff initiative," said Epstein.

How can anyone call it insider trading if thousands of investors are making similar trades for benign reasons, based on hunches, past experience, or dumb luck, he asked.

"When the markets are this volatile, people make and lose money second to second, for any number of reasons," agreed Morian.

"There are so many contingent variables," he added. "How do you discern the signal from the noise, to prove your case?"

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett stunned the audience at his annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday when he announced his plan to resign at year's end after a nearly six-decade run as the leader of the trillion-dollar empire.

Reactions have poured in from business leaders who know and admire the billionaire investor. One person who is more familiar with Buffett's life than most is Alice Schroeder, a journalist who wrote the 2008 bestselling biography of Buffett, "The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," after spending a decade getting to know him and his family.

She spoke with Business Insider about the iconic investor's legacy amid news of his planned resignation.

This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

First things first — what's your initial reaction to the news? How are you feeling?

My initial reaction is: For heaven's sake, he deserves to retire at 94 years old from the day-to-day responsibilities of being a CEO, which are quite considerable. It's amazing that he has kept that role until now. I'm sure he's going to remain involved and will be consulted by those who want his advice — and who wouldn't want his advice? But I think it's a great move on his part, and I hope he enjoys a very well-earned retirement.

Well-earned indeed. Have you been in contact recently? Was this something you knew was on the horizon?

I have not been in contact with him in a few years, not because of any issue, but because he's at an age where he's not chit-chatting on the phone with everybody he knows all the time. But I was not surprised. I knew that he would remain CEO as long as he could, but he would not remain CEO beyond a certain point where he either wasn't enjoying having that responsibility, or for any other reason — I'm not going to speculate about anything related to his health because I don't know enough, but anybody at age 94 has got some things going on. So this day was going to come sooner or later.

What do you think this means for the future of Berkshire Hathaway?

I've been thinking about this since Warren was in his 60s because he's literally not replaceable, and so, of course, Berkshire Hathaway will be different. He has talked about the investment results of his deputies not being as stellar, perhaps, as his earlier record. In addition, Greg Abel obviously has his own style of leadership and management, and it is not Warren's style.

That said, I have never believed Berkshire's decentralized leadership style would survive Warren stepping down as CEO. Warren has been very candid in saying: Don't expect the company's results to be that much better — or necessarily any better — than the market as a whole over the long term after he's gone. Well, the long term has arrived, and now a lot of things are going to change.

I think Berkshire has tremendous advantages. It's got internal diversification, it's got strong, stable businesses. Those will obviously survive. And I think he will achieve the one goal that he told me he had a long time ago, which is that he constructed it to survive and still be a viable, reasonable, successful company for 30 years after he's no longer running it. So I think those who own the stock should not be worried because the business side could be almost put on autopilot, but there's a certain element of magic that is departing now, of course.

Are there any extenuating circumstances you see that could disrupt that stability? Or do you think he's built something steady that is going to survive this moment of economic turmoil and well into the future?

Warren's business career began during the Great Depression when he was a child and has spanned Vietnam, various financial crises, and the pandemic. He has done everything possible to construct a robust business that could survive what I would call normally foreseeable events. Can you think of a black swan that might disrupt the business? Sure, but they'd be very one-off scenarios, and I think you'd have to go many standard deviations away from even extreme outcomes for that to happen.

What about advice for Buffett's likely successor, Greg Abel? Are there any things that you think that Warren might or might not say to him, or things that you would advise him to do as he steps into these shoes?

I think it would be pretty presumptuous for me to give advice that Warren Buffett hasn't given, but with that caveat, his greatest focus for his successor has always been that his successor would allocate capital wisely, not go on a merger spree, overpay for other businesses, start divesting businesses, or repurchase stock at excessive valuations. I believe he has actually hammered that into people's heads, and it's unlikely to happen.

With that said, Berkshire has been, for some time, generating much more capital than it can use. So I think that the possibility of a dividend could be there under someone other than Warren. But I wouldn't expect Berkshire to change its approach to managing risk or asset liability management or anything like that.

Do you think a dividend might be a short-term play to reassure investors after his departure?

I don't think a dividend will be announced in the short term. I think that it will go from being absolutely ruled out to being potentially on the table at some point. But what I think will steady investors is seeing that nothing remarkable happens without Warren in the CEO role, because there is a magic to him and the things that he says, of course, and there will be a reaction to him not being in the day-to-day role. So we'll have to go through a period where he's not in the day-to-day role and see that the businesses actually are robust. You can't predict how investors will react, and I do know that most investors would agree that he's irreplaceable, but we also have known that this was coming for a long time as he's gotten older, so hopefully, people are prepared.

How long do you think it'll take for that confidence to return?

Right now, predicting anything in the market would be foolish. Berkshire would be as affected as any other business by things like tariffs or the fact that the United States has changed its stance on dealing with the rest of the world. So I don't want to predict anything.

Do you think the political environment played a role in his decision to step down in this timeframe?

I mean, he's 94 — it's reasonable for him to step down. I do not want people to think that the political environment is the reason. If it were, he probably would have said so, because he's pretty straightforward about his views on macroeconomics. And if that truly was a major factor, I think he would have identified it.

Looking back at your relationship with him, what lessons did he share with you that you think of now, in light of him taking this step?

I learned almost everything I know about dealing with people, managing people, and negotiating from him, including in my personal life. I credit him with making a major change in my marriage, and I'm now very happily married to my second husband, and that is directly, directly due to Warren Buffett.

I don't think I've ever told this story, but when I got married to my second husband, he had veto power over who I chose. That's how much I trust his judgment about people. I was happy to give him veto power. Thankfully, he liked David.

He is amazing at dealing with people, but there are also the timeless kinds of things that he has hammered home over and over: what makes a good business, how to compare two businesses and know which one is better, how to manage risk personally in your portfolio.

Do you have a favorite Buffett-ism, either personally or something he's shared with the world, that particularly resonates with you?

One thing that he has said to me, in a number of different ways, is that if you are talking to someone, and you say 99 things about them that are positive, and throw in one small criticism, the only thing they'll remember is the criticism — and that's how he manages people. I did not really understand that until I spent so much time with him, but I've seen it since in life, over and over, that you really have to give undiluted praise if you want people to feel it, and if you have something negative to say, tell them privately.

I know you mentioned you haven't been in touch in a while, but have you reached out since you heard the news?

I haven't yet, but I plan to write him a letter. He enjoys receiving mail; he particularly appreciates it, and I know he keeps it. You attract a lot of correspondence if you're as famous as he is, and, of course, some people are unhinged. In fact, that was one of the most important things that he taught me: Being both rich and famous is a terrible curse. You can't trust anybody, you have no privacy, you can't go anywhere without being interrupted, and it really disrupts your life — but if you want to really say 'here's what you've meant to me,' then the best way for Warren is to send a letter.

What else should people know about him?

He's always wanted his legacy to be as a teacher. I think his shareholder letters, all the amazing quotes and stories that are in my book, or things other people have written about him, those are his body of work, and his teachings will have an enduring value. He initially started out wanting to teach investors, but he increasingly branched into the personal, how to live your life — you don't want to wind up being somebody that, if you had a heart attack while you were giving a speech and fell off the stage, nobody would call 911, and he told me about people he knew that were in that situation. So I think he shared lots of lessons like that in terms of deciding what's important. If you really look at it, he's spent almost his whole life teaching people, so I think that will be his greatest legacy.

Texas has a brand new city, and its name is Starbase.

A vote Saturday to decide whether to turn part of south Texas into a new city centered around Elon Musk's SpaceX delivered a victory to the tech billionaire and his rocket company. As expected, the measure passed with broad support, paving the way for a newly incorporated city made up almost exclusively of SpaceX employees and people connected to the company.

The initial vote tally was 173 in favor of incorporation and 4 against; only 143 votes were needed for the measure to pass.

"It's officially statistically impossible for the measure to fail," Cameron County Elections Administrator Remi Garza said Saturday night. "Cameron County is about to have a new city."

Now that the vote has passed, commissioners in the county will canvass the results within two weeks, Garza said. A judge will then assign an order declaring the results of the election and the official incorporation of the new city.

The new city of Starbase covers about 1½ square miles at the southern tip of Texas, a coastal spot nestled against the Mexico border. The area is home to SpaceX headquarters, and it's where the company builds its boosters and engines and launches its huge Starship rocket on test flights.

The ballot result was a much-needed win for Musk, who has faced widespread backlash over the past few months for his involvement with President Donald Trump's administration. Musk was installed as chief of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and oversaw sweeping layoffs and cuts across federal agencies.

In response, protests against Musk erupted around the country and profits plummeted at the billionaire's electric car company, Tesla.

Now, SpaceX will have the company town that Musk first publicly proposed in 2021.

In addition to incorporating the new city, Saturday's election also selected Starbase's first mayor — Bobby Pedden — and two city commissioners — Jordan Buss and Jenna Petrzelka. The candidates for all three positions ran unopposed, and all three are employees of SpaceX.

There were 283 people eligible to cast ballots in Saturday's Cameron County special election, according to county election records. Eligibility was determined based on if a resident's home would fall within the boundaries of the proposed new city.

Neither SpaceX nor Musk has detailed the purpose of incorporating a city around the rocket company's operations. There has been speculation, however, that having greater municipal control of the area could ease some of the bureaucracy and restrictions around SpaceX's tests and rocket launches.

At the moment, SpaceX must obtain permission from authorities in Cameron County to close a highway and shut down public access to Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park to keep people safe during rocket launches.

The frequent closures have contributed to legal complaints against SpaceX, and have drawn protests from local residents and activists, including the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas, the South Texas Environmental Justice Network and Border Workers United, as reported by CNBC.

Now that SpaceX operates within the newly incorporated city of Starbase, things may soon change — though perhaps not without resistance.

"Right now that authority lies solely within Cameron County and my office, and we think that we've proven to be good collaborators and partners with SpaceX in their operations and also in making sure and providing enough notice and public access to Boca Chica Beach," Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino told NBC News.

Trevino said any changes to the established procedures would be unnecessary.

"If it's not broken, it doesn't need to be fixed," he said

Singapore's ruling People's Action Party returned to power in a landslide victory, handing the city-state's governance once again to Lawrence Wong as prime minister at a time when trade turmoil has rocked the globe. The PAP bagged 87 seats in the 97-seat parliament, while the main opposition Workers Party held on to its 10 seats in the country's 14th general election that saw a record-low turnout of 92.47%, according to domestic media. Voting in Singapore is compulsory for citizens above 21.

Votes were cast for 92 seats, after the PAP won five seats in a walkover on Nomination Day on April 23.

The ruling party also increased its vote share, garnering 65.57% of the national vote compared to the 61.2% in the 2020 election.

This election was Wong's first as prime minister, and was dominated by cost of living issues, jobs and economic growth, according to local media outlet CNA. Wong is the first PAP leader to have improved the party's vote share in his first election. The PAP's vote share fell in the 1991 and 2006 elections, when Singapore saw a change in prime minister in 1990 and 2004. 

Wong, who is also finance minister, took over from Lee Hsien Loong in May 2024. Lee currently serves as Senior Minister in Wong's cabinet.

The PAP has ruled Singapore since 1959, when the city-state under the British gained full self-government. Singapore became independent in 1965.Speaking after the election, Wong said that he was "deeply humbled and grateful for the results," adding that "Singaporeans have given the PAP a clear and strong mandate to govern."The results will put Singapore in a better position to face this turbulent world. Many are watching the elections closely, whether it's international media, investors or foreign governments, they will have taken note of tonight's results. It's a clear signal of trust, stability and confidence in your government."

Early Sunday morning, the U.S. State Department congratulated Wong on the PAP's victory, saying it looks forward to working closely with the new government to strengthen economic growth and defense ties. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also said in a post on X that the EU valued its "excellent cooperation" with Singapore. 

"Our partnership is deepening, in trade and investment, and also defence, security, innovation," she added.

The election also comes as Singapore grapples with slowing economic growth and an uncertain trade situation. 

In April, Singapore had downgraded its GDP growth forecast to 0%-2%, with the country's monetary authority easing policy twice this year.First-quarter GDP for the country came in lower than expected, at 3.8%. Wong had warned earlier this year that Singapore might go into a recession in 2025, and had formed a task force led by Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong in April to help businesses and workers navigate the immediate uncertainties arising from U.S. tariffs and related global developments. 

Gan held a call with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last month. Singapore is seeking concessions for pharmaceutical exports to the U.S., while also working with Washington to strengthen export controls for high-end AI chips, Gan said following the meeting.

He also said Lutnick conveyed that the 10% baseline tariff imposed by the Trump administration in early April was an "umbrella," and not likely subject to negotiation.

Singapore was hit with the 10% tariff, despite having a trade deficit with the U.S. and a free trade agreement since 2004.

Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, Kentucky, in a thrilling fight to the finish line on Saturday to capture the first leg of U.S. thoroughbred racing's famed Triple Crown.

The bay colt thrived in the wet and sloppy conditions at Churchill Downs to finish the 1-1/4-mile race in two minutes and 2.31 seconds, beating the heavy favorite Journalism down the final straight.

Journalism finished about a length behind while Baeza was third.

The race marked famed trainer Bob Baffert's first trip to the derby after a three-year ban from the track. Churchill Downs had suspended him after his horse, Medina Spirit, failed a drugs test after winning the 2021 Kentucky Derby.

His horse, Citizen Bull, took the early lead from the pole position, hanging on through much of the race as a dense chase pack followed.

Sovereignty and Journalism made their move at the same time, navigating around the outside on the final turn, battling nose-to-nose through the final 16th of a mile before Sovereignty pulled away in the final moments.

"I saw him gearing up when he left the half-mile pole, he started to pick up his momentum, and I lost him a little bit," trainer Bill Mott said in televised remarks. "He made up a lot of ground in a hurry."

Mott previously trained Country House, who won the derby in 2019 when Maximum Security became the first horse in the history of the race to be disqualified after crossing the line first.

It was the first Kentucky Derby win for jockey Junior Alvarado, who deftly navigated through the pack from the unenviable 18th post position and said he never doubted the horse he called "Mr. Mud" would thrive in the mucky conditions.

"I thought I had a great chance," said Alvarado, who was sidelined with a reported fracture in his shoulder only five weeks ago.

"I was so confident the whole way."

Baeza, who drew in after another Baffert-trained horse, Rodriguez, scratched on Thursday, sneaked into third as jockey Hector Berrios made a gutsy last minute move.

In the crypto market, bold predictions aren't just talk - they're backed by real dollars, often through option plays that resemble lottery tickets offering outsized upside for relatively small costs.

The stand-out as of writing is the Deribit-listed $300,000 strike bitcoin call option expiring on June 26. Theoretically, this call is a bet that BTC's spot price will triple to over $300,000 by the end of the first half of the year.

Over 5,000 contracts were active in the June $300K call at press time, with a notional open interest of $484 million. That makes it the second-most popular option bet in the crucial June expiry, trailing only the $110K call.

Deribit is the world's leading crypto options exchange, accounting for over 75% of the global options activity. On Deribit, one options contract represents 1 BTC. Quarterly expiries, such as the one due on June 26, drive heightened market activity and volatility, with traders using these deadlines to hedge positions, lock in gains, or speculate on the next price moves.

"Perhaps, people like buying lottery tickets. As evidenced by the call skew, there are always folks that want the hyperinflation hedge," Spencer Hallarn, a derivatives trader at crypto market maker GSR, said, explaining the high open interest in the so-called out-of-the-money (OTM) call at the $300K strike.

Deep OTM calls, also called wings, require a large move in the underlying asset's price to become profitable and, hence, are significantly cheaper compared to those closer to or below the asset's going market rate. However, the payoff is huge if the market rallies, which makes them similar to buying lottery tickets with slim odds but potential for a big payout.

Deribit's BTC options market has experienced similar flows during previous bull cycles, but those bets rarely gained enough popularity to rank as the second-most preferred play in quarterly expiries.

The chart shows that the June 26 expiry is the largest among all settlements due this year, and the $300K call has the second-highest open interest buildup in the June expiry options. 

Explaining the chunky notional open interest in the $300K call, GSR's Trader Simranjeet Singh said, "I suspect this is mostly an accumulation of relatively cheap wings betting on broader U.S. reg narrative being pro-crypto and the 'wingy possibility' (no pun intended) of a BTC strategic reserve that was punted around at the start of the administration."

On Friday, Senator Cynthia Lummis said in a speech that she's "particularly pleased with President Trump's support of her BITCOIN Act.

"The BITCOIN Act is the only solution to our nation's $36T debt. I'm grateful for a forward-thinking president who not only recognizes this, but acts on it," Lummis said on X.

According to Amberdata's Director of Derivatives, notable selling in the $300K call expiring on June 26 occurred in April as part of the covered call strategy, which traders use to generate additional yield on top of their spot market holdings.

"My thought is that the selling volume on April 23 came from traders generating income against a long position," Magadini told CoinDesk. "Each option sold for about $60 at 100% implied volatility."

Selling higher strike OTM call options and collecting premium while holding a long position in the spot market is a popular yield-generating strategy in both crypto and traditional markets.

In a significant update to the protocol's long-term roadmap, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has called for the simplification of ETH's base protocol to make the network more efficient and resilient.

In a May 3rd blog post titled “Simplifying the L1,” Buterin shared his perspective on the need to simplify the Ethereum network, stating that simplicity is an important—but easy to undervalue—aspect of scalability and resilience. The crypto founder went on to applaud how beautifully simple the Bitcoin blockchain is.

Buterin said:

Even a smart high school student is capable of fully wrapping their head around and understanding the Bitcoin protocol. A programmer is capable of writing a client as a hobby project.



According to Buterin, protocol simplicity offers a variety of benefits that are crucial to ensuring that blockchain networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, remain a credibly neutral and globally trusted base layer. Meanwhile, it also reduces infrastructure costs, long-term maintenance expenses, and risks of bugs and malicious attacks.

In the blog post, Buterin also described how the Ethereum network can become close to as simple as Bitcoin in five years. According to the co-founder, one of the three ways of achieving this simplicity is through a more optimal consensus layer, with most notably a 3-slot finality redesign.

Furthermore, Buterin mentioned the simplification of the execution layer, complaining about how the complexity of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has unnecessarily increased. To fix this, the crypto co-founder proposed replacing the EVM with a new minimal virtual machine (like RISC-V).

The co-founder noted:

The biggest challenge with meaningfully simplifying (or even improving without complexifying) any part of the EVM is how to balance accomplishing the desired goals with preserving backwards compatibility for existing applications.

Finally, Buterin outlined that the third and “most easily underrated” way of enhancing protocol simplicity is to share one standard across different parts of the protocol. “There is typically very little or no benefit to using different protocols to do the same thing in different places,” the Ethereum co-founder said. 

Buterin concluded that simplicity is extremely similar to decentralization, which are both requisite in achieving resilience in blockchains. 

While Buterin will be looking to make adjustments to the Ethereum network, ETH investors will hope that these enhancements will translate to the value of the Ether token. ETH's performance has been quite underwhelming so far in 2025, registering four red months to start the year.

As of this writing, the price of Ether stands around $1,817, reflecting a 1.6% decline in the past 24 hours. It is worth mentioning that the Ethereum price has enjoyed some bullish momentum in the past two weeks, with its value increasing by nearly 15% in that period.

In a ten-year-old interview with the Guardian, Elden Ring director and creator Hidetaka Miyazaki credited the early-2000s PlayStation 2 game Ico as having an incredible impact on his life, ultimately swaying him to pursue a career in video game development. Ico was a revolutionary concept that pushed the boundaries of what was possible with the available technology at the time. It's also the spiritual predecessor to The Guardian & Shadow of the Colossus, all of which are the brainchildren of legendary director Fumito Ueda of GenDesign studios.

If you're old enough to have played Ico back in 2001, you likely haven't forgotten its beautifully somber tone and minimalist approach to puzzle-platforming that felt completely authentic and original. If you never had the chance to play Ico, however, you're in luck — the game is actually available to stream on PS Plus Premium right now. Ico helped Miyazaki see what video games could be, and the best way to understand why it had such a profound impact on him is to go play Ico yourself.

In a decade-old interview with The Guardian, FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki claimed that Ico was one of the games that made him want to create video games of his own, largely due to Ico's innovative gameplay and simple yet powerful storytelling. These features were a core motivator behind Miyazaki's development of Dark Souls, ultimately spawning the entire Soulsborne genre that encompasses games like Bloodborne and Elden Ring, among others.

“That game awoke me to the possibilities of the medium. I wanted to make one myself.” - Hidetaka Miyazaki

In a 20th anniversary celebration of Ico by the Japanese publication Famitsu, Miyazaki elaborated on his affection for the game. As shared in translation by VGC, Miyazaki describes Ico as "a beautiful, untold experience and story that I had never imagined [...] I was quietly moved and silent."

After seeing the leaked image of the final Nightfarers in Elden Ring Nightreign, I'm convinced the Executor will be a Samurai archetype.

After reading through these old interviews, I felt an urge to replay Ico, and it turns out that it's available to stream on PS Plus with a Premium subscription. Despite its crude early-PlayStation graphics, Ico is still a mesmerizing and enjoyable experience. Aside from being a total nostalgia trip, I started paying more attention to the details of Ico that reminded me of Miyazaki's work.

The influence is glaringly obvious as soon as you get started. The world of Ico is a somber and mysterious one, and its gameplay feels like an early version of what the Soulsborne genre would eventually become. If you want to know what sparked Miyazaki's imagination, you can get a taste of that in the very early parts of Ico, from the very moment you take the princess's hand and venture into the castle depths.

Ico's premise is a simple yet incredibly successful one that hinges on an age-old story trope: a hero saves the princess from a castle. In Ico, a young horned boy named Ico helps free a princess named Yorda from her evil mother, the Queen, who plans to use Yorda to become immortal. What ensues is a 3D puzzle-platforming adventure through a mystical and labyrinthine castle full of all sorts of twists, turns, ominous ghost enemies, and even obnoxious flying enemies like those found throughout the Soulsborne universe.

You'll be able to unlock new cosmetics for each character in Elden Ring Nightreign, including some iconic outfits from previous FromSoftare games.

Gameplay in Ico is very reminiscent of what you experience in Dark Souls and its ilk, particularly when it comes to some of the platformer elements, like traversing narrow high-beams in the rafters, extra-long ladders between levels, and especially how the player's actions influence the environment and open up shortcuts or new pathways. There's even an epic final boss battle that likely inspired some of the most beloved boss fights from Miyazaki's work.

Ico's influence likely extends to many modern juggernauts in the industry.

Ico's influence can be seen in a ton of modern games outside the Soulsborne genre as well, and the game has supposedly influenced the likes of Neil Druckmann, director of The Last of Us Part 1 & 2, and was even beloved by the legend himself, Masahiro Sakurai, creator of Super Smash Bros. Ico's influence likely extends to many modern juggernauts in the industry as well, given its unique and innovative use of the limited hardware power and technology available at the time.

I'd highly recommend giving Ico a try if you haven't had the chance to play it. For those looking beyond PS Plus, its successors are also worth checking out. If you haven't had the chance to play either The Last Guardian or Shadow of the Colossus, you can get both of them for $20 on the PlayStation Store. The real question I have about Team Ico's games is whether they're planning any new remasters, and I think the answer to that might be coming very soon.

Shadow of the Colossus creator Fumito Ueda and his team at GenDesign issues yet another tease concerning their next big project.

When Shadow of the Colossus launched back in 2006, GenDESIGN also re-released Ico, and a PS3 remaster was eventually released in 2011. The Last Guardian released in late 2016, and a remake of Shadow of the Colossus by Bluepoint Games followed 14 months later. And as GenDESIGN's next project is fast-approaching, I'm very hopeful we will see an announcement about re-releases, remasters, or remakes in the coming months.

I'll be surprised if we don't see some sort of remake or remaster for one or even all three of these games as a bundled promo around the time of GenDESIGN's next major release, currently referred to as "Project Robot." This project has been rumored for some time and was officially teased during the 2024 Game Awards with no name or major information. The new project promises to carry on with the studio's aesthetic traditions, and it will likely be another cult classic hit for fans of Ico and the studio's other major projects.

The influence that Ico had on innovators such as Miyazaki is undeniable, and with so many different remasters and remakes in the works across all genres, it would be a major missed opportunity for Sony not to jump in and give fans updated versions of these classics. I'm setting my expectations low, but getting access to remasters of Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Last Guardian would make me even more excited to invest in the upcoming "Project Robot."

If you're a fan of Elden Ring and Miyazaki's other major hits, and you want some insight as to where his unique style originated, you should definitely check out the work of Fumito Ueda and GenDESIGN, including Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Guardian. These games are distinctly different from Soulsborne epics, but the ambiance, tone, settings, themes, and certain aspects of gameplay have some definite overlap that you'll find familiar, entertaining, and every bit as beautiful.

Oblivion Remastered has raised some questions about The Elder Scrolls 6, but ES6 can't follow Oblivion's lead if it wants Skyrim's success. 

Once you're ready to settle down in Oblivion Remastered, there are several options to choose from, ranging from dark shacks to luxury castles.

One item in Act 1 has a secret purpose which alludes to Shadowheart's backstory with Shar and changes a familiar cutscene in Baldur's Gate 3.

Borderlands 4 is doing a lot right, but it is carrying over one of the worst aspects of the series when it should have finally fixed it.

Grand Theft Auto 6's delay may seem like terrible news, especially for fans, but it is actually the best thing that could have happened in 2025.

Putting together the best party build for your characters in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 can be a little complicated with so many skills and weapons. 

DLC has been a consistent part of the Borderlands franchise, and it looks like Borderlands 4 may be featuring my favorite kind of new content.

Central Asia is quickly becoming one of the most interesting regions for crypto adoption.

Kyrgyzstan has partnered with Binance to roll out crypto payments across the country, letting people pay with digital assets in real life.

Kazakhstan is working on a national stablecoin settlement system linked to its exchange, while the Kyrgyz central bank has granted legal status to its CBDC prototype and begun testing.

As governments pivot toward digital solutions, the door is wide open for alternative stablecoins that actually serve the people. That's where SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) comes in – a community-driven project that's quietly becoming one of the best altcoins to watch.

Central Asia is rapidly emerging as a hotbed for crypto innovation, with governments embracing digital finance at a pace that's catching global attention.

In Kyrgyzstan, Binance has launched a new crypto payments system through a partnership with local fintech provider O!Money.



This move allows everyday people to make purchases in cryptocurrency at a growing number of retail locations, marking a significant step toward mainstream adoption.

Meanwhile, Kazakhstan is moving forward with plans to integrate a stablecoin settlement system into its national stock exchange. The idea is to modernize financial infrastructure by enabling faster, blockchain-based transactions – a sharp contrast to the traditional systems that dominate much of the region.

This positions the country among the early adopters exploring sovereign digital currencies.

Together, these initiatives show a clear trend: Central Asia isn't just experimenting with crypto – it's laying down a foundation for digital finance at scale.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) isn't just another new crypto project floating in the DeFi sea – it's the backbone of a growing Web3 ecosystem built for the next generation of fans.

At its core, $SUBBD fuses AI-powered content creation, crypto staking, and token-fueled fan experiences into one all-in-one platform. No middlemen. No clunky payment processors.

The token powers everything from premium content access and instant crypto tipping, to early access to beta features and exclusive creator drops.

It also boasts staking rewards – 20% APY during presale – and real-time creator payments in fiat or crypto.
Right now, you can buy $SUBBD for $0.055325, and it has already raised over $300K in its presale.



Price forecasts suggest it could hit $0.08 to $0.301 in 2025, and climb as high as $2.50 by 2030 if adoption scales. Not bad for a token that hasn't even launched on major exchanges yet.

Unlike meme coins that ride hype cycles like emotional rollercoasters, $SUBBD is built to last – and built to reward participation, not speculation. In a market full of fluff, that's worth paying attention to.

In regions like Central Asia, where trust in banks is shaky and cross-border money movement is still stuck in the stone age, $SUBBD offers something refreshingly modern.

It's fast, permissionless, and built for the real world, not just DeFi whales and Discord day traders.

$SUBBD is already delivering that. Through instant, low-fee payments, followers can tip creators, unlock content, and subscribe without needing a bank account or a currency exchange. It's crypto that works like cash, only smarter.



And because it's community-owned, $SUBBD doesn't suffer from the same risks as corporate-controlled stablecoins.

There's no centralized vault, no board of directors, and no algorithmic house of cards ready to collapse. Just a network of everyday people shaping the future of how we consume and support digital content.

If you're looking for new crypto projects with actual substance – and not just the latest pump-and-dump – $SUBBD is one of the best altcoins to keep on your radar.

The global financial landscape is evolving – and Central Asia is quickly becoming a blueprint for what comes next.

As governments, businesses, and everyday users embrace crypto-powered solutions, it's clear that the old system is running out of road.

If you're watching this shift and wondering where it's all headed, SUBBD Token offers a glimpse of the future. It's not just another token – it's the engine behind a new kind of digital experience that puts people, not institutions, in control.

But as always, don't forget to do your own research (DYOR) before investing into crypto.

According to @Cobie on Twitter, while many cryptocurrency market participants claim their primary interest is technology, trading data and investment flows show most capital is directed toward speculative assets rather than foundational blockchain tech projects (source: @Cobie, Twitter). This trend highlights a disconnect that traders should consider when evaluating project fundamentals versus token performance, as market momentum often favors highly volatile, speculative coins over genuine technological innovation.

Adopting Michael Saylor's strategy of buying for the balance sheet has clearly taken off among many publicly traded firms, substantially enriching their stock prices and shareholders. 

But what does it mean for the future of the bitcoin price? NYDIG Research crunched the numbers, and the results are striking. 

"If we apply a 10x "money multiplier"—a rule of thumb reflecting the historical impact of new capital on bitcoin's market cap—and divide by the total supply of bitcoin, we arrive at a rough estimate of the potential price impact: a nearly $42,000 increase per bitcoin," NYDIG said in a research report. 

To reach this conclusion, the analysts at NYDIG reviewed Strategy (MSTR), Metaplanet (3350), Twenty One (CEP), and Semler Scientific's (SMLR) cumulative equity valuation since they adopted the bitcoin buying strategy. This gave the analysts an outline of how much money they could theoretically raise by issuing shares at current stock prices to buy more bitcoin. 

If this analysis comes true, the projected price is nearly a 44% increase from the current spot price of $96,000 per bitcoin. If capitalized, Wall Street money managers perhaps wouldn't mind showing this PnL chart to their clients, especially given the current volatility and uncertainty in the market. 

"The implication is clear: this 'dry powder' in the form of issuance capacity could have a significant upward effect on bitcoin's price," NYDIG Research said. 

Bitcoin's limited supply also bodes well for the analysis. Publicly-traded companies already hold 3.63% of bitcoin's total supply, with the lion's share of those coins being held by Strategy. Adding private company and government holdings, the total is at 7.48% according to BitcoinTreasuries data.

Demand could also grow further in the near future if the U.S. government finds “budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin” for its strategic bitcoin reserve.

Shiba Inu has finally cleared its April range, supported by a MACD crossover and rising money flow, but it still needs to hold above $0.000015 to keep the SHIB bullish signal alive. Dogecoin's price prediction is also leaning bullish, with DOGE pushing against a descending resistance line near $0.175.

While SHIB and DOGE battle resistance, BlockDAG (BDAG) is distributing value in real time. Its daily Buyer Battle just awarded 25.29 million BDAG to a single wallet after unmet sales triggered a coin transfer.

With $225M raised, 19.6 billion coins sold, and a special entry price of $0.0019 live until May 13, BlockDAG's breakout looks inevitable. Those who accumulate as much as possible now stand to benefit the most, and if their buy is large enough, they might even win the next Buyer Battle!

After spending most of April trading between $0.000010 and $0.000014, Shiba Inu is showing signs of life. A breakout above the neckline at $0.000011 has triggered a Shiba Inu bullish signal, supported by rising money flow and a confirmed MACD crossover.

Adding weight to the setup, the 90-day Mean Dollar Invested Age has dropped, suggesting dormant tokens are now moving. This change in behavior often lines up with price expansion. For now, the Shiba Inu bullish signal hinges on holding above $0.000015. If that happens, the next target sits near $0.000019.

Dogecoin is currently holding near $0.175, sitting just below a key descending resistance trendline that has capped its progress since February. According to the latest Dogecoin price prediction data, the next few sessions could be critical.

A daily close above $0.19 may shift the structure toward a broader move targeting $0.21 and $0.24, provided volume supports the breakout. At the same time, support between $0.167 and $0.15 remains under pressure. Any slip below $0.167 could send the token back toward $0.13, invalidating the bullish setup.

Every 24 hours, BlockDAG sets a coin sale target. Some days, that target is met. Other days, it isn't. And when that happens, something rare unfolds: The unsold coins are given away, in full, to the highest buyer of the day.

Not long ago, the network set a target of fifty million BDAG. By the end of the day, only 24.71 million had been sold. The remaining 25.29 million? They went straight to the buyer who made the biggest purchase that day.

This is the logic behind Buyer Battles. Every day is a new chance for someone to walk away with much more than they paid for, simply because they acted when others didn't.



Right now, BlockDAG is in Batch 28, priced at $0.0262 per coin. But until May 13, buyers can access a limited rate of $0.0019 per coin. So far, the presale has raised over $225 million and moved more than 19.6 billion BDAG, clear signs that conviction is already turning into capital.

Early participants from Batch 1 have already seen up to 2,520% ROI. And with price forecasts reaching $1 in 2025, what today looks like a small advantage could soon become a defining one.

For now, BlockDAG's Buyer Battles run daily, which means every day brings a chance to stash massive profits. Even if someone doesn't walk away with the surplus, BlockDAG's price predictions and past ROI already prove the game is well worth the candle!



Most breakout signals tell you where momentum might show up: the Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish signal points toward $0.000019, while the Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction suggests its structure could unlock higher targets if it clears $0.18. Both setups are valid. But neither comes with a guaranteed payoff.

That's where BlockDAG separates itself. Its Buyer Battle continues rewarding decisive action every day. One wallet already claimed 25.29 million BDAG in a single day simply by leading when others paused.

What's more, BlockDAG's entry price is now slashed to just $0.0019—but this rate is only available until May 13. Compare that to the $1 forecast for 2025, and it's clear why BDAG is one of the top crypto coins today!

On Thursday, six stores across America opened their doors with a curious proposition: Come on in, let a metal orb scan your irises, and walk out with a new online profile that promises you're an individual human – and a few bucks in crypto for your troubles.

The US retail stores are the latest outgrowth of the World (formerly known as WorldCoin) project - the flagship initiative from Tools for Humanity, a startup co-founded in 2019 by OpenAI boss Sam Altman, along with Alex Blania and Max Novendstern.

World allows you to verify you are an actual person so that you can log into services that require the platform. It specializes in attempting to distinguish real humans from bots and AI-generated imitators. The idea being, if you're running a site or app – internet gaming or dating, say – and you really want to make sure each of your users are genuine individuals and not automated fakes, World provides that level of user identity and authenticity management.

Here's the catch: The most reliable way to do this, the startup argues, is with biometric scanning.

World's key components include the Orb (a glossy sphere that photos your iris and face), World ID (a blockchain-based so-called proof-of-personhood system), the World App (where users manage their ID and get access to services), and Worldcoin (aka WLD, A cryptocurrency distributed to users as a reward).

Unsurprisingly, regulators around the world have raised concerns about this whole idea of an upstart collecting and storing people's biometric data. South Korea fined the startup over $800,000 for privacy violations. Hong Kong ordered it to cease operations entirely, and Germany, Kenya, and Spain have initiated various legal actions against the firm.​

But never mind all that - on to America! The upstart has now set up shopfronts in Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco, with its eyeball-scanning Orb devices. Since SF is also the home of Vulture West, we decided to pop in and have a look.

The store, nestled between Macy's and Louis Vuitton in the city's Union Square, is a tad ramshackle and barely painted. A wooden structure in the center of the room houses eight soccer ball-sized Orbs at varying heights.

World's San Francisco outlet ... The Apple Store it ain't

Here's how it works for us netizens. We'll assume you need to create (or anticipate creating) a verified-human profile on World that's required by an app or service you want to use.

First, you must download the World App, sign in, and after entering the store, wait as it links with a nearby Orb. The app tells you where to stand in relation to the sphere and how to position your head, and the scan of your eyes and face takes a few seconds to complete. That data is used to build a blockchain-based World ID unique to you based on your physically biometric info.

Specifically, that biometric scan is encrypted and sent directly to your phone to be converted into that unique identity token, after which the info is deleted on the Orb itself, the project says. As an incentive, the World app is credited with Worldcoins worth a little over $16 in real-world money. That token is then used later on when logging into things to prove you are a unique, genuinely real human.

Despite all the scrutiny, the startup claims to have 26 million people using its app around the world, with 12 million people having added their biometric data.

At a Wednesday event in SF, Altman and Blania officially launched the organization in the US – there have been trials around the world – and said the outfit wanted to have 7,500 Orbs - four times the total current installed base - in place across the States by the end of the year. The biz has set up a factory in Texas to pump out Orbs for America and the rest of the world, and is working on a miniaturized version to increase verification.

“I'm a very proud American, I think America should lead innovation, not fight it off,” Altman said at the shindig, which you can watch below.

At the gathering, Blania said the three areas the business will be focusing on are gaming, online dating, and social media, mainly to eliminate bots masquerading as real people. World IDs can help assure people they are chatting to actual people online, he claimed. That said, it's not a panacea; we can think of some drawbacks.

World announced two partnerships during its US launch. A Visa-backed debit card will be issued later this year, and Match.com in Japan will be using World ID to reassure nervous daters.

During our store visit, an assistant said the amount of traffic for the Orbs had been very high, but we observed only a handful of people giving it a try in the 15 minutes in the shop. One man, a visitor to the RSA Conference happening just down the road, said he'd heard about it at the show and "free money is free money." We hope he's right. ®

 Tokenization is gaining real traction as BlackRock, Libre, and MultiBank make billion-dollar moves, signaling the shift from theory to execution. 

Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is evolving from an abstract concept to a practical financial tool as institutional players increasingly test and deploy blockchain-based infrastructure at scale.

This past week alone saw a flurry of announcements from both traditional financial institutions and blockchain-native firms advancing their RWA initiatives.

On April 30, BlackRock filed to create a digital ledger technology shares class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust fund. It will leverage blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for investors.

The DLT shares will track BlackRock's BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY).

On the same day, Libre announced plans to tokenize $500 million in Telegram debt through its new Telegram Bond Fund (TBF). The fund will be available to accredited investors and usable as collateral for onchain borrowing.

The week's biggest headline came from Dubai, where MultiBank Group signed a $3 billion RWA tokenization deal with United Arab Emirates-based real estate firm MAG and blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk. The deal is touted as the largest RWA tokenization initiative to date.

“The recent surge isn't arbitrary. It's happening because everything's lining up,” Eric Piscini, CEO of Hashgraph, told Cointelegraph:

Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of RedStone, said the recent announcements “demonstrate that tokenization has moved beyond theoretical discussions into practical application by market leaders.”

He added that the growing adoption by big institutions gives the space more credibility, making others feel more confident to join in and help boost new ideas and investments.

Kazmierczak stated that the renewed interest in RWA tokenization is primarily driven by US President Donald Trump's pro-crypto administration and growing regulatory clarity.

Trump, who has pledged to “make the US the crypto capital of the world,” has taken a different approach to crypto compared to the Biden administration. That era saw an aggressive crackdown from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), prompting many firms to withdraw from US operations.

However, the narrative appears to be shifting. Since Trump's election victory, the SEC has dropped or paused over a dozen enforcement cases against crypto companies.

Additionally, the DOJ recently announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency enforcement unit, signaling a softer approach to the sector.

Aside from regulatory clarity, advancements in technological capabilities, especially in wallets, have also played a key role in driving tokenization adoption, Felipe D'Onofrio, chief technology officer at Brickken, said.

“In parallel, macroeconomic pressures are pushing institutions to search for efficiency and liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets,” he added.

Ethereum continues to serve as the primary hub for RWA tokenization, thanks to its mature ecosystem, broad developer support and robust infrastructure.

“Ethereum remains by far the most suitable blockchain for large-scale RWA issuance due to its unparalleled security, developer ecosystem, and institutional adoption,” Kazmierczak said.

However, he noted that dedicated RWA-specialized ecosystems like Canton Network, Plume, and Ondo Chain are building compelling alternatives with features designed explicitly for compliant asset tokenization.

According to data from RWA.xyz, the market value of tokenized US Treasurys currently stands at $6.5 billion. Ethereum accounts for the lion's share of the market, hosting over $4.9 billion in tokenized Treasurys.

Herwig Koningson, CEO of Security Token Market, said companies like BlackRock have shown that it's possible to build large-scale tokenized products, worth billions of dollars, using more than one blockchain at the same time.

He said this shows that the success of tokenizing assets doesn't depend so much on which blockchain is used, but rather on what the company needs the system to do.

“This is why you will see many banks and traditional firms use permissioned blockchains or even private DLT systems,” Koningson said.

Yet hurdles remain. Regulation continues to be a significant barrier, especially for risk-averse institutions requiring guarantees around compliance and privacy.

Technical limitations also persist, chiefly the lack of interoperability between blockchain platforms, according to Piscini. However, he said hybrid models are gaining traction by offering the privacy of permissioned systems with optional future interoperability with public chains.

Looking ahead, Piscini estimated that more than 10% of global financial assets could be tokenized by the end of the decade. D'Onofrio also made a modest projection, estimating that between 5% and 10% of global financial assets could be tokenized by 2030.

On the other hand, RedStone's Kazmierczak predicted that approximately 30% of the global financial system will be tokenized by the end of this decade.

In terms of numbers, STM.co predicted that the world's RWA market will be anywhere between $30 and $50 trillion by the end of 2030.

Most firms predict that the RWA sector will reach a market size of between $4 trillion and $30 trillion by 2030.

If the sector were to achieve the median prediction of about $10 trillion, it would represent more than 50 times the growth from its current value of around $185 billion, including the stablecoin market, according to a Tren Finance research report.

ByBilly Bambrough,

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin and crypto prices are awaiting the next catalyst after surging into May (though Apple might have just quietly created it).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has surged almost 30% since falling to April lows and is nearing $100,000 per bitcoin as the market braces for a $10 trillion Wall Street earthquake.

Now, as "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock, U.S. president Donald Trump's crypto czar David Sacks has predicted a coming “Trump boom.”

U.S. president Donald Trump's crypto czar David Sacks has predicted a bitcoin and crypto "boom" as ... More the bitcoin price approaches $100,000 per bitcoin.

"We've ended the war on crypto, and I think we're trying to stop the regulatory capture that benefits large incumbents," Sacks, who worked with Tesla billionaire Elon Musk in the early days of PayPal and advised him on his takeover of Twitter and its rebranding to X, said during an episode of the All In Podcast.

“I do think that this sets us up for a Trump boom in the future," Sacks said, pointing to “other things that that have been done on the economy as well," and predicted “a lot of these changes take time to to play out.”

Last week, the Federal Reserve quietly rolled back Biden-era rules that prevented Wall Street from fully embracing crypto, while the Trump administration is fast tracking stablecoin legislation that's expected to rewire the global financial system.

The bitcoin and crypto market has lost steam since Trump's inauguration, with the bitcoin price dropped from its January all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting along with the stock market as the Trump administration embarked on a global trade war.

The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last year, recovering from a dip following U.S. president ... More Donald Trump's return to the White House in January.

However, the bitcoin price, which has somewhat supported the wider crypto market, has held up better than many had expected, helped by growing fears swirling around the future of the U.S. dollar and bitcoin's reputation as “digital gold.”

“This renewed risk-on mood is setting the stage for bitcoin to make a run at $100,000,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments.

“The $95,000 level had been a key resistance zone in recent weeks, and once bitcoin cleared it with strong volume, momentum accelerated quickly. With equities pushing higher and liquidity expectations rising, bitcoin is behaving like a high-beta macro asset–closely tied to investor appetite for risk and reflation trades.”

Other bitcoin and crypto investors have cheered the latest bitcoin price rebound, emboldening them to double-down on their bullish bitcoin price predictions.

“I definitely would not be surprised [to see bitcoin reach] $200,000, or $250,000 this year," Joe Burnett, director of market research Unchained, said during an X broadcast.

“If the price gets going soon and breaks a new all-time high, I think things could get really crazy, [and] actually go parabolic... all the narratives are set, the macro conditions are great.”

4th May 2025 – (New York) Apple has revised its U.S. App Store policies to permit apps to connect to external payment systems, a development applauded by the crypto community for simplifying access to NFTs, wallets, and decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms while bypassing Apple's charges. Apple's Updated US App Store Guidelines Simplify Crypto App Transactions and NFT Access

Apple's App Store Policy Adjustment Enables Crypto Transactions via External Links

Effective from 2nd May, 2025, these alterations come in response to a federal court ruling that found Apple in breach of a 2021 injunction from Epic Games' antitrust lawsuit. The injunction mandated Apple to allow developers to guide users to alternative payment methods outside the App Store, where the company had previously levied commissions of up to 30%.

With the new regulations, U.S. developers can now seamlessly incorporate buttons or hyperlinks to external websites for digital acquisitions without requiring Apple's endorsement or charging fees. This marks a departure from Apple's previous practice of imposing substantial fees on such transactions and displaying cautionary prompts regarding external payment risks.

The crypto industry perceives this change as a watershed moment. Applications dealing with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi), and wallet services can now sidestep Apple's fees, retaining a higher percentage of revenue per transaction, ranging from 15% to 30%. Developers also have the liberty to leverage third-party payment processors like Stripe, thereby enhancing the adaptability of crypto-native transactions.

Social media responses have largely been optimistic. One individual posted on 3rd May, 2025, stating, “Mobile crypto just got unleashed,” emphasising the advantages for NFTs and DeFi adoption. Nonetheless, some individuals urged caution. Critics highlighted that this update exclusively impacts the U.S. App Store, thereby constraining global crypto initiatives, and pointed out that Apple still prohibits apps facilitating initial coin offerings (ICOs) or cryptocurrency mining.

This policy adjustment aligns with the prevailing global antitrust climate, exemplified by the EU's Digital Markets Act, which exerts pressure on tech behemoths to foster open ecosystems. Apple has expressed disagreement with the court ruling and intends to challenge it, suggesting the possibility of future policy revisions.

Unlike other projects, Solaxy is building the world's first Layer 2 solution for Solana, bringing scalability improvements similar to Ethereum's successful Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. 

However, Solaxy stands apart as the only major player currently focused on scaling Solana, positioning it as the frontrunner in the ecosystem's next phase of evolution.

Designed to tackle Solana's key challenges — including failed transactions, network congestion, and performance slowdowns — Solaxy uses advanced scaling technology to deliver faster, cheaper, and more reliable transactions for both users and developers. 

The team has already launched a testnet block explorer that provides real-time visibility into Layer 2 activity and is preparing to roll out additional features like its cross-chain bridge, integrated development environment (IDE), and official project wiki.

Currently priced at just $0.0017 per token, Solaxy's presale is generating massive interest. Supporters believe the project could deliver substantial returns after launch, with some speculating on potential 50x to 100x gains. 

With Solana reclaiming the $140 mark, sentiment around scaling solutions like Solaxy continues to heat up.

Looking ahead, Solaxy's roadmap highlights plans to operate as a multi-chain asset, compatible with both Solana and Ethereum ecosystems.

 This cross-chain flexibility could give the project a distinct edge as the crypto industry moves toward more interconnected platforms. Branding itself as “the next evolution in Layer 2 technology,” Solaxy aims to unlock the full potential of Solana's infrastructure. 

As new features roll out and token listings draw nearer, the project is poised to attract attention from both Solana loyalists and the broader crypto investment community.

Investor demand is clearly strong — with Solaxy emerging as one of the most heavily funded presales in the market today.

Adding to its appeal, the project offers staking rewards reportedly reaching up to 123%, providing both a technological and financial incentive for early adopters. 

For those seeking storage options, Best Wallet has been spotlighted by crypto platforms as a preferred non-custodial wallet supporting over 60 blockchains, including Solaxy. 

Beyond secure storage, Best Wallet offers portfolio management tools and reward opportunities without the need for KYC — features that are likely to resonate with the growing Solaxy community.

With record-breaking presale figures and strong early technical progress, Solaxy is quickly establishing itself as a leading project in the ecosystem. 

Having raised over $33 million and becoming the largest ICO to date, it stands out as the first true Layer 2 solution designed to enhance transaction speed, reduce costs, and improve reliability. 

As the network looks toward its next wave of scalability solutions, Solaxy's continued development could position it as a dominant force in the space. 

Supported by growing platforms like Best Wallet, the project is positioning itself as the frontrunner in scalability — making now a great time for investors to get involved before its full launch. Visit Solaxy.

Cryptocurrency mining facilities can blanket towns with ‘constant' noise. They're likely to get louder under Trump

First came the dogs' balding – leathery pink patches on otherwise glossy fur coats.

The veterinarian told Shenice Copenhaver it was genetic. But it wasn't long before one of the hairless puppies began stealing blankets to burrow beneath furniture and hide for long stretches.

Around the same time, in the summer of 2022, she first heard the noise: a deep, mechanical howl that becomes shrill closer to the facility. Copenhaver didn't know it then, but bitcoin miners had come to town. Less than a mile away from her home in east Texas, a cryptocurrency mining facility was rumbling to life.

The hum has since become the soundtrack to life for hundreds of residents in the small city of Granbury, with a population of 12,600. It echoes across agricultural land and forests, chasing away deer. It seeps into walls, vibrating bedrooms and dinner tables. Copenhaver's neighbor Cheryl Shadden imagines it is what standing on the edge of Niagara Falls might sound like. Copenhaver says it's like a jet engine is forever stationed nearby.

A video of the site from Shadden's home, recorded on 23 April, shows green pastures against a backdrop of billowing smoke and the roar.

“It wakes you up,” says Copenhaver. “I'll be asleep, and everything will be fine, and then I'll wake up because I can feel it in my chest.”

Large-scale cryptocurrency mining operations began popping up across the United States a decade ago. But it was China's crackdown on miners in 2021, leading many to relocate to the US, that cemented the country's role as the global hotspot for minting bitcoin. With at least 137 commercial-level facilities across the country, clustered mostly in Texas, the sector uses up to 2.3% of the nation's grid, according to estimates by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), a government agency that gathers and disseminates statistics on energy use. Whereas Joe Biden had promised to crack down on the industry, Donald Trump wants bitcoin to be “mined, minted and made in the USA”, setting the scene for bitcoin mines to roar louder throughout the rural US in the coming years.

“President Trump and his administration have done a lot to deliver on the promises that they made during the campaign, and we see this industry growing rapidly” Fred Thiel, the CEO of Mara, the world's largest miner and owner of the 300-megawatt (MW) site in Granbury, told Fox Business in March. “We want to see the US be the dominant bitcoin mining country in the world.” Shortly before that interview, the firm acquired a 354-MW Texan wind farm to power a new mine, and has begun tapping natural gas from oilfields to fuel new facilities.

Expansion plans published by mining companies show an expanding array of more data centers and more machines across the country. Miners have tapped investors for $3.7bn in bonds since November to fund future growth.

Miners nationwide have likewise unveiled plans to add at least another 2.42 GW in capacity, according to announcements compiled since November. That's equivalent to almost 2m US households, according to EIA estimates.

Bitcoin's “hash rate” – the collective amount of computing power securing the network, of which the US maintains one-third – has increased by one-quarter since Trump's election victory. The respective hash rates of miners Mara and TeraWulf shot up over 40% between October and December last year, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Eric Trump even launched his own mining firm last month, America Bitcoin, a subsidiary of the publicly traded miner Hut 8 Corp.

“Simply buying bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity,” the president said about his son's endeavor. Trump has launched his own cryptocurrency as well.

Polaris Technology Inc is one of many firms expanding. The company is moving to double its footprint in Muskogee, Oklahoma, raising its capacity to use the same amount of energy as approximately 400,000 homes, despite noise complaints from locals. Likewise, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, CleanSpark opened a new site earlier this year.

“They promised to be good neighbors, but so far their noise is constant,” says Dave Simpson, who lives a quarter of a mile from the Wyoming site. The facility is yet to reach full capacity. Simpson worries about how a constant drone will affect his property's valuation. “I miss the quiet times,” he says.

In Granbury, Copenhaver says that the noise has gotten worse since November. Her decibel reader – a must-have for many residents – has been notching higher, she says, now reaching between 80 to 100 decibels on any given day.

Digging for digital gold makes noise for several reasons.

Row after row of industrial-grade fans are typically used to prevent mining computers, known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, from overheating, which can create an enormous din. Crypto mining often also consists of rows of smaller mobile containers in the open air, in contrast to the US's other major construction boom of tech infrastructure: artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are housed in closed structures.

Mary Willis, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University, has spotted a pattern when it comes to the location of mines. Underwritten by bigger budgets, AI data centers are built on large plots of remote land. Miners, on the other hand, flock to the cheapest power and easy grid access, which often means old factory towns.

Miners are increasingly building next to aging power stations – they call such projects co-locations – and striking deals with energy companies to bring underused plants back to life. Mara's Granbury mine is co-located with two gas power stations, both owned by Constellation Energy, which has fought locals over the past year to build a third plant.

Cryptocurrency miners in Texas pay less for electricity than residents on average, according to an Earthjustice report. In 2023, residential ratepayers paid 22.25 cents per kilowatt-hour for their electricity, while specific crypto mining operations paid just 2.5 per kWh, the group estimates. Bitcoin mining raises the cost of electricity for non-miners in Texas by $1.8bn per year, roughly 4.7%, per consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

Trump has also given miners impetus to grow through his commitment to solidifying bitcoin's place in traditional finance, and thus its long-term appreciation. Its price currently sits at roughly $97,000. In December 2024, it topped $100,000 for the first time.

Crypto mining computers race against one another to solve cryptographic puzzles. The correct answer verifies a new batch, or “block”, of bitcoin transactions. The block is added to the blockchain, which functions as a public ledger of all transactions within the network. The computer that cracks the code first is rewarded 3.125 bitcoins.

So, when bitcoin rallies, miners often look to dial up power. But because price surges bring more miners online, the hash rate also grows. This increases mining difficulty, a measurement for how time – consuming it is to solve the cryptographic puzzles needed to validate a block. Unlocking the mining reward requires more guesses, which means more computing power.

Miners thus must increase their facilities' computing power each time hashrate goes up in order to stay profitable, or they must raise the efficiency of their existing equipment.

For instance, for every $1,000 increase in bitcoin price, US mining energy consumption increases by approximately 0.058 terawatt-hours per month, according to a recent study by the Berkeley Lab.

Bitcoin may have lost some of its initial gains following the election, when it rose 50% in just three months, but much of the crypto world anticipates that its long-term rally will resume once new policies take shape. Major financial institutions are increasingly trusting of bitcoin, and Trump plans to create a reserve of cryptocurrency owned by the US government.

Trump issued an executive order on 23 January, “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology”, which promotes the right to mine, and he has hosted crypto mining executives at both Mar-a-Lago and the first White House Crypto Summit. Meanwhile, his promise to unleash domestic oil and gas is welcome news for an industry whose profitability is dictated by access to cheap energy.

Echoing the federal mood, Republican senator Ted Cruz introduced the Facilitate Lower Atmospheric Released Emissions (Flare) Act on 31 March, which proposes using Texas's “stranded” natural gas, a designation indicating the gas would cost more to recover than it would sell for, to help power bitcoin mining.

Trump's promises offer a stark contrast to Biden's proposed 30% tax on miners' electricity and a first-of-its-kind survey of their energy usage. The EIA has no plans to resume this survey.

Anti-mining protests play out in town halls across red states, where activists challenge local officials on why they have showered the industry with tax breaks and subsidized power. Riot Platforms has received almost $136m in power credits from Texas's grid operator since 2022, profiting more in credits than bitcoin mined in certain months, according to company filings.

Despite this, Hood county, where Granbury is located, voted 82% for Trump in 2024, including many of the activists fighting against Mara. Copenhaver admits crypto did not factor into her vote.

On the 600-member Bitcoin Noise Hood County Facebook group, videos are posted each week showcasing the hum while simultaneously praising Trump. One post, shared the morning after the election, shows sunlight streaming through a canopy of trees, as a symphony of birds competes with a deep thunder. “November 6, thank you lord for getting Trump elected,” the video begins, before the narrator details how the sound has destroyed her peace.

Jackie Sawicky, a resident of Corsicana, Texas, had led the 800-member Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining over the past few years. Sawicky got involved in the movement after Riot Platforms began constructing a site in her city. Although the site has so far not raised noise complaints, when finished it will have the 1 gigawatt of capacity – about the same consumption as 600,000 Texan households.

One member told Sawicky they voted for Trump because of abortion. “The unborn babies can't go deaf, but you and yours can,” she replied. “And there are children in your community who are already losing their hearing because of this.” Disillusioned, she has taken a step back from the movement since the election and plans to leave the state.

“If there are policies that support increased mining, there's going to be more pollution and more community impacts,” says Mandy DeRoche, the deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice. DeRoche represents plaintiffs suing miners in three cases across the US, including five Granbury residents who filed a lawsuit against Mara in October, alleging noise-related damage to their health, wildlife and air.

The sound has unleashed a number of health issues, plaintiffs say, including tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss and heart arrhythmia, on top of insomnia and anxiety. Chronic exposure to low-frequency noise is known to affect health, but doesn't receive the attention that water contamination or air pollution attracts, says Willis.

“Disrupted sleep causes a cascade of other issues in someone's life. Lack of sleep is linked to depression, higher stress levels and chronic diseases like hypertension,” she says.

Cyndie Roberson witnessed rampant sleeplessness change her community in Cherokee county, Georgia, when the noise from a mine began to echo through around 800 nearby homes. Neighbors became increasingly anxious, confrontational and angry. One suffered a heart attack. Another left due to acute emotional distress. “There was so much lack of sleep. They weren't the same as they were before,” Roberson says. She sold her “dream retirement cabin” in 2022 and left the county.

In Granbury, Shadden says the sleepless nights have left her anxious and irritable. She endures chronic migraines and struggles at work. A nonstop buzzing in her ears also affects her sleep. After consulting an audiologist last year she was diagnosed with permanent conduction hearing loss.

“It's never going to come back,” she says.

Mara disputes the accusations.

“There is no established link, medical or otherwise, between Mara's operations and the ailments that are being alleged,” the company said in a statement.

The industry contends that noise can be mitigated with immersion-cooled machines, where ASICs are stored in dielectric oil, and by building sound walls.

But critics dispute the efficacy of this promise.

“I wish it were true,” says DeRoche, on the question of immersion cooling. “We can tell from both the research and from the experience on the ground that immersion cooling will decrease the sound in some way, but only by a percentage. It doesn't eliminate the sound,” she says. Immersion cooling often requires external dry coolers, which can be equally as noisy when deployed at scale.

In response to the complaints from Granbury residents, Mara says that by November 2024, a sound wall had been constructed, two-thirds of machines had been replaced with immersion cooling, and an independent sound survey found levels to be below the legal limit of 85 decibels.

The city's residents won an unexpected victory on 31 March. Constellation Energy withdrew its permit application for a third gas plant, citing community concerns and lower-than-expected returns. “This is truly the best news I've had in a year and a half,” said Shadden.

Meanwhile, the noise drones on. “I just want quiet,” says Copenhaver. “We're all feeling very defeated.”

Three years on, she's still waiting for all of her dogs' fur to return. It may never. They're no longer puppies, and they've never known a home undisturbed by the hum of the mine.

The hum has since become the soundtrack to life for hundreds of residents in the small city of Granbury, with a population of 12,600. It echoes across agricultural land and forests, chasing away deer. It seeps into walls, vibrating bedrooms and dinner tables. Copenhaver's neighbor Cheryl Shadden imagines it is what standing on the edge of Niagara Falls might sound like. Copenhaver says it's like a jet engine is forever stationed nearby.

A video of the site from Shadden's home, recorded on 23 April, shows green pastures against a backdrop of billowing smoke and the roar.

“It wakes you up,” says Copenhaver. “I'll be asleep, and everything will be fine, and then I'll wake up because I can feel it in my chest.”

Large-scale cryptocurrency mining operations began popping up across the United States a decade ago. But it was China's crackdown on miners in 2021, leading many to relocate to the US, that cemented the country's role as the global hotspot for minting bitcoin. With at least 137 commercial-level facilities across the country, clustered mostly in Texas, the sector uses up to 2.3% of the nation's grid, according to estimates by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), a government agency that gathers and disseminates statistics on energy use. Whereas Joe Biden had promised to crack down on the industry, Donald Trump wants bitcoin to be “mined, minted and made in the USA”, setting the scene for bitcoin mines to roar louder throughout the rural US in the coming years.

“President Trump and his administration have done a lot to deliver on the promises that they made during the campaign, and we see this industry growing rapidly” Fred Thiel, the CEO of Mara, the world's largest miner and owner of the 300-megawatt (MW) site in Granbury, told Fox Business in March. “We want to see the US be the dominant bitcoin mining country in the world.” Shortly before that interview, the firm acquired a 354-MW Texan wind farm to power a new mine, and has begun tapping natural gas from oilfields to fuel new facilities.

Expansion plans published by mining companies show an expanding array of more data centers and more machines across the country. Miners have tapped investors for $3.7bn in bonds since November to fund future growth.

Miners nationwide have likewise unveiled plans to add at least another 2.42 GW in capacity, according to announcements compiled since November. That's equivalent to almost 2m US households, according to EIA estimates.

Bitcoin's “hash rate” – the collective amount of computing power securing the network, of which the US maintains one-third – has increased by one-quarter since Trump's election victory. The respective hash rates of miners Mara and TeraWulf shot up over 40% between October and December last year, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Eric Trump even launched his own mining firm last month, America Bitcoin, a subsidiary of the publicly traded miner Hut 8 Corp.

“Simply buying bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity,” the president said about his son's endeavor. Trump has launched his own cryptocurrency as well.

Polaris Technology Inc is one of many firms expanding. The company is moving to double its footprint in Muskogee, Oklahoma, raising its capacity to use the same amount of energy as approximately 400,000 homes, despite noise complaints from locals. Likewise, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, CleanSpark opened a new site earlier this year.

“They promised to be good neighbors, but so far their noise is constant,” says Dave Simpson, who lives a quarter of a mile from the Wyoming site. The facility is yet to reach full capacity. Simpson worries about how a constant drone will affect his property's valuation. “I miss the quiet times,” he says.

In Granbury, Copenhaver says that the noise has gotten worse since November. Her decibel reader – a must-have for many residents – has been notching higher, she says, now reaching between 80 to 100 decibels on any given day.

Digging for digital gold makes noise for several reasons.

Row after row of industrial-grade fans are typically used to prevent mining computers, known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, from overheating, which can create an enormous din. Crypto mining often also consists of rows of smaller mobile containers in the open air, in contrast to the US's other major construction boom of tech infrastructure: artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are housed in closed structures.

Mary Willis, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University, has spotted a pattern when it comes to the location of mines. Underwritten by bigger budgets, AI data centers are built on large plots of remote land. Miners, on the other hand, flock to the cheapest power and easy grid access, which often means old factory towns.

Miners are increasingly building next to aging power stations – they call such projects co-locations – and striking deals with energy companies to bring underused plants back to life. Mara's Granbury mine is co-located with two gas power stations, both owned by Constellation Energy, which has fought locals over the past year to build a third plant.

Cryptocurrency miners in Texas pay less for electricity than residents on average, according to an Earthjustice report. In 2023, residential ratepayers paid 22.25 cents per kilowatt-hour for their electricity, while specific crypto mining operations paid just 2.5 per kWh, the group estimates. Bitcoin mining raises the cost of electricity for non-miners in Texas by $1.8bn per year, roughly 4.7%, per consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

Trump has also given miners impetus to grow through his commitment to solidifying bitcoin's place in traditional finance, and thus its long-term appreciation. Its price currently sits at roughly $97,000. In December 2024, it topped $100,000 for the first time.

Crypto mining computers race against one another to solve cryptographic puzzles. The correct answer verifies a new batch, or “block”, of bitcoin transactions. The block is added to the blockchain, which functions as a public ledger of all transactions within the network. The computer that cracks the code first is rewarded 3.125 bitcoins.

So, when bitcoin rallies, miners often look to dial up power. But because price surges bring more miners online, the hash rate also grows. This increases mining difficulty, a measurement for how time – consuming it is to solve the cryptographic puzzles needed to validate a block. Unlocking the mining reward requires more guesses, which means more computing power.

Miners thus must increase their facilities' computing power each time hashrate goes up in order to stay profitable, or they must raise the efficiency of their existing equipment.

For instance, for every $1,000 increase in bitcoin price, US mining energy consumption increases by approximately 0.058 terawatt-hours per month, according to a recent study by the Berkeley Lab.

Bitcoin may have lost some of its initial gains following the election, when it rose 50% in just three months, but much of the crypto world anticipates that its long-term rally will resume once new policies take shape. Major financial institutions are increasingly trusting of bitcoin, and Trump plans to create a reserve of cryptocurrency owned by the US government.

Trump issued an executive order on 23 January, “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology”, which promotes the right to mine, and he has hosted crypto mining executives at both Mar-a-Lago and the first White House Crypto Summit. Meanwhile, his promise to unleash domestic oil and gas is welcome news for an industry whose profitability is dictated by access to cheap energy.

Echoing the federal mood, Republican senator Ted Cruz introduced the Facilitate Lower Atmospheric Released Emissions (Flare) Act on 31 March, which proposes using Texas's “stranded” natural gas, a designation indicating the gas would cost more to recover than it would sell for, to help power bitcoin mining.

Trump's promises offer a stark contrast to Biden's proposed 30% tax on miners' electricity and a first-of-its-kind survey of their energy usage. The EIA has no plans to resume this survey.

Anti-mining protests play out in town halls across red states, where activists challenge local officials on why they have showered the industry with tax breaks and subsidized power. Riot Platforms has received almost $136m in power credits from Texas's grid operator since 2022, profiting more in credits than bitcoin mined in certain months, according to company filings.

Despite this, Hood county, where Granbury is located, voted 82% for Trump in 2024, including many of the activists fighting against Mara. Copenhaver admits crypto did not factor into her vote.

On the 600-member Bitcoin Noise Hood County Facebook group, videos are posted each week showcasing the hum while simultaneously praising Trump. One post, shared the morning after the election, shows sunlight streaming through a canopy of trees, as a symphony of birds competes with a deep thunder. “November 6, thank you lord for getting Trump elected,” the video begins, before the narrator details how the sound has destroyed her peace.

Jackie Sawicky, a resident of Corsicana, Texas, had led the 800-member Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining over the past few years. Sawicky got involved in the movement after Riot Platforms began constructing a site in her city. Although the site has so far not raised noise complaints, when finished it will have the 1 gigawatt of capacity – about the same consumption as 600,000 Texan households.

One member told Sawicky they voted for Trump because of abortion. “The unborn babies can't go deaf, but you and yours can,” she replied. “And there are children in your community who are already losing their hearing because of this.” Disillusioned, she has taken a step back from the movement since the election and plans to leave the state.

“If there are policies that support increased mining, there's going to be more pollution and more community impacts,” says Mandy DeRoche, the deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice. DeRoche represents plaintiffs suing miners in three cases across the US, including five Granbury residents who filed a lawsuit against Mara in October, alleging noise-related damage to their health, wildlife and air.

The sound has unleashed a number of health issues, plaintiffs say, including tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss and heart arrhythmia, on top of insomnia and anxiety. Chronic exposure to low-frequency noise is known to affect health, but doesn't receive the attention that water contamination or air pollution attracts, says Willis.

“Disrupted sleep causes a cascade of other issues in someone's life. Lack of sleep is linked to depression, higher stress levels and chronic diseases like hypertension,” she says.

Cyndie Roberson witnessed rampant sleeplessness change her community in Cherokee county, Georgia, when the noise from a mine began to echo through around 800 nearby homes. Neighbors became increasingly anxious, confrontational and angry. One suffered a heart attack. Another left due to acute emotional distress. “There was so much lack of sleep. They weren't the same as they were before,” Roberson says. She sold her “dream retirement cabin” in 2022 and left the county.

In Granbury, Shadden says the sleepless nights have left her anxious and irritable. She endures chronic migraines and struggles at work. A nonstop buzzing in her ears also affects her sleep. After consulting an audiologist last year she was diagnosed with permanent conduction hearing loss.

“It's never going to come back,” she says.

Mara disputes the accusations.

“There is no established link, medical or otherwise, between Mara's operations and the ailments that are being alleged,” the company said in a statement.

The industry contends that noise can be mitigated with immersion-cooled machines, where ASICs are stored in dielectric oil, and by building sound walls.

But critics dispute the efficacy of this promise.

“I wish it were true,” says DeRoche, on the question of immersion cooling. “We can tell from both the research and from the experience on the ground that immersion cooling will decrease the sound in some way, but only by a percentage. It doesn't eliminate the sound,” she says. Immersion cooling often requires external dry coolers, which can be equally as noisy when deployed at scale.

In response to the complaints from Granbury residents, Mara says that by November 2024, a sound wall had been constructed, two-thirds of machines had been replaced with immersion cooling, and an independent sound survey found levels to be below the legal limit of 85 decibels.

The city's residents won an unexpected victory on 31 March. Constellation Energy withdrew its permit application for a third gas plant, citing community concerns and lower-than-expected returns. “This is truly the best news I've had in a year and a half,” said Shadden.

Meanwhile, the noise drones on. “I just want quiet,” says Copenhaver. “We're all feeling very defeated.”

Three years on, she's still waiting for all of her dogs' fur to return. It may never. They're no longer puppies, and they've never known a home undisturbed by the hum of the mine.

 Binance has partnered with Kyrgyzstan to roll out crypto payments and launch blockchain education programs in the country. 

Binance has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Kyrgyzstan's National Agency for Investments to introduce crypto payment infrastructure and blockchain education in the country.

The MoU was formalized during the inaugural meeting of the Council for the Development of Digital Assets, attended by Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, the exchange said in a May 4 press release.

As part of the agreement, Binance will introduce Binance Pay to Kyrgyzstan, enabling crypto-based transactions for visitors and residents.

The partnership also focuses on educational collaboration. Binance Academy will work with Kyrgyz government agencies and financial institutions to develop blockchain-focused learning programs.

“Binance is excited to partner with the National Agency for Investments of the Kyrgyz Republic to drive forward the development of crypto-assets in the region,” Kyrylo Khomiakov, Binance's regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, said.

On April 4, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said he would begin advising Kyrgyzstan on blockchain and crypto-related regulation after signing an MOU with the country's foreign investment agency.

Despite its growing interest in crypto and digital assets, Kyrgyzstan has also revealed intentions to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

On April 18, President Japarov signed a constitutional law authorizing the launch of a CBDC pilot project while also giving the “digital som” legal tender status.

Notably, Kyrgyzstan has a track record in cryptocurrency mining. The country's abundant hydroelectric resources have made it an attractive location for crypto miners seeking low-cost energy.

Over 30% of Kyrgyzstan's total energy supply comes from hydroelectric power plants, but only 10% of the country's potential hydropower has been tapped, according to a report by the International Energy Agency.

Binance's new partnership with the Kyrgyz government comes as the exchange has recently expanded its collaborations with governments worldwide, aiming to strengthen its global presence and influence in the cryptocurrency sector.

In an April 17 interview, CEO Richard Teng said the exchange has been advising multiple governments on establishing strategic Bitcoin reserves and formulating crypto asset regulations.

“We have actually received quite a number of approaches by a few governments and sovereign wealth funds on the establishment of their own crypto reserves,” Teng said.

On April 7, former CZ was appointed as an adviser to Pakistan's Crypto Council, a newly formed regulatory body tasked with overseeing the country's embrace of blockchain technology and digital assets.

Crypto World News

May 4, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

What if the next top crypto project isn't already sitting at the top of the charts, but is quietly rewriting how digital finance works? While big names enjoy the spotlight, deeper shifts are happening under the radar—real tech upgrades, real-world use, and massive presale momentum. One of them is already catching serious heat.

Qubetics ($TICS) is leading a silent revolution, fixing what the old giants ignored. It's not about hype—it's about utility, scale, and seamless interoperability. Qubetics isn't riding a trend. It's creating the path for cross-chain freedom, real-world asset integration, and a Web3 experience that doesn't require jumping between apps, wallets, or blockchains. If there's one project suited for the future of global blockchain use, this is the one. Let's find out the best crypto to join now.

Qubetics is the world's first full-stack Web3 aggregator. It's on a mission to unify fragmented blockchain ecosystems—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, you name it—into one seamless framework. Through deep-layer interoperability, it allows cross-chain transactions, smart contract execution, and asset movement without switching apps or paying third-party gas fees.

Imagine a business accepting payments from five different blockchains—Qubetics allows it to manage those transactions from a single dashboard. A DeFi app developer builds once, deploys on multiple chains instantly. A logistics firm tracks cross-border shipments using Qubetics' API that reads and writes data on multiple chains in real-time. It's smoother, cheaper, and way more efficient.

The numbers are lighting up. The presale is in its 32nd stage. Current price is $0.2093, with over $16.6 million raised, 25,600+ holders, and 510+ million $TICS sold. And here's where the urgency hits: If $TICS hits $1 after presale—that's 378% ROI. At $5, it becomes 2,289%. $10? That's 4,678%. $15? A mind-blowing 7,066% ROI. This is hands-down the best crypto to join now for those chasing real-world utility and insane upside.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Qubetics is solving problems others ignored. Its utility, interoperability, and ROI potential set it apart. It's not a gamble—it's a blueprint for the next-gen digital economy, one of the best crypto presale.

Filecoin is shaking up decentralized storage by letting people rent out unused disk space. With data demand booming—from dApps to NFTs to AI—storage is gold. Filecoin provides that infrastructure. It's not flashy, but it's absolutely foundational.

It's also becoming faster and more programmable. Its recent network updates now support smart contracts and reduce transaction times, making it ideal for builders launching apps that need permanent, decentralized file hosting. And Filecoin's decentralized cloud competes with giants like AWS but without centralized control or censorship risk.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because the need for decentralized, permanent storage is exploding. Filecoin is the only one doing it at scale. It's easily among the best crypto to join now for long-term infrastructure gains. In 2025, storage is the backbone of everything—content platforms, metaverse files, machine learning data. 

Litecoin might be old, but it's not outdated. It's got lightning-fast block times, low fees, and strong adoption across payment platforms. While newer chains experiment with flashy tech, Litecoin just works—and that matters.

It's also getting leaner and meaner. After its last halving, Litecoin's supply growth rate dropped, increasing scarcity. Its blockchain is still actively used for peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce, and ATM withdrawals globally. It's the “digital silver” for a reason—solid, proven, and efficient.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because trust and reliability matter. Litecoin delivers utility without hype. For anyone watching the best crypto to join now, this is a legacy coin still pulling weight. With institutions slowly adopting Litecoin again, and with upcoming integrations on major wallets and Layer 2 platforms, the stage is set for another run.

VeChain is quietly becoming the default blockchain for logistics, inventory, and compliance. It helps businesses track goods, validate authenticity, and reduce fraud through blockchain-powered transparency.

From pharmaceutical traceability to luxury goods verification, VeChain provides tools that eliminate middlemen and boost trust. Its native VET token fuels these operations, ensuring smooth on-chain transactions. It's also exploring carbon credit systems and government-backed digital IDs, all built on its high-performance Thor blockchain.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it has real-world partnerships and proven solutions. VeChain is practical, efficient, and highly scalable—perfect for the best crypto to join now list. In a world that's demanding more transparency in how products are sourced and shipped, VeChain is in the right place at the right time. 

There's no shortage of tokens in 2025. But when it comes to real-world value, smart tech, and ROI potential, only a handful stand out. Qubetics leads the charge with its interoperability tools and best crypto presale numbers that hint at game-changing upside.

Meanwhile, Filecoin anchors decentralized storage, Litecoin delivers unmatched payment speed, and VeChain powers logistics with next-level transparency. These aren't just speculative assets—they're the infrastructure of tomorrow.

The real wins won't come from the loudest names, but from projects quietly fixing the flaws of yesterday. That's why each of these deserves its place among the best crypto to join now.

According to Lookonchain, an early Ethereum ICO participant sold another 1,500 ETH worth $1.76 million six hours ago, bringing his total sales since April 17 to 16,500 ETH ($29.35 million) at an average price of $1,779. The participant still retains 13,500 ETH valued at approximately $24.82 million. These large-scale sales from a dormant wallet have increased short-term selling pressure on ETH and may impact price dynamics for traders monitoring whale movements.

Buterin believes that simplifying Ethereum by reducing the consensus-critical code will lead to the blockchain's resilience.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that the blockchain's long-term resilience and scalability hinge on making it simple, like Bitcoin. In a blog post on May 3, he described how “Ethereum 5 years from now can become close to as simple as Bitcoin.” Buterin wrote:

“One of the best things about Bitcoin is how beautifully simple the protocol is.”

According to Buterin, Bitcoin's minimalist design and simplicity makes it accessible, so that even a high-school student can grasp the concept and architecture of the protocol. Simplicity, Buterin argued, also brings other benefits, like cutting the cost of creating new infrastructure and maintenance of existing infrastructure, as well as reducing the risk of bugs.

Recent upgrades like proof-of-stake (PoS) and Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) integration have made Ethereum more robust. However, neglecting simplicity of design has added to Ethereum's costs. Buterin explained:

“Historically, Ethereum has often not done this (sometimes because of my own decisions), and this has contributed to much of our excessive development expenditure, all kinds of security risk, and insularity of R&D culture, often in pursuit of benefits that have proven illusory.”

In November, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake proposed a consensus layer upgrade called the ‘Beam Chain.' Buterin believes that the Beam Chain is “well-positioned to be much simpler” than its outdated predecessor, the current beacon chain.

This is because the beam chain will allow for 3-slot finality redesign, which will eliminate complex concepts like separate slots, epochs, and sync committees, Buterin noted. He also highlighted that a basic implementation of 3-slot finality can be achieved through about 200 lines of code, making it much simpler.

The beam chain will also reduce the number of active validators at a time, which would make it “safer to use simpler implementations of the fork choice rule,” Buterin wrote.

The beam chain will also incorporate STARK-based aggregation protocols, which means anyone can be an aggregator. Buterin noted:

“The complexity of the aggregation cryptography itself is significant, but it is at least highly encapsulated complexity, which has much lower systemic risk toward the protocol.”

Buterin added that the reduction of active validators and incorporation of STARK-based aggregators will “likely enable a simpler and more robust” P2P architecture. He went on to say that there is an opportunity to rethink and simplify several facets, from validator entry and exit to inactivity leak. And this can be achieved both by reducing line-of-code (LoC) count and by creating “more legible guarantees.”

Buterin highlighted that the consensus layer is “relatively disconnected” from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) executions, which provides a “relatively wide latitude” to make improvements compared to the execution layer.

Last month, Buterin proposed replacing EVM contract language with RISC-V to boost efficiency by up to 100x. Buterin argued that the adoption of RISC-V will also increase simplicity, since the “RISC-V spec is absurdly simple compared to the EVM.”

However, this would mean ensuring that backwards compatibility for existing applications are preserved. Buterin wrote:

“The first thing that is important to understand is: there isn't one single way to delineate what is the “Ethereum codebase” (even within a single client).”

According to Buterin, the orange area cannot be decreased. The goal, Buterin claimed, is to minimize the green area, by moving code to the yellow area, that indicates “code that is very valuable for understanding and interpreting the chain today, or for optimal block building, but is not part of consensus.” Buterin likened this process to how Apple achieves long-term backwards compatibility through translation layers. He wrote:

“Importantly, the orange and yellow areas are encapsulated complexity, anyone looking to understand the protocol can skip them, implementations of Ethereum are free to skip them, and any bugs in those areas do not pose consensus risks.”

This is why code complexity in the orange and yellow areas have “far fewer downsides” compared to code complexity in the green area.

To reduce the green area, Buterin proposed the following steps:

Phase 1: New precompiles will be written in RISC-V.

Phase 2: Developers will have the option to write contracts in RISC-V.

Phase 3: All precompiles will be replaced with RISC-V implementations through a hard fork.

Phase 4: Implement an EVM interpreter in RISC-V and push it onchain as a smart contract.

The above steps would ensure that Ethereum consensus would “natively” understand only RISC-V, Buterin stated.

Buterin proposed sharing “one standard across different parts of the stack” as a path towards simplification.

For instance, Buterin suggested using a single erasure code for data availability sampling, P2P broadcasting, and distributed history storage. This would minimize the total lines of code, increase efficiency and ensure verifiability, he argued.

Similarly, he proposed having a single shared serialization format across the three Ethereum layers: execution layer, consensus layer, and smart contract calling Application Binary Interface (ABI). Buterin suggested using SSZ, which is easy to decode and widely used.

Lastly, once the EVM has been replaced with RISC-V or another simple language, Buterin proposes switching to a binary tree from the hexary Merkle Patricia tree, both for the consensus and execution layers. This transition could improve efficiency and reduce costs while ensuring that all Ethereum layers can be accessed and interpreted using the same code, Buterin wrote.

Buterin concluded by proposing that Ethereum, following the example of Tinygrad, adopt an explicit maximum line of code target. The goal, Buterin reiterated, is to make “Ethereum consensus-critical code close to as simple as Bitcoin.”

But more importantly, Ethereum needs to adopt an ethos where the simpler option is chosen wherever possible. This would mean favoring encapsulated complexity over systemic complexity.

Buterin reassured that code that deals with processing Ethereum's historical rules will continue to exist with his latest proposal. However, such code should be kept outside the consensus-critical code, or the green area.

In 2020, Monika immersed herself in crypto, maintaining skepticism yet firmly believing blockchain could address key issues like financial disparity and transparency. A book-lover, she's also a passionate food enthusiast.

It wasn't supposed to be there.

These days, we would call them proprietary blends. But in the late 1500s and early 1600s, individual alchemists called the medicines they cooked up in their labs ‘secrets'. And  thanks to a study published in Heritage Science, we now know a little bit more about the secrets of one alchemist in particular. 

It turns out that Tycho Brahe, mostly known for his study of astronomy, had his own basement laboratory for mixing medicines—including some particular elements.

Brahe's famed observatory, located in his castle-like Uraniborg observatory on the island of Ven, in what is now Sweden, was dismantled following his death in 1601. But recently, a team of researchers from the University of Southern Denmark and National Museum of Denmark analyzed five shards rescued from what would have been the site's old garden between 1988 and 1990. It's believed those shards came from the basement alchemical laboratory.

The authors examined cross sections of the shards for 31 trace elements using mass spectrometry by converting sample molecules into charged ions. While there was plenty of the expected elements on the shards (four of which were glass and one of which was ceramic)—including nickel, copper, zin, tin, antimony, gold, mercury, and lead—there was one find that surprised the experts: tungsten. 

“Tungsten is very mysterious,” Kaare Lund Rasmussen, archaeometry expert at the University of Southern Denmark, said in a statement. “Tungsten had not even been described at that time, so what should we infer from its presence on a shard from Tycho Brahe's alchemy workshop?”

That's a question that doesn't have a clear answer. Rasmussen said that while tungsten does occur naturally in certain minerals, and could have made its way into Brahe's laboratory that way, there's another plausible theory: Brahe had a secret substance to help create his medicines for Europe's elite. 

Not classified as an element until the 1780s, tungsten likely first popped up in German chemistry as ‘Wolfram,' and Brahe's medicine were known to have German influence. “Maybe Tycho Brahe had heard about this and thus knew of tungsten's existence,” Rasmussen speculated. “But this is not something we know or can say based on the analyses I have done. It is merely a possible theoretical explanation for why we find tungsten in the samples.” 

“Most intriguing are the elements found in higher concentrations than expected,” Rasmussen said, “indicating enrichment and providing insight into the substances used in Tycho Brahe's alchemical laboratory.” 

The business of creating medicines was a secret one. Brahe, like others of the day, didn't share the makeup of prescriptions. Brahe was known for his plague medicine—a highly complicated remedy to create that could have had up to 60 ingredients, including everything from snake flesh and opium to copper, oils, and herbs. Could the resulting medicine have also included tungsten as part of the finished product?

“It may seem strange that Tycho Brahe was involved in both astronomy and alchemy, but when one understands his worldview, it makes sense,” said Poul Grinder-Hansen, senior researcher and museum curator at the National Museum of Denmark, in a statement. “He believed that there were obvious connections between the heavenly bodies, early substances, and the body's organs.” 

Gold and mercury were often used by alchemists (including Brahe) in medicines, and it was common for alchemists to link the Earth's elements to properties in space and the human body. And there's a whole list of those connections. Silver tied to the Moon and the brain, while gold was a link to the Sun and the heart. Jupiter and the liver were connected through tin, Venus and copper by the kidneys, Saturn and the spleen by lead, Mars and the gallbladder by iron, and Mercury and the lungs by (of course) mercury. In this thinking, gold was a common ingredient for medicines of the day, including ones Brahe took. 

Where tungsten fits into the mix, however, isn't clear. So far, it remains a secret.

If you've ever attended a Formula 1 event, you'll know: The cars are loud. The revving of an F1 car's power unit can reach up to 140 decibels. That's like standing next to a firework as it's exploding. Now imagine there's twenty of them, twenty fireworks going off simultaneously as the cars roar past you at 200 mph. The shock waves rip through the air and rattle the bones in your chest. It's a full-body sensory experience. Most importantly, it rules hard.

It's exactly that visceral experience that Lego wanted to tap into when, last year, it partnered with Formula 1 to create ten full sets of teams and drivers for its Speed Champions line. This year, it's taking that a step further, and making them an awesome, full-sized reality. Today at the Miami Grand Prix, twenty drivers—including the celebrity drivers for McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari—introduced themselves to the crowd while driving lifelike Big Builds of their F1 cars in the driver's parade.

The project to get here has been as big as it sounds. Over the course of eight months, a team of 26 Lego engineers took about 22,000 hours total to build the brick-based fleet. This took the total cooperation of each Formula 1 team. Lego designer Marcel Stastny noted that each F1 team provided complete IP with approvals for faithful reproduction. “We had great cooperation,” Stastny said, which, beyond the engineering, was a coup given that Formula 1 teams guard the car's designs so closely.

Before their track debut, the cars were displayed in the Lego Garage at the west campus of Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida. I had the opportunity to get inside the McLaren car, which is made from the exact same standard Lego bricks that your kids can buy at home, made with Lego's famously tight tolerances. It feels … well, as solid as a brick, which makes sense given that the car weighs over 3,000 pounds. You can lean on it or slap it with your hand without worry, although I'm pretty sure someone would've stopped me if I'd tried to kick it. There are some surprisingly faithful features. It might not have a real V6 engine (in fact, each car can only go 12 mph), and the drag reduction system (DRS) might not work either, but those are real F1 Pirelli tires set in a Lego hub.

F1 superfan and Lego ambassador Nicole, who goes by the name GirlBricksALot, concurs. “Down to the spoons for the side view mirrors, the tiles that are used for the camera mount on top, even the cheese slope piece on the front wing—they're identical,” she says. “Every part of the car is satisfying.”

This isn't Lego's first Big Build in this space. In 2018, its designers brought that same commitment to authenticity with the drivable 1:1 Lego Bugatti made from Lego Technic elements (that's Lego's engineering line with rods, gears, and axles). Last year, McLaren driver Lando Norris took a Lego Technic P1 all the way around the course at Silverstone. But building ten authentic, driveable cars in eight months has been a feat on a different scale.

Each one of these is, of course, a masterful marketing operation, with Lego keen to promise this level of attention to detail has filtered down to the versions that you can build at home for $30—bringing racing fans closer to the cars they might never see in real life. A bit like Drive to Survive, it feels that Lego Speed Champions is serving as an entryway into a sport that has been opaque and inaccessible to so many for most of its history—something Nicole says she experienced as a young fan.

“[As a kid], I would follow F1 with articles or YouTube snippets,” she said. “You couldn't even watch it. It's impossibly hard to get into the sport as a driver, and it was impossibly expensive to go to.”

Today, the sport doesn't feel as inaccessible. I myself had a number of surprises. For a sport that has traditionally catered to such a wealthy clientele, it requires a surprising amount of physical endurance, whether that's walking 11,000 steps to get from the gate to your section, broiling in the sun in your seat, or surviving for 8 hours on ice cream with chocolate sauce because you (I) refuse to wait in any more lines.

The second surprise was just how much fun everyone was having (not alcohol-related, although there was plenty of that). There are way more people wearing funny hats shaped like cars or wings than I expected, way more kids shrieking at the vibrations in the turn bridges. When it started raining during the practice rounds, I hid under an umbrella until I noticed fans gathering around the turns cheering whenever a driver threw up a high sheet of water, like Shamu. Both Formula 1 and Lego have a rich history and a deeply loyal fan base. It was especially easy to notice during the driver's parade that both are just … fun.

My 7-year-old son might not be able to tolerate the heat and walking that a Grand Prix requires (I can barely tolerate it, and I'm in my 40s) but he's currently on his 6th Formula 1 set and counting. It's pretty awesome that teenage prodigy Kimi Antonelli rode in a car that looks just like his.

Elon Musk's SpaceX is getting its own official company town.

Residents of an area around SpaceX's Starbase launch site in southern Texas voted overwhelmingly on Saturday to incorporate as a city — also named Starbase. According to results posted online by the Cameron County Elections Department, there were 212 votes in favor and only six against.

In a post on his social media site X, Musk wrote that Starbase, Texas “Is now a real city!” 

The new city's residents are believed to mostly be SpaceX employees. On Saturday, they also voted to elect three current and former Starbase employees — Bobby Peden, Jordan Buss, and Jenna Petrzelka — who ran unopposed to serve, respectively, as Starbase's mayor and two commissioners.

The Associated Press reports that SpaceX hasn't shared many specifics about why it wanted to incorporate the area. The company said it already manages the area's roads, utilities, and “the provisions of schooling and medical care,” and it's also looking to shift authority from the county to the new city government to close the nearby Boca Chica beach and state park for launches.

Musk — who recently said he would be reducing his role with the Trump administration's controversial Department of Government Efficiency to a “day or two” per week — announced last year that he was moving SpaceX's headquarters from El Segundo, California to the Starbase facility in Texas. 

At the time, Musk said he'd “had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building” and that the “final straw” was a California bill that prohibits schools from disclosing students' sexuality or gender identity without consent.

After last night's election, a new X account representing the town posted, “Becoming a city will help us continue building the best community possible for the men and women building the future of humanity's place in space.”

A dating app that, just this week, announced a creepy new wearable, has been found to have publicly exposed users' data. The data was granular and personal, including their approximate locations.

The app, Raw, says it is dedicated to promoting “real and unfiltered love” through its unique user interface, which resembles BeReal (it utilizes the front and back cameras of your phone), but for dating. Raw also recently announced a bizarre new piece of hardware, called the Raw ring, which purports to allow users to track the location of their lovers to ensure they're not cheating (there's no way that could ever lead to problematic scenarios, right?). Unfortunately, it would appear that Raw has also been promoting something else in quite an “unfiltered” fashion: users' data.

TechCrunch reports that due to a lack of basic digital security protections, Raw was accidentally leaving users' personal information open to public inspection. Indeed, prior to this week, anyone with a web browser would have been able to access detailed app user information, including their date of birth, display names, sexual preferences, and quite specific “street-level” location data.

TechCrunch says it discovered the security deficiencies during a brief test of the company's app. Raw was downloaded onto a virtualized Android device, and then TC staffers used a network monitoring tool to observe the data being transmitted to and from the app. The analysis showed that the personal data was not being protected with any sort of authentication barrier. TC says it discovered the problem within the first “few minutes” of using the app. TC also notes that, while Raw claims to protect users with end-to-end encryption, it found no evidence that E2EE was present. They break down the security loophole like so:

When we first loaded the app, we found that it was pulling the user's profile information directly from the company's servers, but that the server was not protecting the returned data with any authentication. In practice, that meant anyone could access any other user's private information by using a web browser to visit the web address of the exposed server — api.raw.app/users/ followed by a unique 11-digit number corresponding to another app user. Changing the digits to correspond with any other user's 11-digit identifier returned private information from that user's profile, including their location data. This kind of vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a type of bug that can allow someone to access or modify data on someone else's server because of a lack of proper security checks on the user accessing the data.

Gizmodo reached out to Raw for more information. According to statements made to TechCrunch, the security issues have been patched as of Wednesday.  “All previously exposed endpoints have been secured, and we've implemented additional safeguards to prevent similar issues in the future,” Marina Anderson, the co-founder of Raw dating app, told the outlet.

It's not uncommon for companies to poorly secure user data. Strange as it may sound, security is not a particularly huge priority in the software industry. It can be time-consuming, expensive, and may slow down other parts of production, so many companies simply don't bother with it. With a dating app, however—a business which is dedicated to handling users' most intimate (literally) and sensitive data—it obviously pays to spend a little bit more time locking stuff down. As they say: wrap it before you tap it.

As it goes with every Marvel movie, Thunderbolts ends twice: first before the end titles, and again after the credits have rolled. Both closers are pretty important for what's next for the team and their upcoming appearance in Avengers: Doomsday, and director Jake Schreier's discussed about how the post-credits came about.



After the credits, the film jumps ahead 14 months after the motley crew was publicly unveiled as the New Avengers. They're put out about Sam Wilson suing them over the Avengers trademark, but that matter falls to the wayside when they learn a rocket's coming to Earth, and it's bearing the logo of the Fantastic Four. Schreier told Variety that scene was shot about a month ago (prior to its mid-April premiere), and by Doomsday directors Joe and Anthony Russo in London. The team was already confirmed to be among that film's cast back in March, and for those keeping track, this post-credits makes the brothers' first scene they shot since they exited the MCU with Avengers: Endgame.

Schreier may not have directed his former Thunderbolts, but he looked at the scene's scripts and collborated on it “to make sure it was honest to where our characters were. [We're] giving them over to this whole new world and new scope, and [we] want them to function in that way.” Being there on set was “very fun to watch your buddies go on to this grander scale…and see them directed in another context and on a different level of scope than we had been treating it.”

Now that they're in the hands of the Russos, we'll have to wait until Avengers: Doomsday releases on May 1 to see what the New Avengers get up to when they meet the Fantastic Four, Sam's Avengers, and the X-Men.

Spotify generates the vast bulk of its income from ads and subscriptions, but for the past few years the music-streaming giant has also been quietly building out a developer tooling business. Backstage, a project it open-sourced in 2020, has been adopted by more than 2 million developers across 3,400 organizations, including Airbnb, LinkedIn, Twilio, and American Airlines.

Backstage helps companies build customized “internal developer portals” (IDPs), bringing order to their infrastructure chaos by combining all their tooling, apps, data, services, APIs, and documents in a single interface.

Want to monitor Kubernetes, view cloud costs, or check your CI/CD status? Enter Backstage.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which accepted Backstage as an incubating project in 2022, reports that Backstage was one of its top 5 projects last year in terms of velocity and activity. And it's this momentum that is leading Spotify to double down, with various premium tools and services on the horizon.

Companies can already use the core Backstage product for free, including an array of open source plugins that extend its functionality. But Spotify started selling premium plugins in 2022, such as Backstage Insights, which displays data related to active Backstage usage within an organization. And last year, Spotify got serious about its dev tools business play, announcing Spotify Portal for Backstage in beta: a premium, oven-baked incarnation for those lacking the resources (or inclination) to set everything up themselves. “Backstage in a box,” is the general idea.

The fully managed SaaS product is now edging toward general availability in the coming months, with design partners and customers including the Linux Foundation and Pager Duty already on board.

“We discovered that there were a lot of different customer profiles,” Tyson Singer (pictured above), Spotify's head of technology and platforms, explained to TechCrunch in an interview at KubeCon last month. “Our original theory was that Backstage was going to be bigger for mid-size to large enterprises dealing with a lot of complexity, but we found that small companies also see these same problems. And so having a hosted version makes everything so much easier.”

Spotify also teased a couple of new premium Portal plugins at KubeCon, including AiKA (“AI knowledge assistant”), which is basically a chatbot initially developed internally for its own employees.

The result of a 2023 hackathon, Spotify says that AiKA is now used by 25% of its workforce weekly to query the company's collective knowledge base. So rather than bombarding support channels in Slack, employees can just ask AiKA, which is trained on its own internal documents and data. 

Singer also says that AiKA's utility — providing instant answers to questions — motivates employees to make sure all their documents are up-to-date because it makes AiKA smarter. If someone doesn't get a good response to a question, they can see what source was used in the response, and provide feedback to ensure the source document is improved.

“It [AiKA] kind of sounds simple, but it's powerful, and we got super-high adoption very quickly internally,” Singer said. “[I think why is because] it's not just developers that are using it — everybody in the R&D organization has gotten into it, which also brings more people into the Backstage ecosystem. But also it creates this very positive fly-wheel between quality and discovery.”

Spotify has confirmed that an alpha version of AiKA is set to launch for third parties imminently. And while it won't be at feature parity with its own internal version initially, it should go some way toward bolstering Backstage's stickiness as a premium product in the long run.

Backstage isn't the only home-grown developer product Spotify is looking to monetize. Some 20 months ago the company announced Confidence, an A/B experimentation platform that has remained in stealth ever since.

“We have a few customers who are paying [for Confidence], but we are really focused on Portal right now,” Singer said. “We're being very selective about the customers that we let in the door.”

According to Singer, Spotify will have more to say about Confidence later this year, though he did hint at potential synergies between Confidence and Portal in the form of a plugin that brings some simple feature-flagging functionality into Portal.

When all is said and done, creating a developer tooling side-hustle on top of its day job as an online music emporium has surely been a major undertaking. But there has been good reason for all of this. More than a decade ago, Spotify created its own container orchestration platform called Helios to support its transition to a microservices architecture. While Spotify eventually open sourced Helios to spur wider uptake, it ultimately lost out to Google's Kubernetes, which went on to conquer the world.

Spotify ditched Helios and joined the throngs on Kubernetes — a “painful” decision at the time. And what we're seeing now with Backstage is a response to that: an effort to ensure that Backstage is the industry standard IDP, and that its own developers aren't forced to transition to something else that comes along.

“When you have a product that gets replaced by an external product, particularly an open source one, that migration cost is just tremendous,” Singer said. “And so we decided that we don't want that to happen to a product that is literally the foundation of how we do development at Spotify.”

While Spotify went some way toward heading off that problem when it open-sourced Backstage in 2020, the premium stuff that's now following is really to ensure that it sticks. 

“We're a business — and we also want to build a healthy business on top of all this,” Singer said. “We're not just trying to cover costs. At the end of the day, we have a lot of value trapped inside Spotify right now.”

We're nearing the limits of the PCIe 5.0 x4 standard.

Despite not being officially announced by Sandisk, the WD Black SN8100 is available for pre-order at Amazon (Germany), at the equivalent of $225 for the 1TB variant, via momomo_us . With listed reads of 14.9 GB/s, this should be the fastest consumer PCIe 5.0 SSD, at least if we're talking about on-paper specifications. Beyond what the Amazon listing offers, technical details, including the specific controller and NAND flash type, remain unknown.

Western Digital's flash-memory business has been handed over to the now-independent Sandisk, following its spin-off from the company. In theory, this should extend to Western Digital's acclaimed WD Black lineup, though end-users are unlikely to experience any significant changes. The bottom line is that Sandisk will probably be responsible for bringing the SN8100 to market, handling everything from launch to customer support, but it will be marketed with Western Digital's well-known WD label.

The SN8100 is the first PCIe 5.0 SSD under the WD Black product line, and is listed with impressive read speeds of 14.9 GB/s, beating the best from Samsung, Kingston, and Crucial, at least if we're going by first-party tests. The SN8100 is positioned as a successor to the WD Black SN850X, which was among the fastest PCIe 4.0 SSDs back in its day.

The listing's claim of an average operating power of 7W or less strongly suggests the SN8100 employs Silicon Motion's power-efficient SM2508 controller. That being said, Western Digital did show off a prototype 15 GB/s SSD last year at FMS 2024, which leveraged an in-house controller, with comparable power draw. We'll know for sure when Sandisk provides a complete technical datasheet. The NAND ICs employ a TLC (Triple Level Cell) design with CBA technology, likely sourced from 8th generation (218-layer) NAND jointly developed by Sandisk and Kioxia.

The WD Black SN8100 offers sequential reads and writes of up to 14.9 GB/s and 14.0 GB/s, while its random read and write performance is listed at 2,300K IOPS. According to the leaked numbers, it beats every SSD in sequential tests, but loses to the 9100 Pro in random writes, thanks to Samsung's proprietary Presto controller. The SN8100 is said to launch in 1TB to 4TB capacities, but as of writing, only the 1TB model is listed for pre-order.

In terms of pricing, the 1TB variant is listed at $225 (€199.99), or about 22.5 cents per Gigabyte. This is significantly more expensive than PCIe 4.0 options, which currently average around 6-7 cents per gigabyte; even less during sales. Bearing that in mind, German users can pre-order this SSD at Amazon, with deliveries scheduled to begin on May 30. Hopefully, we will see an official announcement by then.

For better or worse, the Wi-Fi 7 router market has bifurcated into two distinct groups. On the one hand, full-featured tri- or quad-band routers support 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to give customers the best possible performance from the latest wireless standard. However, many manufacturers are courting cost-conscious customers with dual-band routers that only support the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The lower price point comes at the expense of outright performance that we expect from the best Wi-Fi routers.

MSI's Roamii BE Lite is a dual-band router that is available in a two-pack. Each wireless node has just two 1 GbE downstream ports, and no USB ports are available for adding network storage. However, with a price tag of just $225 and the ability to cover up to 5,800 square feet, the Roamii BE Lite is an affordable option if you want to take advantage of the added capacity afforded by Wi-Fi 7, and not necessarily the speed boosts.

Whereas competitive offerings like the Amazon Eero 7 and the TP-Link Deco BE5000 are short and stubby, the Roamii BE Lite takes on a taller tower-esque design. However, MSI switches things up with satellite nodes that have a triangular base, making each a three-sided tower. One of the front-facing sides has a large “7” molded into the plastic, while the other side features an “MSI” logo and an LED strip that displays the status of the network.

The third side is the rear panel, which includes a Sync button to pair the satellites, two 2.5 GbE ports, a 2.5 GbE WAN port, and a proprietary barrel-style port for power. There are also latches on the back for attaching the satellites to a wall with included wall mounts. This is an appreciated and surprising addition from MSI, as satellite wall mounts are often available as an optional add-on from the manufacturer or as a third-party aftermarket accessorIncluding of the mounts in a mesh router system that costs just over $200 is admirable.



The top triangular portion of each satellite is home to ventilation slits to keep the electronics inside cool.

MSI recommends that you complete the initial configuration of the Roamii BE Lite using its smartphone app, which is appropriately called MSI Roamii. Once installed, you'll need to scan the QR code on the back of the satellite. In my case, the app then located the primary router (it doesn't matter which you choose as the primary gateway).

Once the app identified the gateway, I assigned an administrator username and password. After some additional configuration and optimizations worked in the background, the Roamii app confirmed that the setup process was complete.

The Roamii BE Lite satellites come pre-paired, so you don't have to go through any additional steps during the setup process. I plugged both units in at the start of the setup process, and both showed up as being online once the installation was complete.

The Roamii BE Lite is configurable using a web GUI or the MSI Roamii app. I preferred to use the former on this review unit, although the smartphone app is just as full-featured. This is a welcome change compared to similarly priced mesh routers like the Deco BE5000 and the Eero 7, which feature app-only controls.

The main dashboard that appears when you first login to the web GUI (accessible via http://msirouter.login/ ) provides a high-level overview of the network. You get charts for CPU and memory utilization along with a traffic analyzer. You'll also see the network topography, connected nodes, and internet status.

There are comprehensive controls for wireless settings, including wireless mode (i.e., 802.11 a/n/ac/ax/be mixed mode), WPA2/WPA3 security, and a "soft" activation for Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). An IoT network can be enabled, with further settings to only give connected devices access to the internet, with no private network access.

You can even prevent IoT devices from talking with each other on the network. For families, MSI includes a Child Network option, which allows you to schedule times when a child can access the internet on their device. So, if you don't want your elementary-school-age kids accessing content on their tablets after bedtime, you can lock them down here.

When it comes to added security, MSI provides its FortiSecu software, which Trend Micro powers. It allows for remote device management, enhanced parental controls, and additional privacy and data security controls. This security suite comes free of charge with the Roamii BE Lite, which is a nice add-in considering that Amazon required you to sign up for Eero Plus to get this kind of protection on its Eero routers.

As we mentioned in the introduction, the Roamii BE Lite already has one hand tied behind its back regarding performance – it lacks the high-performance 6 GHz band, which we've seen allow some flagship mesh routers, like the Asus ZenWiFi BQ16 Pro, to surpass 3.5 Gbps in our throughput tests.

The Roamii BE Lite also only supports 240 MHz channels instead of 320 MHz for the full Wi-Fi 7 spec (although 240 MHz is still higher than the 160 MHz supported by Wi-Fi 6E). With that said, the Roamii BE Lite does leverage other benefits of the Wi-Fi 7 spec, like 4K-QAM and multi-link operation (MLO).

As always, our Wi-Fi client testbed is a Windows 11 desktop with an MSI Pro B650M-A Wi-Fi motherboard, AMD Ryzen 5 7600 CPU, 32GB of DDR5, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, and an MSI Herald-BE Wi-Fi 7 PCIe adapter. All these devices use the most recent software, BIOS, firmware, and drivers (where applicable).

The iPerf3 throughput tests are conducted with our Windows 11 server equipped with an onboard 10 Gbps wired network card connected to the 1 Gbps LAN port on the primary Roamii BE Lite node. Wireless tests are then performed multiple times at 6-foot and 25-foot distances. Wireless tests are initially run with the network free of added traffic from other clients. Next, the tests are repeated with simulated traffic from additional users accessing the network (for our testing, we use six clients streaming 4K video from YouTube Premium).

At first glance, the 6-foot iPerf3 tests might seem a little disappointing, with the Roamii BE Lite topping out at 934 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, which fell behind the Deco BE5000 (1,070 Mbps) and the Eero 7 (1,097 Mbps). However, once we extended the test to 25 feet, the Roamii BE Lite pulled into first place at 541 Mbps. The Deco BE5000 fell to 472 Mbps, while the Eero 7 plummeted nearly a third of its 6 feet performance to 346 Mbps. This strong, long-distance performance (against its rivals) would echo in later tests.

The 2.4 GHz iPerf3 test saw the Roamii BE Lite take the gold in the 6-doot and 25-foot tests.

Moving to congested traffic runs, the Roamii BE Lite slipped into second place at 6-feet (825 Mbps) behind the Eero 7 (886 Mbps), but ahead of the Deco BE5000 (791 Mbps). But again, its 25-foot performance put it on top, with 433 Mbps compared to 335 Mbps and 189 Mbps for the Eero 7 and Deco BE5000, respectively.

The 2.4 GHz test again showed strong performance for the Roamii BE Lite. It far outpaced its rivals, hitting 108 Mbps at 6 feet and maintaining 65 Mbps at 25 feet. The Eero 7 and Deco BE500 were far behind in both metrics.

Overall, I saw consistent performance from the Roamii BE Lite, with no hiccups in our testing. No router crashes, no software bugs in the web GUI, and the smartphone app was rock solid.

MSI's Roamii BE Lite was a strong performer across the board in our Wi-Fi throughput tests, and it proved to be stable with multiple devices connected (at one point, I had over 40 Wi-Fi devices connected across the two satellite nodes).

My main hangup with the Roamii BE Lite echoes what I've said about previous dual-band Wi-Fi 7 routers – they aren't fully compliant with the spec, which leads to confusion among consumers shopping to upgrade their older routers. The Roamii BE Lite is limited in performance by not including the 6 GHz band, although its 5 GHz performance is competitive with its peers.

It would also have been nice if MSI could include 2.5 GbE across the board, not just for the WAN port. Instead, we get two 1 GbE downstream ports. The Deco BE5000 and Eero 7 include at least one 2.5 GbE port for LAN on each satellite.

The Roamii BE Lite is priced at around $225 online. For comparison, the Deco BE5000 is $179 for a two-pack, and the Eero 7 2-pack sells for $279. Given its performance credentials, I'd consider that competitive pricing. If the 1 Gbps LAN ports aren't a big deal to you, we consider the Roamii BE Lite to be the pick of this dual-band Wi-Fi 7 mesh router litter.

Neuralink has allowed some paralyzed patients to regain some control of their lives.

Bradford Smith is just the third patient to be fitted with a Neuralink Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) yet, impressively, advancements in the technology have allowed him to edit and post a YouTube video using just his thoughts. Smith is affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or ALS, a disease wherein the nerves that control his muscles degenerate, which has led to him being unable to move and talk. However, Elon Musk's investments in Neuralink are finally paying off, and the patient was able to make so many advancements that were previously unheard of.

It was just February last year that the first human Neuralink implantee was reportedly able to move a mouse around by just using their brain. One month later, the patient has grown comfortable enough with the tech that they're already playing chess and Civilization 6 using the BCI. These achievements are already impressive in their own right, but the second Neuralink patient upped the ante a few months later. In July 2024, Alex, who suffered from a spinal cord injury, received the BCI implant. After a month of getting used to the system, he was reportedly able to use CAD applications to build a custom 3D-printer charging accessory for the implant and play Counter-Strike 2 with his teammates

In the video we embedded, Smith shared what the BCI looked like: a small cylindrical stack about the size of five quarters with several fine electrode threads sticking out of it. It was implanted into his brain by a robot, ensuring that no blood vessels were damaged during the process. From there, the Neuralink connects to a MacBook Pro via Bluetooth, which processes all the neural data gathered from his brain.

Smith noted that the Neuralink is attached to his motor cortex, meaning it can only read his intended movements — not his thoughts and words. Initially, he tried moving his hands to move the cursor, but the system did not respond well. After further study, the engineers working on his implant discovered that moving his tongue is the best way to move the cursor. Bradford said that he doesn't think about his tongue when moving the cursor, much like how you don't think about moving your arm or wrist when operating a mouse. His subconscious quickly took over the operation, and he now controls a computer seamlessly through his BCI.

Aside from operating the mouse, the third patient was finally able to regain his voice with AI. Bradford and his team used old video and audio recordings, from before his ALS diagnosis, to train a speech synthesis AI. This allows us to hear him once again, narrating a video which he created himself — something that would've been impossible just over a year ago.

BCI technology is advancing at remarkable speed, with patients now able to use it to operate a computer by themselves. Elon Musk's firm isn't by any means the only one working on it. For example, a Chinese company was reportedly working on a competing tech called Neucyber in April last year with the backing of Beijing. The government has even started working on a plan to standardize the technology, which would hopefully make it easier for different companies to cooperate.

Advancements in BCIs are helping paralyzed patients get some control over their lives back, allowing them to use computers without external assistance. And as this tech matures even more, maybe we will have a future where ALS and other debilitating diseases would no longer be a life sentence for those affected.

These smaller Snapdragon X powered devices are expected to become official on Tuesday.

At its Surface event scheduled for May 6th next week, Microsoft is expected to unveil two new compact offerings under its Surface Pro and Surface Laptop families, according to WinFuture. It's important to note that these smaller variants are not a new generation, but rather expand the existing Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 product lines. Information about technical details, pricing, and availability remains in the dark, but Microsoft is expected to reveal more on Tuesday.

Microsoft offers a range of Surface devices, designed for various use cases. The Surface Pro family features 2-in-1 tablets that can function both as a tablet and a laptop with the detachable keyboard (purchased separately). The Surface Laptop series, on the other hand, sticks to the basics with a traditional clamshell laptop form factor.

Starting in June 2024, Microsoft revealed the Surface Laptop 7 (15-inch and 13.8-inch) and Surface Pro 11 (13-inch) families, initially equipped with Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X chips, for the mainstream. Variants with Intel's Lunar Lake followed, targeted towards business users.

Microsoft is reportedly extending these product lines with compact offerings, starting with a 12-inch version of the Surface Pro 11. In terms of display, we're looking at a PixelSense Flow LCD panel (likely IPS), though the refresh rate has not been specified. Under the hood, it reportedly features the Snapdragon X Plus X1P-42-100 SoC with 8 Oryon cores, along with a 45 TOPS capable Hexagon-based NPU.

The SoC is connected with 16GB of LPDDR5x memory (likely 8448 MT/s), which is non-expandable. The laptop is expected to be available in 256GB and 512GB storage capacities, supplied by a UFS-based solution, which, unlike SSDs, is not upgradable. Microsoft claims 16 hours of local video playback, but real-world usage will vary. The leaked press slides only mention two USB Type-C ports for data transfer, charging, and hooking up external displays.

Similarly, the Surface Laptop 7 lineup is reportedly expanding with a 13-inch variant, complementing the existing 13.8-inch and 15-inch options. Display-wise, Microsoft will continue to use a PixelSense Flow LCD panel, but the refresh rate has reportedly been lowered from 120 Hz to 60 Hz. Just like the new Surface Pro model, this device also, allegedly, uses the same 8-core Snapdragon X Plus X1P-42-100 SoC from Qualcomm, with 16GB of RAM and 256GB/512GB of UFS-based storage.

These laptops are said to use an Island-style keyboard with a glass trackpad. Windows Hello login is facilitated by a built-in fingerprint reader next to the keyboard. The port selection is quite limited, with two USB 3.2 Type-C ports, a single USB Type-A port, and a 3.5m jack, with no Surface Connect port.

According to the source, neither of the two new offerings will come with a charging brick included. Users will need to use their own PD-compliant chargers capable of supplying at least 27W of power. We can expect to learn more about pricing and availability from Microsoft at their Surface event on Tuesday.

Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United are on the verge of meeting in the Europa League final after both sides claimed a comfortable first-leg victory in their respective semi-finals.

Spurs defeated Norwegian outfit FK Bodø/Glimt 3-1 in London last week while the Red Devils escaped Spain with a 3-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao, making an all-Premier League final a real possibility.

It would be a high point for either club to win the competition, as they are both languishing near the bottom of the Premier League standings and have no hope of finishing in the top half.

Additionally, the winner of the Europa League crown earns a spot into next season's Champions League, a possibility that does not sit right with Emmanuel Petit.

The former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder slammed both Spurs and United for their mediocre domestic campaigns when speaking to FastSlots, stating that neither would be a worthy Champions League participant next season.

"Tottenham and Manchester United both have the chance to save terrible seasons in the Europa League, but does either side deserve to play in the Champions League next season? Absolutely not," Petit said.

"Both teams don't deserve to be among the Champions League teams for the next season. I wish the best of luck for Manchester United against Bilbao, but looking at the game against Lyon [in Leg 2 of the quarter-finals], Lyon should've finished United off.

Chelsea are eyeing up a double summer transfer swoop for Liam Delap and Dean Huijsen - and the Blues could get both deals done in order for them to feature at the Club World Cup. Enzo Maresca's side travel out to the United States for the inaugural FIFA tournament in June and the transfer window is set to open at the start of the month to give the Blues and Manchester City the chance to sign players to be involved. 

The window will be open between Sunday, June 1, and Tuesday, June 10, due to an exceptional registration period for the expanded Club World Cup. It will open again on Monday, June 16, until Deadline Day on Monday, September 1. All Premier League clubs will be free to do business during the earlier window, not just Chelsea and City. 

However, Chelsea could take advantage of the early window and get a couple of transfers over the line as they look to get prepared for the Club World Cup. According to The Mirror, the Blues are planning a fast start to their summer business, with Delap and Huijsen both identified as primary targets. 

Ipswich striker Delap, 22, who has a £30million relegation clause, and Bournemouth centre-back Huijsen, 20, who has a £50m buyout clause, are players Chelsea want to sign. 

Delap has been impressive in his debut Premier League season for Ipswich, scoring 12 goals in 34 matches. As for Huijsen, he has excelled for Bournemouth since his move from Juventus last summer and won the Player of the Match after netting against Arsenal on Saturday. 

However, any move for Delap and Huijsen to ensure the duo can feature for Chelsea in the Club World Cup could spark a club-versus-country row. Both players are in line to play at the Under 21s European Championship in Slovakia for England and Spain respectively. 

But if Chelsea push ahead with swoops for Delap and Huijsen, their nations would be powerless should the Blues then include either of them in their Club World Cup squad in June. 

Under FIFA rules, it's not mandatory for clubs in the 32-team tournament to release their players for international duty. But football's lead governing body are encouraging Club World Cup participants to name their strongest possible squad, especially as there is a record £775million in prize money up for grabs.

32 sides from across the globe will compete to become the best team in the world, with Manchester City, Real Madrid, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Borussia Dortmund, Atletico Madrid, Red Bull Salzburg, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Porto the European representatives.

The tournament is set to start on Friday, June 13 and run for four weeks, with the final taking place on Sunday, July 13. FIFA have picked 12 venues to host, with matches predominately on the East Coast of the US.

Arne Slot's side fell to just their third defeat of a glorious campaign as a much-changed line up looked well short of their best at Stamford Bridge

Liverpool were beaten 3-1 at Chelsea on Sunday in their first match since being crowned as Premier League champions.

Enzo Fernandez finished off a smart move to give the Blues the lead after three minutes, before a calamitous Jarell Quansah own goal made it two in the second half.

Virgil van Dijk's header gave the title-winners something to cling onto, but Cole Palmer's injury-time penalty sealed the deal.

The Turkey midfielder and France forward combined to bail Carlo Ancelotti's side out as they stuck around in the title race

Real Madrid stumbled to three thoroughly undeserved points on Sunday as Arda Guler and Kylian Mbappe's individual quality bailed them out in a 3-2 home win over Celta Vigo.

Guler seemed, for long stretches, the only player who could make things happen while his Madrid team-mated strolled around in his orbit. Earlier this week, Carlo Ancelotti tipped the winger for a more central role going forward - and it was easy to see why here as Guler danced around, finding all of the right angles and pockets of space. His wonderful left foot delivered the opener, too, as he provided na curled effort into the top corner after 33 minutes following a painfully languid opening half an hour for Madrid.

A moment of magic from Mbappe made it 2-0, as Frenchman dashed through on goal before battering the ball into the top corner. He added a second shortly after half-time, too, when he slotted past a stranded goalkeeper after Guler's angled through ball.

Poor defending saw Madrid lose control of the game in the final 20 minutes, however, as Lucas Vazquez's sloppy clearance off the line handed Javi Rodriguez a tap-in before Celta grabbed another when Iago Aspas found Williot Swedberg, who finished calmly.

A Celta equaliser seemed inevitable as Aspas orchestrated in the final third, but it never quite came off for the visitors, and Madrid secured a victory that they didn't really deserve and that keeps them four points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona ahead of next week's crucial Clasico.

Former U.S. women's national team star Carli Lloyd was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame on Saturday. In her speech, the two-time World Cup winner and Olympic gold medalist acknowledged the cost of success and apologized to her former teammates for being distant.

“I wasn't there to make friends or follow the crowd. I was there to push myself to the very top while helping my team win championships. That drive often meant keeping people at a distance,” Lloyd said, donning her new red Hall of Fame blazer. “I avoided unnecessary drama. I rarely showed weakness, and vulnerability wasn't something I allowed myself to express. I wouldn't say I have regrets, but if there is one thing I do wish, I wish I had let more people understand me over the years.

“I operated like an emotionless machine. I was intense and I truly believed that the only way for me to survive in such a cutthroat environment was to be that way. So, to my teammates, I want to say this: I'm sorry I wasn't always able to give you all of me.”

The 42-year-old, who was inducted in her first year of eligibility as part of the 2025 class, gave a 20-minute speech reflecting on her expansive career, sharing a vulnerable side rarely seen throughout her 17 years on the pitch.

“I finally had the space to truly reflect on my career,” Lloyd said, pausing to settle her emotions. “I knew I didn't need to stand up here and talk about how much I loved the game or how hard I worked. Most of you already know that about me. What I wanted to share wasn't from a perspective of a competitor, but as a person, a human being, and what I kept coming back to again and again was one simple question, was it all worth it?”

Lloyd retired in 2021, ending her playing career with her hometown club, NJ/NY Gotham FC, in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She is considered one of the most impactful players in USWNT history. She is best remembered for her performance in the 2015 World Cup final against Japan, in which her 16-minute hat-trick led the U.S. to its first World Cup title in 16 years. Her third goal is one of her most iconic.

In her speech, Lloyd reflected on her love of winning, which often cost her relationships with those around her.

“There was nothing I loved more than winning but winning comes at a cost, and I paid that price,” Lloyd said, “Yet in return, I gained more than I ever could have imagined. Soccer provided me with the tools to conquer anything that life throws my way.”

She alluded to the controversial moments, both professional and personal: from the snubs that fueled her, to the trainer who drove a wedge between her family and her — a relationship that was later repaired.

Lloyd's acceptance included a nod to her six-month-old daughter, Harper, whom she called her “greatest accomplishment.” Lloyd and her husband, Brian, welcomed Harper in October after struggles with unexplained infertility.

“I always knew I wanted a child, but I had no idea how this little baby could completely change me as a person,” Lloyd said. “Unlike during my playing career, I have been present. I have allowed myself to be vulnerable, emotional and fully engaged in every moment I get to spend with her.

“Being her mom is my greatest joy, and thanks to everything I experienced in my career, I now have the tools to help her navigate this world. I want to teach her how to be strong, to chase her dreams and to understand that nothing in life is handed to you, you earn it.”

Lloyd was inducted into the 2025 class alongside another USWNT great, Mary Harvey, who was the goalkeeper on the 1991 World Cup-winning team.

While Harvey's playing career was brief by today's standards, the seasoned soccer executive has been involved in World Cup bids, founded U.S. Soccer's Athletes' Council and held key roles with Women's Professional Soccer as well as FIFA. She is currently the CEO of the Centre for Sport and Human Rights.

Harvey is credited with inspiring the U.S. culture of giving back through sport. That was most evident with her role in introducing her former teammate and current U.S. Soccer president, Cindy Parlow Cone, to the power of sport governance by bringing her to her first Athlete Council meeting when she was only 17 years old.

“Sport is one of society's great social inventions, and has so much to offer us all, and clearly, it has left an indelible positive imprint on my life and led me to a career path dedicated to the impact and purpose that I never expected,” Harvey said. “Part of that journey has been to be, and continue to be, an agent of change, make it better for those who come after you, which is what we said way back then.”

The 2025 Hall of Fame class also includes Mark Abbott, the former MLS Deputy Commissioner, Chris Armas, head coach of the Colorado Rapids, and former U.S. men's goalkeeper Nick Rimando.

Canada booked its ticket to the inaugural FIFA Futsal Women's World Cup in dramatic fashion by defeating Mexico in a penalty shootout Saturday to reach the final of CONCACAF W Futsal Championship.

The two finalists at the eight-team CONCACAF tournament will represent the region at the 16-team FIFA Futsal World Cup, slated for Nov. 21 to Dec. 7 in the Philippines.

Futsal is a five-a-side indoor game played in two 20-minute halves. Like hockey, teams can make changes on the fly.

The semifinal at the Domo Polideportivo in Guatemala City, Guatemala went to a shootout after finishing tied 4-4 following two five-minute periods of extra time.

Mexico scored three unanswered goals in the first half before Canada answered with four of its own in the first four minutes of the second half. Trailing 4-3, Mexico tied the game with 1.8 seconds remaining on a goal by Rubi Gomez with its net empty.

Joelle Gosselin, Esther Brossard, Jade Houmphanh and Cynthia Gaspar-Freire scored for Canada in the shootout. Stephie-Ann Dadaille had her shot saved.

Goalkeeper Lea Palacio-Tellier stopped shots by Evelyn Gonzalez and Gomez before Gaspar-Freire roofed her penalty for a 4-3 Canada win.

Sunday's final will see Canada face Panama, which downed Costa Rica 3-1 in the other semifinal.

The Canadians moved into the semifinals after beating the U.S. 3-1 to finish runner-up to Costa Rica at 2-1-0 in Group B.

Mexico won Group A with three straight wins and a tournament-high 13 goals. Canada, meanwhile, tied for the tournament's stingiest defence with just four goals allowed in pool play.

The Canadians are coached by Alexandre Da Rocha, a former coach of the Quebec's women's futsal team and assistant coach with the Canadian men's futsal side.

Female futsal players have long campaigned for a FIFA championship. In 2022, the International Women's Futsal Players Association condemned FIFAs "public neglect towards women futsal players."

FIFA held the first Futsal Men's World Cup in 1989 with the 2028 edition featuring 24 teams. Defending champion Brazil has won six of the 10 tournaments to date, finishing runner-up once and third twice.

Canada has not participated since being one of the 16 invited countries for the inaugural men's tournament, failing to advance out of the first round after losing to Argentina and Belgium before downing Japan.

That 1989 futsal team included Paul Dolan, Pat Harrington, Nick De Santis, Eddy Berdusco, Lyndon Hooper and Alex Bunbury. Dolan was also a member of Canada's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad in Mexico.

There have been eight editions of the CONCACAF Men's Futsal Championship with Canada participating in four of them. The Canadians' best showing was making the quarterfinals, in both 2021 and 2024.

The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) has officially announced a change in the date of the 2025 Egypt Cup final. 

The final, originally scheduled for May 20, will now be played on June 5, 2025.

The decision comes in light of Pyramids FC's involvement in the CAF Champions League final, where they are going to face South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns in the first leg on May 24 in South Africa. 

The EFA opted to grant Pyramids more time to prepare, especially with their congested schedule in both domestic and continental competitions.

Pyramids are also scheduled to play Petrojet on May 17 in the seventh round of the Nile Egyptian League title phase, which means it would be congesting to play the Egypt Cup final three days later then travel to South Africa and play on May 24.

In contrast, Zamalek's schedule is not significantly affected by the original Cup final date. 

The White Knights are going to face Pyramids on May 13 in the sixth round of the title phase, followed by a match against Petrojet on May 24.

One additional storyline impacted by the Cup final's new date involves Ahmed Mostafa “Zizo”, Zamalek's star player. 

Al Ahly must officially announce Zizo's signing after the end of the current season—following the Egypt Cup final on June 5.

However, Al Ahly will depart for the United States on June 4 to participate in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. 

As a result, Zizo will not be able to travel with the squad and will instead have to join the team later, after the Cup final and the official join to Al Ahly.

He spoke in Vitoria-Gasteiz after the 0-0 tie

Atlético Madrid coach Diego Simeone spoke following the team's 0-0 draw against Deportivo Alavés on Saturday to reflect on an even battle, and also look forward to what the team is left fighting for in the closing weeks of the campaign.

However, the coach denied accusations that the season is already over for Atlético Madrid, as he responded, “not for me, there are still four games left and something we've earned on our own merits competing with Barça and Madrid, which is the Club World Cup, no small feat for all this work over four years”. 

Speaking further on the tournament, which will be held in the United States starting in June, he added that, “it will be new and will generate real enthusiasm in all the teams who participate”.

“Neither team was able to have superiority, neither in link-up play nor in attacking play, there were no shots in the first half. It was played in the middle of the pitch, without danger. In the second half we went from less to more, around the 20th minute we had a better pace, more bravery in the duels, putting in more crosses, with people in the box, combining at more speed.... They had a chance from Kike, but Jan saved it. We were left with a draw in which neither of us were able to score.”

“When we won the league it also happened to us in Almeria, with Levante... It's part of the game. It doesn't mean that if you go to play with the bottom team you have to win. You have to play well, you have to play better, you have to have chances, you have to be convincing... When we had them, we had to win.”

“They look like easy games, but they are not. Just because they're at the bottom doesn't mean you're going to win. You have to earn it. In Leganés, in the first half, there were three or four important situations, but the goalkeeper was very good and we even had a penalty. In Getafe we were 1-0 up with 10 minutes to go and we got ourselves into trouble. In Las Palmas, the goalkeeper made two incredible saves and in the second half they scored. Today, Alavés almost won it with that close call from Kike.”

“I don't agree. In Las Palmas the first half was very good and the second half was very bad. Phases of the match, moments of the game? At the start there is a different tension, a different rhythm of intensity, everyone thinking about not making mistakes... In the second half, there are some imbalances, and that's why they tend to be more fun.”

The SNP's draconian anti-alcohol laws were blamed for Scots being unable to win tickets to a glamorous football tournament in the USA which is set to feature Lionel Messi. There is a ban on selling booze after 10pm and before 10am in Scotland, as well as minimum unit pricing setting costs at 65p a unit. 

World Cup sponsor Budweiser is currently running a contest in this country, offering best-in-the-house briefs to the Club World Cup 25 this summer. The tournament's teams include Real Madrid, Chelsea and Bayern Munich and sees games being played in California's iconic Pasadena Rose Bowl and the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida.

Superstar Lionel Messi of Inter Miami features on promotional material. But anyone from Scotland trying to enter the competition to win VIP tickets is now being told they are barred. A statement says: ”Unfortunately, owing to alcohol licensing and marketing laws in Scotland, you regrettably are not able to participate in this promotion.”

Under former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish Government have been waging a war on alcohol consumption and its promotion for more than a decade. The 50 milligrammes of alcohol in the blood laws makes Scotland's drink-drive limit the lowest in the UK.

The minimum unit of alcohol policy makes booze more expensive here than any part of Britain. And we are prevented from capitalising on ‘multi-buy' booze offers, available to other shoppers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

But last night, Holyrood officials insisted there is no legal obstacle to Budweiser running its football contest north of the border. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government said:”We are unable to comment on individual promotions. There are no restrictions in Scotland which directly restrict promotions involving competitions, although licence holders need to satisfy themselves that promotions do not breach any conditions of their licence.”

The ban could only be a foretaste of what's to come next year, when Bud becomes the official beer of the 2026 World Cup in America, Mexico and Canada. The firm will launch enticing promotions in the UK to win match tickets. Whether Scotland qualifies or not, it would seem members of the Tartan Army would be excluded once more.

Tartan Army veteran Andy Redmond has enjoyed watching Scotland in the United States, 13 years ago during a ‘friendly' with the USA in Jacksonville, Florida. The 77-year-old fan from Motherwell said:”It's a terrible way to discriminate against the Scots. Watching football in America is a brilliant experience, so it's a shame we cannot take part in this contest. I doubt many fans will choose to buy Budweiser if they're going to treat us in this way.”

Shadow business secretary Murdo Fraser said:“Football-loving Scots fans shouldn't be losing out due to the SNP's misguided policies. Perhaps this strong response from such a well-known brand will finally make SNP ministers think again about their lack of support for businesses, and their failed approach to tackling our relationship with alcohol.”

A spokesperson for the Budweiser Brewing Group said: ”Unfortunately, due to specific alcohol licensing laws that are unique to Scotland, we are not able to include Scottish residents in this type of promotion. This is different from other parts of the UK, where different legislation applies.”

With a professional soccer career that spanned 17 years for the U.S. Women's National Team, legendary forward Carli Lloyd was officially inducted into the national Soccer Hall of Fame at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas.

“There was no greater honor than wearing the red, white and blue,” Lloyd said. “Yes, it was extremely hard. There were countless sacrifices along the way, but every bit of it was worth it, because I loved the game, the lessons I learned, the relationships that I forged and the experiences I gained were more than I ever could imagine.”

The National Soccer Hall of Fame inducted a total of five members for the 2025 class: Mark Abbott, Chris Armas, Mary Harvey, Nick Rimando, and Lloyd.

With the USWNT, Lloyd won two FIFA Women's World Cup championships in both 205 and in 2019. She also earned two Olympic gold medals in 2008 and in 2012 and added a bronze medal to her resume in 2020.

Although Lloyd contributed a wealth of time into her career with 316 caps and 134 international goals, the two-time FIFA Player of the Year (2016, 2017) set the tone with the all-time fastest hat trick in FIFA World Cup history. She's also the only player to score a hat trick in a FIFA World Cup Final.

At the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Final against Japan, Lloyd scored her first goal in the third minute and went on to score a total of three in 17 minutes. Her third goal was most iconic as her long shot stemmed from 54 yards out and gave the USA a 3-0 lead. The USWNT went on to defeat their long-time opponents 5-2.

From her performance, Lloyd received the Golden Ball and the Silver Boot as the No. 2 goalscorer in the tournament.

Lloyd's grit in the game was a pattern for the USA in critical moments as she also led the team to a crucial win at the 2012 London Olympics. Lloyd opened the game with a goal in the eighth minute and after Japan equalized, Lloyd led the team to victory as her brace secured the win.

Along with Lloyd's successful international career, she also played in two professional soccer leagues.

Lloyd began her career in the Women's Professional Soccer league with the Chicago Red Stars, Sky Blue, and Atlanta Beat and she went on to play in the National Women's Soccer League with Western New York Flash, Houston Dash, and ended her career in her home state with Gotham FC.

Following her retirement, Lloyd became a mom in October 2024 as she and her husband welcomed their daughter Harper Anne Hollins into the world.

Jack Draper could not quite clear the final hurdle as he strove to land his first title on clay. It was a significant hurdle, because Casper Ruud is a clay-court animal who was born and bred for this surface.

An exhausting and entertaining three-setter found Draper fading at the last, and eventually going down by a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 margin. The crucial period was the four-game run which allowed Ruud to come back from a 3-5 deficit in the first set to burgle it by a 7-5 margin.

To Ruud's credit, he surged for the finish line in a superb final game, ripping forehand winners up the line with a freedom that belied the size of the prize: the biggest title of his career.

Ruud has won 125 matches and 12 titles on clay since the start of this decade: the best figures on the tour. His nearest competitors are Stefanos Tsitsipas with 95 wins, and Carlos Alcaraz with nine titles, which underlines what an expert Ruud is on the red dirt.

Draper, by contrast, has played fewer than 30 matches on the surface, so he is still learning how to deal with its characteristic movement patterns. Towards the end of this match, as the lactic acid burned its way into his muscles, he wasn't able to avoid Ruud's devastating forehand. As a result, he found himself shuttling left and right like a puppet on a string.

“I think you really deserve this,” Draper told Ruud at the presentation ceremony. “You were braver than me in the key moments. This sport is brutal, but I think this loss is gonna make me better.”

At the end of his winning speech, Casper Ruud turns his hand to a bit of Spanish, which was delivered with a good accent and accurate grammar. He thanked the fans for their support and said he was looking forward to seeing them next year.

Ruud is serving for the match and the championship. He starts it well by winning the first two points to go 30-0 up. He can smell victory now. A stunning forehand down the line takes him to 40-0 and three championship points.

The Norwegian sends a forehand down the line, which Draper cannot return, and Ruud wins the Madrid Open 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. We were treated to one hell of a final. Bravo to both players. Commiserations to Draper, congratulations to Ruud.

Draper simply has to win this game to stay alive in this final and he responds by winning the game without losing a point. Draper is still alive.

Ruud was 30-0 up but loses the next two points, including a double fault. Draper hits the ball just out and Ruud has the chance to seal the game at 40-30 up. Draper goes long and Ruud holds a crucial serve. He is just one game away from the title.

Not the time to be double faulting for Draper. He responds by winning the next two points, including a stunning end to a fantastic rally that Ruud must have thought he was going to win but Draper, on the stretch, wins it with a terrific shot across the court. Draper then falls victim to a second time penalty so loses his first serve. The Briton was not impressed by that decision from the umpire. He then loses the next two points and Ruud has a big break point. Draper saves it and we go to deuce.

Draper now has the advantage after yet another stunning rally. He then closes it out and boy did he need that.

WHAT A POINT THIS IS 🤯Watch with NOW: https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/JUpGGqUjI5

Despite Draper winning the first point of the game, Ruud responds by winning the next four points and is now 4-2 up in the set.

Draper moves to 30-0 up on serve but drops the next two points. The Briton then goes long again and Ruud has break point. Both players have had numerous break points in the last few games but no-one has been able to take it. Can Ruud do so this time? No he cannot as Draper takes us to deuce with a great forehand.

A stunning rally at the net results in Ruud taking the point and having another break point. At the end of that point, Draper did go down but he is back up. This time Ruud can take the break point and it is now advantage Ruud in this deciding set.

Definitely some weariness from Draper there as he dropped to one knee after being outwitted in the forecourt. He's been given the old sleeper hold by Ruud: lots of high, loopy balls that made it hard for Draper to hit winners. He has had to generate a lot of his own pace all match, and the effort is beginning to tell.

Ruud is under pressure at 15-30 down on his serve. But the Norwegian brings it level at 30-30 with a brilliant forehand down the line. But a double fault from Ruud gives Draper a break point. Could this be a huge moment in the match?

Draper cannot take it though as he hits the net. Ruud then goes long at deuce and Draper has a second break point in this game. A stunning serve though from Ruud takes us back to deuce.

Draper hits wide and now the advantage goes to Ruud, who takes it to hold serve with a sublime forehand.

Ruud plays one of the best shots of the day with a stunning forehand down the line that wins him the first point of the game. Ruud then goes 30-15 up but Draper brings it level at 30-30. Draper hits the net, giving Ruud a break point. This could be a hugely pivotal moment in the match. Draper saves himself though and we go to deuce.

Draper wins the next point to move to advantage but then goes long so we return to deuce. Draper gets back to advantage but again cannot convert as he registers a double fault. Not the time to be doing that.

Another advantage for Draper but, after a stunning rally, he wastes the chance once more.

Ruud then pulls out a stunning forehand and, for the first time in this game, he has advantage but Draper saves it. Back to deuce once more!

Draper goes just wide after a lengthy rally and the advantage is Ruud's. But Draper pulls out an ace when he needed it. Draper finally seals an enthralling game with back-to-back points and takes a 2-1 lead in this deciding set.

Amazing hold of serve for Draper. Normally you would say that a long game like that could tilt a match. But the dynamic here is beginning to favour Ruud, with so many long rallies. Sky's Colin Fleming is now pointing out how cold it is on court, maybe 14 degrees, which makes it harder to hit winners.

Ruud drops just the one shot as he cruises towards the game and we are all square in this deciding set at 1-1. The momentum was with Draper so Ruud really needed that to arrest that momentum.

Draper has serve at the start of this deciding set. It is tight at 30-30 and Draper manages to find an ace on second serve, which rather perplexed Ruud. Draper looks like he will see out the game but superb play from Ruud on the run sees him take it deuce.

Draper though wins the next two points to hold serve. It was sealed with a sublime backhand across the court.

A stunning backhand from Draper wins him the first point of this game. He hit that so hard! Ruud then suffers back-to-back double faults to give Draper three break and set points. Ruud saves the first and then the second with a cute drop shot. Can he save all three? No he cannot as he goes long and Draper takes the set 6-3.

We have had everything in this match, with so many momentum swings and now it feels like Draper has it.

The double-break – which he probably should have had in set one – came that time for Draper, and saved him from having to serve it out. Incredible stats for the Brit: 12 winners and one unforced error. What a way to come back from that angry reaction 40 minutes ago.

This has been an enthralling match so far, full of momentum swings and quality tennis, the latest example a terrific forehand across the court from Ruud.

The Norwegian then moves to 15-40 up and has two break points of his own now. A great serve from Draper allows him to save the first one and, after a lengthy rally, saves the second to take us to deuce. Two huge saves from Draper there.

The Briton then wins the next two points and holds serve. He is one game away from the second set but he was also 5-3 up in the first.

Could this be the moment Draper needed to get back in this match? He wins the first two points on Ruud's serve and then the fourth point to set up two break points.

He only needs one with a spectacular forehand and that is a crucial break that brings him right back into this match.

"OHHH HELLO!" 🤩A huge forehand gets Jack Draper a massive break in the second set! 💪Watch the action with NOW:https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/zdZgKZr4s9

This feels like a pivotal moment in this match. If Ruud were to get a break, he would nearly be there to winning this final.

Draper though had no intention of being broken in that service game as he races through the game without conceding a point and once again we are all square in this second set.

Despite a double fault, Ruud sees out the game and holds serve.

One thing no one would have expected is Ruud outserving Draper today, especially when it comes to the aces: eight so far as against two. And five-one in this second set. The one time Ruud was broken was when his serve malfunctioned in game three and he hit double double-faults.

A neat drop shot from Draper takes the Briton to 30-0 up on serve. Ruud then hits the net on his next return and Draper is racing through his latest service game.

A stunning backhand across the court mid-air though from Ruud keeps the game alive.

But Draper sees it out and we are all square in this second set at 2-2.

This would be a great time for Draper to get a break of serve. Ruud has the chance to seal the game at 40-30 but he hits the net, taking us to deuce.

A terrific ace gives Ruud advantage and he looks like he will see out the game but Draper's backhand off a Ruud smash beats the Norwegian and we go back to deuce.

Ruud then earns himself another advantage and this time completes the job in this game.

Draper responds well in his latest service game, racing through the game by winning it to love. He stops the rot and boy did he need that.

Ruud serves at the start of this second set. The Norwegian races through the game, sealing it with back-to-back aces and the momentum is all with him. Draper needs a response and now; Ruud has won five straight games.

The pressure is really on Draper for the first time today and that is not the best of starts to this game as he loses the first point. The tension grows as we move to 30-30 and then Ruud wins the following point to earn himself not only a break point but also set point.

Draper misjudges a return from Ruud and ends up making a mess of it, allowing Ruud to take the first set. Ruud was on the verge of losing that set but comes back to win it. Draper is visibly very annoyed at himself.

Ruud burgled that set with some moonballs and all-sorts, and Draper is shouting at his player box about how flat he has been. I'd say that began as soon as he served for the set. Or actually, slightly earlier, when he handed over some cheap errors while Ruud was 3-5 down and serving. Draper could have won it there with a double break. But instead he tightened up and has been unable to loosen his arm again.

From 5-3 down, Casper Ruud takes the first set! 💪Jack Draper is not happy ❌Watch the action with NOW:https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/SlBTJ7mHG9

The momentum was with Draper earlier in the set but it is shifting towards Ruud, who could himself go within one game of the first set if he holds serve.

An unforced error from Draper allows Ruud to go 40-15 up. An excellent serve from the Norwegian wins him the game and he is now 6-5 up, a game away from taking the opening set.

Draper moves to 30-15 up but a double fault gives Ruud hope of staying alive in this set.

Draper then makes an unforced error and gives Ruud his first break point of the match. The Norwegian takes it and we go to 5-5, with Ruud on serve in the next game. This first set is well and truly back on.

Draper clearly tightened up as he served for the first set, losing a lot of racket-head speed, and Ruud capitalised expertly. His experience could be a big factor in this match. It also feels as if there are a few too many long rallies going on, from Draper's point of view. That's much more Ruud's style of play.

A big break for Casper Ruud! 😲Watch the action with NOW:https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/a2Tw4fMPRA

This is a crucial service game from Ruud to stay in this set and a double fault will not help. That takes us to 30-30. Ruud though wins the next two points and holds serve to stay in the set.

Draper though will serve for the first set.

In between games, Draper takes a moment to take a breath and close his eyes. He is in a good position but Ruud has just started to find some form in the last few games so Draper needs to be careful.

Draper moves to 40-15 with a strong forehand and has the chance to move 5-3 up. He cannot take the first chance as his attempted drop shot goes wide. Not sure that was the right choice of shot.

He does not miss the second opportunity as a strong serve sets up the point. Draper is just one game away from the first set.

Saw a quiet smile there from Nicky Draper, Jack's mother, as he slammed another forehand winner down the line. It's tough for opponents to play into his forehand corner: they have to get plenty of juice on the ball otherwise he just changes direction on them. Alarming stat coming up for Ruud: he has won two of 11 points on his own second serve.

Ruud goes 15-0 up but a stunning shot across the court from Draper takes us to 15-15. He did brilliantly to reach that drop shot from Ruud and then it was a fantastic shot to win the point. Ruud though wins the next three points and easily holds serve.

Ruud finding his rhythm now and not giving away many easy points. The pressure is on Draper to find winning combinations, and he has kept it up in his service games to date, despite some heavy pressure.

Ruud puts some pressure back on Draper, winning the first two points on the Briton's serve in this game. Draper then wins the next two points to take it to 30-30, including a sliding volley as he ran to the net. He only just managed to reach that one.

Ruud then goes long, giving Draper the chance to see out the game. A stunning forehand from Draper seals the game for the Briton and he now leads 4-2 in this opening set.

Draper is certainly putting pressure on the Ruud serve. He gets it to 30-30 but a loose shot goes wide, presenting Ruud the chance to hold serve and get back on track in this match. He then sees out the game as Draper's return goes into the net.

It is a tight tussle in this latest service game, with the momentum swinging one way then another. A clinical forehand takes Draper to 40-30 and then he seals the game with a terrific backhand cross court.

Draper puts some pressure on the Ruud serve and a double fault from the Norwegian gives the Briton a break point at 30-40 up. Ruud makes it back-to-back double faults and Draper secures a crucial early break. Advantage Draper.

It's been a strong start from Draper, with several of those decisive forehand winners which have been such a feature of this campaign. Ruud, by contrast, has just handed over the cheapest of breaks with that double double-fault. He looks to be overplaying a little, which has been another theme of the whole fortnight. Players feel they have to do something special to get past Draper's defences.

Brazilian Ronaldo is in the house, sat alongside Atletico Madrid striker Alexander Sorloth, who will be cheering on his fellow Norwegian Ruud.

On Draper's first serve of the match, we have a decent-length rally, which Draper wins. Draper goes long and it is 15-15. The Briton has already gone long on a number of occasions so far today.

Draper though wins the next three points and takes his first game of the match. 1-1 as both men hold serve.

The first point of the match goes Ruud's way as Draper goes long. Draper then goes long again, giving Ruud a 30-0 lead. The Norwegian moves to 40-0 but Draper keeps his hopes in this game alive with a terrific forehand down the line. Ruud then hits into the net and he will be a little nervous now serving at 40-30 when he was 40-0 up at one stage.

But the Norwegian sees it out and holds serve to take the first game of the match.

We are under way, with Ruud serving first in the Madrid sunshine. Who will win the Madrid Open? Draper or Ruud?

It goes Draper's way and he opts to receive first.

Here come the players! First it is Ruud welcomed onto the court followed by Draper. Both players receive a warm reception, in particular Draper.

Time for some warm ups.

“It is his [Jack Draper's] biggest test yet. I just think [Casper] Ruud is a top-calibre clay-court player. He will be studying Jack's semi-final with [Lorenzo] Musetti and looking at the way he made that second set really hard for Jack.

“If Jack comes through against Ruud it will be an unbelievable win. He can do it but it is going to be tough.”

“It is going to be a wonderful final because you have got Casper Ruud, who has been in two French Open finals and a US Open final and starting to find his form again and playing some fabulous tennis on the way to the final.

“It has been breathtaking watching Jack [Draper] play. We feel like we have been watching this guy just rise through the ranks and we know he is going to be number five on Monday but it is just the manner in which he has played his tennis with this high-level of consistency and everything that backs up that big serve, big forehand and what he brings to the court.

“They have never met each other before and Ruud has never won a Masters title. Jack has won one already this year and he is going to try and go for a big title on clay that has been won by so many great champions. It has got all the ingredients for a wonderful final.”

Jack Draper is aiming to win his second ATP title of the year as he takes on Norway's Casper Ruud in the Madrid Open final. Draper, who is now into the world's top five ahead of Novak Djokovic, beat Italian Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in the semi-finals to reach his third ATP final of the year. This is the first time that he has reached the final of a clay-court event and is the first Englishman to reach the final of this event and the second Briton after Sir Andy Murray, who won this tournament twice. Back in March, Draper was triumphant at Indian Wells and he has yet to drop a set in Madrid. Speaking after his semi-final victory over Musetti, Draper acknowledged the challenge facing him in the final against a player like Ruud but is feeling confident.

“Casper is a two-time Roland Garros finalist and very accustomed to the clay,” Draper said. “He is always tough to beat so it will be a challenge for me but I am ready for it. I feel confident to give it my all and physically good. I came through some five-setters at the Australian Open earlier in the year when not at my best and that has stayed in my memory.”

Meanwhile Ruud booked his place in the final after beating Argentinian Francisco Cerundolo 6-4, 7-5. The world number 15 struggled with a rib injury throughout his semi-final but came through to reach his 18th final on clay. Speaking after beating Cerundolo, Ruud, who has won 11 titles on clay, admitted he was unsure he would finish the match.

“I was not sure I was going to be able to finish the match, honestly. I felt something in my rib during the warm-up, just towards the end before going out [on court],” Ruud said. “I felt it in nearly every shot, especially the serve. Luckily, I got some quick treatment on it. There is not too much you can do, you only have three minutes [with the physio]. So I will go and check it out more now.”

This is the first meeting between these two professionally so who will come out on top and win the Madrid Open? The final is set to get under way at 5.30pm BST.

Three-time Grand Slam finalist and former world No. 2 Casper Ruud won the biggest title of his career on Sunday, charging past Jack Draper 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in the Mutua Madrid Open final.The victory marks Ruud's first ATP Masters 1000 title—making him the first Norwegian player to ever win at this level—and his first since last year's Geneva victory.“It's been a long time coming, and it's one really big goal that I dreamed about since I was young,” Ruud said of his first 1000 trophy. “It's an incredible feeling to accomplish it, and also the way I did it today. It was a great match.“I knew Jack had been playing unbelievable all year and also at this tournament. I knew that if I don't bring my A, A, A+ game I'm going to be whipped around the court. But luckily I played really well…“This is a really good boost for me, I hope I can keep it going.”

“This is a really good boost for me, I hope I can keep it going.”

Coming into the match, Ruud was the ATP Tour's undisputed clay-court leader, with more wins (124), finals (17) and titles (11) than any other player since the start of the 2020 season. He's only extended his dominance on the surface with his win over Draper: 12 of his 13 career titles have now come on clay.As a result, the two-time Roland Garros finalist is set to return to the ATP's Top 10 rankings come Monday as world No. 7. Ruud is currently ranked No. 15, having dipped in the rankings after being unable to defend last year's Monte Carlo final points.Read More: Jack Draper set to break into Top 5 on ATP rankings, joining Rafael Nadal on exclusive listDraper will reach a career-high of his own, set to make his Top 5 debut after Madrid.More to follow…

It was a great match.“I knew Jack had been playing unbelievable all year and also at this tournament. I knew that if I don't bring my A, A, A+ game I'm going to be whipped around the court. But luckily I played really well…“This is a really good boost for me, I hope I can keep it going.”

He's only extended his dominance on the surface with his win over Draper: 12 of his 13 career titles have now come on clay.As a result, the two-time Roland Garros finalist is set to return to the ATP's Top 10 rankings come Monday as world No. 7.

Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka has won her first title since returning to action from a maternity break.

Having not lifted silverware since triumphing at the 2021 Australian Open, she beat Slovenia's Kaja Juvan 6-1, 7-5 in the final of the L'Open 35 de Saint-Malo to bring home her first WTA title in four years, and her first ever on clay.

A former world number one, the 27-year-old Japanese star became a mother in July 2023.

“Kinda ironic to win my first trophy back on the surface that I thought was my worst,” Osaka posted on X. That's one of my favourite things about life though, there's always room to grow and evolve.”

Her victory comes after she lashed out at fans on social media, posting a job application form for those who “constantly had sh** to say” after booking her spot in the Saint Malo final.

Osaka has struggled with her lack of power and accuracy as she failed to progress beyond the second round of any Grand Slam last year.

The former world number one, who reached the third round of the Australian Open in January before retiring due to injury, is set to feature in the main draw of the French Open later this month.

Novak Djokovic's Shocking Move Sparks Speculation About His Future

Serbian tennis superstar Novak Djokovic has sent shockwaves through the tennis world by opting to skip the Rome Masters 1000, fueling intense speculation about his upcoming plans, including his potential absence at Roland Garros. With disappointing performances in Monte Carlo and Madrid, coupled with his decision to forgo Rome, questions loom over Djokovic's current form and his chances at the French Open.

Known for his dominance on the court, Djokovic has faced challenges on the red clay, a surface known to test even the best players. His recent slump in form has raised concerns, especially considering his knee injury at last year's Paris tournament. As whispers circulate about the possibility of him skipping the French Open, rumors suggest he might be eyeing a strategic focus on the upcoming Wimbledon Championships.

At 37 years old, Djokovic is at a pivotal moment in his illustrious career, contemplating his next moves as he aims to secure more Grand Slam titles before retiring. Drawing parallels to tennis greats Ivan Lendl and Roger Federer, Djokovic could be considering a similar strategy to optimize his chances at Wimbledon, a tournament where he has previously excelled despite setbacks.

Lendl's decision to skip Roland Garros in 1990 in favor of Wimbledon ended in disappointment, while Federer's strategic choice in 2017 led to a triumphant victory at the prestigious event. As Djokovic weighs his options, the tennis world eagerly awaits his announcement regarding his participation in the upcoming tournaments.

With Djokovic's future plans shrouded in uncertainty, fans and analysts alike are on the edge of their seats, anticipating the next chapter in the career of one of tennis's most legendary players.

The future of tennis legend Novak Djokovic hangs in the balance as experts predict a drastic decision post Wimbledon. Former doubles world number one Todd Woodbridge has sounded the alarm, stating that the next five to six weeks are critical for Djokovic's career.

At 37 years old, Djokovic, with an impressive 24 Grand Slam titles to his name, is facing a challenging period by his lofty standards. His recent performances have been lackluster, with exits from tournaments becoming more frequent. The Serbian star has not clinched a title since the beginning of 2024, raising concerns about his form and motivation on the court.

Woodbridge highlighted that Djokovic's aura of invincibility has diminished in the eyes of his opponents, potentially pushing him towards retirement if his game doesn't improve by Wimbledon. The tennis icon must now confront a pivotal moment in his career, with doubts looming over his physical condition and ability to bounce back.

As Djokovic approaches his 38th birthday, speculation swirls about his next move in professional tennis. Will he reclaim his dominance and continue to compete at the highest level, or is the end of an era on the horizon for one of the sport's greatest players?

The tennis world eagerly awaits Djokovic's upcoming performances at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, as his fate in the sport hangs in the balance. Stay tuned as the saga of Novak Djokovic's future unfolds in the coming weeks, shaping the landscape of men's tennis for years to come.

Venus Williams will be back on our screens this year.

The 44-year-old tennis legend will serve as a broadcaster for TNT Sports at this year's French Open as she joins a star-studded broadcast team.

Williams is on commentary duties alongside Andre Agassi, Chris Evert, Jim Courier, Lindsay Davenport, John McEnroe, and Caroline Wozniacki.

This will be Williams' first major broadcasting role at a Slam since stepping back from full-time competition.

The move follows TNT Sports becoming the US television rights holder for Roland Garros, taking over from NBC.

The five-time Wimbledon champion will also be a lead analyst.

Williams hasn't played in a singles match since 2023, but has enjoyed a career that has established her as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. 

"I know what it's like to battle on the clay, and I'm looking forward to sharing that experience,” Williams said in a press release.

The seven-time major winner has never won the French Open in singles but was a finalist in 2002.

She did win twice in doubles alongside her sister Serena in 1999 and 2010.

Williams' arrival in the commentary booth will be a welcome addition in the tennis world.

Her tennis career is filled with trophies, and her informed insights and analysis should go down well with fans.

Williams' last Grand Slam appearance was at the 2023 US Open and her last victory at any level came against Veronika Kudermetova in Cincinnati two weeks before that.

The last time the seven-time Grand Slam champion played a full schedule on the tour was in 2019.

Much of Williams' time off the court has been occupied by her business commitments -- she owns the interior design company V Starr.

While her inactivity on tour has made many think she has unofficially retired, the fact that she has not called it quits at the age of 44 is a remarkable feat, especially given her physical circumstances.

In 2019, she was diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune condition that can cause fatigue and joint pain.

Although with seven Grand Slams in singles and 14 in doubles, Williams is likely satisfied with what she has achieved in her career.

The second Grand Slam of the season is now less than a month away as the stars of the women's game prepare for Roland Garros.

America's Madison Keys won the Australian Open in January, shocking the world's top two players, Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka, on her way to the title.

However, she likely won't be the favorite on the clay, as three-time defending champion Swiatek looks to become the first player to win four in a row in Open Era history.

World number one Sabalenka is also likely to challenge, having picked up another ‘big' clay-court title recently.

Immediately after Sabalenka's Madrid Open victory, one former British star revealed who he is picking to win Roland Garros in 2025.

Speaking to Sky Sports after Sabalenka took down Coco Gauff in the Madrid Open final, former British doubles star Colin Fleming made his French Open predictions.

“I think she [Aryna Sabalenka] is now pretty firm favourite for Roland Garros, with all that has gone on, as we stand here in Madrid,” he said.

“Before this tournament started, I would still have picked [Iga] Swiatek as the favourite, despite the fact she was out of form, because I would have said I think she will find something in Madrid and Rome and by the time Roland Garros comes around [she'll be back].

“But although Iga made the semis you would say it's not a terrible result, the manner of the semi-final I just think there is a question mark of how she will be in Rome and Roland Garros.”

Swiatek lost to Gauff, 1-6, 1-6, in this year's Madrid Open semi-finals, suffering her worst loss on a clay court since she won just one game in defeat to Simona Halep at the French Open six years ago.

The Brit is far more confident of Sabalenka's chances after watching her dominate the WTA Tour in 2025.

“Sabalenka is just going from strength to strength,” said Fleming.

“I know she has not won every tournament this season, but she has been close, if not won it, and she is the one primed and ready to get that first Roland Garros title.”

Sabalenka has remarkably reached the final at six of the eight tournaments she's played in 2025, picking up three titles, the most of any player in women's tennis.

Barring a minor blip in the Middle East, Sabalenka has been a consistent feature in the latter stages of WTA tournaments this year, helping her further extend her gap at the top of the world rankings.

When the next set of rankings are released on Monday, Sabalenka will lead her closest rival, Swiatek, by 4,345 points.

With Swiatek set to defend 3,000 points (Italian Open/French Open victories) over the next month or so, it certainly looks like the Belarusian will hold on to the number one spot for quite some time.

The 26-year-old has accumulated 36 total weeks as world number one, placing her 15th in the all-time list.

Fleming thinks the world number one will pick up her maiden Roland Garros title next month, and when looking at form, the prediction makes a lot of sense.

But how has Sabalenka actually performed in the French capital over the years?

Sabalenka came closest to reaching the French Open final two years ago, when she lost a three-set thriller to Czech star Karolina Muchova, 6-7, 7-6, 5-7.

The three-time Major champion holds a 16-7 record (70%) at Roland Garros, but would no doubt love to take her game to another level on the clay in 2025 and lift the Suzanne-Lenglen Cup for the first time.

Sabalenka will begin her 2025 French Open campaign when the tournament begins on Sunday, May 25.

Tennis fans are in for a treat this summer — even if a few of their favorite stars won't be competing on the clay.

TNT Sports has officially unveiled its elite commentary crew for Roland Garros 2025, and the announcement came with a surprise addition: Venus Williams is all set to join the star-studded broadcast team. One of the most iconic names in tennis history, Venus will lend her voice and insight to what promises to be one of the most elite commentary lineups in recent memory.

She joins a legendary group that includes Andre Agassi, Chris Evert, Jim Courier, Lindsay Davenport, John McEnroe, and Caroline Wozniacki. Another notable name on the list is Sloane Stephens, signaling that she has not yet made her return from injury and will not be participating as a player in this year's French Open.

Though Venus Williams and Sloane Stephens will not be taking the court at the French Open this year, fans will still have the chance to connect with them — through their voices, stories, and first-hand perspectives. Both players bring Grand Slam experience and precious viewpoints that will no doubt elevate TNT's live coverage.

This marks a new chapter for Venus, who has rarely taken on commentary duties in the past. Known for her strategic intelligence, calm demeanor, and unmatched achievements both on and off the court, Venus's presence in the broadcast booth is expected to be a major draw for viewers.

On the other hand, Stephens, a former U.S. Open champion and Roland Garros finalist, has previously hinted at exploring media work while recovering from her injury. Her role in the commentary team all but confirms she won't be competing at Roland Garros 2025, disappointing fans who had hoped to see her back in action. However she has made frequent appearances on the tennis channel along with the broadcasting team.

Roland Garros 2025 may be missing a few stars on the court, but thanks to TNT's powerhouse commentary team, the tournament coverage is already looking like a Grand Slam.

There's something uniquely British about Wimbledon. Beyond the swift rallies and the clink of champagne flutes, it's a tournament steeped in tradition, decorum and (of course) strawberries and cream. But if you're lucky enough to score tickets to the world's oldest and most prestigious tennis event, be warned: what you wear, how you behave, and even when you clap matters. Here's your definitive guide to doing Wimbledon the right way.

"Ladies and gentlemen... if you are opening a bottle of champagne, don't do it as the players are about to serve" 🍾The most #Wimbledon warning ever from umpire John Blom 🤣 pic.twitter.com/57GBixnM4U

Wimbledon may be the only place on earth where queuing is treated like a sacred rite. Fans often camp overnight in hopes of snagging same-day show court tickets. In pre-pandemic times, this meant arriving with a two-person tent, following the official Queuing Code of Conduct, and keeping your Queue Card safe like a golden ticket. Fans should check the official website for updates. During COVID years, the iconic queue was temporarily replaced by digital ticketing and reduced crowds. But with the queue back in action, patience, civility, and common sense are non-negotiable.

Wimbledon isn't Royal Ascot, but it's no place for flip-flops and beer-logo tees either. There's no formal dress code for general spectators, but understated elegance is always in style. Think: summer dresses, linen shirts, and loafers. Avoid ripped jeans, dirty trainers, gym clothes, and slogan tees. Big hats are discouraged—they block the view—and flashy logos or political messaging is a hard no.

Now, if you're invited to the Royal Box, it's a whole different ball game. Gentlemen are expected to wear a jacket and tie, while ladies must opt for formal daywear. No exceptions.

As for the players? They face perhaps the strictest dress code in professional sport: all white, right down to undergarments and trim. Even a hint of colour can lead to mid-match wardrobe changes or disqualification.

It's tempting to let out a celebratory whoop after a jaw-dropping backhand from Alcaraz, but etiquette demands restraint. Clapping mid-rally or yelling a player's name before serve? Taboo. Save your cheers for between points, and never, ever applaud a double fault or a lucky net cord. It's just not cricket (or tennis, for that matter).

When it comes to moving around the court, stewards are strict. You'll only be allowed to enter or leave during changeovers—typically after every third game. If you're seated during play, stay put and enjoy the action.

Few food pairings are as iconic as Wimbledon's strawberries and cream. Each year, around 190,000 portions of English strawberries are served at the tournament, washed down with 320,000 glasses of Pimm's.

While the grounds offer a range of food options—from posh bistros to snack bars—many seasoned fans prefer packing a picnic. Just remember: alcohol is limited to one bottle of wine or two cans of beer per person, and glass bottles, thermos flasks, or opaque containers are not allowed.

Final tips from the club's playbook

Carry an umbrella: The British weather loves drama.

Leave the selfie sticks at home: They're banned.

Silence your phone before entering any court.

Be nice to stewards: They're just doing their job—and might save you from breaking a rule.

Keep your ticket or Queue Card on you at all times. No re-entry without it.

Whether you're courtside at Centre Court or picnicking on Henman Hill, remember this: at Wimbledon, tradition reigns supreme. Dress well, clap politely, and always follow the rules. Because at the end of the day, tennis is as much about grace off the court as it is about grit on it.

 WTA
                        

When it was over and the ecstatic crowd at La Caja Magic jumped to its collective feet in applause, Aryna Sabalenka did not fall to the crushed red clay beneath her, didn't scream or pump her fists or even openly exult. She merely raised her arms in a perfect V -- for victory.

And then, blowing kisses to the camera, strolled to her changeover chair, fished a camera out of her bag, crossed the court and snapped a picture of her team. After that thoroughly professional 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory over Coco Gauff on Saturday, Sabalenka is now a three-time Mutua Madrid Open champion. That equals the record total of Petra Kvitova and, not insignificantly, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as well.

Winning is never guaranteed, but in Sabalenka's mind, this was expected. Her will manifested itself in the moments that mattered. Sabalenka's earned that confidence because -- by an uncommonly wide margin -- she is the best player in the sport.

On Monday, the World No. 1 will become only the third woman to amass more than 11,000 ranking points and is nearly 4,000 ahead of No. 2 Iga Swiatek in the PIF WTA Rankings. That gap is likely to grow. With Swiatek defending titles in Rome and Paris, she'll also be defending 3,000 points across the next month. And because Sabalenka missed Wimbledon last year, this year's result will be a ranking points windfall.

Sabalenka is more than 1,600 points clear of No. 2 Madison Keys in the PIF Race to the WTA Finals in Riyadh. She's the only player with three titles so far -- Brisbane, Miami and Madrid -- and has collected back-to-back WTA 1000 titles on vastly different surfaces. Her 31 match-wins are also the most among Hologic WTA Tour players.

This was Gauff's 10th match against Sabalenka in six years. How has her game evolved?

“I feel like she just got a lot better in everything,” Gauff said. “I think she just probably is more confident, so that's why the consistent results are happening.”

Examine the timeline and you'll find that the catalyst for all of this, oddly enough, was a loss.

Back in January, Sabalenka was going for her third consecutive Australian Open but Keys was simply too good in the final. For Sabalenka, who started the year 11-0, it was a devastating loss. She left the Middle East in something of a funk, having lost an unheard of three of four matches.

But then, she rallied and reached four straight finals -- Indian Wells, Miami, Stuttgart and Madrid -- winning two of them. Sabalenka's won 19 of her past 21 and even with the slow surfaces in Rome and Paris looming, she's going to like her chances.

A few hours after the win in Madrid, Sabalenka fielded some questions from wtatennis.com:

Looking back, how did losing that Australian Open final motivate you to produce the best start of your career heading into Rome?

Sabalenka: Yeah, honestly, that final was the toughest one. I really struggled to accept that match, tough loss. And I think, February I was kind of trying to figure my way. Then I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder. Kind of explains to me that you have to really work hard in finals and you have to earn your victories. It was a good push for me.

Your last two matches, four of six sets went to seven games -- you won them all … how proud are you of the fact you competed so well in the most important moments?

Sabalenka: I'm super happy that I was able to bring the level in those key moments. Super happy with the level I played this week and hopefully I can keep going the way everything is going. 

Your defense doesn't get a lot of attention, but … against Coco how important was it to stay in some of those long points?

Sabalenka: It's very important to not only be an attacking player, but in those key moments to be a good defender and dig really deep in there, try to steal a few points. It definitely brings more confidence in your game.

Only four women in 40 years won their first six matches against Top 10 players in straight sets – their names are Martina Navratilova (1986), Steffi Graf (1994, 1995 and 1996), Serena Williams (2014) -- and Aryna Sabalenka … what do you think of that?

Sabalenka: I … don't know. I mean, they are legends. They achieved so much, these players I look up to. Me, being in the same line with them … it just sounds crazy and I couldn't be more proud.

Of all the ups and downs you've experienced, how good do you feel about your game right now?

Sabalenka: I definitely feel really good about my game. But I think the key for me was that I was always looking for something to improve. And now, still, I want to get better.

Three Madrid titles … the way you're playing, in your mind, can you win in Rome or Paris for the first time?

Sabalenka: [Laughing]. I mean, in my mind, in my dreams, yes I can. But sometimes the reality is different. I will definitely go out there and compete and fight and see if my dream will be the same in real life.

Oranje rather than papaya took top honours in the Sunshine State on Saturday afternoon when we got our second pole position driver of the weekend. Max Verstappen put a dismal Sprint result behind him to deliver a mighty lap when it mattered, edging out Lando Norris by a matter of hundredths of a second.

Norris wasn't too disconsolate, however, having bested drivers' championship leader and team mate Oscar Piastri. There was only a tenth between the two McLarens, but that was sufficient space for Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli to crowbar his way in, delivering his second impressive qualifying performance of the weekend.

“Summer House” star, Lexi Wood, cleared the air about her relationship with castmate West Wilson, after she was accused by Jesse Solomon of getting too close with him during a night out.

“West and I have never flirted — and we never will. We just have a strictly platonic relationship, and obviously he is friends with Jesse and they're so close. They were newbies together,” she told People on May 3.

The newest addition to season 9 continued, “So yeah, that would just never be a thing. So I was definitely like, ‘Wait, wait, what is going on right now?'”

Wood and Solomon hit it off right away upon seeing each other for the first time at the Hamptons house.

However, things took a turn when Wood learned that Solomon got his toes sucked by a girl while she was away from the house for a weekend.

Despite her disappointment, Wood told People, “I think I'm really lucky that my cast told me everything and that my friends were kind of there to give me a heads-up, whether it was a little late or not.”

She added, “So yeah, I think I'm really lucky in that case because if we were in the normal world, I probably wouldn't know certain things, like the toe [incident]. I wouldn't have known any of this.”

A post shared by Jesse Solomon (@jessesols)

Although Solomon's brief romance with Wood didn't end well, he told Glamour in April, “Our relationship meant a lot to me, and I'm grateful for everything it taught me.”

He continued, “Sometimes connections shift, especially in a setting like this where everything is under a microscope and conversations are happening through a game of telephone.”

“As far as being called dishonest, I really do try to be transparent. I think there were just some miscommunications and heightened emotions, which is understandable given the environment,” Solomon said.

As for Wood, she told the publication, “Watching back, I wish there was more honesty because I would have made different decisions and choices.”

The model shared, “I wish that I was able to have more knowledge so I could have the autonomy to make those decisions, whereas having a lack of knowledge, I'm just going by what I'm seeing.”

Wood recalled, “On our first date, I was like, ‘I'm a relationship girl. I am not hooking up with anyone that I'm not in that exclusivity with. Again, to protect my physical health, mental health, emotional health. That's number one for me. If you're not there, that's totally fine.'”

	The Trump White House shared a graphic image of Trump, veiny biceps and other inhuman muscles bulging, holding a red light saber in celebration of May the Fourth — an informal Star Wars holiday and pun on “May the Force be with you.” Meanwhile, the administration's chief Border Patrol agent posted a video depicting the agency as Darth Vader killing rebel soldiers. The administration, apparently, doesn't mind that these depictions seem to align them with the antagonists of the film franchise.

Happy May the 4th to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting so hard to to bring Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members, back into our Galaxy. You're not the Rebellion—you're the Empire.May the 4th be with you. pic.twitter.com/G883DhDRR5


	“Happy May the 4th to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting so hard to to bring Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members, back into our Galaxy,” the White House posted on social media alongside the likely AI-generated image. “You're not the Rebellion—you're the Empire. May the 4th be with you.”


	Trump, who has promised to deport millions of immigrants, has deported thousands since taking office (139,000 according to the White House), including sending hundreds of men he claims are gang members to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador without due process.

	











	Keen Star Wars fans quickly pointed out that Trump's red light saber suggests he is a member of the Empire led by the Sith, bad guys in the films who practice the dark side of the Force. The Jedis are the heroes in the Rebellion who use the Force, an energy source that permeates and connects everything in the universe, for good — including to fight against the evil Empire.

	“Embarrassing Stalinist level propaganda from Trump's White House,” Retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman posted on X (formerly Twitter). “This would work better if the AI represented Trump as Jaba the Hut.”


	A U.S. Border Patrol video, titled “Border Wars” and posted Sunday by Chief Patrol Agent Gregory K. Bovino, took a clip from Star Wars spinoff Rogue One where Darth Vader massacres rebel forces. Border Patrol labeled Vader as “Premier Sector,” referring to the agency's El Centro Sector, which covers much of the southern border with Mexico.

	The clip opens with Star Wars-style titles: “Episode one: Border Patrol strikes back. The Premier Sector, in pursuit of a ship occupied by threats to the United States, is intercepted on its way to the galaxy's most notorious sanctuary for lawlessness… Mos Eisley… AKA California…” (In the films, Mos Eisley is a spaceport on Tatooine where aliens of all kinds gather from around the galaxy.)

	











	The video then cuts to Border Patrol Vader wielding a red light saber to kill rebel forces that the video labeled as fentanyl, sanctuary cities, cocaine, human smugglers, invasion, and fake news.


	X users jumped on the post to inform Bovino that Border Patrol is identifying with the films' antagonists. One account responded to Bovino with a meme that asked “Are we the baddies?” 

I think ole Darth had the ultimate situational awareness against threats to the homeland.  So do we which is why our border is the most controlled now than ever before.


	Bovino replied, defending the artistic choices: “I think ole Darth had the ultimate situational awareness against threats to the homeland. So do we which is why our border is the most controlled now than ever before.”


	Another user asked, “Just for clarification, who were the bad guys in Star Wars?”


	“We've depicted who the bad guys were in this video,” Bovino replied. “Watch again as they are labeled as such. 😆 🤣. 🇺🇸 🇺🇲.”

"Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks," the singer's rep said.

	Associated Press



	Police in Brazil said on Sunday (May 4) that two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate explosives at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro.


	The Rio event on Saturday (May 3) was the biggest show of the pop star's career that attracted more than 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach and had crowds screaming and dancing along.


	Even as Brazilian authorities said they arrested suspects in the hours before Gaga's show, the event went ahead without disruption — leading some to question the seriousness of the threat. Serious security concerns typically lead organizers to cancel such massive events — as happened with Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna last year.

	











	Police said said nothing about the alleged plot at the time to in an effort to “avoid panic” and “the distortion of information.”


	On Sunday, a spokesperson for Gaga said the pop star and her team “learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning. Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks.”


	The statement added: “Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.”


	Security was tight at Saturday's concert, with 5,200 military and police officers deployed to the beach where fans were reveling in the pop singer's classic hits like “Born This Way,” which became something of an LGBTQ anthem after its 2011 release.


	Rio de Janeiro's state police and Brazil's Justice Ministry presented the bare outlines of a plot that they said involved a group that promoted hate speech against the LGBTQ+ community, among others, and had planned to detonate homemade explosive devices at the event.


	“The plan was treated as a ‘collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,” the police said. The group, it added, disseminated violent content to teenagers online as “a form of belonging.”


	Authorities arrested two people in connection with the alleged plot — a man described as the group's leader in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul on illegal weapons possession charges, and a teenager in Rio on child pornography charges. Police did not elaborate on their exact roles in the plot or on how the group came to target Gaga's free concert.

	











	“Those involved were recruiting participants, including teenagers, to carry out integrated attacks using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails,” police said.


	The Justice Ministry said that it determined the group posed a “risk to public order.” It said the group falsely presented themselves online as “Little Monsters” — Gaga's nickname for her fans — in order to reach teenagers and lure them into “networks with violent and self-destructive content.”


	The ministry said there was no impact on those attending the open-air concert.


	During a series of raids on the homes of 15 suspects across several Brazilian states, authorities confiscated phones and other electronic devices. Although police said they believed homemade bombs were intended for use in the planned attack, there was no mention of the raids turning up any weapons or explosive material.


	Gaga has expressed gratitude for the enormous crowd in an Instagram post that said nothing of the alleged plot.


	“Nothing could prepare me for the feeling I had during last night's show—the absolute pride and joy I felt singing for the people of Brazil,” she wrote. “The sight of the crowd during my opening songs took my breath away. Your heart shines so bright, your culture is so vibrant and special, I hope you know how grateful I am to have shared this historical moment with you.”


	Her free beach concert stood out at a time of surging ticket prices for live music around the world as concert-goers pay budget-busting costs to see their favorite artists.


	Rio has done this before — last May, superstar Madonna performed the finale to her latest world tower for some 1.6 million fans on the sprawling sands of Copacabana Beach.

Lady Gaga is speaking out after police arrested two people in connection with an alleged plot to bomb her free concert in Brazil on Saturday.


	“We learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning,” a spokesperson for the singer shared in a statement with The Hollywood Reporter. “Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks. Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.”

	Following Lady Gaga's biggest show of her career, drawing more than 2 million people to Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, police in Brazil said they worked with the Justice Ministry on an operation to stop an alleged attack planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community.


	According to authorities, the group sought to radicalize and recruit teens to carry out attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives. “The plan was treated as a ‘collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,” police said.


	After police raided the locations of 15 suspects across several states in Brazil and confiscated phones and other electronic devices, the alleged group's leader was arrested on illegal weapons possession charges, as well as a teen on child pornography charges.


	On Sunday, after the concert, Lady Gaga took to her Instagram to praise her fans, also known as “Little Monsters,” for the unforgettable night.


	“Nothing could prepare me for the feeling I had during last night's show — the absolute pride and joy I felt singing for the people of Brazil,” she wrote in part. “The sight of the crowd during my opening songs took my breath away. Your heart shines so bright, your culture is so vibrant and special, I hope you know how grateful I am to have shared this historical moment with you.”

“SNL 50” is nearing the end, with only two more episodes to go this season, but that doesn't mean it's time to turn things down quite yet. For her second round hosting at Studio 8H, Quinta Brunson pumped up the volume, kicking off the show with a musical monologue that featured both pop star Sabrina Carpenter and basketball phenom Dwayne Wade, then filling out each sketch with energy and dynamism. Not everything landed perfectly, with the writing of many of the live bits feeling like the staff are just going through the motions, but Brunson's ability to commit to each role and work seamlessly off the cast more than made up for it.

It's been a while since a “Saturday Night Live” monologue really stood out, particularly this season with so many return hosts effecting a been-there-done-that attitude, but between Jack Black's crowd work in his episode last month and Brunson's showstopping number topping this one, it's nice to see this section of the show milked for all it's worth. Brunson's singing may not be quite on par with Carpenter, but her enthusiasm and stage presence brought the whole piece together. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Having kicked off her career doing BuzzFeed videos and “A Black Lady Sketch Show,” it's clear that Brunson's comedy skills are best suited to the pre-taped format (though her talent for live work should not go unrecognized). One of the best pre-taped moments of last night (and all season) saw Brunson adopt an older look alongside the show's longest cast member, Kenan Thompson. Together they play an aging couple informing their children of their new side hustle, which is basically a version of OnlyFans, but just for senior citizens. Considering Brunson has mostly had to keep it clean on “Abbott Elementary,” seeing her go so blue with her comedy and have so much fun doing it was a delight.

Another pre-taped moment that garnered a good amount of chuckles was a faux-ad for a new clothing brand named “Forever 31” (as opposed to the real life Forever 21). With most of the cast shifting into their early 30s, it was the perfect opportunity to highlight the alterations that occur to ones presentation/styling when moving on from their raucous 20s. The looks on display were all too familiar, making the joke even that much funnier for its sense of radical honesty.

 










We love a pair of “SNL” besties and Sarah Sherman and Bowen Yang might just top the list. Though they don't always end up in a sketch together, they are more often than not seen embracing during the goodnights of every show. When they do get to play off one another, as they did last night during Weekend Update, it's typically always a sight to behold. Playing two skeezy suburbanites likely from New Jersey or Long Island, Sherman and Yang worked off one another like a finely tuned orchestra, heaping praise upon the chain restaurant Applebees and bemoaning its recent bankruptcy. Come for the shared filled fishbowl drink and questionable pigtails and stache, stay for unavoidable kissing the two end up getting into.

“Saturday Night Live” returns May 11 with host Walton Goggins and musical guest Arcade Fire.

It was the biggest show of the pop star's career that drew some 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach.


							By 

	The Associated Press



	Police in Brazil said on Sunday that two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro.


	The event, on Saturday, was the biggest show of the pop star's career that drew some 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach.




	Rio de Janeiro's state police said they had worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt an attack allegedly planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community. Police said the group sought to radicalize and recruit teenagers to carry out attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives.

	“The plan was treated as a ‘collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,” the police said.


	Authorities said they arrested two people in connection with the planned attack — the alleged leader of the group on illegal weapons possession charges in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a teenager on child pornography charges in Rio.


	Authorities said police raided the locations of 15 suspects across several states in Brazil and confiscated phones and other electronic devices.


	Lady Gaga's publicists and concert promoters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


	The Justice Ministry said members of the group falsely presented themselves online as “Little Monsters” — Lady Gaga's nickname for her fans — in order to reach teenagers and lure them into “networks with violent and self-destructive content.”


	Police said they carried out the operation quietly on Saturday “avoiding panic or distortion of information among the population.” The ministry said there was no impact on those attending the free concert.

	Brazilian police revealed Sunday that they thwarted a terror attack that would have targeted Lady Gaga's record-breaking concert at Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach.


	The Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro state and Brazil's Justice Ministry announced two arrests the morning after the concert, adding that suspects were planning to carry out a bomb attack at the concert that drew an estimated 2.5 million people.


	According to police (via Reuters), the plot was orchestrated by a group “promoting hate speech [against the LGBTQ community] and the radicalization of teenagers.” 


	“The suspects were recruiting participants, including minors, to carry out coordinated attacks using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails,” the police said in a statement. “The plan was treated as a ‘collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media.”


	One male suspect described as the group's leader was arrested in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul for illegal possession of a firearm, while a teenager in Rio de Janeiro was detained for storing child pornography.

It marked the pop star's first performance in Brazil in over a decade.

	Mitchell Peters



Lady Gaga performed to a record-breaking crowd during her free concert at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Saturday (May 3).


	“Tonight, we're making history,” she told the massive audience. “Thank you for making history with me.”


	The concert began around 10 p.m. local time, with the 39-year-old pop icon opening with her 2011 track “Bloody Mary.” She followed it with a hit-filled set including fan favorites like “Poker Face” and “Alejandro,” as well as music from her latest Billboard 200-topping album, Mayhem.


	Concert organizers estimated that approximately 2.1 million people attended the free Copacabana Beach show, according to Associated Press. The event is now the highest-attended concert by a female artist in history, surpassing Madonna's 2024 performance at the same venue, which drew 1.6 million.


	The largest concert crowd in history is still held by Rod Stewart, who drew 3.5 million fans to a New Year's Eve performance at Copacabana Beach in 1994, according to the Guinness World Records.

	











	Gaga's performance drew over 1 million Brazilians and approximately 500,000 Little Monsters who flew in for the show, generating more than $100,000 for Rio's economy, NPR reports. The city's tourism department has announced that free concerts will continue to be held at Copacabana Beach at least through 2028.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The Rio concert marked Gaga's first performance in Brazil since 2012.


	“I've missed you so much,” the superstar told the crowd during a soundcheck the night before the show, according to Rolling Stone. “I know that this is not the first show here, I know this is just a rehearsal, it feels like it's the real show.”


	In 2017, Gaga canceled her Rock in Rio performance due to “severe physical pain,” later revealing she had been hospitalized at the time.

SUNDAY UPDATE: Coming in a touch lower than where we saw it heading yesterday, Marvel Studios/Disney's Thunderbolts* has opened to $162.1M globally, including $86.1M from the international box office. The worldwide bow is within the pre-weekend projected opening range. 


	Overseas, the Florence Pugh-starrer launched at No. 1 or No. 1 non-local in nearly all major markets as well as most smaller markets. The international debut is estimated to be 45% ahead of Shang-Chi, 13% above Ant-Man and 7% over Guardians of the Galaxy in like-for-like markets at current rates (excluding China).

	The film played best in Latin America and smaller Asian markets, while Europe was a bit mixed. Although overall Saturday bumps didn't pan out as hoped, parts of Europe saw some of the biggest Friday-Saturday increases which reflects the impact of changing weather. Similar to the U.S., reviews and social sentiment internationally are generally strong, and Thunderbolts* has runway before the next major wide opener.

	Before we dig into further detail, a note about the other top players: Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie currently stands at $873.4M global after an international weekend of $26.6M (-33%). The overseas total is $475.2M. Also from WB, Sinners had an impressive -27% hold in its third offshore frame. The international cume to date is $57M for $236.7M worldwide.


	Back to Thunderbolts*. It released day-and-date globally, and, as previously noted, was not expected to do mega business in China and Korea (see below). China nevertheless is the top opening market (it started on a non-traditional Wednesday) with $10.4M through Sunday.


	After that, the UK, which had super summer weather heading into the weekend, grossed $7.7M. 


	In Latin America, Thunderbolts* opened at No. 1 in every market and had the 2nd highest debut of 2025 across the region, Brazil (including previews) and Mexico (including previews) as well as Central America, Chile and Paraguay. The regional opening weekend was ahead of Ant-Man, Shang-Chi, Eternals and Captain America: Brave New World.


	Across Europe, Thunderbolts* opened at No. 1 in all markets except for Finland and Sweden which were behind the continued play of Minecraft.


Thunderbolts* had the 2nd highest opening of 2025 in the Middle East and 3rd highest opening of 2025 in France and Spain as well as Iceland, Portugal and South Africa.

	











	Across Asia-Pacific, Thunderbolts* was No. 1 non-local in all markets except for Japan where it was the No. 2 studio title. It scored the 2nd highest studio opening of 2025 in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand; and the best non-local opening of 2025 in Hong Kong, India, Malaysia and Singapore.


	The Top 10 starts were: China ($10.4M), UK ($7.7M), Mexico ($7.3M), Brazil ($4M), France ($3.8M), Germany ($3.6M), Korea ($3.5M), Australia ($3.4M), Japan ($3.2M) and Spain ($2.8M).


A Minecraft Movie, meanwhile, continues to climb, with an overseas drop of just 33%, propelled by increases in China (+38%), Chile (+8%), Brazil (+7%), Japan (+5%) and Argentina (+2%). Other notable holds include Norway (-15%), Spain (-16%), Denmark (-19%), Mexico (-21%), Peru (-23%), Colombia (-24%), Poland (-25%), Holland (-32%), Korea (-33%), and Germany (-45%).


	In the Nordics, the film has become the all-time biggest video game adaptation topping The Super Mario Bros. Movie by 14%. Note that the original game hails from Sweden. The $475.2M international running total has surpassed the lifetime offshore grosses of fellow WB titles The Dark Knight, Wonka, Wonder Woman, The Batman and Dune: Part Two.


	The Top 5 so far are the UK ($69M), Germany ($35.7M), Australia ($33.5M), Mexico ($31.2M) and China ($27.5M). 


	As for Ryan Coogler's Sinners, another $10.4M from 71 overseas markets included exceptional holds in Latin America (-9%) and Europe (-27%), with individual market highlights in Saudi Arabia (+29%), Brazil (+8%), Sweden (-3%), Holland (-5%), Belgium (-10%), Spain (-12%), Germany (-14%), Denmark (-15%), Mexico (-17%), Argentina (-22%), Australia (-23%), UAE (-28%), UK (-31%), and France (-34%). 


	In like-for-like markets and using today's exchange rates, the film is tracking 110% over Speak No Evil, 75% higher than Nope, 49% ahead of Get Out, 27% above Us and 20% over Creed.


	The Top 5 to date are the UK ($13.8M), France ($6.7M), Australia ($4.3M), Mexico ($3.4M) and Germany ($2.7M).


	Rounding out the WB triumverate, The Accountant 2 (an Amazon MGM Studios title that WB handles overseas), the Ben Affleck sequel tallied up another $7.2M in 72 international markets in the sophomore frame (-43%). The offshore running cume now stands at $24.6M and the worldwide total is $65.7M through Sunday.


MISC UPDATED CUMES/NOTABLEUntil Dawn (SNY): $6.4M intl weekend (60 markets); $20.4M intl cume/$34.7M globalThe Amateur (DIS): $2.3M intl weekend (52 markets); $50.8M intl cume/$87.7M globalBlack Bag (UNI): $754K intl weekend (63 markets); $17.8M intl cume/$39.2M globalDrop (UNI): $585K intl weekend (74 markets); $11.3M intl cume/$27.7M globalDog Man (UNI): $482K intl weekend (68 markets); $46.1M intl cume/$144.1M global


PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: Marvel Studios/Disney's Thunderbolts* kicked off international box office play on Wednesday, and through Friday has an estimated overseas cume of $47.2M from 52 material markets. The day-and-date global rollout is rolling up to a projected $165M+ through Sunday. This is in line with the pre-weekend estimated range.


	As Anthony has noted, the domestic bow now has as a shot at coming in at $73M-$77M.


	Overseas, the ragtag bunch of antiheroes is, as a whole, playing best in Latin America, and also scoring in the UK and Asia with projected No. 1s  everywhere (outside of Korea and China, which was expected – more on that below).

	











	Note that May 1st was a holiday in many markets – though the UK will take the day off on Monday — while weather in Europe is also a factor. 


	The well-reviewed Florence Pugh-starrer is hoping to see walk-up business on Saturday and Sunday and thus should finish the weekend within the range we wrote about earlier this week. 


	The Top 5 markets through Friday are China ($7.1M), Mexico ($4.2M), UK ($3.1M), Brazil ($2.2M) and France ($2.1M).


	As expected, we're not seeing big action in China with the Jake Schreier-directed first installment MCU movie having opened on a non-traditional Wednesday and playing into a competitive frame with lots of new local titles. Through Saturday, the estimated China cume is about $9M (note that today's numbers are not included in the running total above).


	We'll have a full update tomorrow.

	President Donald Trump, when asked if he has an obligation to uphold the Constitution as president, said, “I don't know.”


	Trump made the disturbing comment during an interview with Kristen Welker on NBC's Meet the Press while discussing his campaign promise to deport millions of immigrants. Trump, who himself is free because he exploited his own due process rights, has denied those same rights to immigrants he sent without trial to an infamous mega-prison in El Salvador.


	“Your Secretary of State says everyone who's here, citizens and non-citizens, deserve due process. Do you agree, Mr. President?” Welker asked Trump.


	“I don't know. I'm not, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know,” he said.

Welker: Do you agree that everyone who is here deserves due process? Citizens and noncitizens?Trump: I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.Welker: The 5th amendment says as much.. Don't you need to uphold the constitution?Trump: I don't know pic.twitter.com/1y8POREX9S


	It's a terrifying answer from a president who, like other presidents before him, swore while taking the oath of office to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”


	When Welker pressed Trump, pointing out that the Fifth Amendment entitles everyone in the U.S. to due process, he again said, “I don't know.”

	











	“It seems — it might say that, but if you're talking about that, then we'd have to have a million or two million or three million trials,” Trump continued. “We have thousands of people that are some murderers and some drug dealers and some of the worst people on Earth.”


	The Fifth Amendment states that “no person shall… be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” making no distinction between citizens and non-citizens.


	Welker then asked Trump whether he needs to “uphold the Constitution of the United States as president.”


	“I don't know,” Trump said, adding that his lawyers “are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.”


	But, he added, “What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. They have a different interpretation.”


	The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Trump must bring back Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man that Trump's own lawyers have admitted was accidentally deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's deportation was a violation of an earlier “protection from removal” order by a judge that should have prevented him from being sent out of the U.S.

	The court late last month also temporarily blocked Trump from deporting another group of Venezuelan immigrants using the Alien Enemies Act without first granting them an opportunity to contest their deportation.

	











	While Trump has whined that “communist, radical-left judges” are impeding his deportations, despite the fact that he nominated three sitting Supreme Court justices. Even a Trump-appointed federal district judge ruled that his use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport undocumented immigrants and deny them due process is unlawful. 


	“The President cannot summarily declare that a foreign nation or government has threatened or perpetrated an invasion or predatory incursion of the United States, followed by the identification of the alien enemies subject to detention or removal,” District Court Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. wrote in a ruling on Thursday. 


	But in the interview Trump insisted that he has an electoral mandate to deport undocumented immigrants.

	“I was elected to get them the hell out of here and the courts are holding me from doing it,” he said.


	In a recent NewsNation-DDHQ poll, a slim majority of respondents (51 percent) said that immigrants without legal status are entitled to a hearing a due process before being deported.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM: Thunderbolts* at a $76M opening, isn't the most stellar of Disney Marvel Studios' openings, but, heck, this is significantly better than the start of summer a year ago when Universal's original action romcom, The Fall Guy, fell on his face with a $27.7M start. With a $162.1M global opening, Thunderbolts* is just $3M shy of where we forecasted. The movie cost before P&A, $180M. 


	There can be agita in the industry when a movie doesn't exactly wow and kick off summer with a $100M-plus opening, however Thunderbolts* start isn't anything to worry about knowing that Memorial Day is teed up for a possible record-breaking 4-day weekend with Disney's Lilo & Stitch eyeing at least $120M and Paramount's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning at $80M+. 

	











	With an A- CinemaScore, plus other great exists in PostTrak and Rotten Tomatoes, Disney is hoping that Thunderbolts* holds better than recent less-than-$100M openers, i.e. Eternals ($71.2M, -62% second weekend drop, B CinemaScore, $164.8M final) and Captain America: Brave New World ($88.8M opening, -68% second weekend plummet, B- CinemaScore, $200.2M domestic final). With 38% women giving Thunderbolts* an A, there's anticipation that more of them will show up next weekend for Mothers Day; the pic's only competition being Lionsgate's Kerry Washington-Omar Sy movie, Shadow Force. Also, Thunderbolts* skewed young at 62% under 35, which was another promising sign to Disney in regards to more business down the road. Comscore says there's 32% of all colleges are on summer break next Friday, increasing to 49% on May 12. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	What's going on here with Thunderbolts*? Why wasn't it higher? We knew it was in the $70M-range heading into the weekend. Not to rain on Disney's parade, because, really, exhibition is thankful for a deep bench of titles with the entire weekend doing $146M +98% from a year ago), but there wasn't a great degree of FOMO for this antiheroes movie about Yelena Belova, Winter Soldier, etc; they aren't exactly a gang of Paul Kerseys multiplied by five with questionable and acerbic methods. DC's Suicide Squad could roll the Thunderbolts in a barrel. 


	The focus of Disney's marketing campaign for Thunderbolts* was ‘Not Super. Not Heroes' with an angle on the sarcastic twist of assembling assassins forced to work together from the movie Black Widow and series Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Hawkeye. The marketing also highlighted Florence Pugh's performance and complex duality, while also emphasizing the heroes' chemistry. 

	











	Marvel, of course, began the campaign for Thunderbolts* at last July's San Diego Comic-Con when they gave Hall H a first look at the trailer and assembled the cast onstage. There was a Super Bowl 30-second spot and an absolute cinema trailer via Letterboxd. 


	There was a promotional partner campaign valued at $75M, which was bigger than other stand-alone MCU titles, led by Tide, HD and Wheaties. The intent was to partner with brands that aligned and mirrored the irreverent, edgy and fun nature of the movie. 


	Tide's campaign included Captain America and a situation involving “collateral stains” with a spot featuring a news van crew during an action-packed moment from the trailer.


	Harley Davidson had their largest cinematic collaboration to date, with the movie timed to their launch of the 2025 Pan America ST bike placed in the film, a spot, in-dealership support and an editorial feature for their exclusive magazine with interviews of stunt professionals.


	Very clever: Disney and Wheaties created a first-of-its-kind limited-edition Wheaties box, which also became something of a promo one-sheet and theater lobby standee. In addition, popcorn boxes at the premiere were emblazoned with the image. 


	Mike and Ike hosted a branded road trip activation featuring custom-wrapped trucks that visited 80+ colleges across the country. Students received co-branded product and Fandango movie ticket giveaways. 


	There was also a joint partnership with Cupra Kiro and Formula E, the premier competition for electrically powered, single-seater racing cars, including a co-branded Cupra Kiro race car livery competing in races in Miami (broadcast exposure on CBS Sports) and Monaco, co-branded driver helmet, spot, and in-stadium content integration during the races.

	With LinkedIn, Marvel and Disney leveraged the “Red Guardian Limo Service” content piece to reinforce their message to job seekers and professionals. 


	Perfect Sports, the leading brand in the protein powder/performance nutrition, had Thunderbolts* branded products via Walmart.com, Amazon, GNC and Vitamin Shoppe, with in-gym exposure throughout Canada, and social/influencer campaigns.


Thunderbolts* repped Arizona Iced Tea's first-time co-branding with a movie. Ten million cans were splashed with the movie's logo at major convenience stores including 7-Eleven, AM/PM, and Circle K.


	Some of the digital and social stunts included the cast member's arriving in CinemaCon in Red Guardian's limo then crashing Disney's presentation in character. 

A post shared by Marvel Studios (@marvelstudios)


	Speaking of the Red Guardian Limo Service, there was a micro campaign created for social with a commercial and stunted outdoor to coincide with tickets on sale telling moviegoers to dial 1-833-RED-LIM0.


	A jump featurette highlighted Pugh's stunt work as she leaped off the second highest building in the world. 


	EntTelligence reports that 4.7M people went to see Thunderbolts* this weekend, 1M less than Captain America: Brave New World. 


	Also per EntTelligence today, those trailers pushed in-theater on Thunderbolts* were Fantastic Four: First Steps (100%, July 25), Predator: Badlands (86%, Nov. 7) and Tron: Ares (85%, Oct. 10).

SATURDAY AM: Marvel Studios and Disney's Thunderbolts* has a shot at coming in a bit better for the weekend at $73M-$77M. As we told you, Friday was close to $32M, with Disney calling it at $31.5M.


	While we'd expect more and want more from Marvel during the first weekend of summer, when you include Thunderbolts* in with all the other holdovers in the marketplace, there's nothing to complain about with all titles doing an estimated $145M this weekend. This is where originals now live with Marvel post Covid. However, what Thunderbolts* has going for itself are its exits. Audiences gave it a solid A- as compared to the B- they smacked Captain America: Brave New World with, and the Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Hannah John-Kamen and Geraldine Viswanathan-led movie has a great 71% definite recommend on PostTrak. All of that bodes well for this pic holding in the summer to come. You'll remember, there was some cynicism with the bowing of Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3 with a $118.4M opening, and that yielded a -19% ease in its second weekend and a 3x domestic multiple with a near $359M cume.


	More upbeat results from Thunderbolts*: 75% told PostTrak they want to see a sequel, while 40% said they went to watch because of the cast and 53% mentioned the big reason why they bought a ticket was because it's a Marvel movie. Diversity demos are 42% Caucasian, 26% Hispanic and Latino, 17% Black and 10% Asian. Men over 25 came in at 45%, women over 25 at 25%, men under 25 at 20% and women under 25 at 10%. This is a very similar turnout in terms of demo ages as Captain America: Brave New World; men under 25 were a little lower at 18%. Also diversity demos on that movie were 36% Caucasian, 26% Hispanic and Latino, 23% Black and 10% Asian.


	IMAX and PLF are repping 39% of the weekend with 3D generating separately 11% (Disney has to get moviegoers back in a 3D mindset so they're primed for Avatar: Fire & Ash later this year). Best plays are East, Mountain and West. The AMC Dine-In Disney Springs (Fla.) leads single-location gross at $106K.

	











Thunderbolts*‘ social media universe stands at 570M according to analytics corp RelishMix, which is not far from Captain America: Brave New World‘s near 600M, but lower than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3‘s 709.7M followers across TikTok, YouTube, X, Instagram and Facebook. Pugh is not only the key cast driver in the run-up, but her well-boosted videos have driven over 23M views. Also on board are Harbour at 9.4M fans and Julia Louis-Dreyfus at 1.8M.


	Meanwhile, Warner Bros' Sinners is shaping up for a massive $33M third weekend, -28%. That is, of course, the best third weekend for a horror movie ahead of It‘s $29.7M third weekend. The 70MM Imax screenings which are coming back on May 15 are selling out, sources say. More depth to the box office has Warners' A Minecraft Movie at $13M for the weekend in third.


	Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 is now looking at a second weekend of $9.8M, -60% and a running 10-day of $41.4M.


	Also opening this weekend is Roadside Attractions' pick-up of Cannes title The Surfer starring Nicolas Cage, and it's shaping up for a 3-day around $750K after a $325K Friday at 1,085 theaters. Audiences at 48% on Rotten Tomatoes aren't catching the wave like critics are with an 86% certified fresh critical score. 


	The Alec Baldwin Rust western opened on 115 theaters to a very low estimated $25K or $217 per screen. That's not good — but here's what's going on. This is a theatrical day-and-date movie, so the marketing spend, which is minimal here, is weighted to promoting the movie on digital. Furthermore, whenever a theatrical distributor does a day-and-date PVOD release, contractually with the cable companies and digital OTT services, they have to open the movie in a specified amount of theaters. Falling Forward Films, the distributor of Rust, is a gun-for-hire by the producers. Funds from the pic go back to the family of late DP Halyna Hutchins, who was shot on the set. The better share of the film's revenues lie in PVOD, not theatrical. With PVOD, 80% of the revenue generally goes back to the distributor vs. the 50/50 exhibitor-distributor rental from the domestic box office.


	The Sailesh Kolanu crime thriller follows Arjun Sarkaar, a top Homicide Intervention Team officer from Visakhapatnam, who is sent to Jammu and Kashmir to investigate a series of brutal murders. As he pursues a group of elusive killers, the case tests his skills and mental strength. Best markets are Austin, Dallas, Seattle, Toronto, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York City and Baltimore.


AFTERNOON UPDATE: Marvel Studios and Disney's Thunderbolts* is looking at $32M today, including last night's $11.5M previews, for what's shaping up to be a $70M-$75M opening at 4,330 theaters, which has more or less been par for the course for an MCU original title post Covid. The movie has great reviews and immediate thumbs-up from fans. Clearly by tomorrow night, we'll know if it catches on and enters the Guardians of the Galaxy threshold ($94.3M), but as of this minute, no one is seeing it at that altitude.

	











	The opening of Thunderbolts* alone will exceed the total amount that all films made a year ago during the first frame of May ($73.9M, per Box Office Mojo). That's because the strikes pushed the release of Marvel's Deadpool & Wolverine to late July; Universal's The Fall Guy didn't excite anyone with a $27.7M start. The top five movies alone have the potential to do $137M in business, making this a solid weekend.


	Staying strong is Warner Bros' Sinners with $9M today and a 3-day between $30M-$35M at 3,347 — a terrific hold at -23% to -34% in Weekend 3. By comparison, Jordan Peele's Get Out posted a third weekend of $20.7M in 2017, -27%. Cume by Sunday will be $176.6M-$181.6M.


	Warners had bragging rights for third place as well with Legendary co-production A Minecraft Movie at 3,571 sites doing $3M today — $13M, -43% in its fifth weekend — for a running total of $397.5M.


	Fourth goes to Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 with a Friday of $3M, second weekend of $11.2M, -51%, and a running total of $41.6M, which is 12% behind the 2016 original at the same point in time.


	Sony Screen Gems' Until Dawn at 3,055 locations is in fifth with $1M in its second Friday and a $3M second weekend, -59% for an estimated running total by Sunday of $13.8M.


UPDATE AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Disney's official figure Thunderbolts* last night is $11.5M. More good news for Thunderbolts* this weekend: Out of the gate it has 4 1/2 stars on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak and a great 74% definite recommend. Also, 5 stars with kids under 12 and parents.


	The figure isn't that far from the $12M chalked up by February's Captain America: Brave New World; that preview repped 29% of the Anthony Mackie pic's first Friday, which turned into an $88.8M 3-day. Last night's money for the Pugh, Harbour and Stan-led movie is also under that of Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3 which posted $17.5M in previews for a $48.1M Friday and $118.4M 3-day.


	Warner Bros' Sinners ends its second week with $69M at 3,347 theaters, -11%, and a running cume of $146.6M. Yesterday was $4.8M, -20% from Wednesday. Even with Sinners ceding its premium screens this weekend, it's expected to have a robust hold. It was announced that the Ryan Coogler-directed title will return to nine select IMAX 70MM theaters from May 15-21.


	Disney/20th Century Studios' Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith didn't play on Thursday; however, the re-release's gross through Wednesday is $34.1M. The lifetime cume of the George Lucas Episode III is $414.3M.


	Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 is third for the week with $31.6M at 3,610 screens, after a $1.2M Thursday, -18% from Wednesday. The Ben Affleck Artists Equity sequel is slightly behind the original movie's first week tally of $33.8M.


	Warner Bros' A Minecraft Movie ends its fourth week with $27.2M at 3,841 sites, -49%, and a running cume of $384.5M. Thursday's take was $950K, -7% from Wednesday. 


	Sony Screen Gems' Until Dawn has a first week of $10.5M after a $527K Thursday, -5% from Wednesday. 


EXCLUSIVE: Disney and Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* is off to a very good start with around $11M tonight, we hear from non-Disney sources. Always know that forecast can swing higher or lower by the time late night monies come in Friday AM. Hopefully tonight's previews are an indicator to better days at the summer B.O. and that the current momentum from A Minecraft Movie and Sinners keeps up.

	











	Marvel had to postpone last year's summer kickoff pic, Deadpool & Wolverine, to late July due to the impact of the strikes. 


	Not only does the Pugh and Stan vehicle have a solid start, but it's also winning fans over tonight with a 96% Rotten Tomatoes audience score after its 88% certified fresh rating with critics. That's better than the MCU's Captain America: Brave New World from February (48% critics, 78% audience) which saw an $88.8M 3-day, $100M 4-day over the Valentine's Day/President's Day weekend, which translated to $200.2M stateside and $414.8M global take.

	Tonight's previews are roughly a million under Captain America: Brave New World's $12M, but they're also ahead of 2021's Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings ($8.8M) and Eternals ($9.5M). The weekend projection yesterday for the ragtag superhero movie — which is sort of a sequel to Disney+ series The Falcon and Winter Soldier and Hawkeye, as well as the movie Black Widow — was $70M-$75M stateside at 4,300 sites and $175M on the high end of its global start. Thunderbolts* (not to be confused with Thundercats) has all the premium ticket upcharges in IMAX, Dolby, ScreenX, 4DX, etc.


	We told you in the past week that previews/presales for Thunderbolts* are behind Captain America: Brave New World. However, presales for the Jake Schreier-helmed MCU title continue to be ahead of 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings ($75.3M) and Eternals ($71.2M opening).


	We'll have more intel on Warner Bros' Sinners‘ third weekend tomorrow; however, some rivals are estimating that the Ryan Coogler-directed, Michael B. Jordan-starring period vampire movie is headed to a 3-day of $35M, which would be a remarkable dip of -23%. Forecasts had Sinners easing -25% to -30% in its third weekend for $32M-$34.2M yesterday.

The Oscars is held at the Dolby Theatre on Hollywood Blvd., which is right along the marathon route.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	The Oscars made the announcement on Monday, March 17: Comedian Conan O'Brien, who had earned top marks for hosting the 2025 Oscars, would be returning as host of the 2026 Oscars on Sunday, March 15, 2026.


	Most of us focused on the host announcement, which was made far earlier in the year than is typical, but Murphy Reinschreiber, COO of the McCourt Foundation, which operates the L.A. Marathon, immediately zeroed in the date, which was the same as the already-announced date of the 2026 L.A. Marathon, which is typically held on the third Sunday in March.

	











	The McCourt Foundation had announced its 2026 marathon date on March 15, one day before the 2025 marathon and two days before the Oscars made their announcement.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Reinschreiber was driving home after finishing work on this year's marathon when he learned of the double booking.


	“It was confusing and the other thought that went to my mind is there are just no days off in this business,” he told The Los Angeles Times. “It's one thing after the other.”


	It would be virtually impossible to have both megaevents on the same date. The Oscars is held at the Dolby Theatre on Hollywood Blvd., which is right along the marathon route. Both events require significant road closures and law enforcement deployment.


	After six weeks of uncertainty, a solution was finally reached on Thursday (May 1): The 98th Oscars will be held as originally scheduled. The McCourt Foundation will announce a new March date for the race in the coming days.


	Both parties also agreed that, to avoid future date conflicts, the L.A. Marathon will take place on the third Sunday in March (on which it has often but not always been held in recent years), and the Oscars will steer clear of that date. (Though the Oscars are often right around this date, this was the first time the Oscars landed on the third Sunday in March since 1999.)


	Moving a marathon is no easy feat. The event spans a large chunk of the city and involves more than 25,000 runners, thousands of volunteers, medical personnel, law enforcement and city workers.


	“The number of people, communities and businesses that are all impacted by a change of date is mind-boggling,” Reinschreiber told the L.A. Times. “We are going to have to undergo a significant community awareness program.”

	











	More than 5,000 people have registered for the 2026 Marathon, and they will need to be offered the option of a refund due to the change in date, he said.


	Who in city government wasn't on top of things and allowed two megaevents to be scheduled for the same date? No one is saying.


	With this conflict resolved, it's official: The 2026 Oscars will air live on ABC on Sunday, March 15 at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT. It's the third year in a row that the telecast will start at 4 p.m. on the West Coast — in an effort to make it so that East Coast viewers can find out who wins the biggest awards before they go to bed. (This year's show ended at 10:50 p.m. ET, making that goal a reality for all but the earliest risers.)


	The show will again be held at the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Theater in Hollywood, its home base for every year but one since 2002. (The best-forgotten 2021 pandemic show was held at the Union Station in downtown L.A.)


Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan will return as the show's executive producers for the third consecutive year. They first served in that capacity in 2024, when Kimmel hosted. They each won Primetime Emmys for outstanding variety special (live) for that show. Kapoor had previously won for outstanding variety special (pre-recorded) for his work on Adele: One Night Only.


	Jeff Ross and Mike Sweeney will return as producers for a second time. Sweeney will also serve as a writer. Sweeney has won three Primetime Emmys for previous productions with O'Brien. Ross has won one.

Lady Gaga performed to a record-breaking crowd Saturday at Rio De Janeiro, Brazil as an estimated 2.5 million people attended the singer's free concert on Copacabana Beach.


	The gig marked the highest attended concert by a female artist in history, according to the singer's reps, eclipsing the 1.6 million people Madonna drew to the same venue last year.


	“Tonight, we're making history… Thank you for making history with me,” Lady Gaga told the crowd, which included over a million Brazilians as well as a reported 500,000 Little Monsters who flew in for the special show, which injected over $100 million into Rio's economy, NPR reported.


	The record holder for largest concert crowd in history — according to Guinness World Records — remains Rod Stewart, who attracted a crowd of over 4 million to Copacabana Beach on New Year's Eve in 1994.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The Copacabana Beach concert marked Lady Gaga's first concert in Brazil since 2012. “I've missed you so much”, she told an enormous crowd that gathered the previous night just to watch her soundcheck. “I know that this is not the first show here, I know this is just a rehearsal, it feels like it's the real show.”

	The concert itself found Gaga replicating the five-act “gothic opera” that she performed during her headlining sets at Coachella and other Mayhem Ball stops thus far. She'll next travel to Singapore for four shows in that country later this month before the North American arena leg of the Mayhem Ball tour begins in July.


	Rio De Janeiro's tourism department previously announced plans to continue staging free Copacabana Beach concerts until at least 2028

	The forthcoming conclave to select the new Pope has gained a whole new group of interested observers, following the success of Oscar-nominated film Conclave starring Ralph Fiennes.


	Based on the bestselling 2016 novel by Robert Harris, it details the process where cardinals (male, under the age of 80) from across the world gather in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel for a process to choose the next Pontiff, while the public wait outside for a decision. The news is then announced with a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney on the roof of the Chapel. The conclave to elect Pope Francis's successor will begin on Wednesday May 7.

	However, with all the secrecy, private discussions that occur in corridors outside the Chapel and reports of deal-making, Harris says the process is more akin to another screen hit – TV show The Traitors.

The Traitors has been a huge hit for the BBC since debuting in the UK in 2022, with international versions now screening across the world. It sees “faithful” contestants tasked with trying to work out the “traitors” among them, before being “murdered” and eliminated from the game and a chance to share in the cash prize.


Harris told the BBC:


	“[It's] the nearest analogy I can come to. Suddenly everyone swings to one person – you can't see why, particularly, but it happens,”


	“And in a funny way, a similar dynamic does operate in a conclave, which is why often it produces a surprise.”


	Harris suggested that political parties electing a new leader could learn from the process:


	“To lock the door and say you're not going to come out until you've come up with a result concentrates the mind – and if you look back, the popes have been pretty good.


	“I didn't come away from researching the novel thinking this is a terrible idea [and that] I must write a novel to expose how awful it is. In a way, the novel shows a conclave working.”

Marvel's star-studded ensemble pic led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan is winning over critics and audiences alike as it kicks off the summer box office season.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Marvel's Thunderbolts* is storming to a promising domestic opening in the $73 million to $77 million range after topping Friday's chart with $31.5 million, including $11.5 million in Thursday previews.


	The star-studded movie, led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan, is kicking off the summer box office in what's become a tradition for Kevin Feige‘s studio with only a few exceptions. The pic is winning over critics and audiences alike; Thunderbolts* boasts a glowing 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, making it the third-highest score for a title in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a tie with Spider-Man: Far From Home and behind Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (98 percent) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (97 percent). It's still early, of course, and scores can change by one or two points as the weekend wears on. And on PostTrak exit polls, audiences are giving it a rave 4.5 out of 5 stars, while it received an A- CinemaScore.

	Heading into the weekend, tracking suggests the movie will open in the $70 million to $73 million range domestically and $160 million to $175 million globally, against a $180 million production budget before marketing. Word of mouth is seeing that number climb higher, although some rivals see it coming in between $72 million and $75 million.


	As a comparison, Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World had an audience RT score of 92 percent when opening to $88.8 million earlier this year. (That film's critics score was a rotten 48 percent, compared to 88 percent for Thunderbolts*.)


	The unexpected spring bloom is currently underway at the box office — led by Ryan Coogler's sleeper sensation Sinners — proves that people want the communal experience of watching a film together. Regarding Sinners, the Warner Bros. hit is enjoying a phenomenal third weekend, even if it falls to second place. The supernatural vampire pic continues to break all the rules and could fall just 26 percent this weekend to $33.7 million for a domestic tally north of $180 million.


Thunderbolts* is a pivotal moment for Marvel as it kicks off a new hoped-for franchise. Directed by Jake Schreier, the film brings together a band of dysfunctional outsiders — and lesser-known comic book characters — who discover their potential to be heroes when working together.

	











	In addition to Pugh (Yelena Belova) and Stan (Bucky Barnes), the movie features Wyatt Russell (John Walker), David Harbour (Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian), Lewis Pullman (Bob), Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost), Olga Kurylenko (Taskmaster) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (CIA director Valentine Allegra de Fontaine).


	“Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan lead a gratifyingly fresh and soulful Marvel adventure,” The Hollywood Reporter‘s chief film critic David Rooney writes in his review. “While a handful of the characters and the actors playing them have appeared in previous entries, there's a disarming freshness to this first-time assembly, not to mention something even more unexpected: heart. That's due to an appealing ensemble cast and the new blood of a creative team with a distinctive take on the genre.”


	In the film, Louis-Dreyfus' villainous character has positioned a number of MCU loners and rejects to kill each other for her own nefarious reasons. But they instead decide to team up in response to the obvious setup, bringing along newcomer Bob, who suffers from a mental illness that has catastrophic consequences after he's subjected to cruel experimentation.


	Overseas, Thunderbolts* is opening everywhere timed to its release in North America, including in China.


	No other major studio dared open a wide release opposite the Marvel event pic. Elsewhere, Alec Baldwin's controversial-laced Rust finally opened in select theaters while also being available on premium VOD. The Western appears to be bombing — at least in cinemas — with an estimated opening gross of just $25,000 from 115 theaters.

	











	The movie opens four years after Baldwin, who co-wrote and produced the film, accidentally discharged a weapon he thought only had blanks. A live round was in the chamber, and the bullet fatally wounded cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and also hit director-wirter Joel Souza. What followed was a dramatic, closely reported story that revealed on-set negligence and raised questions about industry practices around gun safety. Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Still, his case was dismissed after new evidence came to light that Baldwin's lawyers alleged had been buried by the prosecutors. The film's prop armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was also charged and is serving an 18-month prison sentence. 


	Baldwin paid a settlement to Hutchins' surviving family and Matthew Hutchins, the widower, was made an executive producer on the project. In a recent interview, Souza said the family ultimately wanted to finish the film, and asked that he return. When all is said and one, he says he regrets ever making the movie.

Saturday Night Live host Quinta Brunson sang about what it's like being under five feet tall–something that Sabrina Carpenter popped in to say she could relate to.


	The Abbott Elementary creator and star, who last hosted SNL in April 2023, prefaced her showtune: “I'm proof you can do anything you put your mind to, even if people look down on you, whether it's because of where you come from or literally because you're only 4′11.” 


	Brunson then sang about how some experiences at her height unintentionally turn out well.


	“I went for a walk in the park the other day, and didn't even realize I had won a limbo competition,” Brunson revealed. 


	After comparing herself to the 4'8″ Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Simone Biles, the 5'5″ rapper Kendrick Lamar, and the 5'7″ actor Tom Holland, Carpenter sidled up to her.

	Brunson asked: “One shorty to another: When you eat short ribs, does it just taste like ribs?”

	











	“I've never thought about it like that, but yeah!” Carpenter replied. “Here's a question for you: When you read short stories, do they feel like novels?”


	The two traded off lines until 5'6″ SNL cast member Marcello Hernandez joined in, followed by former NBA star Dwayne Wade, who towered over them all at 6'4″.


	Yet being that height in the league, Wade said, made it seem like he was 4'10”.

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took aim at Donald Trump imagining himself as the next Pope, as well as the president's claim that he actually isn't ruining the economy and Americans should just “be patient.”


	“Well, guys, it happened. Last night, Trump posted an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope, apparently ordering a one-way ticket to hell,” Colin Jost joked. “Who posts a photo of themselves dressed as a guy who died a week ago? Trump was at the Pope's funeral. That means he walked past an open casket and was like, ‘We should do a Who Wore It Best.'”


	“As a Catholic, I just feel like Trump's photo was really disrespectful,” Jost continued. “Also, if Trump really wants to be Pope, he should probably stay away from JD Vance.”


	Co-anchor Michael Che then turned to Trump pleading with Americans to “be patient” when it comes to the contracting economy, while also continuing to blame his predecessor.

	“If his brain gets any worse, he's going to be patient,” Che joked as an image of Trump in a mental health facility showed on screen.

	











	Also on the economy, Jost reacted to Trump saying at a recent Cabinet meeting that, due to his tariffs, children may have to make do with two dolls “instead of 30” this Christmas.


	“Now I rarely talk directly to the president, but you listen, and you listen good: If I wake up on Christmas morning and run downstairs to find only two dolls under my tree, I will lose my f—ing mind,” he joked. “There better be a second tree with 28 dolls. And you know what? I've put up with a lot under Trump so far. He might be cutting social security. Okay, they're old. Screw 'em. He's deporting innocent kids? They've gotta grow up some time. But if only two dolls show up when I've made tea for thirty? Oh hell, no!”


	Che then riffed on Elon Musk stepping back from his role in DOGE.

The 'Abbott Elementary' creator-star returns to host the NBC sketch comedy show for the second time, alongside musical guest Benson Boone. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Sabrina Carpenter made a surprise cameo during Quinta Brunson‘s Saturday Night Live monologue, during which they performed a song all about honoring short people.


	Brunson began her SNL monologue by noting its her second time hosting the beloved show, before making a joke about being “proof you can do anything you put your mind to even if people look down on you.”




	“Whether it's because of where you come from or literally because you're only 4'11,” she joked. “Yeah, that's right. I'm short… But I love being short, and I want other short people to know the sky's the limit. So shorties, tonight, this one's for us!”

	The host then launched into a song about her height: “Being short is amazing, being short is just fine. I'm a cheap date cause I get wasted off of one glass of wine.”


	Brunson went on to reference some of the most notorious “shorties,” including Simone Biles, Kendrick Lamar and Tom Holland, before the camera then panned over to reveal the Grammy winner, surprising Brunson, who asked, “Sabrina, what are you doing here?”


	Carpenter replied, “I mean, you were talking about being short, so I thought I'd stop by.”


	“Sabrina, can I ask you something one shorty to another?” the host asked the singer. “Anything,” she responded to which Brunson joked, “When you eat short rib does it taste just like rib?”


	“I never thought about it like that, but yeah,” the “Espresso” singer responded, before Carpenter offered another height-related joke query: “Wait, here's a question for you. When you read short stories, do they feel like novels?”


SNL cast member Marcello Hernandez then joined Brunson and Carpenter on stage, where he poked fun at their height. “I just thought I would come stand next to you because it makes me look super tall.”


	“Come on, Marcello, you should be proud of being short,” Carpenter noted, before former NBA champion Dwyane Wade joined them on-stage. “Dwyane, sorry, what are you doing here?” Brunson asked, to which Wade responded, “Well, I was just in the audience watching SNL, and I heard your song about being short, and I felt seen.”


	“But, you're tall, you're 6'4″,” Brunson pointed out. “Yeah, but I'm 6'4″, and in basketball world, it's like 4'10″, Shaq's like 7'1″, and I just really want to be in the song,” he responded. 

	











	“Alright, I can't say no to you, Dwyane Wade,” Brunson affirmed, and the “shorties” closed out the opening monologue.


	Earlier in the night, SNL's cold open poked fun at Donald Trump's first 100 days in office — specifically joking about the president's many executive orders.


	“Well, it's been 100 years since I became president. Excuse me, days, wow, feels longer, but people are saying that what I've done so far has single-handedly helped win people elections, mostly in Canada,” James Austin Johnson's Trump joked. “Also I signed 147 executive orders, everything from banning paper straws to defunding PBS. I understand Elmo has now been apprehended by ICE, brought to you by the letter ‘L' for El Salvador. He's not coming back.”


	Johnson's Trump invited Stephen Miller (played by Mikey Day), the White House's deputy chief of staff, to introduce the varying new executive orders. The duo even issued a “pardon” to J.K. Rowling.


	“Jackie, Jackie Rowley,” he said. “We love Jackie. You know, she created a whole wizarding world, a wonderful place for overweight millennials to stake their entire identity well past the point of it being cute. I'm a Hufflepuff. No, bitch, you work at Staples.”


	Earlier in the cold open, they touched on Bill Belichick's controversial CBS Sunday Morning appearance where his girlfriend Jordon Hudson awkwardly interrupted his interview.


	“Sir, this order will make it socially acceptable for a man in his 70s to date a 24-year old,” Day's Miller said, to which Johnson's Trump added, “That's right, we're calling it the Belichick Law.”

	











	“We're gonna make girlfriends young again, OK?” he added. “Old men can now date far younger women. We like that, it's hot, but in reverse it's quite disgusting, right? Very Dateline, you know.”


	“Did you see Belichick's girlfriend? She's pretty hot, right?” the faux Trump asked. “Yes, she is a beautiful creature,” Day's Miller added.


	Brunson, the star and creator of Abbott Elementary, returned to host SNL for the second time alongside Benson Boone as the night's musical guest. Saturday's show notably marked the Grammy nominee's first appearance on the show and Brunson's first hosting gig since April 2023.


	Brunson and Boone are two of the final hosts and musical guests for SNL‘s landmark 50th season. Next week, The White Lotus star Walton Goggins will host with musical guest Arcade Fire, with Scarlett Johansson and Bad Bunny closing out season 50 on May 17 as host and musical guest, respectively.

Colin Jost left his ‘Weekend Update‘ post to poke fun at his ongoing side venture with Pete Davidson.


	On this weekend's Saturday Night Live, the comedian made a rare sketch appearance to try and offload the pair's decommissioned Staten Island ferry, which they infamously purchased for $280,100 in 2022.


	The cameo came at the end of a recurring sketch in which Mikey Day plays a man who gets cut off in traffic while driving with his daughter, played by Chloe Fineman, exchanging vulgar insults and very literal hand gestures with host Quinta Brunson on a ferry.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“This ticks me off too, 'cause I usually love the ferry,” says Day after conceding to Brunson, which cues Jost to pop up at Fineman's window.

	











	Jost shouts, “Hey! You said you love ferries? If you love ferries, would you like to buy one?”


	“Oh my god, is that Colin Jost?” asks Fineman, to which Day responds, “Yeah, that's Colin Jost. … Don't make eye contact. Just look straight ahead.”


	“Please buy it! Hey, I'm Pete Davidson. Hi!” adds Jost.


	Last March, Jost and Davidson's business partner Ron Castellano noted that their plans are still underway for a potentially $34 million project to convert the vessel into a floating entertainment complex complete with bars, restaurants and possibly a hotel.


	As the architect, Castellano explained that the SNL stars “have input,” adding: “I think right now, we have six bars and two venues operated separately or combined. We have outdoor event space, we have restaurants — two restaurants. It's a big boat, almost 300 feet long, 65,000 square feet.”

Quinta Brunson made her Saturday Night Live with a shorty celebration that conjured a 5′ pop icon.


	During this weekend's episode of the NBC sketch comedy show, the Golden Globe winner used her opening monologue to perform a song about being 4'11”, for which she was joined by Sabrina Carpenter and other special guests.


	“Yeah, that's right, I'm short. It's OK,” she said. “They even tried to cast me as a kid on Abbott Elementary, and I wrote that. But I love being short, and I want other short people to know the sky's the limit. So shorties, tonight, this one's for us.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	After being presented with a comically tall microphone stand, Brunson launches into a song about how “there's nothing wrong with being short,” listing some famous shorties in the lyrics.

	











	“When you're short you can do anything / You can flip like Simone [Biles], Olympic superstar / Or start a war with Drake, like you're Kendrick Lamar / You can be like Tom Holland and marry a ten / Or like Sabrina Carpenter and—”


	Carpenter then appears. “Wait. Sabrina, it's the real you. What are you doing here?” asked Brunson, to which the 2x Grammy winner responded: “I mean, you were talking about being short, so I thought I'd stop by.”


	They were also joined by SNL cast member Marcello Hernandez and retired NBA star Dwyane Wade, who said he “felt seen” because he's 6'4″ but “in the basketball world, that's like 4'10”, Shaq's like 7'1″—I just really wanna be in the song.”

Saturday Night Live opened in the Oval Office, where Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson) was joined by Stephen Miller (Mikey Day) to sign a slew of new executive orders.


	Among them: An order to “make it socially acceptable for a man in his 70s to date a 24 year old.”


	“We're calling it the Belichick law,” Trump explained. “We're going to make girlfriends young again, OK. Old men can now date far younger women.”


	“We like that. It's hot. But in reverse, it's quite disgusting, right?”


	The quip was a reference to Bill Belichick, 73, the University of North Carolina head coach who is dating Jordon Hudson, 24.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The cold open was a return to familiar territory, but understandable given the way that Trump has dominated the news in his first months in office. 


	The skit opened with Trump boasting of signing 147 executive orders so far, “everything from banning paper straws to defunding PBS. I understand Elmo has now been apprehended by ICE brought to you by the letter L for El Salvador. He's not coming back.”


	Trump then introduced Miller as “lord of the shadows,” and Day played the White House deputy chief of staff as unusually creepy.


	As absurd as some of the executive orders sounded, in some cases they are not far off from reality.


	For example, one executive order, to reduce the number of interracial couples in TV commercials, isn't far off from the Trump administration's actions to eliminate DEI. The president's FCC chairman, has opened investigations into NBC-parent Comcast and other media companies over their diversity, equity and inclusion policies, even though they are private companies.


	Johnson's Trump remarked of the diversity in advertising, “It's just too many, right? You see them in the kitchen together making a meal from Hello Fresh. She's got tight braids. You're like, Where'd they meet, you know? What do they even talk about. It's insane.”


	Making an appearance in the sketch was Marco Rubio (Marcello Hernandez), as Trump signed an executive order forbidding all Hispanic babies from getting their ears pierced.


	“I mean, we got grown white American tweens trying to get into Claire's, and they gotta wait behind a thousand tiny Latina babies to get their ears pierced,” Trump said.


	The sketch ended with Trump signing an executive order to shorten the word “recession.”

	











	Trump said, “Recession will now be called recess. Fun, right? So America, get ready for a historically long recess.”


	Watch it above.

	Following the Season 3 finale of The White Lotus, Natasha Rothwell is shutting down critics of Belinda's “good for her” moment.


	The 2x Emmy nominee defended the character's choice to leave Thailand after successfully blackmailing Greg (Jon Gries) to stay quiet about him likely killing his late wife Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge), reasoning that it doesn't mean Belinda has an evil streak. 


	“I don't think so,” she told People. “I think her heart is good, but I do think that she was flirting with being a baddie by taking this money. So I don't think she'll turn bad, but I do think there's maybe a consequence by all those decisions have, sort of that yin and yang.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Rothwell thinks Belinda could suffer consequences in a future season “as a result of the decision she made,” adding: “Who knows? I don't even know if she's coming back. But in my mind I'm like, yeah, that probably would be the thing.”


	Meanwhile, Rothwell also defended Belinda for leaving town without Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul), despite sparking a romance and discussing going into business together. Many likened the decision to Tanya changing her mind about investing in Belinda during a heartbreaking Season 1 finale scene.


	“People tell me to my face, they're just like, ‘Oh, you should have taken Pornchai with you,'” said Rothwell. “And I'm like, ‘No ma'am, no sir. She does not owe a man anything. She has de-centered men. She is centering herself.'”

The pop singer's launching her third studio album.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Ava Max‘s new album Don't Click Play is arriving this summer. The set, featuring lead single “Lost Your Faith,” will be her third full-length album.


	Max unveiled the album's release date and its cover art on Thursday (May 1). Pop fans will be able to click play on Don't Click Play on Aug. 22.


	The album cover features Max handling the heat in a triangle of fire, her hands grasping edges that are going up in flames — perhaps serving as a visual of the fire-emoji vibes she hopes listeners will feel when they do click play. The triangle is in the form of the familiar symbol that's recognized as a play button.

	










A post shared by AVA MAX (@avamax)


	She's dabbling in the art of reverse psychology with this album cycle. Last month, the singer led folks to the website DontClickPlayOnAvaMax.com, which under the guise of an online petition actually teased an unreleased track. She also shared a photo of a roadside “Don't Click Play on Ava Max” billboard.




			Trending on Billboard		







	With Max's album reveal on X on May 1, she also played on Atlantic Records labelmate Ed Sheeran's Play album announcement, quoting his HQ account's post from the same day; both announcements, of course, made use of the handy play button icon.


Don't Click Play is the follow-up to 2023's Diamonds & Dancefloors (which reached No. 34 on the Billboard 200 albums chart) and 2020's Heaven & Hell (Max's debut LP, which peaked at No. 27 and included breakthrough single “Sweet But Psycho,” a Top 10 hit on the Hot 100 in 2018).

A popular Plymouth clairvoyant who's been “guiding” locals for years has left some "absolutely gobsmacked”. I decided to give her a visit after speaking with her on the phone in December 2024 - as she spookily seemed to pick up on a few things about me then, even though we'd never met in person.

Sam Hatch set up The Psychic Shop in Devonport about 30 years ago, but she told me she's been “reading people” for 40 years - and generations of Plymothians have visited her in that timeframe. I'd spoken to other people who were familiar with the clairvoyant - and even some sceptics said this woman's predictions were spot on.

I've always found fortune telling possibilities intriguing - of course, I realise there is no actual scientific proof in this spiritual practice of prediction. However, the age-old profession of clairvoyance goes back hundreds of years and many people still flock to a fortune teller with a good reputation even in this day and age.

Google reviews of Sam's predictions show that many customers are impressed. One recent reviewer said she was “absolutely gobsmacked”. Sam was “so accurate” the reviewer wrote, adding that she “cannot recommend her enough”.

Another reviewer wrote: "I have met Sam twice, both times everything she predicted happened. No other psychic has been that accurate."

When I walked into The Psychic Shop it felt very calming and although it's situated on the busy Albert Road in Devonport, once inside it was very peaceful. The shop itself is a treasure trove full to the brim with dream catchers, crystals, books and lots of other bits and pieces related to the spiritual world - and the premises has its own resident ghost, I was told.

I sat beside a wishing well while waiting for my reading, all coins put into the wishing well are collected for animal charities. A notice by the well reads: “Be careful what you wish for. Wishes made in a psychic shop are sure to be heard” - of course I made a wish.

Then I went into a separate room and met Sam for my reading. I sat opposite her, the table was covered with huge crystals, candles, incense and tarot cards.

Sam explained the process and then I was asked to “call to the higher realms” in order for Sam to “make contact with the spirits and get the insight she needs” for my reading. I was to make notes on a pad of A4 paper as she spoke, she spoke slowly and thoroughly so it was easy to write it all down.

I was given initials of certain people with connections to weddings and other life events she predicted. It's all on a notepad so I can refer to this going forward, a few specific trips away to Spain and America were predicted - all noted so I'll wait to see.

Readings are very personal, so I won't be divulging all, but one of the most interesting things Sam told me was right at the end of my reading. She detailed that sometimes the answers you're looking for may lie in the past - and not just your immediate past, but a past life you may have experienced.

Sam also provides past life readings, which I'm intrigued to try next, she also runs hypnotherapy sessions. Crystal healing is also offered along with spell and tarot reading sessions - where you can learn how to “open up psychically” yourself, Sam also provides readings to people across the globe over the phone.

Khao Kala, located just three hours north of Bangkok, has earned its reputation as a UFO hotspot due to persistent claims from locals. Many residents say they have seen flying saucers or strange lights in the sky, with some asserting these sightings are a nearly daily occurrence. 

A mysterious hill in Thailand is drawing global attention after villagers claimed to have frequent encounters with unidentified flying objects (UFOs). American vlogger Travis Leon Price recently visited Khao Kala in Nakhon Sawan province—dubbed Thailand's Area 51—to uncover the truth behind the astonishing reports.

Khao Kala, located just three hours north of Bangkok, has earned its reputation as a UFO hotspot due to persistent claims from locals. Many residents say they have seen flying saucers or strange lights in the sky, with some asserting these sightings are a nearly daily occurrence. The hill is nestled in a region known as Nakhon Sawan, or "City of Heaven," adding to the mystique of the location. According to a report by CNN, villagers believe that telepathic communication with aliens is possible, especially during meditation sessions in front of Buddha statues found on the hill.

Intrigued by the reports, Travis Leon Price visited the site and recorded his journey in a video shared across his social media platforms. During his exploration, Price was guided by a local who passionately described frequent alien encounters. The area even features a UFO club, where like-minded believers gather to exchange stories and engage in group meditation.

Towards the end of his visit, Price joined a nighttime watch session. His footage captured twinkling lights moving oddly in the sky, something many believe to be evidence of alien activity. While sceptics may argue otherwise, Price left viewers to draw their own conclusions.

Some locals do not see conflict between their Buddhist faith and extraterrestrial beliefs. In fact, they interpret alien messages as spiritually aligned with traditional religious teachings. In 2024, a local sect even hosted Thailand's first UFO music festival, drawing believers and curious visitors from across the country. Festival attendee Siwadon Chantanasewi told the South China Morning Post, “I thought the aliens might fly past, maybe just pop by for a moment. I had this strong feeling they knew about the festival.”

Due to growing crowds of UFO seekers, Thai officials have expressed concern about Khao Kala's status as a protected forest area. While visitors are welcome to hike up the hill and visit religious sites like the large Buddha statue and the Buddha footprint, camping or overnight stays are strictly prohibited.

In a twist that has both shocked and enthralled fans, a dramatic development emerged from a heart-stopping incident at the PNC Park. A 20-year-old fan, once believed to be severely injured from a fall off the famous 21-foot Clemente Wall, has now regained consciousness, prompting both relief and a surge of unexpected mythology.

Incident Overview
A fateful day at PNC Park turned tragic when the young fan experienced a perilous fall off the towering Clemente Wall. The 21-foot height that has long symbolized admiration for a sporting legend became the setting for a life-altering accident. The incident, which evoked collective sympathy and numerous heartbeats around the stadium, set the stage for a story that has since morphed into a broader conversation with unexpected twists.

Emergency Response and Recovery
In the immediate aftermath of the fall, emergency responders worked swiftly under immense pressure to stabilize the injured fan. The dramatic scene unfolded against the backdrop of a bustling stadium, where every second felt monumental. Following essential treatments and critical care, hopes began to rise when news of the fan's awakening started to circulate. This milestone in the recovery journey has provided a sense of cautious optimism for all those who witnessed the event unfold.

Conspiracy Theories and Public Reaction
As details of the recovery emerged, the narrative quickly expanded beyond the factual. In the digital age, claims and counterclaims began to circulate, evolving into conspiracy theories that questioned the nature of the accident. These theories, though far removed from the stark realities of an unfortunate mishap, underscore how quickly public sentiment can pivot from concern to conjecture. The incident has ignited debates, revealing the fine line between genuine worry and the human penchant for crafting elaborate backstories around unexplained events.

Reflection on the Event and Its Impact
This incident transcends the immediate shock of the fall. It highlights the unpredictable interplay between fate and public perception, where a singular moment can give rise to diverse narratives, both heartfelt and speculative. The young fan's recovery now stands as a reminder of resilience amidst adversity, and it invites thoughtful reflection on how such events can resonate beyond the confines of a sports arena. The layered responses—from the urgency of emergency intervention to the subsequent surge in conjectural storytelling—paint a picture of a community deeply invested in its heroes, both on and off the field.

In the end, the evolving story of this Pittsburgh Pirates fan serves as a powerful testament to human endurance and the multifaceted nature of public discourse. The incident not only tests our collective compassion but also exemplifies how quickly a harrowing moment can transform into a broader dialogue about recovery, hope, and the shadows of modern myth-making.

iQiyi is surely breathing a sigh of relief with the reception for it's fantasy supernatural period C-drama The Demon Hunter's Romance. The shelved for nearly two years drama airdropped in early April once the ban on female lead Song Zu Er was lifted and the result was better than expected. The drama got stronger than expected reviews especially for male lead Allen Ren who many felt was back to his strong suit in playing the stoic yet still emotionally aware male lead. Song Zu Er has long been a top among the flowers of her generation for both her visuals and her acting so her performance here was par for the course. It helps that the directing was sharp and the vignette stories interesting, and the drama recently wrapped its run and opened with a solid 7.3 Douban ratings.



This drama is definitely joining my list of rewatchable dramas.

Mine too. I watched to support Song Zu'er and it exceed my expectations. I dont want to compare it to others great Chinese dramas, this was entertaining for me. Even Allen Ren was watchable.

It's making me look forward to Xu Kai and Tian Xiwei's Moonlit Reunion as well, where the male lead is also a demon hunter.

I hope this drama will be good for Xu Kai… He is not a bad actor, he looks good but there something lacking in his dramas… I wish him well this time.

He seems to do well when he has chemistry with his co-star. The most recent drama which I think he's good in is As Beautiful As You.

It's such well made drama, in terms of writing, and cinematography, it's beautiful. Director did a great job, and usually lifeless  Allen Ren is very suited for role. Love it.

I think if iQIYI didn't mess up with AI open ending the rating Douban would be higher.

The stories were interesting and engaging. I know I have hard time finishing dramas but this one, I've finished it in one week. The open ending was absolutely not necessary though.
