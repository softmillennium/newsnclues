                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Summer House” star, Lexi Wood, cleared the air about her relationship with castmate West Wilson, after she was accused by Jesse Solomon of getting too close with him during a night out. We just have a strictly platonic relationship, and obviously he is friends with Jesse and they're so close. They were newbies together,” she told People on May 3. The newest addition to season 9 continued, “So yeah, that would just never be a thing. Wood and Solomon hit it off right away upon seeing each other for the first time at the Hamptons house. Despite her disappointment, Wood told People, “I think I'm really lucky that my cast told me everything and that my friends were kind of there to give me a heads-up, whether it was a little late or not.” She added, “So yeah, I think I'm really lucky in that case because if we were in the normal world, I probably wouldn't know certain things, like the toe [incident]. I wouldn't have known any of this.” Although Solomon's brief romance with Wood didn't end well, he told Glamour in April, “Our relationship meant a lot to me, and I'm grateful for everything it taught me.” I think there were just some miscommunications and heightened emotions, which is understandable given the environment,” Solomon said. As for Wood, she told the publication, “Watching back, I wish there was more honesty because I would have made different decisions and choices.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump White House shared a graphic image of Trump, veiny biceps and other inhuman muscles bulging, holding a red light saber in celebration of May the Fourth — an informal Star Wars holiday and pun on “May the Force be with you.” Meanwhile, the administration's chief Border Patrol agent posted a video depicting the agency as Darth Vader killing rebel soldiers. Happy May the 4th to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting so hard to to bring Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members, back into our Galaxy. “Happy May the 4th to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting so hard to to bring Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members, back into our Galaxy,” the White House posted on social media alongside the likely AI-generated image. Trump, who has promised to deport millions of immigrants, has deported thousands since taking office (139,000 according to the White House), including sending hundreds of men he claims are gang members to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador without due process. “Embarrassing Stalinist level propaganda from Trump's White House,” Retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman posted on X (formerly Twitter). A U.S. Border Patrol video, titled “Border Wars” and posted Sunday by Chief Patrol Agent Gregory K. Bovino, took a clip from Star Wars spinoff Rogue One where Darth Vader massacres rebel forces. Border Patrol labeled Vader as “Premier Sector,” referring to the agency's El Centro Sector, which covers much of the southern border with Mexico. So the border can't be closed quickly?

The video then cuts to Border Patrol Vader wielding a red light saber to kill rebel forces that the video labeled as fentanyl, sanctuary cities, cocaine, human smugglers, invasion, and fake news. One account responded to Bovino with a meme that asked “Are we the baddies?” Another user asked, “Just for clarification, who were the bad guys in Star Wars?” “We've depicted who the bad guys were in this video,” Bovino replied.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Serious security concerns typically lead organizers to cancel such massive events — as happened with Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna last year. Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks.” Security was tight at Saturday's concert, with 5,200 military and police officers deployed to the beach where fans were reveling in the pop singer's classic hits like “Born This Way,” which became something of an LGBTQ anthem after its 2011 release. Rio de Janeiro's state police and Brazil's Justice Ministry presented the bare outlines of a plot that they said involved a group that promoted hate speech against the LGBTQ+ community, among others, and had planned to detonate homemade explosive devices at the event. The group, it added, disseminated violent content to teenagers online as “a form of belonging.” Authorities arrested two people in connection with the alleged plot — a man described as the group's leader in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul on illegal weapons possession charges, and a teenager in Rio on child pornography charges. “Those involved were recruiting participants, including teenagers, to carry out integrated attacks using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails,” police said. The Justice Ministry said that it determined the group posed a “risk to public order.” It said the group falsely presented themselves online as “Little Monsters” — Gaga's nickname for her fans — in order to reach teenagers and lure them into “networks with violent and self-destructive content.” Although police said they believed homemade bombs were intended for use in the planned attack, there was no mention of the raids turning up any weapons or explosive material. “Nothing could prepare me for the feeling I had during last night's show—the absolute pride and joy I felt singing for the people of Brazil,” she wrote. Your heart shines so bright, your culture is so vibrant and special, I hope you know how grateful I am to have shared this historical moment with you.” Her free beach concert stood out at a time of surging ticket prices for live music around the world as concert-goers pay budget-busting costs to see their favorite artists. Rio has done this before — last May, superstar Madonna performed the finale to her latest world tower for some 1.6 million fans on the sprawling sands of Copacabana Beach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lady Gaga is speaking out after police arrested two people in connection with an alleged plot to bomb her free concert in Brazil on Saturday. “We learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning,” a spokesperson for the singer shared in a statement with The Hollywood Reporter. “Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks. Brazilian Police Arrest 2 People Over Plot to Bomb Lady Gaga's Concert in Rio Following Lady Gaga's biggest show of her career, drawing more than 2 million people to Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, police in Brazil said they worked with the Justice Ministry on an operation to stop an alleged attack planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community. After police raided the locations of 15 suspects across several states in Brazil and confiscated phones and other electronic devices, the alleged group's leader was arrested on illegal weapons possession charges, as well as a teen on child pornography charges. On Sunday, after the concert, Lady Gaga took to her Instagram to praise her fans, also known as “Little Monsters,” for the unforgettable night.

For her second round hosting at Studio 8H, Quinta Brunson pumped up the volume, kicking off the show with a musical monologue that featured both pop star Sabrina Carpenter and basketball phenom Dwayne Wade, then filling out each sketch with energy and dynamism. Related Stories Bruce Springsteen Calls ‘Adolescence' Star Stephen Graham ‘Amazing' as His Father in ‘Deliver Me from Nowhere' How ‘The Righteous Gemstones' Costume Designs Drip for Christ It's been a while since a “Saturday Night Live” monologue really stood out, particularly this season with so many return hosts effecting a been-there-done-that attitude, but between Jack Black's crowd work in his episode last month and Brunson's showstopping number topping this one, it's nice to see this section of the show milked for all it's worth. Brunson's singing may not be quite on par with Carpenter, but her enthusiasm and stage presence brought the whole piece together. Having kicked off her career doing BuzzFeed videos and “A Black Lady Sketch Show,” it's clear that Brunson's comedy skills are best suited to the pre-taped format (though her talent for live work should not go unrecognized). One of the best pre-taped moments of last night (and all season) saw Brunson adopt an older look alongside the show's longest cast member, Kenan Thompson. Together they play an aging couple informing their children of their new side hustle, which is basically a version of OnlyFans, but just for senior citizens. Considering Brunson has mostly had to keep it clean on “Abbott Elementary,” seeing her go so blue with her comedy and have so much fun doing it was a delight. Though they don't always end up in a sketch together, they are more often than not seen embracing during the goodnights of every show. Playing two skeezy suburbanites likely from New Jersey or Long Island, Sherman and Yang worked off one another like a finely tuned orchestra, heaping praise upon the chain restaurant Applebees and bemoaning its recent bankruptcy. “Saturday Night Live” returns May 11 with host Walton Goggins and musical guest Arcade Fire.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lady Gaga performed to a record-breaking crowd during her free concert at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Saturday (May 3). “Tonight, we're making history,” she told the massive audience. The concert began around 10 p.m. local time, with the 39-year-old pop icon opening with her 2011 track “Bloody Mary.” She followed it with a hit-filled set including fan favorites like “Poker Face” and “Alejandro,” as well as music from her latest Billboard 200-topping album, Mayhem. Concert organizers estimated that approximately 2.1 million people attended the free Copacabana Beach show, according to Associated Press. The largest concert crowd in history is still held by Rod Stewart, who drew 3.5 million fans to a New Year's Eve performance at Copacabana Beach in 1994, according to the Guinness World Records. Gaga's performance drew over 1 million Brazilians and approximately 500,000 Little Monsters who flew in for the show, generating more than $100,000 for Rio's economy, NPR reports. The Rio concert marked Gaga's first performance in Brazil since 2012. “I know that this is not the first show here, I know this is just a rehearsal, it feels like it's the real show.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SUNDAY UPDATE: Coming in a touch lower than where we saw it heading yesterday, Marvel Studios/Disney's Thunderbolts* has opened to $162.1M globally, including $86.1M from the international box office. The international debut is estimated to be 45% ahead of Shang-Chi, 13% above Ant-Man and 7% over Guardians of the Galaxy in like-for-like markets at current rates (excluding China). 'Thunderbolts*' Settles At $76M Opening, 'Sinners' Full Of Grace With $33M, 'Rust' Not Good - Sunday AM Box Office Update 'Avengers: Doomsday' Stars Assemble To Support New Marvel Movie 'Thunderbolts*': Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Vanessa Kirby & More The film played best in Latin America and smaller Asian markets, while Europe was a bit mixed. Similar to the U.S., reviews and social sentiment internationally are generally strong, and Thunderbolts* has runway before the next major wide opener. Before we dig into further detail, a note about the other top players: Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie currently stands at $873.4M global after an international weekend of $26.6M (-33%). Also from WB, Sinners had an impressive -27% hold in its third offshore frame. The international cume to date is $57M for $236.7M worldwide. It released day-and-date globally, and, as previously noted, was not expected to do mega business in China and Korea (see below). China nevertheless is the top opening market (it started on a non-traditional Wednesday) with $10.4M through Sunday. 1 in every market and had the 2nd highest debut of 2025 across the region, Brazil (including previews) and Mexico (including previews) as well as Central America, Chile and Paraguay. The regional opening weekend was ahead of Ant-Man, Shang-Chi, Eternals and Captain America: Brave New World. 1 in all markets except for Finland and Sweden which were behind the continued play of Minecraft. Thunderbolts* had the 2nd highest opening of 2025 in the Middle East and 3rd highest opening of 2025 in France and Spain as well as Iceland, Portugal and South Africa. 1 non-local in all markets except for Japan where it was the No. It scored the 2nd highest studio opening of 2025 in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand; and the best non-local opening of 2025 in Hong Kong, India, Malaysia and Singapore. The Top 10 starts were: China ($10.4M), UK ($7.7M), Mexico ($7.3M), Brazil ($4M), France ($3.8M), Germany ($3.6M), Korea ($3.5M), Australia ($3.4M), Japan ($3.2M) and Spain ($2.8M). A Minecraft Movie, meanwhile, continues to climb, with an overseas drop of just 33%, propelled by increases in China (+38%), Chile (+8%), Brazil (+7%), Japan (+5%) and Argentina (+2%). Other notable holds include Norway (-15%), Spain (-16%), Denmark (-19%), Mexico (-21%), Peru (-23%), Colombia (-24%), Poland (-25%), Holland (-32%), Korea (-33%), and Germany (-45%). Note that the original game hails from Sweden. As for Ryan Coogler's Sinners, another $10.4M from 71 overseas markets included exceptional holds in Latin America (-9%) and Europe (-27%), with individual market highlights in Saudi Arabia (+29%), Brazil (+8%), Sweden (-3%), Holland (-5%), Belgium (-10%), Spain (-12%), Germany (-14%), Denmark (-15%), Mexico (-17%), Argentina (-22%), Australia (-23%), UAE (-28%), UK (-31%), and France (-34%). In like-for-like markets and using today's exchange rates, the film is tracking 110% over Speak No Evil, 75% higher than Nope, 49% ahead of Get Out, 27% above Us and 20% over Creed. PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: Marvel Studios/Disney's Thunderbolts* kicked off international box office play on Wednesday, and through Friday has an estimated overseas cume of $47.2M from 52 material markets. The day-and-date global rollout is rolling up to a projected $165M+ through Sunday. This is in line with the pre-weekend estimated range. Overseas, the ragtag bunch of antiheroes is, as a whole, playing best in Latin America, and also scoring in the UK and Asia with projected No. 1s  everywhere (outside of Korea and China, which was expected – more on that below). Note that May 1st was a holiday in many markets – though the UK will take the day off on Monday — while weather in Europe is also a factor. The well-reviewed Florence Pugh-starrer is hoping to see walk-up business on Saturday and Sunday and thus should finish the weekend within the range we wrote about earlier this week. The Top 5 markets through Friday are China ($7.1M), Mexico ($4.2M), UK ($3.1M), Brazil ($2.2M) and France ($2.1M). As expected, we're not seeing big action in China with the Jake Schreier-directed first installment MCU movie having opened on a non-traditional Wednesday and playing into a competitive frame with lots of new local titles. Through Saturday, the estimated China cume is about $9M (note that today's numbers are not included in the running total above). Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SUNDAY AM: Thunderbolts* at a $76M opening, isn't the most stellar of Disney Marvel Studios' openings, but, heck, this is significantly better than the start of summer a year ago when Universal's original action romcom, The Fall Guy, fell on his face with a $27.7M start. With a $162.1M global opening, Thunderbolts* is just $3M shy of where we forecasted. There can be agita in the industry when a movie doesn't exactly wow and kick off summer with a $100M-plus opening, however Thunderbolts* start isn't anything to worry about knowing that Memorial Day is teed up for a possible record-breaking 4-day weekend with Disney's Lilo & Stitch eyeing at least $120M and Paramount's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning at $80M+. With an A- CinemaScore, plus other great exists in PostTrak and Rotten Tomatoes, Disney is hoping that Thunderbolts* holds better than recent less-than-$100M openers, i.e. Eternals ($71.2M, -62% second weekend drop, B CinemaScore, $164.8M final) and Captain America: Brave New World ($88.8M opening, -68% second weekend plummet, B- CinemaScore, $200.2M domestic final). With 38% women giving Thunderbolts* an A, there's anticipation that more of them will show up next weekend for Mothers Day; the pic's only competition being Lionsgate's Kerry Washington-Omar Sy movie, Shadow Force. Also, Thunderbolts* skewed young at 62% under 35, which was another promising sign to Disney in regards to more business down the road. Not to rain on Disney's parade, because, really, exhibition is thankful for a deep bench of titles with the entire weekend doing $146M +98% from a year ago), but there wasn't a great degree of FOMO for this antiheroes movie about Yelena Belova, Winter Soldier, etc; they aren't exactly a gang of Paul Kerseys multiplied by five with questionable and acerbic methods. DC's Suicide Squad could roll the Thunderbolts in a barrel. The focus of Disney's marketing campaign for Thunderbolts* was ‘Not Super. Not Heroes' with an angle on the sarcastic twist of assembling assassins forced to work together from the movie Black Widow and series Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Hawkeye. There was a Super Bowl 30-second spot and an absolute cinema trailer via Letterboxd. There was a promotional partner campaign valued at $75M, which was bigger than other stand-alone MCU titles, led by Tide, HD and Wheaties. Harley Davidson had their largest cinematic collaboration to date, with the movie timed to their launch of the 2025 Pan America ST bike placed in the film, a spot, in-dealership support and an editorial feature for their exclusive magazine with interviews of stunt professionals. Very clever: Disney and Wheaties created a first-of-its-kind limited-edition Wheaties box, which also became something of a promo one-sheet and theater lobby standee. Mike and Ike hosted a branded road trip activation featuring custom-wrapped trucks that visited 80+ colleges across the country. Students received co-branded product and Fandango movie ticket giveaways. There was also a joint partnership with Cupra Kiro and Formula E, the premier competition for electrically powered, single-seater racing cars, including a co-branded Cupra Kiro race car livery competing in races in Miami (broadcast exposure on CBS Sports) and Monaco, co-branded driver helmet, spot, and in-stadium content integration during the races. With LinkedIn, Marvel and Disney leveraged the “Red Guardian Limo Service” content piece to reinforce their message to job seekers and professionals. Perfect Sports, the leading brand in the protein powder/performance nutrition, had Thunderbolts* branded products via Walmart.com, Amazon, GNC and Vitamin Shoppe, with in-gym exposure throughout Canada, and social/influencer campaigns. Thunderbolts* repped Arizona Iced Tea's first-time co-branding with a movie. Ten million cans were splashed with the movie's logo at major convenience stores including 7-Eleven, AM/PM, and Circle K. Speaking of the Red Guardian Limo Service, there was a micro campaign created for social with a commercial and stunted outdoor to coincide with tickets on sale telling moviegoers to dial 1-833-RED-LIM0. EntTelligence reports that 4.7M people went to see Thunderbolts* this weekend, 1M less than Captain America: Brave New World. Also per EntTelligence today, those trailers pushed in-theater on Thunderbolts* were Fantastic Four: First Steps (100%, July 25), Predator: Badlands (86%, Nov. 7) and Tron: Ares (85%, Oct. 10). Imax theaters stateside grossed $8.6M or 11.3% of Thunderbolts* opening weekend. A Minecraft Movie (WB/Leg) 3,571 (-270) theaters Fri $3M (-42%) Sat $6.3M Sun $4.4M 3-day $13.7M (-40%), Total $398.2M/Wk 5 The Accountant 2 (AMZ) 3,610 theaters, Fri $2.6M (-72%) Sat $4M Sun $2.8M 3-day $9.46M (-61%), Total $41.1M/Wk 2 Until Dawn (Sony) 3,055 theaters, Fri $1.1M (-67%) Sat $1.6M Sun $1M 3-day $3.8M (-53%), Total $14.3M/Wk 2 King of Kings (Angel) 2,035 (-1,140) theaters, Fri $364K Sat $763K Sun $530K 3-day $1.65M (-61%)/ Total $57.6M/Wk 4 Hit: The Third Case (Prath) 590 theaters, Fri $385K,Sat $360K Sun $210K 3-day $955K, Total $2.1M/Wk 1 Guru Nanak Jahaz (OCW) 119 theaters, $170K, Sat $300K Sun $215K 3-day $685K, Total $742K/Wk 1 SATURDAY AM: Marvel Studios and Disney's Thunderbolts* has a shot at coming in a bit better for the weekend at $73M-$77M. As we told you, Friday was close to $32M, with Disney calling it at $31.5M. While we'd expect more and want more from Marvel during the first weekend of summer, when you include Thunderbolts* in with all the other holdovers in the marketplace, there's nothing to complain about with all titles doing an estimated $145M this weekend. This is where originals now live with Marvel post Covid. However, what Thunderbolts* has going for itself are its exits. Audiences gave it a solid A- as compared to the B- they smacked Captain America: Brave New World with, and the Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Hannah John-Kamen and Geraldine Viswanathan-led movie has a great 71% definite recommend on PostTrak. All of that bodes well for this pic holding in the summer to come. More upbeat results from Thunderbolts*: 75% told PostTrak they want to see a sequel, while 40% said they went to watch because of the cast and 53% mentioned the big reason why they bought a ticket was because it's a Marvel movie. This is a very similar turnout in terms of demo ages as Captain America: Brave New World; men under 25 were a little lower at 18%. IMAX and PLF are repping 39% of the weekend with 3D generating separately 11% (Disney has to get moviegoers back in a 3D mindset so they're primed for Avatar: Fire & Ash later this year). The AMC Dine-In Disney Springs (Fla.) leads single-location gross at $106K. Thunderbolts*‘ social media universe stands at 570M according to analytics corp RelishMix, which is not far from Captain America: Brave New World‘s near 600M, but lower than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3‘s 709.7M followers across TikTok, YouTube, X, Instagram and Facebook. Meanwhile, Warner Bros' Sinners is shaping up for a massive $33M third weekend, -28%. That is, of course, the best third weekend for a horror movie ahead of It‘s $29.7M third weekend. Also opening this weekend is Roadside Attractions' pick-up of Cannes title The Surfer starring Nicolas Cage, and it's shaping up for a 3-day around $750K after a $325K Friday at 1,085 theaters. Audiences at 48% on Rotten Tomatoes aren't catching the wave like critics are with an 86% certified fresh critical score. The Alec Baldwin Rust western opened on 115 theaters to a very low estimated $25K or $217 per screen. That's not good — but here's what's going on. Furthermore, whenever a theatrical distributor does a day-and-date PVOD release, contractually with the cable companies and digital OTT services, they have to open the movie in a specified amount of theaters. The Sailesh Kolanu crime thriller follows Arjun Sarkaar, a top Homicide Intervention Team officer from Visakhapatnam, who is sent to Jammu and Kashmir to investigate a series of brutal murders. As he pursues a group of elusive killers, the case tests his skills and mental strength. Best markets are Austin, Dallas, Seattle, Toronto, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York City and Baltimore. AFTERNOON UPDATE: Marvel Studios and Disney's Thunderbolts* is looking at $32M today, including last night's $11.5M previews, for what's shaping up to be a $70M-$75M opening at 4,330 theaters, which has more or less been par for the course for an MCU original title post Covid. The movie has great reviews and immediate thumbs-up from fans. Clearly by tomorrow night, we'll know if it catches on and enters the Guardians of the Galaxy threshold ($94.3M), but as of this minute, no one is seeing it at that altitude. Staying strong is Warner Bros' Sinners with $9M today and a 3-day between $30M-$35M at 3,347 — a terrific hold at -23% to -34% in Weekend 3. By comparison, Jordan Peele's Get Out posted a third weekend of $20.7M in 2017, -27%. Warners had bragging rights for third place as well with Legendary co-production A Minecraft Movie at 3,571 sites doing $3M today — $13M, -43% in its fifth weekend — for a running total of $397.5M. Fourth goes to Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 with a Friday of $3M, second weekend of $11.2M, -51%, and a running total of $41.6M, which is 12% behind the 2016 original at the same point in time. Sony Screen Gems' Until Dawn at 3,055 locations is in fifth with $1M in its second Friday and a $3M second weekend, -59% for an estimated running total by Sunday of $13.8M. UPDATE AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Disney's official figure Thunderbolts* last night is $11.5M. More good news for Thunderbolts* this weekend: Out of the gate it has 4 1/2 stars on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak and a great 74% definite recommend. The figure isn't that far from the $12M chalked up by February's Captain America: Brave New World; that preview repped 29% of the Anthony Mackie pic's first Friday, which turned into an $88.8M 3-day. Last night's money for the Pugh, Harbour and Stan-led movie is also under that of Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3 which posted $17.5M in previews for a $48.1M Friday and $118.4M 3-day. Warner Bros' Sinners ends its second week with $69M at 3,347 theaters, -11%, and a running cume of $146.6M. Even with Sinners ceding its premium screens this weekend, it's expected to have a robust hold. It was announced that the Ryan Coogler-directed title will return to nine select IMAX 70MM theaters from May 15-21. EXCLUSIVE: Disney and Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* is off to a very good start with around $11M tonight, we hear from non-Disney sources. Always know that forecast can swing higher or lower by the time late night monies come in Friday AM. Hopefully tonight's previews are an indicator to better days at the summer B.O. Not only does the Pugh and Stan vehicle have a solid start, but it's also winning fans over tonight with a 96% Rotten Tomatoes audience score after its 88% certified fresh rating with critics. That's better than the MCU's Captain America: Brave New World from February (48% critics, 78% audience) which saw an $88.8M 3-day, $100M 4-day over the Valentine's Day/President's Day weekend, which translated to $200.2M stateside and $414.8M global take. Tonight's previews are roughly a million under Captain America: Brave New World's $12M, but they're also ahead of 2021's Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings ($8.8M) and Eternals ($9.5M). Thunderbolts* (not to be confused with Thundercats) has all the premium ticket upcharges in IMAX, Dolby, ScreenX, 4DX, etc. We told you in the past week that previews/presales for Thunderbolts* are behind Captain America: Brave New World. However, presales for the Jake Schreier-helmed MCU title continue to be ahead of 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings ($75.3M) and Eternals ($71.2M opening). We'll have more intel on Warner Bros' Sinners‘ third weekend tomorrow; however, some rivals are estimating that the Ryan Coogler-directed, Michael B. Jordan-starring period vampire movie is headed to a 3-day of $35M, which would be a remarkable dip of -23%. Forecasts had Sinners easing -25% to -30% in its third weekend for $32M-$34.2M yesterday.
