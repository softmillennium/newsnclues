                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A failed interception of a missile fired from Yemen forced Israel to briefly shut down its main international airport on Sunday, exposing the country's vulnerabilities and the Houthi rebels' continued ability to strike distant targets despite a sustained US military campaign. Flights were halted at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv for about 30 minutes on Sunday morning after a missile landed in the airport's vicinity, following what the Israeli military said were “several attempts” at interception. The US also has an advanced THAAD anti-missile system deployed in Israel. Related article Far from being cowed by US airstrikes, Yemen's Houthis may be relishing them The Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was carried out “in rejection of (Israel's) crime of genocide” against the people of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed further attacks against the Houthis. I can't elaborate all of that. It's not ‘one and done' - but there will be hits,” he said in a video address posted on social media. In a post to X later, he also promised a response to Iran: “Israel will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters.” Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that the response would be “sevenfold.” The incident marks a major security breach at one of the most heavily protected sites in the country, and is likely to raise questions about Israel's ability to intercept such attacks despite its vaunted missile defense system. Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings suspend flights to and from Tel Aviv until after Tuesday, May 6, a Lufthansa Group spokesperson told CNN. “They were very accurate, and to be very accurate if you're launching from 2,000 kilometers, it's impressive,” Bar Shalom told CNN. “And you have to take this threat seriously. We have to check whether it's our mistake or whether we have a new kind of threat here.” Related article Iran has a new hypersonic missile. Here's what that means for the Middle East Iran is developing long-range missiles capable of maneuvering to evade air defenses, Bar Shalom said, though it remains unclear whether such advanced technology has been transferred to the Houthis. “There are so many parameters that may be relevant to the result that have to be analyzed,” he said. Sunday's strike marks the third consecutive day of missile launches from Yemen toward Israel, according to the IDF. The Houthis claim their hypersonic missiles have stealth technology, a range of 2,150 kilometers (1,335 miles), high maneuverability and can travel up to speeds of Mach 16. Almost all of the projectiles have been intercepted by Israel's air defenses. The Houthis said they fired a hypersonic ballistic missile labeled “Palestine 2” at an Israeli military target in the Jaffa area. Related article Who are the Houthis and why are they attacking ships in the Red Sea? Israel has launched several strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, including the targeting of a power plant and maritime ports in January. But the US military has carried out far more extensive strikes on targets in Yemen in recent weeks, aiming to weaken the group, whose attacks on Red Sea shipping have significantly disrupted global trade. The campaign is also aimed at stopping launches targeting Israel, as well as commercial and US Navy vessels operating in the Middle East.</p>

House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes, D-Conn., joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss Mike Waltz's move from National Security advisor to U.N. ambassador, President Donald Trump working to end the war in Ukraine and border security. The U.S. could withdraw from peace talks with Ukraine and Russia if the two sides can't make progress toward ending their three-year war, President Donald Trump said. Trump made the comments during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press" that aired Sunday, telling host Kristen Welker that there is "tremendous hatred" between Ukraine and Russia. The president says he remains hopeful a peace deal is possible, but confirmed that the U.S. would not remain a mediator indefinitely. "I do believe we're closer with one party. And maybe not as close with the other, but we'll have to see," Trump said. "Five thousand soldiers a week on average, are dying. U.S. President Donald Trump says there is "tremendous hatred" between the Russian and Ukrainian sides. "Well, there will be a time when I will say, okay, keep going, keep being stupid," Trump replied. "Maybe it's not possible to do," he added. Just so you understand, Kristen, we're talking tremendous hatred between these two men and between, you know, some of the soldiers, frankly, between the generals, they've been fighting hard for three years. I think we have a very good chance of doing it." Trump says the US may withdraw from peace talks if Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy do not cooperate. The interview comes just days after Trump blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioning whether his Russian counterpart has any interest in peace. Trump spoke up on social media last week after Russian forces launched missiles into Ukrainian cities. "There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days," Trump wrote. "It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking' or ‘Secondary Sanctions?' President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak in Rome, where they both attended Pope Francis' funeral on April 26, 2025. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also appeared to temper expectations for a major peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia last week. Rubio argued it was "silly" to put a specific date or timeline on when the U.S. might pull out from mediation, but he said this will be "a very critical week." Days later, the White House signed a rare earth minerals agreement with Ukraine, a months-long priority for Trump.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazilian police said on Sunday that they had thwarted a bomb attack planned for Lady Gaga's historic concert that drew over 2 million people to Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday. The Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro state, working in coordination with the Justice Ministry, said the plot was orchestrated by a group promoting hate speech and the radicalization of teenagers, including self-harm and violent content as a form of social belonging. According to the Rio city hall, 2.1 million people attended the concert of the American pop icon. “The suspects were recruiting participants, including minors, to carry out coordinated attacks using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails,” the police said in a statement. The Justice Ministry said the recruiters identified themselves as members of Gaga's global fan base, known as the “Little Monsters.” The operation was based on a report by the ministry's Cyber Operations Lab following a tip-off from Rio state police intelligence, which uncovered digital cells encouraging violent behavior among teenagers using coded language and extremist symbolism. A man described as the group's leader was arrested in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul for illegal possession of a firearm, while a teenager in Rio de Janeiro was detained for storing child pornography. Authorities carried out over a dozen search and seizure warrants across the states of Rio de Janeiro, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo. A Warner Bros.

For many people, the term “mummy” usually brings to mind images of Egyptian sarcophagi. Such well-preserved remains have enabled scientists to reconstruct the faces of those who lived in bygone centuries, such as the Incan “Ice Maiden.” Each mummy has their own story to tell, and this week, researchers have uncovered the truth behind an enigmatic figure from a remote Austrian village. A water leak in the church crypt of St. Thomas am Blasenstein presented an opportunity for scientists to delve into the secrets of an unusual mummy. The mummy's incredible condition, including intact skin and tissue, may be due to the presence of zinc chloride, wood chips and embroidered fabric found inside the body — a technique never described before in scientific literature, according to the new study. The chaplain's cause of death has long been shrouded in mystery due to a capsule-shaped object revealed by an X-ray. Geoscientists discovered a magma cap beneath Yellowstone National Park, which harbors the world's largest active volcanic systems. See how the unique feature acts like nature's pressure-release valve. Astronomers detected an invisible molecular cloud surprisingly close to Earth. The cosmic phenomenon could provide a window into understanding how stars and planets form. They found Eos by searching for ultraviolet light emitted by hydrogen within the cloud, which is made of gas and dust clumps that collapse and trigger the birth of stars. Separately, a signal traced in 20-year-old telescope data could shed light on an unlikely celestial object that may be connected to the formation of gold across the universe. Both animals, known as monotremes, are the only mammals that lay eggs. A team of scientists now believe the only known fossil of a monotreme relative, named Kryoryctes cadburyi, may represent a common ancestor of both animals that lived more than 100 million years ago. When immunologist Jacob Glanville came across stories about Tim Friede, a California man who injected himself with deadly snake venom hundreds of times and gained immunity to several neurotoxins, he wanted to analyze Friede's blood. Now, the pair and a team of scientists have shared their latest research about an antivenom that can protect mice against the toxins of 19 species of poisonous snake. The antivenom is based on a venom-blocking drug, as well as antibodies in Friede's blood sample — and researchers hope to conduct human clinical trials with it one day. “However, we strongly discourage anyone from trying to do what Tim did. A fresh fiery image is showcasing the sun's complexity like never before. The image was taken in December — shortly after scientists announced the sun is experiencing the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle — and it could help researchers gain new insights into solar weather and how it could impact our planet. — Amazon launched the first batch of internet-beaming satellites for Project Kuiper, a plan to create a giant constellation that will compete with SpaceX's Starlink satellites, which already serve at least 4.6 million customers across the globe. — Archaeologists discovered the true identity of two shipwrecks in shallow waters off Cahuita National Park, on Costa Rica's southern Caribbean coast, that were long thought to be pirate ships. Researchers in Montana grew a framework for a living, self-repairing building material from mycelium, or the rootlike structures that connect fungal networks, and it could eventually be used to build homes in the future.

A college admissions worker in Boston was arrested Friday after he was accused of offering $400 to a 17-year-old prospective student in exchange for sex, federal officials said. Jacob Henriques, 29, used his position as an assistant admissions director at Emmanuel College to gain access to the personal information of at least four potential students before contacting them, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts alleged. Henriques met with at least three such students on April 25. Henriques contacted a fourth victim after she formally committed to attending the school on April 25, the attorney's office said. Jacob Henriques, a 29-year-old assistant admissions director, was fired from Emmanuel College following allegations he solicited sex from prospective students, a university spokesperson said. (David L Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images, File) Henriques contacted one prospective student, a 17-year-old high school girl, within hours of finishing a tour of the college on or about April 25, federal officials said. The 29-year-old continued to text the girl that night, refusing to identify himself or tell her how he obtained her phone number, according to officials. (David L Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images, File) After Henriques allegedly sent the 17-year-old five pornographic videos, prosecutors said he asked if she wanted to participate in a "gangbang" and if she wanted to have sex with him. Despite the girl rejecting Henriques multiple times, he continued to text her, saying he "would buy her anything she wanted" if she changed her mind, the attorney's office said. After she blocked his number, Henriques started emailing her, federal officials said. An Emmanuel College spokesperson told WBZ-TV that Henriques has since been fired after an internal investigation. "[We are] saddened, angered, and shocked by these serious federal allegations that have been brought against a former employee," the spokesperson said. "They are an affront to our core values, and we stand with any victimized by this incident." The FBI said it is seeking other potential victims who Henriques may have targeted between 2024 and 2025. He faces up to life in prison if found guilty. The FBI's Boston Division Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force is seeking to identify other potential victims of Henriques who he may have targeted between 2024 and 2025.

(AP Photo/Reba Saldanha) Many Democrats have been in and out of the spotlight as the party looks for effective counters to President Donald Trump and his second administration. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have seen their national profiles rise by delivering messages that excite a demoralized and fractured party. Both have urged mass resistance and accused their party of not fighting more. Each has stood out enough to draw sharp retorts from Trump loyalists. But as messengers, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez could not be more different. And their arguments, despite some overlap, are distinct enough to raise familiar questions for Democrats: Should they make their challenges to Trump about threats to democracy and national stability, as Pritzker has done, or portray him as a corrupt billionaire exacerbating an uneven economy, as Ocasio-Cortez does? “People want Trump and Trumpism to be met with equal passion and force,” said National Urban League President Marc Morial, a former New Orleans mayor deeply connected in Democratic politics. On that front, he added, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez “are both effective national figures –- but in very different ways.” He chaired Illinois' Human Rights Commission before running for governor. His family's hotels are unionized, making them regular options for official Democratic Party events. When Democratic President Joe Biden exited the 2024 campaign, Pritzker was floated as a replacement. He made no visible moves, quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris and acted as the de facto host of her nominating convention in his home state. Since Harris' defeat, Pritzker has behaved like a future candidate. “All I'm saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.” Addressing party faithful in the traditional early nominating state of New Hampshire, Pritzker bemoaned “do-nothing” Democrats, called for party honchos to set aside “decades of stale decorum” and urged voters into the streets. It was enough for senior Trump aide Stephen Miller to accuse Pritzker of inciting violence. She has recently headlined “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a two-time presidential candidate. The tour has drawn tens of thousands of people across the country, notably including reliably Republican states, often with overflow crowds outside many stops. She is seen as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, and she only recently became old enough to be constitutionally eligible for the presidency. But she leans more heavily into broader economic and social critiques that she's made since her first House bid and that Sanders has offered for decades. She also played up her roots: “From the waitress who is now speaking to you today, I can tell you: impossible is nothing.” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, argues Pritzker could be more attractive as a “traitor to his class” in the tradition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, which typically backs centrist Democrats, countered that Pritzker could bring a “more stable” version of Trump's argument that his wealth and success is an asset. Trump's biggest liability, Bennett said, is “chaos” that negatively affects people's lives. “People are very mad at Elon Musk, but not because he's rich,” Bennett said of the Tesla CEO who is leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. “They're mad at him because he's vandalizing our government and doing it in a destructive way.” Ocasio-Cortez is often criticized by more moderate Democrats, including Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who has also positioned herself as a thought leader in the party. Slotkin recently suggested the word “oligarchy” didn't resonate with working-class voters. It was an implicit rebuke of the Ocasio-Cortez-Sanders' tour. Shortly after Slotkin's comments about oligarchy, Ocasio-Cortez posted on X: “Plenty of politicians on both sides of the aisle feel threatened by rising class consciousness.” Bennett said Democrats who emerge as party leaders, including the 2028 nominee, will be those who offer solutions for voters' frustration “over their needs not being met.” It's a notion that Green insisted is indistinguishable from criticizing the billionaire class, along with the tax and labor policies that drive wealth and income gaps in the U.S. Whatever direction Democrats choose, Bennett said, Ocasio-Cortez has secured her place as a national voice. “And anybody on the center-left who denies that is just kidding themselves.”</p>

A Houthi missile struck Israeli soil near Tel Aviv's largest airport on Sunday, causing multiple international airlines to cancel flights to Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation for the attack Sunday and will participate in several defense meetings throughout the day. "Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold," said Defense Minister Israel Katz. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with defense officials after a Houthi missile struck near Tel Aviv's airport. Israel has not yet confirmed any specific military retaliation. Over the weekend, the Israeli Air Force says it struck over 100 terror targets in the Gaza Strip, including terrorist cells, tunnels, underground infrastructure sites, and other military structures. IDF troops operating in southern Gaza also located weapons caches in the area, dismantled dozens of terrorist infrastructure sites, and eliminated a number of terrorists. Israeli forces say they eliminated several Hamas terrorists during operations in southern Gaza this weekend. The missile strike comes days after Israel was forced to cancel its independence day celebrations due to wildfires raging throughout the country. Massive wildfires broke out near Jerusalem on Wednesday, forcing road closures and mass evacuations that paralyzed the country. Israel traditionally celebrates its independence with a torch-lighting ceremony. It instead broadcast footage of the rehearsal ceremony. A forest fire burns near Jerusalem, Wednesday, April 30, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like the other ceremonies and traditions that accompany the advent of a new pope, his newly chosen name will be imbued with centuries of Catholic history and dissected for its many layers of meaning. It is a precedent that was set in the early Middle Ages and, while there is no doctrinal reason for a pope to choose a new name, it has become part of the election process. So, how did this tradition come about, what are the meanings behind different papal names, what name could the next pope choose and how will it be announced? The next pope to change his name was Peter Canepanova in the 10th century, who became John XIV to avoid being called Peter II (more on that below), said Liam Temple, assistant professor in the history of Catholicism at the Centre for Catholic Studies at Durham University. After the 10th century, taking a different name became common practice for popes once they had been elected, as popes from countries such as France and Germany adopted more Italian-sounding names to mimic their predecessors. And that then became the custom, with only a handful of popes keeping their baptismal names since, including Marcellus II and Adrian VI, who both served as head of the church in the 16th century. Each name is steeped in its own history and connotations, linked to the achievements or failings of the previous popes or saints who carried it. “Linking to the names of previous popes who weathered crises, inspired reform, or were incredibly popular can often, although not always, play a role in the choosing of a name,”  Temple told CNN. For example, Pope Francis chose his papal name to honor St. Francis of Assisi, with his love for peace and nature, as well as his care for the poor and focus on cooperation between different sects of the church. These associations established the priorities for Francis' papacy. His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, chose his papal name to show his commitment to peace and reconciliation by honoring St. Benedict and Pope Benedict XV, who was head of the church during World War I, Temple said. He identifies the name Urban as an unlikely candidate for the new pope because it would “harken back to Urban VIII, who started the trial of Galileo Galilei, and would not sit well in modern debates about science, faith and religion.” In a similar vein, the name Pius would evoke memories of Pius XII, whose role during World War II has been increasingly criticized, Temple added. If the new pope wishes to continue on a reforming path, Temple said that names like Leo, referencing Leo XIII who was known for his dedication to social justice, fair wages and safe working conditions, or Innocent, referencing Innocent XIII who sought to root out corruption, might be appropriate choices. A new pope who is elected from the Global South, like Pope Francis, may also choose a name adopted by early non-Italian pontiffs such as Gelasius, Miltiades or Victor, who all hailed from the African continent, Temple added. Over the centuries, there have been 44 papal names used only once – most recently Pope Francis' own. His decision to choose  a unique name had “massive historical ramifications,” Temple said, for “it had been around 1,100 years since the last uniquely named pope in the form of Pope Lando, whose pontificate lasted less than a year in the 10th century.” John is the most popular name, with 21 popes choosing to adopt it – although, somewhat confusingly, the last pope to take that name was John XXIII, after historians accidentally misnumbered the popes after John XIV. (Benedict X was declared an antipope, and expelled from the papal throne, hence the discrepancy in numbering for subsequent Benedicts.) For example, when Pope Francis was elected in 2013, his given names of “Jorge Mario” were delivered as “Giorgio Marium,” but his surname “Bergoglio” remained the same.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee, the panel weighing Waltz's nomination, are expected to heavily litigate his judgment after he mistakenly added the Atlantic‘s editor-in-chief to a Signal group chat detailing sensitive military plans. Trump removed Waltz from his post as national security adviser on Thursday, which was viewed as a firing prompted by the controversy. He previously nominated and then pulled Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) from consideration due to concerns over Republicans' slim House majority. Waltz, a former House member, has enjoyed support from within the party, and on Thursday, Republicans suggested he would have no trouble filling the vacancy. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who was informed by reporters of the nomination, quipped that perhaps Stefanik should switch with Waltz and become national security adviser. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is temporarily filling the role. Hawley also projected confidence in Waltz when asked about his prospects: “Unless there's something I'm really missing here, I think [Waltz] would be perfectly fine.” Lawmakers are increasingly anxious to fill the U.N. post, which has been vacant for three months in Trump's second term. Senators on both sides of the aisle have, in recent days, felt a pressing need to confirm an ambassador as Trump clashes over trade and tries to broker an end to foreign conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the top committee Democrat, described Trump's withdrawal of Stefanik as “unfortunate” because it was based on “political considerations, not on qualifications.” “We really need to be pushing back against China and the Russian Security Council,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), another panel Democrat. He praised Waltz's former military experience, time serving in the House, and short stint as national security adviser. “From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,” Trump said. “I know he will do the same in his new role.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum attends her morning press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City, April 2, 2025. MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump proposed sending American troops into Mexico to help her administration fight drug trafficking but that she rejected it. “He said, ‘How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you.' And you know what I said to him? She added: “Sovereignty is not for sale. White House National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt said in a statement later Saturday that Trump has worked closely with Mexico's president “to achieve the most secure southwest border in history.” “The President has been crystal clear that Mexico must do more do combat these gangs and cartels and the United States stands ready to assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries.” The U.S. military presence has increased steadily along its southern border with Mexico in recent months, following Trump's order in January to increase the army's role in stemming the flow of migrants. The U.S. Northern Command has surged troops and equipment to the border, increased manned surveillance flights to monitor fentanyl trafficking along the border and sought expanded authority for U.S. Special Forces to work closely with Mexican forces conducting operations against cartels. Trump designated many of the gangs and cartels smuggling drugs into the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations on Feb. 19, restricting their movements and lending law enforcement more resources to act against them. But Sheinbaum's hardline stance Saturday signaled that U.S. pressure for unilateral military intervention would put her and Trump on a collision course after months of cooperation on immigration and trade.</p>
