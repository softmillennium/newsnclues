                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper could not quite clear the final hurdle as he strove to land his first title on clay. It was a significant hurdle, because Casper Ruud is a clay-court animal who was born and bred for this surface. His nearest competitors are Stefanos Tsitsipas with 95 wins, and Carlos Alcaraz with nine titles, which underlines what an expert Ruud is on the red dirt. Draper, by contrast, has played fewer than 30 matches on the surface, so he is still learning how to deal with its characteristic movement patterns. Towards the end of this match, as the lactic acid burned its way into his muscles, he wasn't able to avoid Ruud's devastating forehand. ‚ÄúI think you really deserve this,‚Äù Draper told Ruud at the presentation ceremony. ‚ÄúYou were braver than me in the key moments. Casper Ruud gets his hands on the Madrid Open trophy üèÜ pic.twitter.com/P3ppPBW1lL At the end of his winning speech, Casper Ruud turns his hand to a bit of Spanish, which was delivered with a good accent and accurate grammar. "I think you really deserve this" üôåJack Draper with nothing but respect for Casper Ruud ü§ù pic.twitter.com/Fdnl7s4shu "It's been a long time coming" ü•∫Casper Ruud reacts to his incredible Madrid Open win! What a moment for Casper Ruud as he wins his first Masters 1000 title ü§©Watch with NOW: https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/wSZzPqrxxh He starts it well by winning the first two points to go 30-0 up. A stunning forehand down the line takes him to 40-0 and three championship points. We were treated to one hell of a final. CASPER RUUD WINS THE BIGGEST TITLE OF HIS CAREER SO FAR!! Draper simply has to win this game to stay alive in this final and he responds by winning the game without losing a point. Ruud was 30-0 up but loses the next two points, including a double fault. Draper goes long and Ruud holds a crucial serve. He is just one game away from the title. Not the time to be double faulting for Draper. He responds by winning the next two points, including a stunning end to a fantastic rally that Ruud must have thought he was going to win but Draper, on the stretch, wins it with a terrific shot across the court. Draper then falls victim to a second time penalty so loses his first serve. He then loses the next two points and Ruud has a big break point. Draper now has the advantage after yet another stunning rally. Draper moves to 30-0 up on serve but drops the next two points. The Briton then goes long again and Ruud has break point. Both players have had numerous break points in the last few games but no-one has been able to take it. No he cannot as Draper takes us to deuce with a great forehand. At the end of that point, Draper did go down but he is back up. Definitely some weariness from Draper there as he dropped to one knee after being outwitted in the forecourt. He's been given the old sleeper hold by Ruud: lots of high, loopy balls that made it hard for Draper to hit winners. He has had to generate a lot of his own pace all match, and the effort is beginning to tell. Ruud is under pressure at 15-30 down on his serve. Could this be a huge moment in the match? Draper cannot take it though as he hits the net. Ruud then goes long at deuce and Draper has a second break point in this game. A stunning serve though from Ruud takes us back to deuce. Draper hits wide and now the advantage goes to Ruud, who takes it to hold serve with a sublime forehand. Ruud then goes 30-15 up but Draper brings it level at 30-30. Draper hits the net, giving Ruud a break point. This could be a hugely pivotal moment in the match. Draper saves himself though and we go to deuce. Draper gets back to advantage but again cannot convert as he registers a double fault. Another advantage for Draper but, after a stunning rally, he wastes the chance once more. Ruud then pulls out a stunning forehand and, for the first time in this game, he has advantage but Draper saves it. Draper goes just wide after a lengthy rally and the advantage is Ruud's. But Draper pulls out an ace when he needed it. Draper finally seals an enthralling game with back-to-back points and takes a 2-1 lead in this deciding set. But the dynamic here is beginning to favour Ruud, with so many long rallies. Sky's Colin Fleming is now pointing out how cold it is on court, maybe 14 degrees, which makes it harder to hit winners. Ruud drops just the one shot as he cruises towards the game and we are all square in this deciding set at 1-1. Draper has serve at the start of this deciding set. It is tight at 30-30 and Draper manages to find an ace on second serve, which rather perplexed Ruud. Draper looks like he will see out the game but superb play from Ruud on the run sees him take it deuce. Draper though wins the next two points to hold serve. It was sealed with a sublime backhand across the court. A stunning backhand from Draper wins him the first point of this game. Ruud then suffers back-to-back double faults to give Draper three break and set points. The double-break ‚Äì which he probably should have had in set one ‚Äì came that time for Draper, and saved him from having to serve it out. Incredible stats for the Brit: 12 winners and one unforced error. What a way to come back from that angry reaction 40 minutes ago. This has been an enthralling match so far, full of momentum swings and quality tennis, the latest example a terrific forehand across the court from Ruud. The Norwegian then moves to 15-40 up and has two break points of his own now. He wins the first two points on Ruud's serve and then the fourth point to set up two break points. He only needs one with a spectacular forehand and that is a crucial break that brings him right back into this match. ü§©A huge forehand gets Jack Draper a massive break in the second set! Draper though had no intention of being broken in that service game as he races through the game without conceding a point and once again we are all square in this second set. Despite a double fault, Ruud sees out the game and holds serve. One thing no one would have expected is Ruud outserving Draper today, especially when it comes to the aces: eight so far as against two. A neat drop shot from Draper takes the Briton to 30-0 up on serve. But Draper sees it out and we are all square in this second set at 2-2. A terrific ace gives Ruud advantage and he looks like he will see out the game but Draper's backhand off a Ruud smash beats the Norwegian and we go back to deuce. Ruud serves at the start of this second set. Draper needs a response and now; Ruud has won five straight games. Draper misjudges a return from Ruud and ends up making a mess of it, allowing Ruud to take the first set. Ruud was on the verge of losing that set but comes back to win it. Ruud burgled that set with some moonballs and all-sorts, and Draper is shouting at his player box about how flat he has been. Or actually, slightly earlier, when he handed over some cheap errors while Ruud was 3-5 down and serving. Draper could have won it there with a double break. But instead he tightened up and has been unable to loosen his arm again. üí™Jack Draper is not happy ‚ùåWatch the action with NOW:https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/SlBTJ7mHG9 An unforced error from Draper allows Ruud to go 40-15 up. Draper moves to 30-15 up but a double fault gives Ruud hope of staying alive in this set. Draper then makes an unforced error and gives Ruud his first break point of the match. This first set is well and truly back on. Draper clearly tightened up as he served for the first set, losing a lot of racket-head speed, and Ruud capitalised expertly. His experience could be a big factor in this match. It also feels as if there are a few too many long rallies going on, from Draper's point of view. This is a crucial service game from Ruud to stay in this set and a double fault will not help. He is in a good position but Ruud has just started to find some form in the last few games so Draper needs to be careful. He cannot take the first chance as his attempted drop shot goes wide. Not sure that was the right choice of shot. Draper is just one game away from the first set. Saw a quiet smile there from Nicky Draper, Jack's mother, as he slammed another forehand winner down the line. It's tough for opponents to play into his forehand corner: they have to get plenty of juice on the ball otherwise he just changes direction on them. Alarming stat coming up for Ruud: he has won two of 11 points on his own second serve. Ruud goes 15-0 up but a stunning shot across the court from Draper takes us to 15-15. He did brilliantly to reach that drop shot from Ruud and then it was a fantastic shot to win the point. Ruud though wins the next three points and easily holds serve. Ruud finding his rhythm now and not giving away many easy points. The pressure is on Draper to find winning combinations, and he has kept it up in his service games to date, despite some heavy pressure. Draper is certainly putting pressure on the Ruud serve. He gets it to 30-30 but a loose shot goes wide, presenting Ruud the chance to hold serve and get back on track in this match. It is a tight tussle in this latest service game, with the momentum swinging one way then another. Ruud makes it back-to-back double faults and Draper secures a crucial early break. It's been a strong start from Draper, with several of those decisive forehand winners which have been such a feature of this campaign. Ruud, by contrast, has just handed over the cheapest of breaks with that double double-fault. He looks to be overplaying a little, which has been another theme of the whole fortnight. Brazilian Ronaldo is in the house, sat alongside Atletico Madrid striker Alexander Sorloth, who will be cheering on his fellow Norwegian Ruud. The Briton has already gone long on a number of occasions so far today. Draper then goes long again, giving Ruud a 30-0 lead. The Norwegian moves to 40-0 but Draper keeps his hopes in this game alive with a terrific forehand down the line. Ruud then hits into the net and he will be a little nervous now serving at 40-30 when he was 40-0 up at one stage. We are under way, with Ruud serving first in the Madrid sunshine. It goes Draper's way and he opts to receive first. First it is Ruud welcomed onto the court followed by Draper. Both players receive a warm reception, in particular Draper. I just think [Casper] Ruud is a top-calibre clay-court player. He will be studying Jack's semi-final with [Lorenzo] Musetti and looking at the way he made that second set really hard for Jack. ‚ÄúIf Jack comes through against Ruud it will be an unbelievable win. ‚ÄúIt is going to be a wonderful final because you have got Casper Ruud, who has been in two French Open finals and a US Open final and starting to find his form again and playing some fabulous tennis on the way to the final. We feel like we have been watching this guy just rise through the ranks and we know he is going to be number five on Monday but it is just the manner in which he has played his tennis with this high-level of consistency and everything that backs up that big serve, big forehand and what he brings to the court. Jack has won one already this year and he is going to try and go for a big title on clay that has been won by so many great champions. It has got all the ingredients for a wonderful final.‚Äù Jack Draper is aiming to win his second ATP title of the year as he takes on Norway's Casper Ruud in the Madrid Open final. Speaking after his semi-final victory over Musetti, Draper acknowledged the challenge facing him in the final against a player like Ruud but is feeling confident. ‚ÄúCasper is a two-time Roland Garros finalist and very accustomed to the clay,‚Äù Draper said. ‚ÄúHe is always tough to beat so it will be a challenge for me but I am ready for it. I feel confident to give it my all and physically good. I came through some five-setters at the Australian Open earlier in the year when not at my best and that has stayed in my memory.‚Äù Meanwhile Ruud booked his place in the final after beating Argentinian Francisco Cerundolo 6-4, 7-5. The world number 15 struggled with a rib injury throughout his semi-final but came through to reach his 18th final on clay. Speaking after beating Cerundolo, Ruud, who has won 11 titles on clay, admitted he was unsure he would finish the match. I felt something in my rib during the warm-up, just towards the end before going out [on court],‚Äù Ruud said. ‚ÄúI felt it in nearly every shot, especially the serve. So I will go and check it out more now.‚Äù This is the first meeting between these two professionally so who will come out on top and win the Madrid Open? The final is set to get under way at 5.30pm BST.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka has won her first title since returning to action from a maternity break. Having not lifted silverware since triumphing at the 2021 Australian Open, she beat Slovenia's Kaja Juvan 6-1, 7-5 in the final of the L'Open 35 de Saint-Malo to bring home her first WTA title in four years, and her first ever on clay. ‚ÄúKinda ironic to win my first trophy back on the surface that I thought was my worst,‚Äù Osaka posted on X. That's one of my favourite things about life though, there's always room to grow and evolve.‚Äù Her victory comes after she lashed out at fans on social media, posting a job application form for those who ‚Äúconstantly had sh** to say‚Äù after booking her spot in the Saint Malo final. Osaka has struggled with her lack of power and accuracy as she failed to progress beyond the second round of any Grand Slam last year. 1 clinched her third WTA title this year with the win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic's Shocking Move Sparks Speculation About His Future Serbian tennis superstar Novak Djokovic has sent shockwaves through the tennis world by opting to skip the Rome Masters 1000, fueling intense speculation about his upcoming plans, including his potential absence at Roland Garros. With disappointing performances in Monte Carlo and Madrid, coupled with his decision to forgo Rome, questions loom over Djokovic's current form and his chances at the French Open. At 37 years old, Djokovic is at a pivotal moment in his illustrious career, contemplating his next moves as he aims to secure more Grand Slam titles before retiring. Drawing parallels to tennis greats Ivan Lendl and Roger Federer, Djokovic could be considering a similar strategy to optimize his chances at Wimbledon, a tournament where he has previously excelled despite setbacks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former doubles world number one Todd Woodbridge has sounded the alarm, stating that the next five to six weeks are critical for Djokovic's career. At 37 years old, Djokovic, with an impressive 24 Grand Slam titles to his name, is facing a challenging period by his lofty standards. His recent performances have been lackluster, with exits from tournaments becoming more frequent. Woodbridge highlighted that Djokovic's aura of invincibility has diminished in the eyes of his opponents, potentially pushing him towards retirement if his game doesn't improve by Wimbledon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams will be back on our screens this year. The 44-year-old tennis legend will serve as a broadcaster for TNT Sports at this year's French Open as she joins a star-studded broadcast team. Williams is on commentary duties alongside Andre Agassi, Chris Evert, Jim Courier, Lindsay Davenport, John McEnroe, and Caroline Wozniacki. This will be Williams' first major broadcasting role at a Slam since stepping back from full-time competition. The move follows TNT Sports becoming the US television rights holder for Roland Garros, taking over from NBC. The five-time Wimbledon champion will also be a lead analyst. "I know what it's like to battle on the clay, and I'm looking forward to sharing that experience,‚Äù Williams said in a press release. Her tennis career is filled with trophies, and her informed insights and analysis should go down well with fans. Williams' last Grand Slam appearance was at the 2023 US Open and her last victory at any level came against Veronika Kudermetova in Cincinnati two weeks before that. Much of Williams' time off the court has been occupied by her business commitments -- she owns the interior design company V Starr. While her inactivity on tour has made many think she has unofficially retired, the fact that she has not called it quits at the age of 44 is a remarkable feat, especially given her physical circumstances. In 2019, she was diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune condition that can cause fatigue and joint pain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World number one Sabalenka is also likely to challenge, having picked up another ‚Äòbig' clay-court title recently. Immediately after Sabalenka's Madrid Open victory, one former British star revealed who he is picking to win Roland Garros in 2025. Speaking to Sky Sports after Sabalenka took down Coco Gauff in the Madrid Open final, former British doubles star Colin Fleming made his French Open predictions. ‚ÄúI think she [Aryna Sabalenka] is now pretty firm favourite for Roland Garros, with all that has gone on, as we stand here in Madrid,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBefore this tournament started, I would still have picked [Iga] Swiatek as the favourite, despite the fact she was out of form, because I would have said I think she will find something in Madrid and Rome and by the time Roland Garros comes around [she'll be back]. ‚ÄúBut although Iga made the semis you would say it's not a terrible result, the manner of the semi-final I just think there is a question mark of how she will be in Rome and Roland Garros.‚Äù Swiatek lost to Gauff, 1-6, 1-6, in this year's Madrid Open semi-finals, suffering her worst loss on a clay court since she won just one game in defeat to Simona Halep at the French Open six years ago. ‚ÄúI know she has not won every tournament this season, but she has been close, if not won it, and she is the one primed and ready to get that first Roland Garros title.‚Äù When the next set of rankings are released on Monday, Sabalenka will lead her closest rival, Swiatek, by 4,345 points. With Swiatek set to defend 3,000 points (Italian Open/French Open victories) over the next month or so, it certainly looks like the Belarusian will hold on to the number one spot for quite some time. Fleming thinks the world number one will pick up her maiden Roland Garros title next month, and when looking at form, the prediction makes a lot of sense. Sabalenka came closest to reaching the French Open final two years ago, when she lost a three-set thriller to Czech star Karolina Muchova, 6-7, 7-6, 5-7. Sabalenka will begin her 2025 French Open campaign when the tournament begins on Sunday, May 25.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TNT Sports has officially unveiled its elite commentary crew for Roland Garros 2025, and the announcement came with a surprise addition: Venus Williams is all set to join the star-studded broadcast team. One of the most iconic names in tennis history, Venus will lend her voice and insight to what promises to be one of the most elite commentary lineups in recent memory. She joins a legendary group that includes Andre Agassi, Chris Evert, Jim Courier, Lindsay Davenport, John McEnroe, and Caroline Wozniacki. Another notable name on the list is Sloane Stephens, signaling that she has not yet made her return from injury and will not be participating as a player in this year's French Open. Both players bring Grand Slam experience and precious viewpoints that will no doubt elevate TNT's live coverage. This marks a new chapter for Venus, who has rarely taken on commentary duties in the past. Known for her strategic intelligence, calm demeanor, and unmatched achievements both on and off the court, Venus's presence in the broadcast booth is expected to be a major draw for viewers. On the other hand, Stephens, a former U.S. Open champion and Roland Garros finalist, has previously hinted at exploring media work while recovering from her injury. Roland Garros 2025 may be missing a few stars on the court, but thanks to TNT's powerhouse commentary team, the tournament coverage is already looking like a Grand Slam.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's your definitive guide to doing Wimbledon the right way. "Ladies and gentlemen... if you are opening a bottle of champagne, don't do it as the players are about to serve" üçæThe most #Wimbledon warning ever from umpire John Blom ü§£ pic.twitter.com/57GBixnM4U Wimbledon may be the only place on earth where queuing is treated like a sacred rite. Fans often camp overnight in hopes of snagging same-day show court tickets. In pre-pandemic times, this meant arriving with a two-person tent, following the official Queuing Code of Conduct, and keeping your Queue Card safe like a golden ticket. During COVID years, the iconic queue was temporarily replaced by digital ticketing and reduced crowds. But with the queue back in action, patience, civility, and common sense are non-negotiable. Wimbledon isn't Royal Ascot, but it's no place for flip-flops and beer-logo tees either. There's no formal dress code for general spectators, but understated elegance is always in style. Avoid ripped jeans, dirty trainers, gym clothes, and slogan tees. Big hats are discouraged‚Äîthey block the view‚Äîand flashy logos or political messaging is a hard no. Now, if you're invited to the Royal Box, it's a whole different ball game. Gentlemen are expected to wear a jacket and tie, while ladies must opt for formal daywear. They face perhaps the strictest dress code in professional sport: all white, right down to undergarments and trim. Even a hint of colour can lead to mid-match wardrobe changes or disqualification. Jeans at Wimbledon...is a violation of etiquette. Clapping mid-rally or yelling a player's name before serve? It's just not cricket (or tennis, for that matter). When it comes to moving around the court, stewards are strict. You'll only be allowed to enter or leave during changeovers‚Äîtypically after every third game. If you're seated during play, stay put and enjoy the action. Just remember: alcohol is limited to one bottle of wine or two cans of beer per person, and glass bottles, thermos flasks, or opaque containers are not allowed. Carry an umbrella: The British weather loves drama. Be nice to stewards: They're just doing their job‚Äîand might save you from breaking a rule. Keep your ticket or Queue Card on you at all times. Dress well, clap politely, and always follow the rules.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it was over and the ecstatic crowd at La Caja Magic jumped to its collective feet in applause, Aryna Sabalenka did not fall to the crushed red clay beneath her, didn't scream or pump her fists or even openly exult. She merely raised her arms in a perfect V -- for victory. And then, blowing kisses to the camera, strolled to her changeover chair, fished a camera out of her bag, crossed the court and snapped a picture of her team. After that thoroughly professional 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory over Coco Gauff on Saturday, Sabalenka is now a three-time Mutua Madrid Open champion. Winning is never guaranteed, but in Sabalenka's mind, this was expected. Her will manifested itself in the moments that mattered. 1 will become only the third woman to amass more than 11,000 ranking points and is nearly 4,000 ahead of No. Sabalenka is more than 1,600 points clear of No. She's the only player with three titles so far -- Brisbane, Miami and Madrid -- and has collected back-to-back WTA 1000 titles on vastly different surfaces. Her 31 match-wins are also the most among Hologic WTA Tour players. This was Gauff's 10th match against Sabalenka in six years. ‚ÄúI feel like she just got a lot better in everything,‚Äù Gauff said. ‚ÄúI think she just probably is more confident, so that's why the consistent results are happening.‚Äù Back in January, Sabalenka was going for her third consecutive Australian Open but Keys was simply too good in the final. For Sabalenka, who started the year 11-0, it was a devastating loss. Sabalenka's won 19 of her past 21 and even with the slow surfaces in Rome and Paris looming, she's going to like her chances. A few hours after the win in Madrid, Sabalenka fielded some questions from wtatennis.com: Looking back, how did losing that Australian Open final motivate you to produce the best start of your career heading into Rome? Sabalenka: Yeah, honestly, that final was the toughest one. I really struggled to accept that match, tough loss. Then I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder. Your last two matches, four of six sets went to seven games -- you won them all ‚Ä¶ how proud are you of the fact you competed so well in the most important moments? Super happy with the level I played this week and hopefully I can keep going the way everything is going. Your defense doesn't get a lot of attention, but ‚Ä¶ against Coco how important was it to stay in some of those long points? Sabalenka: It's very important to not only be an attacking player, but in those key moments to be a good defender and dig really deep in there, try to steal a few points. It definitely brings more confidence in your game. Only four women in 40 years won their first six matches against Top 10 players in straight sets ‚Äì their names are Martina Navratilova (1986), Steffi Graf (1994, 1995 and 1996), Serena Williams (2014) -- and Aryna Sabalenka ‚Ä¶ what do you think of that? They achieved so much, these players I look up to. Me, being in the same line with them ‚Ä¶ it just sounds crazy and I couldn't be more proud. Sabalenka: I definitely feel really good about my game. And now, still, I want to get better. Three Madrid titles ‚Ä¶ the way you're playing, in your mind, can you win in Rome or Paris for the first time?</p>
