                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French police rescued the father of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur from his kidnappers Saturday night, but found he'd had one of his fingers severed – the latest in a spate of abductions tied to cryptocurrency. The victim, who has not been publicly identified, was forced into a van by four men wearing ski masks on a street of Paris Thursday morning. He was held hostage in an Airbnb 12 miles south of the French capital for two days before being rescued. The kidnapping shares striking similarities with other recent kidnappings tied to crypto currency in France and surrounding countries. In January 2025, David Balland, cofounder of the crypto wallet company Ledger, was kidnapped with his wife from their home in central France. In December 2024, the wife of crypto investor and influencer Stéphane Winkel was kidnapped from the couple's home in Belgium. She was rescued after her kidnapper crashed his car in a dramatic police chase, Winkel wrote in a post on X. It is unclear whether the recent spate of crypto kidnappings are connected or not. “Obviously there's at least a link in the modus operandi. Now, whether it's the same team or not is for the investigators to say.” said internal security expert Guillaume Farde speaking on French television Sunday. Police have opened an investigation into the latest kidnapping, including for extortion by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy, the Paris Prosecutor's office told CNN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Commons leader had appeared to suggest Reform commentator was using a political ‘dog whistle' No 10 has backed the cabinet minister Lucy Powell after she apologised for appearing to suggest it was a “dog whistle” issue to discuss grooming gangs. She apologised on Saturday, saying: “In the heat of a discussion on AQ [Any Questions], I would like to clarify that I regard issues of child exploitation and grooming with the utmost seriousness. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said on Sunday that everyone makes mistakes and it was time to move forward after Powell had said sorry for her lack of clarity. Asked if Powell's job was safe, he told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News: “Yes. Reform said Keir Starmer should consider whether Powell was still fit to serve in her job. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, went further by calling on Powell to resign. “This shocking outburst from a Labour cabinet minister belittles the thousands of girls and women who were raped by grooming gangs over decades,” he said. “We have consistently called for a national inquiry in parliament, which has been blocked by Labour ministers who don't seem to know or care about the disgusting crimes which have been perpetrated. To dismiss thousands of victims who were raped and the cover-up that followed is sickening. Starmer said on Wednesday there had already been an inquiry and its recommendations would be implemented. He told parliament that Labour was “delivering truth and justice for victims”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's Saturday night at a rooftop bar in downtown Atlanta, and the band Orden Activa is about to launch into a Mexican ballad. The crowd rises to its feet and sings in Spanish as the dance floor dissolves into a sea of cowboy hats: With their gently bobbing heads, matching leather jackets and knowing smiles, their act hardly screams controversy – or at least not to the casual observer. Yet last month, a group that sang the very same song – “El del Palenque” (“He of the Cockfighting Arena”) – was barred from the United States in an unprecedented move that critics say raises troubling questions about free speech in America. Authorities in both countries took exception when video of the concert went viral. “The last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists,” said US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau in a post on X. While songs about the drug trade have been censored on and off in Mexico for years, observers say increasing pressure from the Trump administration to clamp down on cartels has fueled a new wave of bans on public performance of narcocorridos in several Mexican states. Even more worryingly, they say, are signs that Mexican bands are beginning to self-censor in the fear that upsetting US authorities could compromise their ability to tour. Related article ‘Narcocorridos': El Chapo's jailbreak inspires new round of folk songs Some critics paint it as the latest anti-Mexico move by the Trump administration, which has already strained ties with its immigration crackdowns and tariff policies. “(These bands) have been saved up to now by the fact that nobody spoke Spanish,” Wald said. It has to do with a politics of revoking visas.” Asked about Los Alegres del Barranco, the State Department told CNN they could not discuss individual cases. Figures from Billboard show the band subsequently gained over 2 million new listens on streaming services, proof if any were needed of the enduring modern appeal of a genre rooted in 19th century folk music that has long romanticized outlaws, outcasts and underdogs. Early corridos or ballads celebrated the exploits of “famous bandits, generals, sometimes horses, sometimes fighting roosters as well,” according to Sam Quinones, a writer who covers music and the drug trade in Mexico and California. “It was almost like a musical newspaper,” Quinones said. A century later and that subgenre is still booming. The most popular musical artist among US YouTube users in 2023 was not Taylor Swift, but the narcocorrido singer Peso Pluma. But experts say a cultural shift took place when drug traffickers began paying musicians to write songs about themselves in the mid-1980s, when the legendary “King of Corridos” Chalino Sanchez began accepting commissions. “It meant anybody with money could commission a laudatory corrido.” Since then, many singers and groups “have been sponsored by or have performed for specific figures in the narco-world, and are thought of as being aligned with particular cartels,” Wald said, leading to a situation that's “definitely dangerous for the artists.” “The corrido used to be about a simple man going up against power, knowing he was doomed, knowing he was going to die and fighting anyway,” Quinones said. “People say, ‘Oh, parents, don't let your kid play Call of Duty, or your kid's gonna grow up to be a shooter! '” said Ray Mancias, a 19-year-old guitarist who performed after Orden Activa at the show in Atlanta. “I think that's the way they're seeing (narcocorridos) as well. Noel Flores – one of Orden Activa's two singers – suggests authorities that try to ban narcocorridos risk shooting themselves in the foot. “That's just gonna make people want it more,” Flores said. While some Mexican states have tried to ban the songs, and the US State Department their singers, Mexico's President Sheinbaum has taken a softer approach – ruling out a nationwide ban and proposing instead that the government promote music about peace and love as an alternative – a position that has led to some ridicule. “She's trying the rather comical alternative of trying to sponsor nice music that people will listen to instead, which is charming,” Wald said. “With everything going on with (Trump), as a Mexican, cancelling corridos makes us feel more ‘less,'” said Emmanuel Gonzalez, who attended the concert in Atlanta. Other fans have been rowdier about the idea of cancelling corridos. When the singer Luis R. Conriquez refused to play drug-themed music at an April concert in Texcoco, Mexico, citing a local ban, he told the booing audience, “There are no corridos tonight. Related article Trump administration considering labeling some suspected cartel and gang members inside the US as ‘enemy combatants' Oswaldo Zavala, a professor of literature and expert on narcoculture, says many musicians are  self-censoring not out of deference to Mexican authorities, but “in response to Donald Trump's presidency… the fear that (Trump) may revoke their visas that allow them to perform and produce their music in the US.” A few days after their Atlanta concert, Orden Activa posted a video of their performance  alongside the caption: “Let's see if they don't take away our visa. Still, amid the fears there are those that take comfort in the irony that driving underground a form of music that has always celebrated outlaws will likely make it only more popular.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A coalition of advocacy organizations on Saturday expressed support for Wisconsin Gov. The groups — including All Voting Is Local and the ACLU of Wisconsin — said in a joint statement that Evers' guidance to state officials on how to handle being confronted by federal agents was “a prudent measure aimed at ensuring compliance with state and federal laws while protecting the rights of state employees.” “To threaten our governor over his legal directive is gross overreach by our federal government, and it is not occurring in a vacuum,” they continued, warning that the administration's rhetoric and actions represent a “chilling attempt to normalize fascism.” Trump administration officials and the president himself have repeatedly threatened state and local officials as the White House rushes ahead with its lawless mass deportation campaign, which has ensnared tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants and at least over a dozen U.S. citizens — including children. In an executive order signed late last month, Trump accused “some state and local officials” of engaging in a “lawless insurrection” against the federal government by refusing to cooperate with the administration's deportation efforts. But as Temple University law professor Jennifer Lee recently noted, localities “can legally decide not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.” “Cities, like states, have constitutional protections against being forced to administer or enforce federal programs,” Lee wrote. “The Trump administration cannot force any state or local official to assist in enforcing federal immigration law.” Administration officials have also leveled threats against members of Congress, with Homan suggesting earlier this year that he would refer Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to the U.S. Justice Department for holding a webinar informing constituents of their rights. During a town hall on Friday, Ocasio-Cortez dared Homan to do so. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian military intelligence claims Su-30 destroyed over waters near Russian port city of Novorossiisk, drawing no comment from Moscow. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has dismissed a three-day truce ordered by Vladimir Putin as theatrics but said Kyiv was ready for a full ceasefire. “This is more of a theatrical performance on his part, because in two or three days it is impossible to develop a plan for the next steps to end the war,” the Ukrainian president said on Friday in remarks embargoed until Saturday. Moscow claimed the truce, set to coincide with its second world war commemorations on 9 May, was aimed at testing Kyiv's “readiness” for long-term peace. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, said on Saturday that nobody could guarantee Kyiv would survive to see 10 May if Ukraine attacked Moscow during the 9 May celebrations. The Kremlin has rejected calls by Kyiv and Washington for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. A Russian overnight drone attack on Kyiv  injured at least 11 people, including two children, and set several residential buildings throughout the city on fire, the military and officials of the Ukrainian capital said on Sunday. Falling debris from destroyed drones sparked fires at buildings in Kyiv's Obolonskyi and Sviatoshynskyi districts, the head of Kyiv's military administration said on social media. Timur Tkachenko added that several cars throughout the city also caught alight. Ukraine's emergency service said 76 firefighters were involved in putting out the fires. Russian shelling killed two people in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region on Saturday, while a drone strike on the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson left one other person dead, regional officials said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Patriot air defense system based in Israel will be transferred to Ukraine after refurbishment, the New York Times reported on May 4, citing four unnamed current and former U.S. officials. According to the publication, Western allies are also discussing the logistics of supplying additional systems from Germany or Greece as Russia escalates its attacks across Ukraine. Kyiv has consistently pressed Western partners to bolster Ukraine's air defenses, warning that its current capabilities are insufficient to counter the scale of Russian missile and drone assaults. According to the New York Times, Ukraine currently has eight Patriot systems, of which only six are operational. President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated Ukraine's urgent need for air defenses in an April 13 interview with CBS News, saying Kyiv is ready to purchase 10 U.S.-made Patriot systems for $15 billion to shield densely populated cities. "We will find the money and pay for everything," Zelensky said, emphasizing Ukraine's intention to buy, not request, additional systems. Despite Kyiv's appeals, Trump dismissed the request on April 14, accusing Zelensky of "always looking to purchase missiles" and falsely blaming Ukraine for instigating the war. On April 24, he criticized a Russian strike on Kyiv that killed at least nine civilians and injured 87, calling it "not necessary" and urging Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the attacks. Shortly after taking office, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force negotiations, saying "we can do it the easy way or the hard way," though no measures have materialized so far. Trump has recently questioned Russia's intentions to seek peace, as Moscow continues to reject a complete ceasefire agreement, intensifying attacks against Ukrainian civilian areas.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PDF metadata revealed a letter circulated in the House was written by Paragon Health Institute President Brian Blase. Health policy advocates say such a change would make it more difficult for eligible enrollees to keep their Medicaid coverage. The letter signed by Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and other House Republicans aligns with Paragon's objectives, claiming that “political abuse” of Medicaid “is helping to bankrupt the federal government” and calling for “structural Medicaid reform” in the party's forthcoming reconciliation package. Tony Carrk, executive director of the watchdog group Accountable.US, said in a statement that “you'd be hard pressed to find a more shameless example of congressional Republicans taking their cues from special interests at the cost of the American people than Chip Roy copying and pasting a letter directly from… special interests.” Earlier this week, as Common Dreams reported, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said he would not accept more than $500 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A man exits a voting booth before casting his vote in the first round of the presidential election redo in Bucharest, Romania, on May 4.Andreea Alexandru/The Canadian Press Romanians are casting ballots Sunday in a critical presidential election rerun after last year's annulled vote plunged the European Union and NATO member country into its worst political crisis in decades. Eleven candidates are vying for the presidency and a May 18 runoff is expected. By 5 p.m. 7.1 million people – about 39.6 per cent of eligible voters – had cast ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau, with 799,000 votes cast at polling stations set up in other countries. As in many EU countries, anti-establishment sentiment is running high in Romania, fuelled by high inflation and cost of living, a large budget deficit and a sluggish economy. While data from local surveys should be taken with caution, a median of polls suggests that hard-right nationalist George Simion will enter the runoff, likely pitting him against Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, or the governing coalition's candidate, Crin Antonescu. I have no other goal than first place for the Romanian people.” Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician and former anti-corruption activist who founded the Save Romania Union party (USR) in 2016, is running on a pro-EU “Honest Romania” ticket. “I voted with realism, because Romania is going through a difficult time,” he said. Victor Ponta, who was prime minister from 2012-2015, has also pushed a MAGA-style “Romania First” campaign and boasts of having close ties to the Trump administration. “What happened in December 2024 is definitely a dark chapter in the history of this country, and we can no longer accept it,” he said. Simion said that his hard-right nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians party is “perfectly aligned with the MAGA movement,” capitalizing on a growing wave of populism in Europe after U.S. President Donald Trump's political comeback. Retiree Done Chiritoi says he feels robbed of his previous vote, which has left him with “only bad words” for the political class. “If my vote gets cancelled again or if the one I chose won't get elected, I'll take to the streets,” he said. The election redo is a crossroads moment for Romania as it seeks to restore its democracy and retain its geopolitical alliances, which have become strained since the cancelled election fiasco.

During his first public address since winning the election, Mr. Carney said he will travel to Washington to meet Mr. Trump at the White House on Tuesday. Auto workers at the Stellantis Windsor Assembly Plant leave after the last day shift before a two-week shutdown, in Windsor, Ont., on Friday, April 4, 2025.Dax Melmer/The Canadian Press Some are rerouting U.S.-bound shipments from China to Canada and storing goods in Canadian warehouses – a move that, experts says, risks flooding the Canadian market and raising competition for already scarce warehouse storage. Automakers in Canada are also an early sign of how Trump's trade policies will upend the North American industry. The company also announced that the Stellantis NV auto assembly plant in Windsor, Ont., will close for a week beginning on May 5, putting 3,800 workers on temporary layoff. General Motors Co. also said this week it will cut one of three shifts at its pickup-truck plant in Oshawa, Ont., by the fall. The average unemployment rate for recent grads in the first quarter of 2025 was 11.2 per cent, according to an analysis of Statistics Canada data from Brendon Bernard, senior economist at job-search site Indeed Canada.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be among the first to get it. Pro-Russian demonstrators staged an Immortal Regiment rally in Washington, D.C, on May 3 to mark 80 years since the end of World War II, representatives of NFO Ukrainian Cultural Front D.C. reported on Facebook. The Immortal Regiment was originally a grassroots campaign launched in 2012 to honor WWII veterans. Its members have complained that it has since been co-opted by the Kremlin and transformed into a political spectacle. While officially commemorating relatives who fought in World War II, the march reinforces narratives of Russian military glory and is used to legitimize Moscow's current military actions, including the war against Ukraine. Washington police blocked streets and guarded the march's participants. Ukrainian protesters carried flags and posters that read "(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is wanted for genocide," "Honor the dead, bring Russia to justice," and "Putin = Hitler." They also displayed a photo of Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, tortured in Russian captivity, according to the Ukrainian Cultural Front DC NGO. Victory Day, celebrated on May 9, is a cornerstone of Putin's nationalist narrative. By glorifying the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, Putin aims to rally support, display military power, and frame Russia as a heroic nation resisting Western aggression.</p>

NEW DELHI, May 4. /TASS/. Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh may not attend the Victory Parade in Moscow this year as planned, the PTI news agency reported, citing sources in the government.

It is possible that his deputy, State Minister of Defense Sanjay Seth, will attend in his place.

According to the sources, this decision was made due to escalated tensions between India and Pakistan following the deadly terror attack in the popular tourist town of Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir where 26 individuals were killed.

On April 22, armed militants opened fire on tourists in the town of Pahalgam in northern India (Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir), killing 25 Indian nationals and one tourist from Nepal, and wounding many more. The perpetrators managed to flee the scene.

Earlier, an invitation to attend the Victory Parade in Red Square in Moscow was sent to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists that Modi will be unable to attend and the country will be represented at the event by other officials.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House on May 2 shared a $1 trillion military budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 and some congressional Republicans have said the funding doesn't quite add up. ), the Senate Armed Services Committee chair, was quick to dispute Vought's budget. The White House reached its $1 trillion defense budget figure by combining this $892.6 billion budget request for fiscal year 2026 with a $119.3 billion that's part of a supplemental defense spending plan that's currently advancing through Congress as a reconciliation bill. “President Trump successfully campaigned on a Peace Through Strength agenda but his advisers at the Office of Management and Budget were apparently not listening,” Wicker wrote. Wicker said more military funding is necessary to ensure that Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping “does not launch a military war against us in Asia.” He also raised concerns about existing security challenges from countries such as Russia and Iran, and from Hamas and the Houthis; terrorist groups based in Gaza and Yemen, respectively. Collins also expressed disapproval of the White House plan. Beyond military spending, Collins also raised objections to White House plans to cut funding or outright eliminate other programs including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the Department of Education's TRIO programs, and other programs related to biomedical research. Introducing its budget plan on Friday, the White House said it has proposed the lowest level of non-defense spending since 2017, achieving savings by “eliminating radical diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and critical race theory programs, Green New Scam funding, large swaths of the Federal Government weaponized against the American people, and moving programs that are better suited for States and localities to provide.” Under the White House plan, the Department of Homeland Security would also receive a 65 percent funding increase. The Epoch Times reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive a response by publication time.</p>

In response, Tokyo has insisted that it will make no concessions as it presses for a complete overhaul of each of the duties imposed Saturday, including those on auto parts. “There is still a wide gulf between [Japan's and the United States'] positions, and no common ground has emerged,” Ishiba told reporters after the meeting. “We are [pushing to negotiate] all the tariffs, including those on automobiles, steel and aluminum.” Ishiba also called the new duties on auto parts “extremely regrettable” and said Japan would “continue to demand that they be reversed.” Unlike the reciprocal tariffs, the automotive duty is a flat 25% rate applied equally to every country, and it is said that Washington will not grant Japan special treatment. Automobiles, however, are Japan's core industry, with an extensive supply chain for parts makers, and leaving the tariffs in place could cause the entire Japanese economy to stall. Japan and the United States have agreed to hold an intensive series of ministerial meetings starting in mid-May. Speaking to reporters at Haneda Airport immediately after landing on Saturday, Akazawa revealed that working-level talks had already begun in the United States on Friday local time, stressing that “discussions on individual issues and technical details are also extremely important.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“What has happened in the last 30, 45 days … is really nothing,” Buffett told shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on May 3 in Omaha, Nebraska. “This is not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort.” Buffett made clear that wild market swings, while unsettling in the moment, are nothing to panic about. “If it makes a difference to you whether your stocks are down 15 percent or not, you need a somewhat different investment philosophy,” he said. He reminded attendees that Berkshire Hathaway's stock has dropped by 50 percent three times in its history, and each time, the fundamentals of the company remained sound. The S&P 500 capped its longest winning streak since 2004 last week, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 560 points on Friday. In its quarterly filing, Berkshire warned that “considerable uncertainty remains” due to “ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events,” including tariffs, supply chain inefficiencies, and fluctuating customer demand. “It is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences on most, if not all, of our operating businesses,” the company noted. Four years ago, Buffett picked Abel to be his successor at the helm of Berkshire, but prior to Saturday's announcement, he gave no indication when he would retire. Buffett also weighed in on broader policy issues, particularly trade and energy. He also noted that America's fragmented energy infrastructure poses challenges and called for smart policies. “It is important that the United States have an intelligent energy policy, just as it was important during World War II that we learned how to make ships instead of cars extremely fast,” he said. We combined private enterprise with ... the power of ... government,” he said.</p>
