                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the crypto market, bold predictions aren't just talk - they're backed by real dollars, often through option plays that resemble lottery tickets offering outsized upside for relatively small costs. Over 5,000 contracts were active in the June $300K call at press time, with a notional open interest of $484 million. On Deribit, one options contract represents 1 BTC. Quarterly expiries, such as the one due on June 26, drive heightened market activity and volatility, with traders using these deadlines to hedge positions, lock in gains, or speculate on the next price moves. Deep OTM calls, also called wings, require a large move in the underlying asset's price to become profitable and, hence, are significantly cheaper compared to those closer to or below the asset's going market rate. However, the payoff is huge if the market rallies, which makes them similar to buying lottery tickets with slim odds but potential for a big payout. Deribit's BTC options market has experienced similar flows during previous bull cycles, but those bets rarely gained enough popularity to rank as the second-most preferred play in quarterly expiries. Explaining the chunky notional open interest in the $300K call, GSR's Trader Simranjeet Singh said, "I suspect this is mostly an accumulation of relatively cheap wings betting on broader U.S. reg narrative being pro-crypto and the 'wingy possibility' (no pun intended) of a BTC strategic reserve that was punted around at the start of the administration." On Friday, Senator Cynthia Lummis said in a speech that she's "particularly pleased with President Trump's support of her BITCOIN Act. I'm grateful for a forward-thinking president who not only recognizes this, but acts on it," Lummis said on X. According to Amberdata's Director of Derivatives, notable selling in the $300K call expiring on June 26 occurred in April as part of the covered call strategy, which traders use to generate additional yield on top of their spot market holdings. "My thought is that the selling volume on April 23 came from traders generating income against a long position," Magadini told CoinDesk. "Each option sold for about $60 at 100% implied volatility." Selling higher strike OTM call options and collecting premium while holding a long position in the spot market is a popular yield-generating strategy in both crypto and traditional markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a significant update to the protocol's long-term roadmap, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has called for the simplification of ETH's base protocol to make the network more efficient and resilient. In a May 3rd blog post titled “Simplifying the L1,” Buterin shared his perspective on the need to simplify the Ethereum network, stating that simplicity is an important—but easy to undervalue—aspect of scalability and resilience. Even a smart high school student is capable of fully wrapping their head around and understanding the Bitcoin protocol. According to Buterin, protocol simplicity offers a variety of benefits that are crucial to ensuring that blockchain networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, remain a credibly neutral and globally trusted base layer. In the blog post, Buterin also described how the Ethereum network can become close to as simple as Bitcoin in five years. According to the co-founder, one of the three ways of achieving this simplicity is through a more optimal consensus layer, with most notably a 3-slot finality redesign. To fix this, the crypto co-founder proposed replacing the EVM with a new minimal virtual machine (like RISC-V). The biggest challenge with meaningfully simplifying (or even improving without complexifying) any part of the EVM is how to balance accomplishing the desired goals with preserving backwards compatibility for existing applications. Finally, Buterin outlined that the third and “most easily underrated” way of enhancing protocol simplicity is to share one standard across different parts of the protocol. “There is typically very little or no benefit to using different protocols to do the same thing in different places,” the Ethereum co-founder said. Buterin concluded that simplicity is extremely similar to decentralization, which are both requisite in achieving resilience in blockchains. While Buterin will be looking to make adjustments to the Ethereum network, ETH investors will hope that these enhancements will translate to the value of the Ether token. ETH's performance has been quite underwhelming so far in 2025, registering four red months to start the year. It is worth mentioning that the Ethereum price has enjoyed some bullish momentum in the past two weeks, with its value increasing by nearly 15% in that period.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a ten-year-old interview with the Guardian, Elden Ring director and creator Hidetaka Miyazaki credited the early-2000s PlayStation 2 game Ico as having an incredible impact on his life, ultimately swaying him to pursue a career in video game development. If you're old enough to have played Ico back in 2001, you likely haven't forgotten its beautifully somber tone and minimalist approach to puzzle-platforming that felt completely authentic and original. If you never had the chance to play Ico, however, you're in luck — the game is actually available to stream on PS Plus Premium right now. Ico helped Miyazaki see what video games could be, and the best way to understand why it had such a profound impact on him is to go play Ico yourself. In a decade-old interview with The Guardian, FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki claimed that Ico was one of the games that made him want to create video games of his own, largely due to Ico's innovative gameplay and simple yet powerful storytelling. These features were a core motivator behind Miyazaki's development of Dark Souls, ultimately spawning the entire Soulsborne genre that encompasses games like Bloodborne and Elden Ring, among others. As shared in translation by VGC, Miyazaki describes Ico as "a beautiful, untold experience and story that I had never imagined [...] I was quietly moved and silent." After reading through these old interviews, I felt an urge to replay Ico, and it turns out that it's available to stream on PS Plus with a Premium subscription. Despite its crude early-PlayStation graphics, Ico is still a mesmerizing and enjoyable experience. Aside from being a total nostalgia trip, I started paying more attention to the details of Ico that reminded me of Miyazaki's work. The world of Ico is a somber and mysterious one, and its gameplay feels like an early version of what the Soulsborne genre would eventually become. In Ico, a young horned boy named Ico helps free a princess named Yorda from her evil mother, the Queen, who plans to use Yorda to become immortal. What ensues is a 3D puzzle-platforming adventure through a mystical and labyrinthine castle full of all sorts of twists, turns, ominous ghost enemies, and even obnoxious flying enemies like those found throughout the Soulsborne universe. You'll be able to unlock new cosmetics for each character in Elden Ring Nightreign, including some iconic outfits from previous FromSoftare games. Gameplay in Ico is very reminiscent of what you experience in Dark Souls and its ilk, particularly when it comes to some of the platformer elements, like traversing narrow high-beams in the rafters, extra-long ladders between levels, and especially how the player's actions influence the environment and open up shortcuts or new pathways. Ico's influence likely extends to many modern juggernauts in the industry. I'd highly recommend giving Ico a try if you haven't had the chance to play it. For those looking beyond PS Plus, its successors are also worth checking out. The real question I have about Team Ico's games is whether they're planning any new remasters, and I think the answer to that might be coming very soon. Shadow of the Colossus creator Fumito Ueda and his team at GenDesign issues yet another tease concerning their next big project. And as GenDESIGN's next project is fast-approaching, I'm very hopeful we will see an announcement about re-releases, remasters, or remakes in the coming months. I'll be surprised if we don't see some sort of remake or remaster for one or even all three of these games as a bundled promo around the time of GenDESIGN's next major release, currently referred to as "Project Robot." This project has been rumored for some time and was officially teased during the 2024 Game Awards with no name or major information. The influence that Ico had on innovators such as Miyazaki is undeniable, and with so many different remasters and remakes in the works across all genres, it would be a major missed opportunity for Sony not to jump in and give fans updated versions of these classics. These games are distinctly different from Soulsborne epics, but the ambiance, tone, settings, themes, and certain aspects of gameplay have some definite overlap that you'll find familiar, entertaining, and every bit as beautiful. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Oblivion Remastered has raised some questions about The Elder Scrolls 6, but ES6 can't follow Oblivion's lead if it wants Skyrim's success. One item in Act 1 has a secret purpose which alludes to Shadowheart's backstory with Shar and changes a familiar cutscene in Baldur's Gate 3. Grand Theft Auto 6's delay may seem like terrible news, especially for fans, but it is actually the best thing that could have happened in 2025. Putting together the best party build for your characters in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 can be a little complicated with so many skills and weapons. DLC has been a consistent part of the Borderlands franchise, and it looks like Borderlands 4 may be featuring my favorite kind of new content.</p>

According to @Cobie on Twitter, while many cryptocurrency market participants claim their primary interest is technology, trading data and investment flows show most capital is directed toward speculative assets rather than foundational blockchain tech projects (source: @Cobie, Twitter). This trend highlights a disconnect that traders should consider when evaluating project fundamentals versus token performance, as market momentum often favors highly volatile, speculative coins over genuine technological innovation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shiba Inu has finally cleared its April range, supported by a MACD crossover and rising money flow, but it still needs to hold above $0.000015 to keep the SHIB bullish signal alive. Dogecoin's price prediction is also leaning bullish, with DOGE pushing against a descending resistance line near $0.175. While SHIB and DOGE battle resistance, BlockDAG (BDAG) is distributing value in real time. Its daily Buyer Battle just awarded 25.29 million BDAG to a single wallet after unmet sales triggered a coin transfer. With $225M raised, 19.6 billion coins sold, and a special entry price of $0.0019 live until May 13, BlockDAG's breakout looks inevitable. Those who accumulate as much as possible now stand to benefit the most, and if their buy is large enough, they might even win the next Buyer Battle! This change in behavior often lines up with price expansion. For now, the Shiba Inu bullish signal hinges on holding above $0.000015. If that happens, the next target sits near $0.000019. Dogecoin is currently holding near $0.175, sitting just below a key descending resistance trendline that has capped its progress since February. A daily close above $0.19 may shift the structure toward a broader move targeting $0.21 and $0.24, provided volume supports the breakout. At the same time, support between $0.167 and $0.15 remains under pressure. Every 24 hours, BlockDAG sets a coin sale target. Not long ago, the network set a target of fifty million BDAG. Every day is a new chance for someone to walk away with much more than they paid for, simply because they acted when others didn't. Right now, BlockDAG is in Batch 28, priced at $0.0262 per coin. But until May 13, buyers can access a limited rate of $0.0019 per coin. So far, the presale has raised over $225 million and moved more than 19.6 billion BDAG, clear signs that conviction is already turning into capital. Early participants from Batch 1 have already seen up to 2,520% ROI. And with price forecasts reaching $1 in 2025, what today looks like a small advantage could soon become a defining one. For now, BlockDAG's Buyer Battles run daily, which means every day brings a chance to stash massive profits. Most breakout signals tell you where momentum might show up: the Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish signal points toward $0.000019, while the Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction suggests its structure could unlock higher targets if it clears $0.18. Its Buyer Battle continues rewarding decisive action every day. One wallet already claimed 25.29 million BDAG in a single day simply by leading when others paused. Compare that to the $1 forecast for 2025, and it's clear why BDAG is one of the top crypto coins today! Please conduct your own research before taking any action based on the content.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday, six stores across America opened their doors with a curious proposition: Come on in, let a metal orb scan your irises, and walk out with a new online profile that promises you're an individual human – and a few bucks in crypto for your troubles. It specializes in attempting to distinguish real humans from bots and AI-generated imitators. The idea being, if you're running a site or app – internet gaming or dating, say – and you really want to make sure each of your users are genuine individuals and not automated fakes, World provides that level of user identity and authenticity management. World's key components include the Orb (a glossy sphere that photos your iris and face), World ID (a blockchain-based so-called proof-of-personhood system), the World App (where users manage their ID and get access to services), and Worldcoin (aka WLD, A cryptocurrency distributed to users as a reward). Unsurprisingly, regulators around the world have raised concerns about this whole idea of an upstart collecting and storing people's biometric data. South Korea fined the startup over $800,000 for privacy violations. Hong Kong ordered it to cease operations entirely, and Germany, Kenya, and Spain have initiated various legal actions against the firm.​ But never mind all that - on to America! The upstart has now set up shopfronts in Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco, with its eyeball-scanning Orb devices. Since SF is also the home of Vulture West, we decided to pop in and have a look. The store, nestled between Macy's and Louis Vuitton in the city's Union Square, is a tad ramshackle and barely painted. We'll assume you need to create (or anticipate creating) a verified-human profile on World that's required by an app or service you want to use. First, you must download the World App, sign in, and after entering the store, wait as it links with a nearby Orb. That data is used to build a blockchain-based World ID unique to you based on your physically biometric info. Specifically, that biometric scan is encrypted and sent directly to your phone to be converted into that unique identity token, after which the info is deleted on the Orb itself, the project says. As an incentive, the World app is credited with Worldcoins worth a little over $16 in real-world money. That token is then used later on when logging into things to prove you are a unique, genuinely real human. The biz has set up a factory in Texas to pump out Orbs for America and the rest of the world, and is working on a miniaturized version to increase verification. “I'm a very proud American, I think America should lead innovation, not fight it off,” Altman said at the shindig, which you can watch below. That said, it's not a panacea; we can think of some drawbacks. World announced two partnerships during its US launch. A Visa-backed debit card will be issued later this year, and Match.com in Japan will be using World ID to reassure nervous daters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tokenization is gaining real traction as BlackRock, Libre, and MultiBank make billion-dollar moves, signaling the shift from theory to execution. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is evolving from an abstract concept to a practical financial tool as institutional players increasingly test and deploy blockchain-based infrastructure at scale. This past week alone saw a flurry of announcements from both traditional financial institutions and blockchain-native firms advancing their RWA initiatives. On April 30, BlackRock filed to create a digital ledger technology shares class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust fund. It will leverage blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for investors. The fund will be available to accredited investors and usable as collateral for onchain borrowing. The week's biggest headline came from Dubai, where MultiBank Group signed a $3 billion RWA tokenization deal with United Arab Emirates-based real estate firm MAG and blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk. It's happening because everything's lining up,” Eric Piscini, CEO of Hashgraph, told Cointelegraph: Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of RedStone, said the recent announcements “demonstrate that tokenization has moved beyond theoretical discussions into practical application by market leaders.” He added that the growing adoption by big institutions gives the space more credibility, making others feel more confident to join in and help boost new ideas and investments. Kazmierczak stated that the renewed interest in RWA tokenization is primarily driven by US President Donald Trump's pro-crypto administration and growing regulatory clarity. That era saw an aggressive crackdown from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), prompting many firms to withdraw from US operations. Since Trump's election victory, the SEC has dropped or paused over a dozen enforcement cases against crypto companies. Related: New era in mining: How tokenization can transform the salt industry “Ethereum remains by far the most suitable blockchain for large-scale RWA issuance due to its unparalleled security, developer ecosystem, and institutional adoption,” Kazmierczak said. However, he noted that dedicated RWA-specialized ecosystems like Canton Network, Plume, and Ondo Chain are building compelling alternatives with features designed explicitly for compliant asset tokenization. According to data from RWA.xyz, the market value of tokenized US Treasurys currently stands at $6.5 billion. Herwig Koningson, CEO of Security Token Market, said companies like BlackRock have shown that it's possible to build large-scale tokenized products, worth billions of dollars, using more than one blockchain at the same time. “This is why you will see many banks and traditional firms use permissioned blockchains or even private DLT systems,” Koningson said. Regulation continues to be a significant barrier, especially for risk-averse institutions requiring guarantees around compliance and privacy. Technical limitations also persist, chiefly the lack of interoperability between blockchain platforms, according to Piscini. D'Onofrio also made a modest projection, estimating that between 5% and 10% of global financial assets could be tokenized by 2030.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I write about how bitcoin, crypto and blockchain can change the world. Bitcoin and crypto prices are awaiting the next catalyst after surging into May (though Apple might have just quietly created it). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged almost 30% since falling to April lows and is nearing $100,000 per bitcoin as the market braces for a $10 trillion Wall Street earthquake. Now, as "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock, U.S. president Donald Trump's crypto czar David Sacks has predicted a coming “Trump boom.” "We've ended the war on crypto, and I think we're trying to stop the regulatory capture that benefits large incumbents," Sacks, who worked with Tesla billionaire Elon Musk in the early days of PayPal and advised him on his takeover of Twitter and its rebranding to X, said during an episode of the All In Podcast. “I do think that this sets us up for a Trump boom in the future," Sacks said, pointing to “other things that that have been done on the economy as well," and predicted “a lot of these changes take time to to play out.” “This renewed risk-on mood is setting the stage for bitcoin to make a run at $100,000,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “The $95,000 level had been a key resistance zone in recent weeks, and once bitcoin cleared it with strong volume, momentum accelerated quickly. “I definitely would not be surprised [to see bitcoin reach] $200,000, or $250,000 this year," Joe Burnett, director of market research Unchained, said during an X broadcast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple's App Store Policy Adjustment Enables Crypto Transactions via External Links Effective from 2nd May, 2025, these alterations come in response to a federal court ruling that found Apple in breach of a 2021 injunction from Epic Games' antitrust lawsuit. With the new regulations, U.S. developers can now seamlessly incorporate buttons or hyperlinks to external websites for digital acquisitions without requiring Apple's endorsement or charging fees. This marks a departure from Apple's previous practice of imposing substantial fees on such transactions and displaying cautionary prompts regarding external payment risks. The crypto industry perceives this change as a watershed moment. Applications dealing with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi), and wallet services can now sidestep Apple's fees, retaining a higher percentage of revenue per transaction, ranging from 15% to 30%. Developers also have the liberty to leverage third-party payment processors like Stripe, thereby enhancing the adaptability of crypto-native transactions. One individual posted on 3rd May, 2025, stating, “Mobile crypto just got unleashed,” emphasising the advantages for NFTs and DeFi adoption. Critics highlighted that this update exclusively impacts the U.S. App Store, thereby constraining global crypto initiatives, and pointed out that Apple still prohibits apps facilitating initial coin offerings (ICOs) or cryptocurrency mining. This policy adjustment aligns with the prevailing global antitrust climate, exemplified by the EU's Digital Markets Act, which exerts pressure on tech behemoths to foster open ecosystems. Apple has expressed disagreement with the court ruling and intends to challenge it, suggesting the possibility of future policy revisions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a crypto world where many projects promise the world but few deliver, Solaxy is quickly emerging as one of the rare projects poised to make a real impact. For investors who believe in Solana's potential, Solaxy stands out as a project that could lead the next wave in the ongoing bull run. With its $33 million presale milestone, Solaxy has officially become the largest ICO of its kind — entering uncharted territory in the crypto market. Unlike other projects, Solaxy is building the world's first Layer 2 solution for Solana, bringing scalability improvements similar to Ethereum's successful Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. The team has already launched a testnet block explorer that provides real-time visibility into Layer 2 activity and is preparing to roll out additional features like its cross-chain bridge, integrated development environment (IDE), and official project wiki. Currently priced at just $0.0017 per token, Solaxy's presale is generating massive interest. Supporters believe the project could deliver substantial returns after launch, with some speculating on potential 50x to 100x gains. With Solana reclaiming the $140 mark, sentiment around scaling solutions like Solaxy continues to heat up. Looking ahead, Solaxy's roadmap highlights plans to operate as a multi-chain asset, compatible with both Solana and Ethereum ecosystems. As new features roll out and token listings draw nearer, the project is poised to attract attention from both Solana loyalists and the broader crypto investment community. Adding to its appeal, the project offers staking rewards reportedly reaching up to 123%, providing both a technological and financial incentive for early adopters. For those seeking storage options, Best Wallet has been spotlighted by crypto platforms as a preferred non-custodial wallet supporting over 60 blockchains, including Solaxy. Beyond secure storage, Best Wallet offers portfolio management tools and reward opportunities without the need for KYC — features that are likely to resonate with the growing Solaxy community. With record-breaking presale figures and strong early technical progress, Solaxy is quickly establishing itself as a leading project in the ecosystem. Having raised over $33 million and becoming the largest ICO to date, it stands out as the first true Layer 2 solution designed to enhance transaction speed, reduce costs, and improve reliability. As the network looks toward its next wave of scalability solutions, Solaxy's continued development could position it as a dominant force in the space. Supported by growing platforms like Best Wallet, the project is positioning itself as the frontrunner in scalability — making now a great time for investors to get involved before its full launch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency mining facilities can blanket towns with ‘constant' noise. First came the dogs' balding – leathery pink patches on otherwise glossy fur coats. But it wasn't long before one of the hairless puppies began stealing blankets to burrow beneath furniture and hide for long stretches. Copenhaver didn't know it then, but bitcoin miners had come to town. It echoes across agricultural land and forests, chasing away deer. It seeps into walls, vibrating bedrooms and dinner tables. Copenhaver's neighbor Cheryl Shadden imagines it is what standing on the edge of Niagara Falls might sound like. Copenhaver says it's like a jet engine is forever stationed nearby. A video of the site from Shadden's home, recorded on 23 April, shows green pastures against a backdrop of billowing smoke and the roar. Large-scale cryptocurrency mining operations began popping up across the United States a decade ago. Expansion plans published by mining companies show an expanding array of more data centers and more machines across the country. Miners have tapped investors for $3.7bn in bonds since November to fund future growth. Miners nationwide have likewise unveiled plans to add at least another 2.42 GW in capacity, according to announcements compiled since November. Eric Trump even launched his own mining firm last month, America Bitcoin, a subsidiary of the publicly traded miner Hut 8 Corp. Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity,” the president said about his son's endeavor. Polaris Technology Inc is one of many firms expanding. The company is moving to double its footprint in Muskogee, Oklahoma, raising its capacity to use the same amount of energy as approximately 400,000 homes, despite noise complaints from locals. Likewise, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, CleanSpark opened a new site earlier this year. “They promised to be good neighbors, but so far their noise is constant,” says Dave Simpson, who lives a quarter of a mile from the Wyoming site. Simpson worries about how a constant drone will affect his property's valuation. In Granbury, Copenhaver says that the noise has gotten worse since November. Her decibel reader – a must-have for many residents – has been notching higher, she says, now reaching between 80 to 100 decibels on any given day. Row after row of industrial-grade fans are typically used to prevent mining computers, known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, from overheating, which can create an enormous din. Crypto mining often also consists of rows of smaller mobile containers in the open air, in contrast to the US's other major construction boom of tech infrastructure: artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are housed in closed structures. Mary Willis, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University, has spotted a pattern when it comes to the location of mines. Underwritten by bigger budgets, AI data centers are built on large plots of remote land. Miners, on the other hand, flock to the cheapest power and easy grid access, which often means old factory towns. Mara's Granbury mine is co-located with two gas power stations, both owned by Constellation Energy, which has fought locals over the past year to build a third plant. Cryptocurrency miners in Texas pay less for electricity than residents on average, according to an Earthjustice report. In 2023, residential ratepayers paid 22.25 cents per kilowatt-hour for their electricity, while specific crypto mining operations paid just 2.5 per kWh, the group estimates. Trump has also given miners impetus to grow through his commitment to solidifying bitcoin's place in traditional finance, and thus its long-term appreciation. Crypto mining computers race against one another to solve cryptographic puzzles. The correct answer verifies a new batch, or “block”, of bitcoin transactions. So, when bitcoin rallies, miners often look to dial up power. But because price surges bring more miners online, the hash rate also grows. This increases mining difficulty, a measurement for how time – consuming it is to solve the cryptographic puzzles needed to validate a block. Miners thus must increase their facilities' computing power each time hashrate goes up in order to stay profitable, or they must raise the efficiency of their existing equipment. For instance, for every $1,000 increase in bitcoin price, US mining energy consumption increases by approximately 0.058 terawatt-hours per month, according to a recent study by the Berkeley Lab. Bitcoin may have lost some of its initial gains following the election, when it rose 50% in just three months, but much of the crypto world anticipates that its long-term rally will resume once new policies take shape. Major financial institutions are increasingly trusting of bitcoin, and Trump plans to create a reserve of cryptocurrency owned by the US government. Trump issued an executive order on 23 January, “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology”, which promotes the right to mine, and he has hosted crypto mining executives at both Mar-a-Lago and the first White House Crypto Summit. Meanwhile, his promise to unleash domestic oil and gas is welcome news for an industry whose profitability is dictated by access to cheap energy. A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Echoing the federal mood, Republican senator Ted Cruz introduced the Facilitate Lower Atmospheric Released Emissions (Flare) Act on 31 March, which proposes using Texas's “stranded” natural gas, a designation indicating the gas would cost more to recover than it would sell for, to help power bitcoin mining. Trump's promises offer a stark contrast to Biden's proposed 30% tax on miners' electricity and a first-of-its-kind survey of their energy usage. The EIA has no plans to resume this survey. Anti-mining protests play out in town halls across red states, where activists challenge local officials on why they have showered the industry with tax breaks and subsidized power. Despite this, Hood county, where Granbury is located, voted 82% for Trump in 2024, including many of the activists fighting against Mara. Copenhaver admits crypto did not factor into her vote. One member told Sawicky they voted for Trump because of abortion. “The unborn babies can't go deaf, but you and yours can,” she replied. “And there are children in your community who are already losing their hearing because of this.” Disillusioned, she has taken a step back from the movement since the election and plans to leave the state. “If there are policies that support increased mining, there's going to be more pollution and more community impacts,” says Mandy DeRoche, the deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice. DeRoche represents plaintiffs suing miners in three cases across the US, including five Granbury residents who filed a lawsuit against Mara in October, alleging noise-related damage to their health, wildlife and air. The sound has unleashed a number of health issues, plaintiffs say, including tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss and heart arrhythmia, on top of insomnia and anxiety. Chronic exposure to low-frequency noise is known to affect health, but doesn't receive the attention that water contamination or air pollution attracts, says Willis. “Disrupted sleep causes a cascade of other issues in someone's life. Lack of sleep is linked to depression, higher stress levels and chronic diseases like hypertension,” she says. Cyndie Roberson witnessed rampant sleeplessness change her community in Cherokee county, Georgia, when the noise from a mine began to echo through around 800 nearby homes. She sold her “dream retirement cabin” in 2022 and left the county. In Granbury, Shadden says the sleepless nights have left her anxious and irritable. After consulting an audiologist last year she was diagnosed with permanent conduction hearing loss. “There is no established link, medical or otherwise, between Mara's operations and the ailments that are being alleged,” the company said in a statement. The industry contends that noise can be mitigated with immersion-cooled machines, where ASICs are stored in dielectric oil, and by building sound walls. “I wish it were true,” says DeRoche, on the question of immersion cooling. Immersion cooling often requires external dry coolers, which can be equally as noisy when deployed at scale. In response to the complaints from Granbury residents, Mara says that by November 2024, a sound wall had been constructed, two-thirds of machines had been replaced with immersion cooling, and an independent sound survey found levels to be below the legal limit of 85 decibels. The city's residents won an unexpected victory on 31 March. Constellation Energy withdrew its permit application for a third gas plant, citing community concerns and lower-than-expected returns. Three years on, she's still waiting for all of her dogs' fur to return.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While big names enjoy the spotlight, deeper shifts are happening under the radar—real tech upgrades, real-world use, and massive presale momentum. One of them is already catching serious heat. Qubetics ($TICS) is leading a silent revolution, fixing what the old giants ignored. It's creating the path for cross-chain freedom, real-world asset integration, and a Web3 experience that doesn't require jumping between apps, wallets, or blockchains. Let's find out the best crypto to join now. Qubetics is the world's first full-stack Web3 aggregator. It's on a mission to unify fragmented blockchain ecosystems—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, you name it—into one seamless framework. Through deep-layer interoperability, it allows cross-chain transactions, smart contract execution, and asset movement without switching apps or paying third-party gas fees. Imagine a business accepting payments from five different blockchains—Qubetics allows it to manage those transactions from a single dashboard. A DeFi app developer builds once, deploys on multiple chains instantly. A logistics firm tracks cross-border shipments using Qubetics' API that reads and writes data on multiple chains in real-time. It's smoother, cheaper, and way more efficient. This is hands-down the best crypto to join now for those chasing real-world utility and insane upside. Because Qubetics is solving problems others ignored. Its utility, interoperability, and ROI potential set it apart. Filecoin is shaking up decentralized storage by letting people rent out unused disk space. It's also becoming faster and more programmable. Its recent network updates now support smart contracts and reduce transaction times, making it ideal for builders launching apps that need permanent, decentralized file hosting. And Filecoin's decentralized cloud competes with giants like AWS but without centralized control or censorship risk. Because the need for decentralized, permanent storage is exploding. Filecoin is the only one doing it at scale. It's easily among the best crypto to join now for long-term infrastructure gains. In 2025, storage is the backbone of everything—content platforms, metaverse files, machine learning data. Litecoin might be old, but it's not outdated. It's got lightning-fast block times, low fees, and strong adoption across payment platforms. While newer chains experiment with flashy tech, Litecoin just works—and that matters. After its last halving, Litecoin's supply growth rate dropped, increasing scarcity. Its blockchain is still actively used for peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce, and ATM withdrawals globally. It's the “digital silver” for a reason—solid, proven, and efficient. For anyone watching the best crypto to join now, this is a legacy coin still pulling weight. With institutions slowly adopting Litecoin again, and with upcoming integrations on major wallets and Layer 2 platforms, the stage is set for another run. VeChain is quietly becoming the default blockchain for logistics, inventory, and compliance. It helps businesses track goods, validate authenticity, and reduce fraud through blockchain-powered transparency. From pharmaceutical traceability to luxury goods verification, VeChain provides tools that eliminate middlemen and boost trust. Its native VET token fuels these operations, ensuring smooth on-chain transactions. It's also exploring carbon credit systems and government-backed digital IDs, all built on its high-performance Thor blockchain. Because it has real-world partnerships and proven solutions. VeChain is practical, efficient, and highly scalable—perfect for the best crypto to join now list. But when it comes to real-world value, smart tech, and ROI potential, only a handful stand out. Qubetics leads the charge with its interoperability tools and best crypto presale numbers that hint at game-changing upside.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that the blockchain's long-term resilience and scalability hinge on making it simple, like Bitcoin. In a blog post on May 3, he described how “Ethereum 5 years from now can become close to as simple as Bitcoin.” Buterin wrote: According to Buterin, Bitcoin's minimalist design and simplicity makes it accessible, so that even a high-school student can grasp the concept and architecture of the protocol. Recent upgrades like proof-of-stake (PoS) and Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) integration have made Ethereum more robust. However, neglecting simplicity of design has added to Ethereum's costs. In November, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake proposed a consensus layer upgrade called the ‘Beam Chain.' Buterin believes that the Beam Chain is “well-positioned to be much simpler” than its outdated predecessor, the current beacon chain. This is because the beam chain will allow for 3-slot finality redesign, which will eliminate complex concepts like separate slots, epochs, and sync committees, Buterin noted. He also highlighted that a basic implementation of 3-slot finality can be achieved through about 200 lines of code, making it much simpler. The beam chain will also incorporate STARK-based aggregation protocols, which means anyone can be an aggregator. Buterin added that the reduction of active validators and incorporation of STARK-based aggregators will “likely enable a simpler and more robust” P2P architecture. Buterin highlighted that the consensus layer is “relatively disconnected” from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) executions, which provides a “relatively wide latitude” to make improvements compared to the execution layer. However, this would mean ensuring that backwards compatibility for existing applications are preserved. According to Buterin, the orange area cannot be decreased. The goal, Buterin claimed, is to minimize the green area, by moving code to the yellow area, that indicates “code that is very valuable for understanding and interpreting the chain today, or for optimal block building, but is not part of consensus.” Buterin likened this process to how Apple achieves long-term backwards compatibility through translation layers. “Importantly, the orange and yellow areas are encapsulated complexity, anyone looking to understand the protocol can skip them, implementations of Ethereum are free to skip them, and any bugs in those areas do not pose consensus risks.” This is why code complexity in the orange and yellow areas have “far fewer downsides” compared to code complexity in the green area. Phase 2: Developers will have the option to write contracts in RISC-V. Phase 3: All precompiles will be replaced with RISC-V implementations through a hard fork. Phase 4: Implement an EVM interpreter in RISC-V and push it onchain as a smart contract. Buterin proposed sharing “one standard across different parts of the stack” as a path towards simplification. This would minimize the total lines of code, increase efficiency and ensure verifiability, he argued. Similarly, he proposed having a single shared serialization format across the three Ethereum layers: execution layer, consensus layer, and smart contract calling Application Binary Interface (ABI). Buterin suggested using SSZ, which is easy to decode and widely used. Lastly, once the EVM has been replaced with RISC-V or another simple language, Buterin proposes switching to a binary tree from the hexary Merkle Patricia tree, both for the consensus and execution layers. This transition could improve efficiency and reduce costs while ensuring that all Ethereum layers can be accessed and interpreted using the same code, Buterin wrote. But more importantly, Ethereum needs to adopt an ethos where the simpler option is chosen wherever possible. In 2020, Monika immersed herself in crypto, maintaining skepticism yet firmly believing blockchain could address key issues like financial disparity and transparency.
