            It's Saturday night at a rooftop bar in downtown Atlanta, and the band Orden Activa is about to launch into a Mexican ballad.
    


            What seemed like a shy and reserved audience suddenly transforms as the opening chords of the trotting polka begin. The crowd rises to its feet and sings in Spanish as the dance floor dissolves into a sea of cowboy hats:
    


“I'm the ruler of the roostersOf the Jalisco cartel.I've got fighting cocksWho duel for my crew.”



            With their gently bobbing heads, matching leather jackets and knowing smiles, their act hardly screams controversy – or at least not to the casual observer.
    


            Yet last month, a group that sang the very same song – “El del Palenque” (“He of the Cockfighting Arena”) – was barred from the United States in an unprecedented move that critics say raises troubling questions about free speech in America.
    


            Their transgression, according to the State Department? “Glorifying (a) drug kingpin.”
    


            The song is a narcocorrido: a ballad about the drug trafficking underworld. The band that wrote it – Los Alegres del Barranco – landed in hot water with both US and Mexican authorities recently when they performed the tune in the Mexican city of Zapopan.
    


            That performance, in which the group sang about the exploits of El Mencho, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, in front of a cartoon portrait of him, not only ended the band's plans for a US tour but left them the subject of a criminal investigation on their home turf.
    


            As one of six Mexican drug cartels the Trump administration has declared Foreign Terrorist Organizations, the Jalisco cartel is at the center of growing US-Mexico tensions over cross-border crime. Authorities in both countries took exception when video of the concert went viral.
    


            The venue where Los Alegres del Barranco performed swiftly apologized; the Jalisco prosecutor's office vowed to investigate; and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum warned the band may have broken the law. Then the US State Department revoked their visas.
    


            “The last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists,” said US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau in a post on X. “In the Trump administration, we take seriously our responsibility over foreigners' access to our country.” The band apologized on Facebook the next day.
    


            While songs about the drug trade have been censored on and off in Mexico for years, observers say increasing pressure from the Trump administration to clamp down on cartels has fueled a new wave of bans on public performance of narcocorridos in several Mexican states. Even more worryingly, they say, are signs that Mexican bands are beginning to self-censor in the fear that upsetting US authorities could compromise their ability to tour.

            The action against Los Alegres del Barranco is the first time the State Department has punished a Mexican band in this way, according to Elijah Wald, author of an English-language guide to the genre. Some critics paint it as the latest anti-Mexico move by the Trump administration, which has already strained ties with its immigration crackdowns and tariff policies.
    


            “(These bands) have been saved up to now by the fact that nobody spoke Spanish,” Wald said. “And when I say ‘nobody,' I mean the people who are enforcing this kind of silliness. The revoking of visas obviously has very little to do with the songs. It has to do with a politics of revoking visas.”
    


            Asked about Los Alegres del Barranco, the State Department told CNN they could not discuss individual cases.
    


            The State Department's rebuke may have ruined Los Alegres del Barranco's planned US tour, but it has done little to dent the popularity of either the band or the genre. If anything, it gave both a boost.
    


            Figures from Billboard show the band subsequently gained over 2 million new listens on streaming services, proof if any were needed of the enduring modern appeal of a genre rooted in 19th century folk music that has long romanticized outlaws, outcasts and underdogs.
    


            Early corridos or ballads celebrated the exploits of “famous bandits, generals, sometimes horses, sometimes fighting roosters as well,” according to Sam Quinones, a writer who covers music and the drug trade in Mexico and California.
    


            “It was almost like a musical newspaper,” Quinones said. “This became a very common kind of entrenched genre of popular music.”
    


            During Prohibition in the 1920s, a new subgenre – the narcocorrido – emerged to tell the tales of those smuggling illicit alcohol from Mexico to the United States, explained author Wald.
    


            A century later and that subgenre is still booming. The most popular musical artist among US YouTube users in 2023 was not Taylor Swift, but the narcocorrido singer Peso Pluma.
    


            But experts say a cultural shift took place when drug traffickers began paying musicians to write songs about themselves in the mid-1980s, when the legendary “King of Corridos” Chalino Sanchez began accepting commissions.
    


            “He wasn't necessarily the first, but he was the key figure in that shift, which significantly changed the economics of the business,” Wald said. “It meant anybody with money could commission a laudatory corrido.”
    


            Since then, many singers and groups “have been sponsored by or have performed for specific figures in the narco-world, and are thought of as being aligned with particular cartels,” Wald said, leading to a situation that's “definitely dangerous for the artists.”
    


            Case in point: Chalino Sanchez was shot dead after a concert in Sinaloa in 1992. His murder remains unsolved.
    


            Some fans, like Quinones – who is writing a biography of Sanchez – are critical of this shift.

            “The corrido used to be about a simple man going up against power, knowing he was doomed, knowing he was going to die and fighting anyway,” Quinones said. “It became corrupted, in my opinion, when it became in praise of power, in praise of these bloodthirsty men with enormous power who killed wantonly.”
    


            Others, though, dismiss the notion that narcocorridos encourage the violence and crime they portray, likening them to gangster-rap, video games or films like The Godfather.
    


            “People say, ‘Oh, parents, don't let your kid play Call of Duty, or your kid's gonna grow up to be a shooter!'” said Ray Mancias, a 19-year-old guitarist who performed after Orden Activa at the show in Atlanta.
    


            “I think that's the way they're seeing (narcocorridos) as well. They think if all these kids keep listening to it, that they're going to get influenced by it and they're going to start doing it. But at the end of the day, the way you grow up is your parents. No music is going to change that.”
    


            Noel Flores – one of Orden Activa's two singers – suggests authorities that try to ban narcocorridos risk shooting themselves in the foot.
    


            “That's just gonna make people want it more,” Flores said.
    


            While some Mexican states have tried to ban the songs, and the US State Department their singers, Mexico's President Sheinbaum has taken a softer approach – ruling out a nationwide ban and proposing instead that the government promote music about peace and love as an alternative – a position that has led to some ridicule.
    


            “She's trying the rather comical alternative of trying to sponsor nice music that people will listen to instead, which is charming,” Wald said. “But no, that's not going to work.”
    


            Of course, if authorities can't find a way through the debate, it's not only the bands that will lose, but fans in both Mexico and the US.
    


            “With everything going on with (Trump), as a Mexican, cancelling corridos makes us feel more ‘less,'” said Emmanuel Gonzalez, who attended the concert in Atlanta.
    


            Other fans have been rowdier about the idea of cancelling corridos.
    


            When the singer Luis R. Conriquez refused to play drug-themed music at an April concert in Texcoco, Mexico, citing a local ban, he told the booing audience, “There are no corridos tonight. Should we just go home?”
    


            They answered by trashing the stage. (Conriquez later defended his decision, saying he “must follow the new rules the government has set regarding corridos.”)

            Oswaldo Zavala, a professor of literature and expert on narcoculture, says many musicians are  self-censoring not out of deference to Mexican authorities, but “in response to Donald Trump's presidency… the fear that (Trump) may revoke their visas that allow them to perform and produce their music in the US.”
    


            A few days after their Atlanta concert, Orden Activa posted a video of their performance  alongside the caption: “Let's see if they don't take away our visa. Don't believe it's a joke.”
    


            Still, amid the fears there are those that take comfort in the irony that driving underground a form of music that has always celebrated outlaws will likely make it only more popular.
    


            As another member of the audience in Atlanta, Violet Uresti, puts it: “I like the vibe. I like the way it brings people together. If they ban it, we're still gonna listen to it.”

Follow:


            US President Donald Trump posted an AI image of himself as the pope, prompting accusations of poor taste in the Roman Catholic community just days before the conclave to elect Pope Francis's successor is due to begin.
    


            Trump, who days prior joked that he would “like to be pope”, posted the digitally doctored image of himself wearing a white cassock and papal headdress, with his forefinger raised, to his Truth Social platform late Friday. It was then reshared by the White House on its official X account.
    


            It came less than a week after Trump, who is himself not a Catholic, attended Francis's funeral last month. An official period of mourning for the pope is still being observed by the Vatican.
    


            While no one suggests that the image is a serious distraction from the task of choosing the next leader of the world's 1.4 billion Roman Catholics – Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to comment on the matter – it has raised eyebrows on social media and drawn criticism, including from cardinals who are in Rome for conclave next week.
    


            “Not funny, Sir,” the 66-year-old Filipino Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David wrote in a post on Facebook.
    


            Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, was also critical when questioned by journalists ahead of delivering a Mass in Rome on Sunday.
    


            Asked whether he was offended by the image, Cardinal Dolan – who Trump hinted he favors for the next pope - replied, “Well, it wasn't good.”
    


            Similarly, Father Gerald Murray, a priest of the Archdiocese of New York who was attending the Mass at Cardinal Dolan's church Sunday, said that Trump's post was “silly … you don't do that.”
    


            Italy's former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, condemned the image as offensive to those of Catholic faith. “This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,” he wrote on X.
    


            Trump's post caught the attention of Italy's media. “Infantile” was the word used by Italian daily La Repubblica, accusing the president of “pathological megalomania.”

            In St. Peter's Square, CNN asked several groups of American tourists what they thought, and while none wanted to give their names, their reactions ranged from “absurd” to “typical.”
    


            The office of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, an international ally of Trump, said they would not comment on the matter.
    


            The image also prompted backlash among Catholic groups in the US. The New York State Catholic Conference, which describes itself as representing bishops in New York, said in a post on X; “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President.
    


            “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.”
    


            But the White House defended Trump as pro-Catholic.
    


            “President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects for Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said when asked to respond to the criticism.
    


            Others in Trump's circle stressed it was a joke.
    


            “I'm Catholic. We've all been making jokes about the upcoming Pope selection all week. It's called a sense of humor,” far-right activist Jack Posobiec  wrote on X.
    


            This is not the first time Trump has triggered controversy with AI-generated imagery. He faced backlash after posting footage imagining war-ravaged Gaza as a Gulf state-like resort featuring a golden statue of himself.

Romania is holding a rerun of its presidential election on Sunday after the previous vote was annulled on grounds of alleged Russian interference and electoral violations. Moscow has denied all claims of interference. 

The annulled election in late November saw independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu, known for his NATO-sceptic stance, unexpectedly prevail in the first round with 23% of the vote. However, the Constitutional Court later invalidated the results, citing electoral “irregularities.” The country's officials claimed that the candidate's campaign had utilized undeclared funds, and that Russia was behind “hybrid” attacks, including in the cyber realm. 

In March, Georgescu was barred by the Central Electoral Bureau from running again, citing his alleged “anti-democratic” and “extremist” stance as well as a failure to comply with electoral procedures.

In the current election, a total of 11 candidates are competing for the presidential post. The key contenders include George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), who is known for his opposition to the EU, and criticism of military support to Ukraine. He is leading the polls with approximately 30% support.

Other prominent candidates include Crin Antonescu, representing the governing Social-Democrat and National Liberal coalition, and Nicusor Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, both of whom support pro-EU agendas.

If no candidate wins an absolute majority, a run-off between the two leading candidates will be held on May 18.

Ahead of the rerun, meanwhile, Romanian detained RT journalist Chay Bowes, who had traveled to Bucharest from Dublin, Ireland, to cover the election. According to the reporter, he was presented with a paper – of which he was not given a copy – alleging that he was “a threat to the security of the state” and therefore should be deported. Bowes, a EU citizen, has insisted that he entered Romania “completely legally… to do [his] job.”

Commenting on the detention, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the Romanian election had turned into a “meme.” She added that “the situation around the election in Romania is so scandalous. It's so dead-ended and it discredits the level of that pseudo democracy in Romania.”

NEW YORK, May 4. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has promised not to run for president for a third time.

""This is not something I'm looking to do. I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward,"" Trump told NBC News in an interview.

""I'll be an eight-year president, I'll be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important.""

The US constitution's 22nd Amendment says ""no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice."" Amending the constitution to abolish that limit would be extremely difficult, requiring the support of either two-thirds of both the House and Senate or two-thirds of state legislatures. Both routes would then require ratification from three-quarters of the states.

The next US presidential election will be held in 2028. Trump previously said he could be nominated for a third term, while media reported that he had instructed the Justice Ministry to study the legality of his potential participation in the 2028 presidential polls.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

NEW DELHI, May 4. /TASS/. Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh may not attend the Victory Parade in Moscow this year as planned, the PTI news agency reported, citing sources in the government.

It is possible that his deputy, State Minister of Defense Sanjay Seth, will attend in his place.

According to the sources, this decision was made due to escalated tensions between India and Pakistan following the deadly terror attack in the popular tourist town of Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir where 26 individuals were killed.

On April 22, armed militants opened fire on tourists in the town of Pahalgam in northern India (Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir), killing 25 Indian nationals and one tourist from Nepal, and wounding many more. The perpetrators managed to flee the scene.

Earlier, an invitation to attend the Victory Parade in Red Square in Moscow was sent to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists that Modi will be unable to attend and the country will be represented at the event by other officials.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Traffic is down at America's busiest port complex – and anxious dock workers are fearful of further economic harm

Southern California may be known for celebrities and glitz, but the true action has long been about 40 miles away from Hollywood, in a place where high-visibility coveralls and hardhats dominate.

For the past 25 years, the San Pedro Bay port complex – comprised of the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach – has been the celebrity of the shipping world and an economic driver of California's massive economy. The busiest seaport in the western hemisphere and one of the busiest in the world, approximately 15,000 longshore workers usually pull shifts around the clock, moving billions of dollars' worth of cargo in cars, agriculture, auto parts, toys, clothes and furniture.

This week, however, the port is shining a little less brightly. As a result of the Trump administration's decision to subject imports to a minimum 10% tariff (and levies far higher for goods from 57 countries), roughly a third of the traffic at the port has ground to a halt, according to Eugene Seroka, the chief executive officer of the Port of Los Angeles.

With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA's waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13.

“One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA's Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected.

What happens in the port doesn't stay in the port, echoed long-time labor activist and former Los Angeles harbor commissioner Diane Middleton. “One way or the other, cargo that comes in here goes to all 435 US congressional districts. Everyone in the US will feel this.”

The port, which handles 40% of all containerized imports into the country, is widely seen as a bellwether for the entire US economy. For months leading up to the election and inauguration, the docks were abuzz. Large retailers especially were front-loading – stocking up on merchandise in fear of what might be to come. Now that the tariffs are here, experts say the front-loaded stock will only last six to eight weeks.

Trump, who meted out the harshest tariffs to China, Vietnam and Cambodia, has referred to his 2 April announcement as “liberation day”. To those immediately affected, however, chaos and anxiety are better ways to describe it.

Trump has made dizzying statements, sometimes even suggesting certain tariffs may not last, Middleton noted. “He's saying, ‘I'm negotiating 200 deals. There'll be a deal with China in no time,'” said Middleton. “And the Chinese are saying, ‘We're not talking to anybody.' So there are contradictions, and who do you believe?”

Vivian Malauulu, a night-shift longshore worker, believes what she sees. “When ships are docked on our berths, we're busy – there's manning, dispatch activity, job orders, and 24-hour operations across day, night, and what we call “hoot” shifts.” Now there are “fewer imports, and fewer vessels calling at our terminals”, said Malauulu, who is also a local 13 officer.

Workers who previously clocked full work-weeks have already been slashed to three or four shifts. She and co-workers, all accustomed to good-paying union jobs, are now tightening their purse strings – eliminating luxuries like family outings and entertainment. “There's definitely concern on the docks,” said Malauulu.

The west coast-based ILWU has a long history of backing progressive ideas. ILWU vice-president Brandi Good, along with a handful of other labor union representatives, spoke briefly at Bernie Sanders' recent “Standing Up to Oligarchy” rally in downtown Los Angeles.

But Malauulu said that not all individual members rebuffed Trump. Neither did the ILWU's counterpart on the east coast – the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA). ILA president Harold Daggett had a well publicized visit with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.

“Some members, like many working-class Americans across the country, were drawn to Trump because he sounded like he was speaking directly to them,” said Malauulu. Messaging about “bringing jobs back”, being “tough on China” and protecting American industries felt like it aligned with labor values, she said. Malauulu says too many people did not take the time to really dig into Trump policies and the potential effects. Now they are experiencing the result.

Herrera hopes, however, that the focus among port workers can remain on strength and unity. Because of California's location, the ports here get more traffic from Asia. But all US ports and longshore workers will be negatively impacted. They need to stick together, he says.

“We are the most resilient workforce in the world. During the Covid pandemic, we kept moving the world's cargo because we couldn't work remotely. Now, with this situation, we're all just hoping that there's some type of resolve because at the end of the day it's about the American worker, the blue-collar worker, that's being hurt – and the consumer and the communities.”

The situation on the waterfront, however, does not appear to be resolving any time soon. In mid-April, the Trump administration announced new rules that will also phase in port fees on many ships built in China. Jamieson Greer, the head of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), which formulated the rules, said the fees are designed to “reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the US supply chain and send a demand signal for US-built ships”.

The USTR action says that in the first phase, the charge will be $50 per net ton per US voyage, increasing incrementally to $140 per net ton by 17 April, 2028. The fees, which could amount to millions, will be charged up to five times per year per vessel. The charges have been dialed back since they were first floated by the Trump administration and there may be additional carveouts, but Beijing has nonetheless vowed to retaliate.

The Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach have tripled the number of projected blank sailings – or canceled ships. The ports are projecting 30 combined blank sailings for this month, up from 10 in April.

“The men and women of the ILWU are strong and resilient. We are accustomed to peaks and valleys so, for now, we're just trying to remain as positive as we can,” said Herrera. “If and when the work comes back, we'll be here.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Commons leader had appeared to suggest Reform commentator was using a political ‘dog whistle'

No 10 has backed the cabinet minister Lucy Powell after she apologised for appearing to suggest it was a “dog whistle” issue to discuss grooming gangs.

Powell, the leader of the House of Commons, faced calls from the Conservatives to resign after she made the remarks on Friday night.

In a radio discussion, Tim Montgomerie, a Reform commentator, asked Powell if she had seen a Channel 4 programme about five girls who were sexually abused by grooming gangs.

In response, Powell, who is the MP for Manchester Central, responded: “Oh, we want to blow that little trumpet now, do we? Yeah, OK, let's get that dog whistle out.”

She apologised on Saturday, saying: “In the heat of a discussion on AQ [Any Questions], I would like to clarify that I regard issues of child exploitation and grooming with the utmost seriousness.

“I'm sorry if this was unclear. I was challenging the political point scoring around it, not the issue itself. As a constituency MP, I've dealt with horrendous cases. This government is acting to get to the truth and deliver justice.”

Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said on Sunday that everyone makes mistakes and it was time to move forward after Powell had said sorry for her lack of clarity.

Asked if Powell's job was safe, he told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News: “Yes. I think she's made a genuine mistake. She's owned up to it, she's said sorry and we'll move on.”

Reform said Keir Starmer should consider whether Powell was still fit to serve in her job.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, went further by calling on Powell to resign.

“This shocking outburst from a Labour cabinet minister belittles the thousands of girls and women who were raped by grooming gangs over decades,” he said. “We have consistently called for a national inquiry in parliament, which has been blocked by Labour ministers who don't seem to know or care about the disgusting crimes which have been perpetrated.

“Anyone who has seen the shocking Channel 4 documentary will know that it is clearer than ever that this is not a ‘dog whistle'. To dismiss thousands of victims who were raped and the cover-up that followed is sickening. She should resign.”

The Channel 4 documentary has led to renewed calls for an inquiry into the grooming gang scandal, which has led to accusations of failures in the police and social services.

Starmer said on Wednesday there had already been an inquiry and its recommendations would be implemented. He told parliament that Labour was “delivering truth and justice for victims”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine has destroyed a Russian Su-30 fighter jet using a missile fired from a seaborne drone, according to Ukraine's military intelligence agency, in what it said was the world's first downing of a combat plane by a maritime drone. The GUR's statement on social media on Saturday said the fighter had been shot down by a military intelligence unit called Group 13 on Friday over waters near Novorossiisk, a major Russian port city on the Black Sea. The Russian defence ministry did not comment on the Ukrainian claim, but an authoritative Russian blogger believed to be close to the ministry said the jet had been shot down. “The pilots ejected and were picked up by civilian sailors,” the blogger, who goes by the name Rybar, said on Telegram. Meanwhile, the mayor of Novorossiisk declared a state of emergency on Saturday after local authorities said a Ukrainian drone attack had damaged a grain terminal and several residential buildings, injuring five people.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has dismissed a three-day truce ordered by Vladimir Putin as theatrics but said Kyiv was ready for a full ceasefire. “This is more of a theatrical performance on his part, because in two or three days it is impossible to develop a plan for the next steps to end the war,” the Ukrainian president said on Friday in remarks embargoed until Saturday. Moscow claimed the truce, set to coincide with its second world war commemorations on 9 May, was aimed at testing Kyiv's “readiness” for long-term peace. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, said on Saturday that nobody could guarantee Kyiv would survive to see 10 May if Ukraine attacked Moscow during the 9 May celebrations. Zelenskyy said Ukraine would not be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin's exit from isolation on 9 May”. The Kremlin has rejected calls by Kyiv and Washington for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.

A Russian overnight drone attack on Kyiv  injured at least 11 people, including two children, and set several residential buildings throughout the city on fire, the military and officials of the Ukrainian capital said on Sunday. Falling debris from destroyed drones sparked fires at buildings in Kyiv's Obolonskyi and Sviatoshynskyi districts, the head of Kyiv's military administration said on social media. Timur Tkachenko added that several cars throughout the city also caught alight. Ukraine's emergency service said 76 firefighters were involved in putting out the fires.

Russian shelling killed two people in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region on Saturday, while a drone strike on the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson left one other person dead, regional officials said. In the central region of Cherkasy, a Russian drone attack late on Saturday sparked several fires, said the governor, Ihor Taburets. Ukraine's emergency service said one person was injured.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwan has achieved a world first in aquaculture by rearing artificially fertilized narrow-barred Spanish mackerel, the Fisheries Research Institute said.

The institute has been raising artificially inseminated fish for 600 days, with some weighing up to 7kg and measuring up to 80cm in length, it said in a news release.

In April and May 2023, the institute made a breakthrough in the artificial fertilization of mackerel larvae using onboard artificial insemination off Penghu County.

The experiment was the world's first successful land-based larviculture of the species, it said.

The first batch of fry were raised in land-based tanks for about 50 days after hatching, setting a world record, although they subsequently suffered from a high mortality rate due to the species' aggressive nature, collisions with tank walls and jumping out of the tanks.

The institute on Wednesday said that researchers had optimized survival conditions and have cultivated the fish for more than 600 days.

The fish samples also had testes and ovaries, demonstrating the potential for transporting them to land-based ponds for further breeding in captivity, it added.

The research puts the goal of land-based, full-cycle artificial breeding of the species for farming purposes well within reach, it said.

The research has been published in the journal Aquaculture International, showcasing Taiwan's advances in aquaculture technology, it said.

Narrow-barred Spanish mackerel, or Scomberomorus commerson, is a popular food item in Taiwan and a highly valuable fishery resource.

Prices soar over the Lunar New Year holiday, when one fish could sell for more than NT$10,000, the report said.

The research aimed to provide an alternative to wild-caught mackerel, as catches have been declining in the past few years, with the total catch dropping from 6,600 tonnes in 2002 to just 522 tonnes in 2023, it said.

The species' scarcity is due to changes in the maritime environment, high demand and overfishing, it added.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature classified the species as “near threatened” in 2023.

German Ministry of Foreign Affairs hit back at US Secretary of State Marco Rubio after he criticized the decision to classify the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a “right-wing extremist” organization. 

The spat deepened on Friday to embroil the foreign office, Rubio, US Vice President J.D. Vance and tech billionaire Elon Musk. It also occurred at a complicated time for Germany — just days before the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and Nazi Germany's unconditional capitulation. 

Plus, a coalition deal between the center-right and center-left parties was just approved, and the German parliament is set to vote next week to elect conservative leader Friedrich Merz as the country's new chancellor.

Merz has not commented publicly on the intelligence service's decision. 

Oleksii Makeiev, Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, told German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur that he is concerned about AfD's ties to Russia in light of the classification. 

AfD has long faced criticism for Russia-friendly positions and opposes Germany's stance toward the war in Ukraine. Berlin is Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier after the US. 

The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution described the party as a threat to the country's democratic order, saying it “disregards human dignity” — in particular by what it called “ongoing agitation” against refugees and migrants. 

The German domestic intelligence service's move to classify the AfD, which placed second in national elections in February, as a right-wing extremist group means its officials can now use informants and other tools such as audio and video recordings to monitor its activities nationwide. 

However, it also risks fueling the party's claims of political persecution. Far-right parties have been gaining ground across Europe and the AfD attracts international attention, including support from Musk, who is a close ally of US President Donald Trump. 

In his post on Friday, Rubio called on Germany to undo the classification. 

“Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition. That's not democracy — it's tyranny in disguise,” he wrote. “What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD — which took second in the recent election — but rather the establishment's deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes. Germany should reverse course.” 

The foreign ministry wrote: “This is democracy,” in a post that replied directly to Rubio. 

“This decision is the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law,” the foreign office wrote late on Friday. “It is independent courts that will have the final say. We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.” 

Meanwhile, Vance referenced the Cold War in his post on X. 

“The AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it,” Vance wrote. “The West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt — not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment.” 

Musk, who owns X, reposted Vance's comments and added: “Fate loves irony.”



                                                                                Kehinde Sanni spends his days smoothing out dents and repainting scratched bumpers in a modest autobody shop in Lagos. He has never left Nigeria, yet he speaks glowingly of Burkina Faso military leader Ibrahim Traore.
“Nigeria needs someone like Ibrahim Traore of Burkina Faso. He is doing well for his country,” Sanni said.
His admiration is shaped by a steady stream of viral videos, memes and social media posts — many misleading or outright false — portraying Traore as a fearless reformer who defied Western powers and reclaimed his country's dignity.
The Burkinabe strongman swept into power following a coup in September 2022

Following a campaign dominated by Trump's tariffs and annexation threats, Carney promised to chart “a new path forward” in a world “fundamentally changed” by a US that is newly hostile to free trade.
“We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,” said Carney, who led the central banks of Canada and the UK before entering politics earlier this year.
“We will win this trade war and

Corals spawn in Penghu

Waters in a southern coastal area of Penghu County on Saturday took on a faint red color, as coral reefs released tiny eggs, the Cimei Township (七美) Office said. A guesthouse operator in the area reported the spawning event on Saturday evening near Woniu Bay (臥牛灣) on the township's southernmost tip, the office wrote on Facebook. The relatively small spawning was the first of its kind in Penghu this year, it said, adding that it expected the phenomenon to peak on Sunday. The Penghu Fishery Research Center said it hired a local scuba diver to take egg samples for research purposes. Coral spawning is a seasonal event in Penghu, which typically coincides with the birthday of the sea goddess Matsu (媽祖), which falls on the 23rd day of the third month of the lunar calendar, it said. Cimei is the southernmost island in Penghu. It has an area of about 7km2 with a population of fewer than 3,900.

Job recruitment drive starts

More than 900 job openings are to be available during a four-day recruitment campaign across Taipei starting today, the city's Department of Labor said yesterday. Twenty-three companies are participating in the event, offering positions with monthly salaries of up to NT$70,000, department Director Wang Chiu-tung (王秋冬) said. The drive is targeted at first-time jobseekers, people looking to change careers and retirees looking to rejoin the workforce. Job interviews would be held at employment service stations around Taipei. Positions range from retail and hospitality to logistics and caregiving. Employers include Osim, which manufactures massage chairs, and My Humble House Group, which operates the Sheraton Grand Taipei Hotel. Fast food and retail brands such as McDonald's, Mos Burger, 7-Eleven, Pizza Hut, Carrefour and Simple Mart are also hiring. All participating companies have been vetted by the city and have no recent record of disputes or furloughing staff, the department said. Employment service stations provide free job-matching services to Taiwanese citizens, their foreign or Chinese spouses with residency permits, and foreign nationals with valid work permits.

Taiwanese featured in Napoli

The Napoli Comicon in Italy last week featured more than 30 Taiwanese comic books, along with a live drawing and signing event by two Taiwanese artists, attracting comic book fans to the Taiwan Pavilion for a taste of Taiwanese art. The showcase was a joint effort by the Cultural Division of the Taipei Representative Office in Italy and Locus Publishing, the Ministry of Culture said in a statement. Napoli Comicon president Claudio Curcio said he hoped Taiwan would continue participating in the event, adding that it enriches the exhibition, the ministry said. Some of the comic books have been translated into Italian, others are available in English or other languages, while some remain in Chinese, it said. Despite the language barrier, Italian visitors showed strong support for the Taiwanese works, with many buying non-Italian editions to have them signed and illustrated live by artists, it said. The pavilion also hosted an exhibition of select frames from Taiwanese comic books. The representative office said this was the first year it opened a pavilion at the Napoli Comicon. The Napoli Comicon began on Thursday and was to conclude yesterday.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

12:49 JST, May 4, 2025

The government decided Saturday to continue to press the United States to review its extra tariffs on Japanese automobiles during bilateral talks aimed at scrapping the Trump administration's tariff measures.

Washington has excluded automobiles and other key items from the scope of the talks. In response, Tokyo has insisted that it will make no concessions as it presses for a complete overhaul of each of the duties imposed Saturday, including those on auto parts.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the day met at the Prime Minister's Residence with economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa, who had just returned from the second round of ministerial talks in the United States, and instructed him on the government's next steps based on the outcome of the talks.

“There is still a wide gulf between [Japan's and the United States'] positions, and no common ground has emerged,” Ishiba told reporters after the meeting. “We are [pushing to negotiate] all the tariffs, including those on automobiles, steel and aluminum.” Ishiba also called the new duties on auto parts “extremely regrettable” and said Japan would “continue to demand that they be reversed.”

Akazawa likewise told the press that Tokyo “has consistently requested a total rollback of the tariff package, and [the two countries] cannot reach an agreement unless that element is included.”

The United States has limited the scope of the ministerial talks to the extra “reciprocal tariff” surcharge — 14% for Japan — and excluded the additional levies on automobiles, steel and aluminum, materials which Tokyo regards as essential. Unlike the reciprocal tariffs, the automotive duty is a flat 25% rate applied equally to every country, and it is said that Washington will not grant Japan special treatment.

Automobiles, however, are Japan's core industry, with an extensive supply chain for parts makers, and leaving the tariffs in place could cause the entire Japanese economy to stall. On Saturday, Ishiba ordered Akazawa and other officials to plan their negotiating strategy “swiftly and meticulously.”

Japan and the United States have agreed to hold an intensive series of ministerial meetings starting in mid-May. Speaking to reporters at Haneda Airport immediately after landing on Saturday, Akazawa revealed that working-level talks had already begun in the United States on Friday local time, stressing that “discussions on individual issues and technical details are also extremely important.”

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) shot down two Russian Su-30 fighter jets using air-to-air missiles fired from Magura-7 sea drones near Novorossiysk on May 2, HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov told the War Zone on May 3.

The operation marks the first time in history that fighter jets have been downed by unmanned boats. Initially, reports confirmed the destruction of only one jet, but Budanov later clarified that two aircraft were hit. 

""It's a historical moment,"" he told the publication.

According to HUR, Group 13, a special operations unit within the agency, executed the strike. A video of the first downed Su-30 was released and widely shared on social media, though no visual evidence of the second strike has emerged. 

World first: On May 2, 2025, the @DI_Ukraine special operations unit, in coordination with the Security Service of Ukraine and Defence Forces of Ukraine, eliminated a russian Su-30 fighter jet in the Black Sea.🔗 https://t.co/DXhg74AKcg pic.twitter.com/Z4fP5CFRb8

Budanov said the crew of the first jet survived and was rescued by a civilian vessel, while the second crew is believed to have been killed.

The Sukhoi Su-30 is a $50 million twin-engine, two-seat multirole fighter designed by Russia's Sukhoi Design Bureau. HUR claimed that the aircraft were hit midair and crashed into the Black Sea.

The Kyiv Independent can't independently verify all the claims.

A Patriot air defense system based in Israel will be transferred to Ukraine after refurbishment, the New York Times reported on May 4, citing four unnamed current and former U.S. officials.

According to the publication, Western allies are also discussing the logistics of supplying additional systems from Germany or Greece as Russia escalates its attacks across Ukraine.

The sources declined to go into detail about U.S. President Donald Trump's stance on the decision or clarify whether the move was initiated before he took office, during former President Joe Biden's administration.

The move comes amid a sharp increase in Russian strikes that have caused numerous casualties in Kryvyi Rih, Sumy, Odesa, Kharkiv, and Kyiv.

Kyiv has consistently pressed Western partners to bolster Ukraine's air defenses, warning that its current capabilities are insufficient to counter the scale of Russian missile and drone assaults.

The Patriot system, a U.S.-made surface-to-air missile platform, is widely recognized for its high-precision detection, tracking, and interception of aircraft, cruise, and ballistic missiles.

According to the New York Times, Ukraine currently has eight Patriot systems, of which only six are operational. The remaining two are reportedly undergoing refurbishment.

President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated Ukraine's urgent need for air defenses in an April 13 interview with CBS News, saying Kyiv is ready to purchase 10 U.S.-made Patriot systems for $15 billion to shield densely populated cities. 

""We will find the money and pay for everything,"" Zelensky said, emphasizing Ukraine's intention to buy, not request, additional systems.

Despite Kyiv's appeals, Trump dismissed the request on April 14, accusing Zelensky of ""always looking to purchase missiles"" and falsely blaming Ukraine for instigating the war. 

Trump's tone on Ukraine has shifted in recent weeks. On April 24, he criticized a Russian strike on Kyiv that killed at least nine civilians and injured 87, calling it ""not necessary"" and urging Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the attacks.

Shortly after taking office, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force negotiations, saying ""we can do it the easy way or the hard way,"" though no measures have materialized so far.

Trump has recently questioned Russia's intentions to seek peace, as Moscow continues to reject a complete ceasefire agreement, intensifying attacks against Ukrainian civilian areas.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Pro-Russian demonstrators staged an Immortal Regiment rally in Washington, D.C, on May 3 to mark 80 years since the end of World War II, representatives of NFO Ukrainian Cultural Front D.C. reported on Facebook.

It was the first Immortal Regiment rally in the U.S. capital in six years. Ukrainian nationals staged a protest in response.

The Immortal Regiment was originally a grassroots campaign launched in 2012 to honor WWII veterans. Its members have complained that it has since been co-opted by the Kremlin and transformed into a political spectacle.

While officially commemorating relatives who fought in World War II, the march reinforces narratives of Russian military glory and is used to legitimize Moscow's current military actions, including the war against Ukraine.

The rally, held ahead of Russia's Victory Day on May 9, began at Lafayette Square Park near the White House and ended at the World War II Memorial. 

Washington police blocked streets and guarded the march's participants.

""That's the crazy reality. We have a Russian march in the middle of Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States... Justifying war crimes seems fine,"" Marichka Hlyten, an activist with the Ukrainian Cultural Front D.C., said in a video posted on Facebook.

Ukrainian protesters carried flags and posters that read ""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is wanted for genocide,"" ""Honor the dead, bring Russia to justice,"" and ""Putin = Hitler."" 

They also displayed a photo of Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, tortured in Russian captivity, according to the Ukrainian Cultural Front DC NGO.

An activist told the Ukrainian broadcaster News.LIVE that the Russian media covering the event kept their distance from the Ukrainian protest to skew coverage for domestic audiences.

Victory Day, celebrated on May 9, is a cornerstone of Putin's nationalist narrative. By glorifying the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, Putin aims to rally support, display military power, and frame Russia as a heroic nation resisting Western aggression.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Given the unenviable job of defending his party's campaign on national television as it became clear Australia's Liberals were headed for an historic defeat in Saturday's election, Senator James Paterson was clear about who he blamed for the loss. 

The conservative Liberal-National Coalition — which governed Australia from 2013 to 2022 — lost seats across the country amid a national swing towards Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's ruling Labor Party, including that of Liberal leader Peter Dutton.

Like Canada's election last month, polls had shown the Coalition on course for victory at the start of this year, and speaking to the ABC as results rolled in, Mr. Paterson drew a direct parallel. 

“One fact I think we can all acknowledge and recognize is the Donald Trump factor,” the Coalition spokesman said. “It was devastating in Canada for the Conservatives where the Canadian Conservative leader lost 20 points over the course of a few months. I think that has been a factor here.” 

Australia's Anthony Albanese claimed a historic second term as prime minister on May 3 in a dramatic comeback against once-resurgent conservatives that was powered by voters' concerns about the influence of U.S. President Donald Trump.

A former police officer who served as minister and attack dog for several former conservative leaders, Mr. Dutton once embraced comparisons to Mr. Trump, even proposing an Australian equivalent to Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. 

This approach was embraced and cheered on by Australia's powerful right wing media, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., but quickly backfired after Mr. Albanese called an election at the height of Mr. Trump's trade war chaos, and polls showed voters were turned off by any suggestion of bringing MAGA-style politics to their shores. 

Try as he might, the Liberal leader could not shrug the comparisons – with even a focus group of his own supporters describing him as “too Trumpy” – and in his humiliating double concession speech Saturday, as he acknowledged losing both the country and his own seat, Mr. Dutton said his party had been “defined by our opponents in this election.” 

An April poll by the Sydney Morning Herald found 60 per cent of Australian voters believed Mr. Trump's election was bad for their country, while one-third said they were less likely to vote for Mr. Dutton because of his association with the U.S. President. 

Beyond the Coalition's worst result since 1946, smaller right wing parties also failed to break through, with conservative billionaire Clive Palmer's Trumpet of Patriots – which spent millions on advertising, including blanketing increasingly annoyed voters with daily text messages – only picking up 1.85 per cent of the national vote. 

Unlike Pierre Poilievre, who Mr. Trump may have cost victory in last month's election but nevertheless added seats and appears poised to continue as Conservative leader, Mr. Dutton's political career is over. Even as the Liberal party quickly dissolved into infighting Sunday over the future direction of the party, one thing everyone appeared to agree upon was the woeful nature of Mr. Dutton's gaffe-filled and often contradictory campaign. 

A path forward for the party will be difficult: Saturday's defeat claimed many of its leading figures and potential future stars, on both the moderate and right wings of the party. Surviving lawmakers were split on whether they needed to pivot back towards the centre and stop the bleeding towards so-called “teal independents,” or tack harder to the right. 

“Grievance politics was not enough to win,” former Liberal lawmaker and party strategist Arthur Sinodinos wrote Sunday. “An opposition must have a clear and coherent plan that demonstrates they are ready to govern.” 

Speaking on the ABC, Liberal Senator James McGrath warned against adopting “Donald Trump's positions,” saying this “would be dangerous for my party.” 

“I speak as a Ronald Reagan Republican and a George Bush Republican,” he said. “We are a free-trade party and pro-Ukraine and we should continue to be centre-right. We must resist that path, focus on where middle Australia is.”

Others in the party expressed the opposite view, with Senator Alex Antic telling Sky News “what we have to do is make sure that we make the Liberal Party great again – I said it, there we go – so we can make Australia great again.”

“We've seen it in the United States, the Republican party is stronger under a stronger conservative leader, and I think the same is true here,” he said.

Whomever emerges as Liberal leader will face an emboldened Labor movement, with Mr. Albanese already being hailed as among the pantheon of the party's heroes, on par with Bob Hawke, who led Labor to four successive election wins, at a time when the Liberals were riven by infighting between the party's moderate and conservative wings. 

Speaking Saturday, Mr. Albanese vowed to govern for “all Australians” and further grow the party's tent. In his sole dig at Mr. Dutton's Trumpian Achilles heel, the Prime Minister said Australia “does not need to beg or borrow or copy from anywhere else.”

“We do not seek our inspiration overseas,” he said. “We find it here in our country and our people.”

Mark Carney led the Liberals to election victory this week, giving the party its fourth consecutive term since 2015. There's no shortage of challenges for the new prime minister, but the main task ahead is to tackle U.S. President Donald Trump's's trade war. Canada's business leaders and top executives see a window of opportunity for Mr. Carney to push through big changes for Canada's economy while voters are united on the need to bring a strong hand to negotiations with Mr. Trump – but they want to see results quickly. It's a long cry from just a few months ago when the country's business leadership had all but given up on the Liberals. During his first public address since winning the election, Mr. Carney said he will travel to Washington to meet Mr. Trump at the White House on Tuesday.

A growing number of businesses are starting to make significant changes in order to avoid crushing U.S. tariffs. Some are rerouting U.S.-bound shipments from China to Canada and storing goods in Canadian warehouses – a move that, experts says, risks flooding the Canadian market and raising competition for already scarce warehouse storage. Automakers in Canada are also an early sign of how Trump's trade policies will upend the North American industry. Stellantis plans to shift some vehicle production and revamp its parts supply lines to avoid paying U.S. tariffs. The company also announced that the Stellantis NV auto assembly plant in Windsor, Ont., will close for a week beginning on May 5, putting 3,800 workers on temporary layoff. General Motors Co. also said this week it will cut one of three shifts at its pickup-truck plant in Oshawa, Ont., by the fall.

New Canadian graduates are being confronted with a harsh reality: This is the worst job market for graduates in decades. The average unemployment rate for recent grads in the first quarter of 2025 was 11.2 per cent, according to an analysis of Statistics Canada data from Brendon Bernard, senior economist at job-search site Indeed Canada. That's the highest jobless rate to start the year in at least two decades, excluding the pandemic. Matt Lundy takes a closer look at the numbers in this week's Decoder series.

A Telus Health drug report published this week said patient claims submitted to insurers soared last year following the introduction of weight-loss drug Wegovy in Canada. The total claims paid out by Canadian insurers for weight management drugs nearly doubled, climbing to $77-million in 2024 from nearly $38-million a year prior. The growing popularity of these drugs poses a problem for private benefit plans, which are funded by employers and have a direct impact on companies' bottom line, Clare O'Hara reports. “The stakes are high for employee health and the long-term sustainability of private drug plans,” said benefits industry veteran Paul Sabat. He said if coverage continues to expand, so will the strain on benefit plans.

Romanians are casting ballots Sunday in a critical presidential election rerun after last year's annulled vote plunged the European Union and NATO member country into its worst political crisis in decades.

Eleven candidates are vying for the presidency and a May 18 runoff is expected. Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and will close at 9 p.m.

By 5 p.m. 7.1 million people – about 39.6 per cent of eligible voters – had cast ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau, with 799,000 votes cast at polling stations set up in other countries.

Romania's political landscape was shaken last year when a top court voided the previous election in which the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped the first round, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied.

As in many EU countries, anti-establishment sentiment is running high in Romania, fuelled by high inflation and cost of living, a large budget deficit and a sluggish economy. Observers say the malaise has bolstered support for nationalist and far-right figures like Georgescu, who is under investigation and barred from the rerun.

While data from local surveys should be taken with caution, a median of polls suggests that hard-right nationalist George Simion will enter the runoff, likely pitting him against Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, or the governing coalition's candidate, Crin Antonescu.

Appearing with Georgescu at a polling station in the capital, Bucharest, on Sunday morning, Simion told reporters: “We are here with one mission only: the return to constitutional order, the return to democracy. I have no other goal than first place for the Romanian people.”

Georgescu called the vote rerun “a fraud orchestrated by those who have made deceit the only state policy,” but said he was there to “acknowledge the power of democracy, the power of the vote that frightens the system, that terrifies the system.”

Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician and former anti-corruption activist who founded the Save Romania Union party (USR) in 2016, is running on a pro-EU “Honest Romania” ticket. After casting his ballot, he said he voted “for hope and a new beginning” for Romania. “I voted with realism, because Romania is going through a difficult time,” he said.

Antonescu, 65, a veteran centrist who campaigned on retaining Romania's pro-Western orientation, said Sunday that he voted for “a united Romania, for a strong Romania, for a dignified Romania.”

Victor Ponta, who was prime minister from 2012-2015, has also pushed a MAGA-style “Romania First” campaign and boasts of having close ties to the Trump administration.

Another hopeful, Elena Lasconi, came second in last year's first round ballot and is participating in the rerun. She has positioned herself as a staunchly pro-Western, anti-system candidate, railing against what she describes as a corrupt political class.

Distrust in the authorities remains widespread, especially for those who voted for Georgescu, a sizable electorate that Simion has sought to tap into.

“The anti-establishment sentiment is not like an anarchic movement, but is against the people who destroyed this country,” Simion, who came fourth in last year's race and later backed Georgescu, told the Associated Press days before the rerun. “We are not a democratic state anymore.”

Rares Ghiorghies, 36, who works in the energy sector and voted for Simion, says he hopes that if he secures the presidency, Romania can “return to the basic principles of democracy, regain our confidence.”

“What happened in December 2024 is definitely a dark chapter in the history of this country, and we can no longer accept it,” he said. “I'm hoping things will get back to normal.”

Simion said that his hard-right nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians party is “perfectly aligned with the MAGA movement,” capitalizing on a growing wave of populism in Europe after U.S. President Donald Trump's political comeback. AUR rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election, proclaims to stand for “family, nation, faith, and freedom,” and has since doubled its support.

Retiree Done Chiritoi says he feels robbed of his previous vote, which has left him with “only bad words” for the political class. “If my vote gets cancelled again or if the one I chose won't get elected, I'll take to the streets,” he said.

The election redo is a crossroads moment for Romania as it seeks to restore its democracy and retain its geopolitical alliances, which have become strained since the cancelled election fiasco.

The decision to annul the election and the ban on Georgescu's candidacy drew criticism from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and Russia, which publicly supported his candidacy in the rerun.

The presidential role carries a five-year term and significant decision-making powers in national security and foreign policy.

Claudia Sheinbaum said Donald Trump had offered to send US troops to Mexico to help fight drug trafficking. Trump has made stemming drugs and immigration at the US-Mexico border key policy priorities.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Saturday that she had turned down an offer from her US counterpart, Donald Trump, to send American soldiers to Mexico to help fight drug cartels.

At an event in Texcoco, on the outskirts of the capital, Mexico City, Sheinbaum said Trump had made the offer during one of several phone calls between the two leaders.

""I told him, ''No, President Trump, our territory is inviolable, our sovereignty is inviolable, our sovereignty is not for sale,'"" Sheinbaum said.

""There is no need — we can collaborate, we can work together, but you in your territory, we in ours. We can share information, but we will never accept the presence of the US Army in our territory,"" the Mexican president added.

Her remarks come after the Wall Street Journal reported this week that Trump was pushing for more US military involvement to tackle drug trafficking.

Sheinbaum also said she had urged Trump to halt weapons smuggling across the border from the US.

She told the event in Texcoco that the US president had issued an order on Friday ensuring that all available measures were being deployed to stop weapons from entering Mexico.

The massive amounts of arms coming in from the US have helped make Mexico one of the world's most violent countries. 

Over 450,000 people have been killed since the Mexican state declared war on the country's drug trafficking gangs, known as cartels.

Trump has often complained of cross-border drug smuggling and undocumented immigrants. He has slapped import duties on Mexico as a way to pressure Mexican authorities to do more to tackle drug cartels and stem irregular migration.

The sweeping tariffs are expected to have a severe impact on Mexico, which is the United States' largest trading partner and the second-largest economy in Latin America.

Since Trump returned to the White House in January, Sheinbaum, a leftist, has sought to find a balance in her dealings with the US Republican leader, having to placate him while also defending her nation's interests.

Trump's rhetoric has repeatedly angered Mexicans. In March, he said his country's neighbor to the south was ""dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control... posing a grave threat to our national security.""

When he first announced his intention to run for president in 2015, Trump said Mexico was sending people to America who were ""bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""

Aleksandar Vucic was visiting the state of Florida when he was forced to return home after suffering chest pain. He had been hoping to meet with his US counterpart Donald Trump.

Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic cut short a trip to the United States after suddenly falling ill, his office said Saturday.

He was admitted to the Military Medical Academy (MMA) in Belgrade immediately after returning to Serbia, public broadcaster RTS reported.

He was met there by his Health Minister Zlatibor Loncar and the the head of the military health department, Dr Dragan Dincic.

Later on Saturday, Dincic told a press conference that Vucic's condition was stable, according to RTS.

""I cannot discuss the details, but during his stay in America, the president felt severe chest pain,"" Dincic said, adding that Vucic, 55, has had similar issues related to high blood pressure on three prior occasions.

Dincic also said that the Serbian leader was expected to leave the MMA shortly, but that ""it is certainly not realistic"" to expect him to ""fully return to his regular activities in the next few days.""

Vucic suddenly fell ill after meeting with US Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevic, as well as Serbian entrepreneurs in the US, according to RTS.

He was with Serbian Finance Minister Finance Minister Sinisa Mali and presidential media advisor Suzana Vasiljevic preparing for upcoming meetings when he started feeling unwell.

After consulting doctors in Florida, he decided to cut short the trip and return to the Balkan country.

Vucic had traveled to Miami, south Florida, where he had met with disgraced former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Giuliani was disbarred over his role in Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election — which his predecessor Joe Biden won — was stolen or rigged.

Vucic had also said he hoped to meet with Trump during his trip. The US president spends much of his time at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, an upscale town north of Miami.

It is unclear whether the Serbian leader will be able to travel to Russia to attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9.

Vucic had said he hoped to attend the commemoration of Russia's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II despite warnings from the European Union that the trip could jeopardize Serbia's bid to join the bloc.

A right-wing populist, Vucic has refused to join Western sanctions against the Kremlin over its invasion of Ukraine.

He has also been facing mounting pressure on the domestic front after months of massive, mostly student-led anti-corruption protests in Serbia in the wake of a roof collapse at a train station that killed 16 people.

Advocacy groups called Tom Homan's threat against Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers a “chilling attempt to normalize fascism.”

A coalition of advocacy organizations on Saturday expressed support for Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and warned that the Trump border czar's threat against the Democratic leader marks a “dangerous escalation” of the administration's assault on the rule of law across the United States.

The groups — including All Voting Is Local and the ACLU of Wisconsin — said in a joint statement that Evers' guidance to state officials on how to handle being confronted by federal agents was “a prudent measure aimed at ensuring compliance with state and federal laws while protecting the rights of state employees.”

The suggestion by Tom Homan, a leader of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign, that Evers could be arrested for issuing such guidance undermines “the foundational principles of our democracy, including the separation of powers, the rule of law, and the right of state governments to operate without undue federal interference,” the groups said Saturday.

“To threaten our governor over his legal directive is gross overreach by our federal government, and it is not occurring in a vacuum,” they continued, warning that the administration's rhetoric and actions represent a “chilling attempt to normalize fascism.”

“Similar occurrences are happening across the nation, including within our academic systems,” the groups added. “If we do not reject these actions now, states and other institutions will only lose more and more of their autonomy and power. This is exactly why we underscore Gov. Evers' claim that this event is ‘chilling.'”

The threats against Gov. Evers in Wisconsin undermine the foundational principles of our democracy: the separation of powers, the rule of law, and the right of state governments to operate without undue federal interference. We must reject this overreach.allvotingislocal.org/statements/w…

Trump administration officials and the president himself have repeatedly threatened state and local officials as the White House rushes ahead with its lawless mass deportation campaign, which has ensnared tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants and at least over a dozen U.S. citizens — including children.

In an executive order signed late last month, Trump accused “some state and local officials” of engaging in a “lawless insurrection” against the federal government by refusing to cooperate with the administration's deportation efforts.

But as Temple University law professor Jennifer Lee recently noted, localities “can legally decide not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.”

“Cities, like states, have constitutional protections against being forced to administer or enforce federal programs,” Lee wrote. “The Trump administration cannot force any state or local official to assist in enforcing federal immigration law.”

Administration officials have also leveled threats against members of Congress, with Homan suggesting earlier this year that he would refer Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to the U.S. Justice Department for holding a webinar informing constituents of their rights.

During a town hall on Friday, Ocasio-Cortez dared Homan to do so.

“To that I say: Come for me,” she said to cheers from the audience. “We need to challenge them. So don't let them intimidate you.”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

PDF metadata revealed a letter circulated in the House was written by Paragon Health Institute President Brian Blase.

A letter that a group of 20 far-right House Republicans released earlier this week as part of a campaign in support of slashing Medicaid appears to have been authored by the head of a research institute with ties to the Koch network.

Politico reported Friday that “digital metadata embedded in a PDF copy” of the letter that was circulated inside the House of Representatives “lists the author as Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute.”

InfluenceWatch notes that in 2021, Paragon received a nearly $2 million donation from Stand Together, “a right-libertarian funding organization that acts as the umbrella organization for the political network that is largely funded by right-leaning businessman and political donor Charles Koch.”

Paragon recently urged federal policymakers to require states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks for Medicaid recipients in a purported effort to root out improper payments. Health policy advocates say such a change would make it more difficult for eligible enrollees to keep their Medicaid coverage.

The letter signed by Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and other House Republicans aligns with Paragon's objectives, claiming that “political abuse” of Medicaid “is helping to bankrupt the federal government” and calling for “structural Medicaid reform” in the party's forthcoming reconciliation package.

Tony Carrk, executive director of the watchdog group Accountable.US, said in a statement that “you'd be hard pressed to find a more shameless example of congressional Republicans taking their cues from special interests at the cost of the American people than Chip Roy copying and pasting a letter directly from… special interests.”

“This remarkably blatant kowtowing to conservative billionaires is a sad reflection of the congressional Republicans' willingness to make devastating cuts to Americans' healthcare to pay for lower taxes for the richest,” said Carrk.

The letter was released as congressional Republicans grappled internally with how and how much to cut Medicaid as they seek to offset the massive projected costs of another round of tax breaks for the rich.

Earlier this week, as Common Dreams reported, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said he would not accept more than $500 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade. Cuts of that magnitude would still be the largest in the program's history and would strip health coverage from tens of millions of people.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

As we undertake this life-sustaining work, we appeal for your support. Please, if you find value in what we do, join our community of sustainers by making a monthly or one-time gift.

Warren Buffett on May 3 urged long-term investors not to be shaken by short-term swings and focus on fundamentals amid recent market volatility.

“What has happened in the last 30, 45 days … is really nothing,” Buffett told shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on May 3 in Omaha, Nebraska. “This is not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort.”

Buffett made clear that wild market swings, while unsettling in the moment, are nothing to panic about.

“If it makes a difference to you whether your stocks are down 15 percent or not, you need a somewhat different investment philosophy,” he said. “The world is not going to adapt to you. You're going to have to adapt to the world.”

He reminded attendees that Berkshire Hathaway's stock has dropped by 50 percent three times in its history, and each time, the fundamentals of the company remained sound.

“People have emotions,” he said. “But you got to check them at the door when you invest.”

The massive cash pile—larger than the GDP of many countries—reflects not just Buffett's trademark caution but also the challenge of finding investment opportunities in an uncertain economic environment.

Markets have shown signs of stabilizing. The S&P 500 capped its longest winning streak since 2004 last week, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 560 points on Friday.

In its quarterly filing, Berkshire warned that “considerable uncertainty remains” due to “ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events,” including tariffs, supply chain inefficiencies, and fluctuating customer demand. “It is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences on most, if not all, of our operating businesses,” the company noted.

Beyond markets, the 94-year-old Buffett also revealed that he plans to retire at the end of the year.

“I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the Chief Executive Officer of the company at year end,” Buffett said, referring to Berkshire vice-chairman Greg Abel. Four years ago, Buffett picked Abel to be his successor at the helm of Berkshire, but prior to Saturday's announcement, he gave no indication when he would retire.

Buffett also weighed in on broader policy issues, particularly trade and energy.

“Balanced trade is good for the world,” he said. “In the United States, we should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We want a prosperous world.”

He also noted that America's fragmented energy infrastructure poses challenges and called for smart policies.

“It is important that the United States have an intelligent energy policy, just as it was important during World War II that we learned how to make ships instead of cars extremely fast,” he said. “And we figured out the answer. We combined private enterprise with ... the power of ... government,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

“To date, the Aurora Driver has completed over 1,200 miles without a driver,” said the statement. “The milestone makes Aurora the first company to operate a commercial self-driving service with heavy-duty trucks on public roads.”

“Aurora plans to expand its driverless service to El Paso, Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona, by the end of 2025.”

Aurora's launch customers are logistics companies Uber Freight and Hirschbach Motor Lines, both of which have had “long-standing supervised commercial pilots with Aurora.”

Aurora Driver is reportedly an SAE L4 self-driving system that is being deployed for long-haul trucking for the first time.

At the L4 level, the features of the driverless system can “drive the vehicle under limited conditions and will not operate unless all required conditions are met,” according to the SAE website.

Pedals and steering wheels may or may not be installed in SAE L4 vehicles. The automated features of the system won't require a person sitting inside the vehicle to take over driving.

“We founded Aurora to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly,” said Chris Urmson, CEO and co-founder of Aurora. “Riding in the back seat for our inaugural trip was an honor of a lifetime—the Aurora Driver performed perfectly.”

Meanwhile, autonomous trucks pose a critical employment issue for truck drivers.

The bill requires that all commercial vehicles weighing over 26,000 pounds have a trained human safety operator behind the wheel.

“For Big Tech companies to think they can come into any state and replace the jobs of hardworking union members with this dangerous and inferior technology is an insult to professional drivers everywhere,” said Peter Finn, president of Teamsters Joint Council 7.

“SB 395 is critical to protecting the middle class. That is why we are demanding that Nevada lawmakers vote in favor of this legislation.”

“In over four years of supervised pilot hauls, the Aurora Driver has delivered over 10,000 customer loads across three million autonomous miles,” the company said.

“It has also demonstrated extraordinary capabilities, including predicting red light runners, avoiding collisions, and detecting pedestrians in the dark hundreds of meters away.”

Before beginning operations, Aurora had completed a “safety case” for its vehicles. A safety case is a documented assurance of the vehicle maintaining safety.

The company said it had briefed several government entities about Aurora Driver's readiness for driverless operations, including the National Transportation Safety Board, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Texas Department of Public Safety, and Texas Department of Transportation.

Specifically, the agency will expand the Automated Vehicle Exemption Program to domestically-produced automated vehicles (AVs) as well. The program currently only applies to imported AVs.

Advocacy group Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety criticized the decision, saying that “troubling incidents” involving automated vehicles have already occurred in multiple cities.

If proper safety regulations, safeguards, transparency, and accountability are not maintained regarding the issue, the deployment of AVs could result in “deadly consequences,” it said.

“Yes, we've got to move smartly and safely. But this announcement shows the administration is also proceeding with a sense of urgency, so we don't cede AV leadership to China and other countries. Time is of the essence,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

The White House on May 2 shared a $1 trillion military budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 and some congressional Republicans have said the funding doesn't quite add up.

Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), the Senate Armed Services Committee chair, was quick to dispute Vought's budget.

The White House reached its $1 trillion defense budget figure by combining this $892.6 billion budget request for fiscal year 2026 with a $119.3 billion that's part of a supplemental defense spending plan that's currently advancing through Congress as a reconciliation bill.

Wicker said it's not the plan he wants to see through the reconciliation process.

“The Big, Beautiful Reconciliation Bill was always meant to change fundamentally the direction of the Pentagon on programs like Golden Dome, border support, and unmanned capabilities—not to paper over OMB's intent to shred to the bone our military capabilities and our support to service members,” he said.

Though the spending plan comes from the White House, Wicker cast the proposal as one at odds with Trump's true intent.

“President Trump successfully campaigned on a Peace Through Strength agenda but his advisers at the Office of Management and Budget were apparently not listening,” Wicker wrote.

Wicker said more military funding is necessary to ensure that Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping “does not launch a military war against us in Asia.” He also raised concerns about existing security challenges from countries such as Russia and Iran, and from Hamas and the Houthis; terrorist groups based in Gaza and Yemen, respectively.

Collins also expressed disapproval of the White House plan.

Beyond military spending, Collins also raised objections to White House plans to cut funding or outright eliminate other programs including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the Department of Education's TRIO programs, and other programs related to biomedical research.

Introducing its budget plan on Friday, the White House said it has proposed the lowest level of non-defense spending since 2017, achieving savings by “eliminating radical diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and critical race theory programs, Green New Scam funding, large swaths of the Federal Government weaponized against the American people, and moving programs that are better suited for States and localities to provide.”

Under the White House plan, the Department of Homeland Security would also receive a 65 percent funding increase. The White House said the increase would help “ensure that our military and other agencies repelling the invasion of our border have the resources they need to complete the mission.”

The Epoch Times reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive a response by publication time.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Follow:


            Brazilian police said on Sunday that they had thwarted a bomb attack planned for Lady Gaga's historic concert that drew over 2 million people to Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday.
    


            The Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro state, working in coordination with the Justice Ministry, said the plot was orchestrated by a group promoting hate speech and the radicalization of teenagers, including self-harm and violent content as a form of social belonging.
    


            According to the Rio city hall, 2.1 million people attended the concert of the American pop icon.
    


            “The suspects were recruiting participants, including minors, to carry out coordinated attacks using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails,” the police said in a statement.
    


            The Justice Ministry said the recruiters identified themselves as members of Gaga's global fan base, known as the “Little Monsters.”
    


            The operation was based on a report by the ministry's Cyber Operations Lab following a tip-off from Rio state police intelligence, which uncovered digital cells encouraging violent behavior among teenagers using coded language and extremist symbolism.
    


            A man described as the group's leader was arrested in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul for illegal possession of a firearm, while a teenager in Rio de Janeiro was detained for storing child pornography.
    


            Authorities carried out over a dozen search and seizure warrants across the states of Rio de Janeiro, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo.

Editor's note: A version of this story appeared in CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            For many people, the term “mummy” usually brings to mind images of Egyptian sarcophagi.
    


            But the history of mummies is much more complex and spans cultures around the world.
    


            Such well-preserved remains have enabled scientists to reconstruct the faces of those who lived in bygone centuries, such as the Incan “Ice Maiden.”



            Each mummy has their own story to tell, and this week, researchers have uncovered the truth behind an enigmatic figure from a remote Austrian village.
    


            A water leak in the church crypt of St. Thomas am Blasenstein presented an opportunity for scientists to delve into the secrets of an unusual mummy. Called the “air-dried chaplain” by village locals, the remains belonged to an 18th century clergyman who had served as the parish vicar, the research team determined.
    


            The mummy's incredible condition, including intact skin and tissue, may be due to the presence of zinc chloride, wood chips and embroidered fabric found inside the body — a technique never described before in scientific literature, according to the new study.
    


            The chaplain's cause of death has long been shrouded in mystery due to a capsule-shaped object revealed by an X-ray. But the new research has pulled back the curtain on his ultimate cause of death — and the true identity of the glass sphere.
    


            Geoscientists discovered a magma cap beneath Yellowstone National Park, which harbors the world's largest active volcanic systems. See how the unique feature acts like nature's pressure-release valve.
    


            Astronomers detected an invisible molecular cloud surprisingly close to Earth. The cosmic phenomenon could provide a window into understanding how stars and planets form.
    


            The cloud, named Eos after the Greek goddess of the dawn, measures about 40 moons across and its mass is 3,400 times that of the sun, according to the researchers.
    


            They found Eos by searching for ultraviolet light emitted by hydrogen within the cloud, which is made of gas and dust clumps that collapse and trigger the birth of stars.
    


            Separately, a signal traced in 20-year-old telescope data could shed light on an unlikely celestial object that may be connected to the formation of gold across the universe.
    


            A new analysis of a fossil could upend what's known of the evolution of two of the most oddball creatures alive today: the echidna and the platypus.
    


            Both animals, known as monotremes, are the only mammals that lay eggs. The amphibious platypus spends much of its time in the water, while the echidna, often called a spiny anteater, is at home on land.
    


            A team of scientists now believe the only known fossil of a monotreme relative, named Kryoryctes cadburyi, may represent a common ancestor of both animals that lived more than 100 million years ago.
    


            Some of the fossil's features suggest monotremes might have evolved from living in the water to land — and could explain the bizarre, backward feet echidnas have today.
    


            When immunologist Jacob Glanville came across stories about Tim Friede, a California man who injected himself with deadly snake venom hundreds of times and gained immunity to several neurotoxins, he wanted to analyze Friede's blood.
    


            Now, the pair and a team of scientists have shared their latest research about an antivenom that can protect mice against the toxins of 19 species of poisonous snake. The antivenom is based on a venom-blocking drug, as well as antibodies in Friede's blood sample — and researchers hope to conduct human clinical trials with it one day.
    


            “However, we strongly discourage anyone from trying to do what Tim did. Snake venom is dangerous,” said Glanville, who is CEO of biotech company Centivax.
    


            A fresh fiery image is showcasing the sun's complexity like never before.
    


            The image, the first taken by the US National Science Foundation Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope's new Visible Tunable Filter, showcases a highly detailed and 3D view of the sun's roiling activity. The instrument is near the summit of Maui's Haleakalā volcanic mountain.
    


Continent-size sunspots appear to swirl near the heart of the sun's inner atmosphere in the close-up. The image was taken in December — shortly after scientists announced the sun is experiencing the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle — and it could help researchers gain new insights into solar weather and how it could impact our planet.
    


            Take a closer look:
    


            — Amazon launched the first batch of internet-beaming satellites for Project Kuiper, a plan to create a giant constellation that will compete with SpaceX's Starlink satellites, which already serve at least 4.6 million customers across the globe.
    


            — Archaeologists discovered the true identity of two shipwrecks in shallow waters off Cahuita National Park, on Costa Rica's southern Caribbean coast, that were long thought to be pirate ships.
    


            — Perhaps a toadstool house isn't just a fairy tale. Researchers in Montana grew a framework for a living, self-repairing building material from mycelium, or the rootlike structures that connect fungal networks, and it could eventually be used to build homes in the future.
    


            And before you go, look up for this weekend's celestial show. Here's how you can watch the peak of the Eta Aquariid meteor shower.

Follow:


            Like the other ceremonies and traditions that accompany the advent of a new pope, his newly chosen name will be imbued with centuries of Catholic history and dissected for its many layers of meaning.
    


            Changing his name is one of the first actions the new pope takes as head of the Roman Catholic Church and can play a hugely symbolic role in setting the tone for his pontificate.
    


            It is a precedent that was set in the early Middle Ages and, while there is no doctrinal reason for a pope to choose a new name, it has become part of the election process.
    


            So, how did this tradition come about, what are the meanings behind different papal names, what name could the next pope choose and how will it be announced?
    


            St. Peter, the first pope and one of the 12 apostles, was renamed from his birth name of Simon by Jesus, but this was before he became head of the church.
    


            Another 500 years would pass before Pope John II, who was head of the church from 533 to 535, started the papal tradition when he shed the name Mercurius, which he thought was too like the name of the pagan god Mercury.
    


            The next pope to change his name was Peter Canepanova in the 10th century, who became John XIV to avoid being called Peter II (more on that below), said Liam Temple, assistant professor in the history of Catholicism at the Centre for Catholic Studies at Durham University.
    


            After the 10th century, taking a different name became common practice for popes once they had been elected, as popes from countries such as France and Germany adopted more Italian-sounding names to mimic their predecessors.
    


            And that then became the custom, with only a handful of popes keeping their baptismal names since, including Marcellus II and Adrian VI, who both served as head of the church in the 16th century.
    


            Each name is steeped in its own history and connotations, linked to the achievements or failings of the previous popes or saints who carried it.
    


            “Linking to the names of previous popes who weathered crises, inspired reform, or were incredibly popular can often, although not always, play a role in the choosing of a name,”  Temple told CNN.
    


            For example, Pope Francis chose his papal name to honor St. Francis of Assisi, with his love for peace and nature, as well as his care for the poor and focus on cooperation between different sects of the church. These associations established the priorities for Francis' papacy.
    


            His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, chose his papal name to show his commitment to peace and reconciliation by honoring St. Benedict and Pope Benedict XV, who was head of the church during World War I, Temple said.
    


            One name that the new pope definitely won't adopt is Peter, out of respect for the first pope, St. Peter the Apostle – but also perhaps because of a centuries-old prophecy that Peter II will be the last pope to serve.
    


            There are other names that aren't necessarily off-limits but are less likely to be chosen because of their associations with the most recent pope who bore them, said Temple.
    


            He identifies the name Urban as an unlikely candidate for the new pope because it would “harken back to Urban VIII, who started the trial of Galileo Galilei, and would not sit well in modern debates about science, faith and religion.”
    


            In a similar vein, the name Pius would evoke memories of Pius XII, whose role during World War II has been increasingly criticized, Temple added.
    


            If the new pope wishes to continue on a reforming path, Temple said that names like Leo, referencing Leo XIII who was known for his dedication to social justice, fair wages and safe working conditions, or Innocent, referencing Innocent XIII who sought to root out corruption, might be appropriate choices.
    


            A new pope who is elected from the Global South, like Pope Francis, may also choose a name adopted by early non-Italian pontiffs such as Gelasius, Miltiades or Victor, who all hailed from the African continent, Temple added.
    


            Over the centuries, there have been 44 papal names used only once – most recently Pope Francis' own.
    


            His decision to choose  a unique name had “massive historical ramifications,” Temple said, for “it had been around 1,100 years since the last uniquely named pope in the form of Pope Lando, whose pontificate lasted less than a year in the 10th century.”
    


            John is the most popular name, with 21 popes choosing to adopt it – although, somewhat confusingly, the last pope to take that name was John XXIII, after historians accidentally misnumbered the popes after John XIV.
    


            Gregory and Benedict are also popular pontifical names with 16 and 15 uses, respectively, while Innocent and Leo come close behind with 13 uses each. (Benedict X was declared an antipope, and expelled from the papal throne, hence the discrepancy in numbering for subsequent Benedicts.)
    


            After white smoke has risen from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel and the bells of St. Peter's have rung, the newly elected pope's name will be conveyed to the world in a Latin pronouncement.
    


            The senior cardinal deacon will step onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, accompanied by two priests, and will deliver the iconic announcement: “Habemus Papam” (“We have a pope”).
    


            The new pope's name, as well as his baptismal names, will be translated into Latin in the announcement but his former surname will remain in his native language.
    


            For example, when Pope Francis was elected in 2013, his given names of “Jorge Mario” were delivered as “Giorgio Marium,” but his surname “Bergoglio” remained the same.
    


            His papal name was announced as “Franciscum” and was the last word of the proclamation, as is customary.

            The judge tasked with weighing in on the government's reach into higher education in Harvard University's recent lawsuit against the Trump administration is an experienced prosecutor and jurist with a history of taking on tough cases – including those involving both the Ivy League and the president.
    


            “95% of life is showing up,” US District Court Allison Dale Burroughs quipped Monday morning inside a Boston courtroom where she is overseeing Harvard's legal battle against the Trump administration over $2 billion in ﻿frozen federal funds.
    


            The hearing was supposed to be streamed on Zoom, but courthouse technology staff struggled to get it working. Burroughs sat for 15 minutes on the bench, noting “81 unhappy people” were waiting to get in. After the attorneys for each side said they were ready to proceed, she started the hearing sans-Zoom.
    


            Harvard has asked for an expedited final decision rather than an immediate order to restore the money, leaving $2 billion in federal grants and contracts the university says is critical to important research hanging in the balance. The university's lawyers specifically asked in a court filing that Burroughs be assigned to this case, citing her involvement in a related case over federal research funding brought by the Association of American Universities, which includes Harvard.
    


            Burroughs “is a brilliant jurist and I think she'll give everyone a fair shake,” Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard, told CNN on Monday.
    


            “It looks like the parties are trying to advance this case as quickly as possible,” Burroughs said Monday. At the 15-minute hearing, she scheduled oral arguments for July 21.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House, Burroughs and Harvard University for comment.
    


            Burroughs was working as a partner in Nutter McClennen & Fish LLP, a law firm co-founded by former Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, when President Barack Obama nominated her as a district court judge in the summer of 2014.
    


            Burroughs graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont before receiving her law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1988.
    


            She spent time in the early 1980s waitressing at a longtime pub on Capitol Hill and working as a congressional intern for Democratic Congressman Matthew McHugh, Burroughs told the Senate Judiciary Committee, before starting her law career clerking for Judge Norma Shapiro, the first female judge in the Third Circuit's Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
    


            She then spent about 17 years prosecuting criminal cases for the federal government as a US attorney in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, taking on emerging criminal gangs, drug offenders, economic crime and technology-focused cases.
    


            Donald Sterling, former US attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said hiring Burroughs as an assistant US attorney years ago was an easy decision. Even then, she was a star, he told CNN.
    


            “Allison was never shy about speaking her mind but usually did so with a sense of humor,” Sterling said, describing Burroughs as “hard working, balanced, smart and highly ethical.”
    


            “Allison was a no-nonsense prosecutor but always listened to what defense counsel had to say. When making a prosecution decision, she was guided wholly by the facts and the law,” he added.
    


            Obama said he was confident Burroughs would “serve the American people with integrity and a steadfast commitment to justice,” in a statement around the time of her nomination.
    


            As part of her confirmation process, the Senate Judiciary Committee asked Burroughs to list her 10 most significant cases. Among those she listed were one of the first cases in the nation tied to the Patriot Act – enacted after the September 11 terror attacks to broaden the government's surveillance powers; a complex offshore money laundering scheme; large-scale telemarketing fraud; an enforcer for a violent crack cocaine trafficking organization; and a Maine state trooper accused of stealing and selling championship baseball rings from Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams.
    


            “I am fully committed to putting aside any personal views that I might have and being fair to all who might appear before me,” Burroughs told the committee. “During my career I have litigated effectively on behalf of both the U.S. government and individual defendants.”
    


            She was sworn in as a US district judge for the District of Massachusetts in January 2015.
    


            This isn't Burroughs' first high-profile case involving Harvard University. As a federal judge in 2019, she upheld the Ivy League's admissions process in an affirmative action case – a decision the US Supreme Court later overturned.
    


            She ruled that while Harvard's admissions process was “not perfect,” she would not “dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster, solely because it could do better.”
    


            Race-conscious admissions hold “an important place in society and help ensure that colleges and universities can offer a diverse atmosphere that fosters learning, improves scholarship, and encourages mutual respect and understanding,” the judge said in her decision.
    


            The case prompted nationwide scrutiny of university admissions practices, and in 2023, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision saying universities could no longer take race into consideration in admissions decisions. The decision overturned long-standing precedent that has benefited Black and Latino students in higher education.
    


            As a federal district judge, Burroughs has put guardrails on the Trump administration before.
    


            As hordes of protesters descended on US airports where travelers were being detained under Trump's 2017 travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order blocking the removal of individuals from those countries. Boston Logan International Airport became a de facto shelter for many of those families.
    


            During the coronavirus pandemic, Burroughs oversaw a case brought by Harvard and MIT against the Trump administration, which insisted international students at schools offering online-only classes would need to leave the United States. The administration walked back that policy before a ruling was made.
    


            And two weeks ago, Burroughs issued another temporary restraining order blocking Department of Energy cuts to federal research funding in the lawsuit brought by the Association of American Universities.

Follow:


            A failed interception of a missile fired from Yemen forced Israel to briefly shut down its main international airport on Sunday, exposing the country's vulnerabilities and the Houthi rebels' continued ability to strike distant targets despite a sustained US military campaign.
    


            Flights were halted at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv for about 30 minutes on Sunday morning after a missile landed in the airport's vicinity, following what the Israeli military said were “several attempts” at interception. “The results of the interception are under review,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
    


            The military fired its long-range Arrow interceptor at the incoming missile, an IDF spokesperson said. The US also has an advanced THAAD anti-missile system deployed in Israel.

Far from being cowed by US airstrikes, Yemen's Houthis may be relishing them



            The Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was carried out “in rejection of (Israel's) crime of genocide” against the people of Gaza.
    


            The strike appears to be the first time Israel's international airport has been successfully targeted by the group.
    


            “The American and Israeli defense systems failed to intercept the missile aimed at Ben Gurion Airport,” Yahya Saree, the group's spokesperson, said in a statement, adding that the airport was targeted with a “hypersonic ballistic missile.”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed further attacks against the Houthis.
    


            “We acted before, we will act in the future too. I can't elaborate all of that. The US, in coordination with us, is also operating against them. It's not ‘one and done' - but there will be hits,” he said in a video address posted on social media.
    


            In a post to X later, he also promised a response to Iran: “Israel will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters.”
    


            Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that the response would be “sevenfold.”
    


            Israel's security cabinet convened on Sunday afternoon to discuss the incident, according to an Israeli official.
    


            The incident marks a major security breach at one of the most heavily protected sites in the country, and is likely to raise questions about Israel's ability to intercept such attacks despite its vaunted missile defense system.
    


            Trains to and from the airport were also halted and police asked the public to refrain from arriving in the area.
    


            Pictures from the scene showed debris from the impact of the missile on the grounds of the airport, littering the road toward the main terminal. A video shared on social media appeared to show the impact of the missile at the airport and a cloud of black smoke rising from the strike.
    


            Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings suspend flights to and from Tel Aviv until after Tuesday, May 6, a Lufthansa Group spokesperson told CNN.
    


            Amir Bar Shalom, the military affairs analyst for Israel's Army Radio, said the missile showed both tremendous accuracy and the ability to penetrate Israel's air defenses.
    


            “They were very accurate, and to be very accurate if you're launching from 2,000 kilometers, it's impressive,” Bar Shalom told CNN. “And you have to take this threat seriously. We have to check whether it's our mistake or whether we have a new kind of threat here.”

Iran has a new hypersonic missile. Here's what that means for the Middle East



            Iran is developing long-range missiles capable of maneuvering to evade air defenses, Bar Shalom said, though it remains unclear whether such advanced technology has been transferred to the Houthis. He added that the military will analyze all of the aspects of the failed interception attempts, including when sensors detected the incoming projectile, which systems identified it, and how close interceptors came to the missile.
    


            “There are so many parameters that may be relevant to the result that have to be analyzed,” he said.
    


            The Palestinian militant group Hamas praised the attack, calling Yemen “the twin of Palestine, as it continues to defy the most brutal forces of oppression, refusing submission or defeat despite the aggression it faces.”
    


            Sunday's strike marks the third consecutive day of missile launches from Yemen toward Israel, according to the IDF.
    


            The Houthis claim their hypersonic missiles have stealth technology, a range of 2,150 kilometers (1,335 miles), high maneuverability and can travel up to speeds of Mach 16.
    


            Since Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza started in October 2023, the country has come under fire from missiles and rockets from Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, who claim to strike Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. Almost all of the projectiles have been intercepted by Israel's air defenses.
    


            But in December, a Houthi missile hit Israel's commercial capital Tel Aviv after a failed interception, leading to more than a dozen injuries. The Houthis said they fired a hypersonic ballistic missile labeled “Palestine 2” at an Israeli military target in the Jaffa area. And in July, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a deadly drone attack in Tel Aviv – the first such strike on the city by the group.

Who are the Houthis and why are they attacking ships in the Red Sea?



            Israel has launched several strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, including the targeting of a power plant and maritime ports in January.
    


            But the US military has carried out far more extensive strikes on targets in Yemen in recent weeks, aiming to weaken the group, whose attacks on Red Sea shipping have significantly disrupted global trade.
    


            The campaign is also aimed at stopping launches targeting Israel, as well as commercial and US Navy vessels operating in the Middle East. Early last month, the cost of US the effort had approached $1 billion in just three weeks, including the deployment of B-2 stealth bombers and the use of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of high-end munitions.
    


            But it has largely failed to disrupt the Houthis' ability to launch ballistic missiles against Israel. The country's vaunted missile defense system routinely intercepts the launches, but some have gotten through.

ATLANTA (AP) — The billionaire heir and the former bartender.

Many Democrats have been in and out of the spotlight as the party looks for effective counters to President Donald Trump and his second administration. But two disparate figures, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have seen their national profiles rise by delivering messages that excite a demoralized and fractured party. 

The governor, a 60-year-old heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, and the congresswoman, the 35-year-old with working-class roots, both won their first elections in 2018. Both have urged mass resistance and accused their party of not fighting more. Each has stood out enough to draw sharp retorts from Trump loyalists. 

But as messengers, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez could not be more different. And their arguments, despite some overlap, are distinct enough to raise familiar questions for Democrats: Should they make their challenges to Trump about threats to democracy and national stability, as Pritzker has done, or portray him as a corrupt billionaire exacerbating an uneven economy, as Ocasio-Cortez does? And beyond the message itself, what qualities should the best messenger have?

What links them, said one prominent Democrat, is “assertiveness.”

“People want Trump and Trumpism to be met with equal passion and force,” said National Urban League President Marc Morial, a former New Orleans mayor deeply connected in Democratic politics. On that front, he added, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez “are both effective national figures –- but in very different ways.”

Pritzker was born at the bridge of the baby boomers and Generation X into a sprawling family now entrenched in Democratic politics. Like Trump, he inherited great wealth, but he lambastes the president as a poser on working-class issues.

He chaired Illinois' Human Rights Commission before running for governor. In office, he has signed an Illinois minimum-wage increase and is an ally of unions. His family's hotels are unionized, making them regular options for official Democratic Party events. 

When Democratic President Joe Biden exited the 2024 campaign, Pritzker was floated as a replacement. He made no visible moves, quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris and acted as the de facto host of her nominating convention in his home state.

“Take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity,” Pritzker said in Chicago. 

Since Harris' defeat, Pritzker has behaved like a future candidate. One of the nation's highest-profile Jewish politicians, he fired up liberals by comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich. 

“If you think I'm overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,” the governor said his joint budget and State of the State address on Feb. 19. “All I'm saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.”

Addressing party faithful in the traditional early nominating state of New Hampshire, Pritzker bemoaned “do-nothing” Democrats, called for party honchos to set aside “decades of stale decorum” and urged voters into the streets.

“Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption, but I am now,” he said. Democrats, he added, “must castigate (Republicans) on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.”

It was enough for senior Trump aide Stephen Miller to accuse Pritzker of inciting violence. Pritzker wasted no time returning the volley, calling it “terrible hypocrisy” for Trump allies to complain given the Capitol siege on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump's pardons of the rioters. 

Ocasio-Cortez is a millennial progressive who earned degrees in international relations and economics and worked as a waiter and bartender before entering politics. With support from the progressive Working Families Party, she ousted a top House Democrat, Joe Crowley, in a 2018 primary. 

Like Trump, she leverages millions of social media followers. Also like Trump, she is an economic populist. But she comes from the left wing of U.S. politics and without the anti-immigration and cultural conservatism of Trump's right wing or the alliances with billionaire business and tech elites. 

She has recently headlined “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a two-time presidential candidate. The tour has drawn tens of thousands of people across the country, notably including reliably Republican states, often with overflow crowds outside many stops. 

Ocasio-Cortez's next political move seems less certain than Pritzker's. She is seen as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, and she only recently became old enough to be constitutionally eligible for the presidency. But she appears poised to inherit the mantle of the 83-year-old Sanders' movement.

She freely criticizes Trump. But she leans more heavily into broader economic and social critiques that she's made since her first House bid and that Sanders has offered for decades. 

“For years we have known that our political system has slowly but surely become dominated by big money and billionaires and time after time we have seen how our government and laws are more responsive to corporations and lobbyists than everyday people and voters,” she said in Folsom, California. She advocated for “living wages … stable housing … guaranteed health care,” and blasted “the agenda of dark money to keep our wages low and to loot our public goods like Social Security and Medicare.”

She also played up her roots: “From the waitress who is now speaking to you today, I can tell you: impossible is nothing.”

Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker are allied against a common opponent, Trump, and not each other. Advisers to Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker did not respond to questions.

Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, argues Pritzker could be more attractive as a “traitor to his class” in the tradition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. An East Coast patrician, Roosevelt authored the New Deal's federal expansion to combat the Great Depression of the 1930s.

“How powerful would it be if a billionaire was the one helping to lead the charge against corrupt billionaires and corrupt billionaire corporations that are trying to crack the Constitution and loot the American people?” Green said, adding that “continued silence” on “billionaire issues” should disqualify Pritzker. “We have to be speaking to the shake-up-the-system vibe that people want to see.”

Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, which typically backs centrist Democrats, countered that Pritzker could bring a “more stable” version of Trump's argument that his wealth and success is an asset. Trump's biggest liability, Bennett said, is “chaos” that negatively affects people's lives.

“People are very mad at Elon Musk, but not because he's rich,” Bennett said of the Tesla CEO who is leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. “They're mad at him because he's vandalizing our government and doing it in a destructive way.”

A relative of the governor, Rachel Pritzker, chairs Third Way's board of trustees.

Ocasio-Cortez is often criticized by more moderate Democrats, including Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who has also positioned herself as a thought leader in the party. Slotkin recently suggested the word “oligarchy” didn't resonate with working-class voters. It was an implicit rebuke of the Ocasio-Cortez-Sanders' tour. 

Shortly after Slotkin's comments about oligarchy, Ocasio-Cortez posted on X: “Plenty of politicians on both sides of the aisle feel threatened by rising class consciousness.” 

Bennett said Democrats who emerge as party leaders, including the 2028 nominee, will be those who offer solutions for voters' frustration “over their needs not being met.” It's a notion that Green insisted is indistinguishable from criticizing the billionaire class, along with the tax and labor policies that drive wealth and income gaps in the U.S. 

Whatever direction Democrats choose, Bennett said, Ocasio-Cortez has secured her place as a national voice.

“She's very good at what she does. She's formidable,” he said. “And anybody on the center-left who denies that is just kidding themselves.”

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump proposed sending American troops into Mexico to help her administration fight drug trafficking but that she rejected it. 

Her remarks to supporters in eastern Mexico came in response to a Wall Street Journal article published the day before, describing a tense phone call last month in which Trump reportedly pressured her to accept a bigger role for the U.S. military in combating drug cartels in Mexico. 

“He said, ‘How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you.' And you know what I said to him? ‘No, President Trump.'” 

She added: “Sovereignty is not for sale. Sovereignty is loved and defended.” 

White House National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt said in a statement later Saturday that Trump has worked closely with Mexico's president “to achieve the most secure southwest border in history.”

“Dangerous Foreign Terrorist Organizations, however, continue to threaten our shared security and the drugs and crime they spread threaten American communities across the country,” the statement said. “The President has been crystal clear that Mexico must do more do combat these gangs and cartels and the United States stands ready to assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries.”

The U.S. military presence has increased steadily along its southern border with Mexico in recent months, following Trump's order in January to increase the army's role in stemming the flow of migrants.




The U.S. Northern Command has surged troops and equipment to the border, increased manned surveillance flights to monitor fentanyl trafficking along the border and sought expanded authority for U.S. Special Forces to work closely with Mexican forces conducting operations against cartels.

Trump designated many of the gangs and cartels smuggling drugs into the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations on Feb. 19, restricting their movements and lending law enforcement more resources to act against them.

But Sheinbaum's hardline stance Saturday signaled that U.S. pressure for unilateral military intervention would put her and Trump on a collision course after months of cooperation on immigration and trade. 

“We can work together, but you in your territory and us in ours,” Sheinbaum said.

THANE, India (AP) — It's early morning at a traffic intersection in Thane, a city on the outskirts of Mumbai, the bustling financial capital of India that's home to more than 20 million people. The roads are already crowded with commuters, while engines and horns fill the air with noise that's amplified by the highway overhead.

About a dozen young children are forming little splashes of color on the gray tarmac as they cross a busy road helped by two men. They are arriving to attend an innovative school operated by the NGO Samarth Bharat Vyaspeeth, using shipping containers under the highway as classrooms.

Children will bathe, change into a uniform, and have their morning meal of tea and porridge before filing into air-conditioned shipping containers for lessons. They learn to read and write in the local Marathi language and English; practicing using computers; and conduct simple experiments in a science lab. In between lessons, they play soccer and traditional sports like kabaddi.

The school is a day-time sanctuary, promising some of the city's poorest children a safe environment and three nutritious meals. In the evening they will return to homes on the fringes of the metropolis, many improvised from scavenged corrugated iron sheets, plywood boards and tarpaulins.

“If I had not been to school, I would have been married by now, or just wandering around. I want to become a doctor or a nurse.”Sonali Gautam Gayakwad, 14.



“Teacher teaches me how to draw in school. I want to be a painter.”Vaishali Ramesh Pawar, 10.



“If I hadn't come to this school, I would have also become a ragpicker and collected garbage from the streets.”Harshida Pradeep Kudya, 12.



“I don't know what I would be doing if I had not joined this school. I want to start a beauty parlour in the future”Neelam Krishan, 11.



Vaishali Pawar, 10, and her two siblings attend Signal Shala, named after its location near a traffic signal.




“My elder brother has never been to school and is an auto driver. One sister has got married but I want to become an artist,” says Pawar.

Her parents were reluctant to send the children but were talked into it by the school.

Since 2016, the school is preparing children like Vaishali to appear for formal examinations conducted by the state education board. According to its webpage there are 57 students enrolled in the school which strives “to bring such children into the mainstream of society by addressing not only their educational needs but also their health and emotional well-being.”

Sonali Gautam Gayakwad, 14, says that If she had not joined the school, she would have been married off by now.

House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes, D-Conn., joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss Mike Waltz's move from National Security advisor to U.N. ambassador, President Donald Trump working to end the war in Ukraine and border security. 

The U.S. could withdraw from peace talks with Ukraine and Russia if the two sides can't make progress toward ending their three-year war, President Donald Trump said.

Trump made the comments during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that aired Sunday, telling host Kristen Welker that there is ""tremendous hatred"" between Ukraine and Russia.

The president says he remains hopeful a peace deal is possible, but confirmed that the U.S. would not remain a mediator indefinitely.

""I do believe we're closer with one party. And maybe not as close with the other, but we'll have to see,"" Trump said. ""Five thousand soldiers a week on average, are dying. They're not American soldiers. But I want to solve the problem.""

""How long do you give both countries before you're going to walk away?"" Welker asked.

""Well, there will be a time when I will say, okay, keep going, keep being stupid,"" Trump replied.

""Maybe it's not possible to do,"" he added. ""There's tremendous hatred. Just so you understand, Kristen, we're talking tremendous hatred between these two men and between, you know, some of the soldiers, frankly, between the generals, they've been fighting hard for three years. I think we have a very good chance of doing it.""

The interview comes just days after Trump blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioning whether his Russian counterpart has any interest in peace.

TRUMP INSISTS UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE DEAL IS CLOSE, BUT MISTRUST IN PUTIN LEAVES EXPERTS SKEPTICAL

Trump spoke up on social media last week after Russian forces launched missiles into Ukrainian cities.

""There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,"" Trump wrote. ""It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking' or ‘Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also appeared to temper expectations for a major peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia last week.

Rubio argued it was ""silly"" to put a specific date or timeline on when the U.S. might pull out from mediation, but he said this will be ""a very critical week.""

A college admissions worker in Boston was arrested Friday after he was accused of offering $400 to a 17-year-old prospective student in exchange for sex, federal officials said.

Jacob Henriques, 29, used his position as an assistant admissions director at Emmanuel College to gain access to the personal information of at least four potential students before contacting them, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts alleged.

Henriques met with at least three such students on April 25. He is accused of contacting them afterward with offers to ""pay them for some fun,"" along with offering them and sending them pornography, officials said.

Henriques contacted a fourth victim after she formally committed to attending the school on April 25, the attorney's office said. He allegedly offered to pay her for ""some fun"" before sending her pornographic videos.

Henriques contacted one prospective student, a 17-year-old high school girl, within hours of finishing a tour of the college on or about April 25, federal officials said. 

Henriques allegedly used the phone number the girl provided on her admissions form to text her with offers to pay her $400 for ""some fun"" and said he could send her pornography. 

The 29-year-old continued to text the girl that night, refusing to identify himself or tell her how he obtained her phone number, according to officials.

After Henriques allegedly sent the 17-year-old five pornographic videos, prosecutors said he asked if she wanted to participate in a ""gangbang"" and if she wanted to have sex with him.

Despite the girl rejecting Henriques multiple times, he continued to text her, saying he ""would buy her anything she wanted"" if she changed her mind, the attorney's office said.

Between April 25 and April 28, Henriques allegedly accessed the girl's profile 47 times. After she blocked his number, Henriques started emailing her, federal officials said.

Henriques was charged with one count of attempted sex trafficking of a minor. 

An Emmanuel College spokesperson told WBZ-TV that Henriques has since been fired after an internal investigation.

""[We are] saddened, angered, and shocked by these serious federal allegations that have been brought against a former employee,"" the spokesperson said. ""They are an affront to our core values, and we stand with any victimized by this incident.""

Henriques is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Boston on Monday. He faces up to life in prison if found guilty.

""MobLand"" stars Tom Hardy and Paddy Considine tell Fox News Digital what it was like working with Pierce Brosnan and Helen Mirren on the show.

Tom Hardy's road to stardom hasn't always been easy. From battling addiction to navigating on-set feuds, the 47-year-old British actor, best known for roles in TV and film projects such as ""Peaky Blinders,"" ""Venom,"" ""Inception"" and ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" has proven he has what it takes to overcome adversity and become one of Hollywood's leading men. 

From an early age, Hardy, who stars alongside Pierce Brosnan and Helen Mirren in the Paramount+ series ""MobLand,"" faced a wave of challenges. 

As a young teen, the London native found himself often at odds with the law and quickly developed an addiction to alcohol and crack.

""What I have is indiscriminate, like a bullet. If you are an alcoholic, that is what you are,"" Hardy told The Mirror in 2014. ""If I had four pints of lager and half a bottle of vodka, I could turn this room into an absolute f---ing nightmare in about three minutes. I could destroy everything in my life I have worked so hard for.""

Hardy, who made his big-screen debut in 2001 with his role in ""Black Hawk Down,"" checked himself into a rehab center after wrapping ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" in 2002. 

""I didn't want anyone to know I was out of control, but I couldn't hide it,"" he told The Mirror.  ""I went in thinking I'd do it for a little bit until I can go out and drink and people forgive me. But I did my 28 days, and after listening to people who had been through similar circumstances, I realized I did have a problem.

""I did something particularly heinous that allowed me to wake up,"" added Hardy, whose rock-bottom included waking up in a pool of his own blood and vomit. ""I had to lose something. Sometimes you have to lose something that is worth more to you than your drinking.""

Despite the challenging road ahead, Hardy, a father of three, said he found a way to use his troubling past as a stepping stone in his career. 

While discussing his role in the 2011 film ""Warrior,"" in which he plays the son of an alcoholic former boxer, Hardy said his experiences helped with character development. 

""In the [alcohol abuse] scenes with Nick Nolte, if you've been to those depths, experience allows you to think ‘this is right' or ‘this is wrong' and know how to react,"" Hardy, sober since 2003, told ShortList at the time. 

""There's only so much imagination you can use before you have to go out and live life again. You see these kid actors who work from 10 to 21 and then, all of a sudden, they disappear for a bit. They've got nothing to draw upon apart from a life of working, so you need to go out and catch up and then come back in again.""

Hardy's past is what pushed him to pursue acting in the first place.

""In the end, there was nothing else I could do. I had a busy head, and I didn't really want to do things that I found boring,"" he told The ShortList in 2011. ""The only thing that kept my attention was to play and have fun and manipulate. I've always been a liar, always been able to manipulate. I pretty much get whatever I want.

""Acting really is a mixture of bulls---ng and manipulating and the study of action-reaction,"" he added. ""And camouflage — hiding yourself in other languages, bodies and shapes. Acting channeled me into something. I found some self-esteem and thought, ‘I'm actually quite good at something.'""

And he enjoys playing the villain. 

""I play a lot of scary blokes, and there are probably a few reasons why,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter in 2017. ""First, villains are much more interesting than hero leads, who are, for the most part, really boring. The thought of going into work day in and day out to play someone who is just mind-numbingly boring fills me with dread, so I don't bother.

""Another part of it is when I was younger I remember being frightened a lot, of being small and skinny and vulnerable and feeling that I could have been preyed upon easily. So, everything that I play is what scared me.""

Throughout his run in Hollywood, however, Hardy has gotten some press for being difficult on set. 

According to ""Blood, Sweat & Chrome,"" a book that sheds light on ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" Hardy once sent co-star Charlize Theron into a rage after showing up late to set. 

Camera operator Mark Goellnicht alleges in the book that Hardy ""was notorious for never being on time in the morning. If the call time was in the morning, forget it. He didn't show up.""

After arriving three hours late to set, Theron allegedly ripped into Hardy at the time, calling him ""disrespectful.""

""She jumps out of the War Rig, and she starts swearing her head off at him, saying, ‘Fine the f--king c--- $100,00 for every minute that he's held up this crew,' and ‘How disrespectful you are!'"" Goellnicht claimed. ""She was right. Full rant. She screams it out. It's so loud, it's so windy — he might've heard some of it, but he charged up to her and went, ‘What did you say to me?' [Hardy] was quite aggressive. She really felt threatened, and that was the turning point.""

""It was like two parents in the front of the car. We were either fighting or we were icing each other — I don't know which one is worse — and they had to deal with it in the back,"" Theron explained in an excerpt, according to Vanity Fair. ""It was horrible. We should not have done that; we should have been better. I can own up to that.""

""In hindsight, I was in over my head in many ways,"" Hardy told Esquire in 2020 about the confrontation. ""The pressure on both of us was overwhelming at times. What she needed was a better, perhaps more experienced partner in me. … I'd like to think that now that I'm older and uglier, I could rise to that occasion.""

Hardy once told THR he's fully aware of the rep he's earned.

""There's this myth, which is quite asinine, that circulates about me — usually by those who haven't worked with me,"" he told THR. ""There's only one thing worse than being talked about and that's not being talked about in this game. So, I'd rather it be that, I guess. But there are other people who I work with consistently who know that's not the case, who just wouldn't risk having somebody like that in their midst because there's too much at stake. Obviously, you're going to rub people the wrong way … and I've been a d---. But then, who hasn't?""

These days, Hardy's most important role is being a dad to his three children — Louis, 17, whom he shares with ex-girlfriend and casting director Rachael Speed, and his two children he shares with wife Charlotte Riley. 

""There is no harder and more important job on the planet than parenting,"" he told Esquire in 2018. ""You've got the military, police, doctors, service personnel — massive respect, huge consequences — but parenting? It's beyond a job, isn't it.

""In trying to protect my children, I'll probably give them their own dose of problems,"" he said. ""But I don't want them to go through what I went through.""

British counterterrorism officers arrested several Iranian men over an alleged plan to attack an undisclosed location in London, the London Metropolitan Police announced Sunday.

Five men between the ages of 29 and 46 were taken into custody on Saturday in various parts of England on suspicion of preparing a terrorist act.

Four of the men are Iranian citizens, while investigators are still working to determine the nationality of the fifth.

In a separate investigation, three other Iranian men, aged 39, 44 and 55, were arrested in London on suspicion of a national security offense.

All the suspects are being questioned at police stations but have not yet been charged. Police are searching several properties in London, Manchester in northwest England and Swindon in western England.

Police said the attack plot targeted a single location, which the agency said is not being revealed ""for operational reasons.""

Commander Dominic Murphy, who leads the police force's Counter Terrorism Command, said investigators are still working to establish a motive ""as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public.""

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the arrests were ""serious events that demonstrate the ongoing requirement to adapt our response to national security threats.""

""The government continues to work with police and intelligence agencies to support all the action and security assessments that are needed to keep the country safe,"" she said.

In October, the head of Britain's MI5 domestic security service, Ken McCallum, said his agents and police have identified 20 ""potentially lethal"" plots backed by Iran since 2022, with most targeting Iranians in the U.K. who oppose the country's authorities.

McCallum said at the time there was the risk ""of an increase in, or broadening of, Iranian state aggression in the U.K."" if conflicts in the Middle East intensified.

The U.K.'s official terror threat level stands at ""substantial,"" which falls in the middle of a five-point scale, meaning an attack is likely.

Buck Wehrbein, NCBA President and rancher, sounds the alarm on the return of the screwworm and urges action from Mexico while crediting strong pressure from the Trump administration and Secretary Rollins for recent progress.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum publicly confirmed she rejected U.S. military assistance from President Donald Trump, who was looking to help the country fight drug trafficking and violent cartels.

Responding to a Wall Street Journal report Friday that detailed the offer, Sheinbaum confirmed ""it's true.""

Trump reportedly called Sheinbaum and asked, ""How can we help you fight drug trafficking?""

She told Trump the country will ""never accept"" the presence of the U.S. Army in its territory.

""No, President Trump, our territory is inalienable, sovereignty is inalienable,"" Sheinbaum said. ""We can collaborate. We can work together, but with you in your territory and us in ours. We can share information, but we will never accept the presence of the United States Army on our territory.""

SINALOA CARTEL TAKES ROOT IN AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS: WHERE ARE THEY?

In a written statement to Fox News Digital Saturday, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly highlighted coordinated efforts with Mexico to address border security.

""President Trump has worked with President Sheinbaum to advance border security collaboration with Mexico to the highest levels ever,"" Kelly wrote. ""This robust cooperation and information sharing is delivering tangible results, including the removal of numerous cartel leaders to the U.S. to face justice and creating the most secure border in history.""

Since taking office, Trump has continued to use CIA drones to conduct surveillance flights over the country in coordination with the Mexican government.

He has also formally named drug cartels ""foreign terrorist"" groups.

However, Kelly said Mexico must do more to protect Americans from dangerous foreign terrorist organizations and ""the drugs and violence they flood into communities on both sides of the border.""

""We will continue exploring ways to enhance our efforts across the region to dismantle these transnational criminal organizations,"" she wrote. ""We will make America safe again.""

The Heritage Foundation, a top conservative group, released a report in January detailing how Trump could use the military to confront the border crisis.

It argued that Mexican cartels are continuing to grow, illegal immigration and narcotics smuggling have accelerated and U.S.-Mexico security cooperation has deteriorated.

However, the report noted direct military action against cartels should be a ""last resort,"" preferring joint military action with Mexican coordination, Fox News Digital previously reported.

""In the appropriate context, unilateral U.S. military action may be employed to disrupt cartel activity and prompt cooperation from a resistant Mexican government,"" the group wrote.

The foundation claimed Mexico was unlikely to change its stance when Sheinbaum was elected despite the escalating threat from cartels.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), a speculated 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, attracted both praise and backlash for appearing alongside President Donald Trump as he announced new federal funding for an Air National Guard base in Michigan.

Whitmer's physical embrace of Trump, accepting a hug from him upon his arrival at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township on Tuesday before his first 100 days rally in Detroit, draws a stark contrast with other Democratic presidential contenders, including Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL), who told Democrats last weekend in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire that “Republicans cannot know a moment of peace.”

LIST: THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT

Whitmer's and Pritzker's different approaches to Trump and Republicans underscore the disagreement among Democrats about how to deal with the president, considering the GOP's popular vote win in last year's election. However, they are expressing more confidence now that the average presidential approval rating is 45% approve-52% disapprove, at least according to RealClearPolitics.

Whitmer and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) are examples of 2028 Democrats who are trying to portray themselves as centrist Democrats, a particularly striking moderation for Newsom thanks to his new podcast, featuring Republicans such as former White House chief political strategist and MAGA whisperer Steve Bannon and Turning Point USA founder and president Charlie Kirk.

“Gov. Whitmer's moderation is a hell of a lot more authentic than whatever Newsom is doing,” Democratic strategist Jim Manley told the Washington Examiner. “I would like to know what highly paid political consultant advised him to set up that podcast — 'cause he or she needs to be fired. Platforming Steve Bannon is not a good way to get ahead, given the current state of the country.”

Whitmer has defended her appearance with Trump, adamant that “it doesn't mean I've abandoned any of my values” or that “I'm not going to stand my ground.”

“This is one of those moments where, as a public servant, you're reminded your job is to put service above self, and that's what it was all about,” Whitmer told Pod Save America this week.

But the delicacy of the balance she is trying to strike was on display last month when she was photographed in the White House's Oval Office after a meeting with Trump regarding federal funding to help Michigan recover from an ice storm that struck in March. She was caught attempting to hide from photographers by holding a folder up to her face.

“There are two possible journeys of upwardly mobile party politicians: Court the base by pointing the political compass in one direction or expand the base by encompassing many more points of view,” Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos told the Washington Examiner. “For Democrats, we see both approaches via the words and actions of J.B. Pritzker and Gretchen Whitmer.”

Presidential candidates too far left on the political spectrum abandon independent voters to win their party's nomination and often are doomed to fail because they find themselves too far from the center, Paleologos said.

“Candidates who moderate rarely win a party nomination because independents usually skip voting in primaries,” the pollster said. “To be successful, presidential hopefuls need to cover terrain from both journeys, veering enough to the left initially to secure a plurality party nomination, followed by the gentle tacking back to the center in order to collect swing voters who may feel alienated by Trump.”

“In short,” he added, “our political party system is designed to reward two-faced politicians who promise party extremists one thing and promise moderates another, all within a matter of weeks.”

Democratic strategist Christopher Hahn provided another perspective, contending that “voters want politicians to find common ground when they can and push back on each other when they must.”

“Her interaction with Trump may be viewed as political malpractice by some in the same way Chris Christie was demonized by Republicans for hugging Obama, but I suggest in both instances they were putting their governing responsibilities first,” Hahn told the Washington Examiner.

Joanne Carducci, a liberal political commentator with a large social media following, known as JoJoFromJerz, blasted the moment of affection on X. “Gretchen Whitmer what the actual f***?!? A hug?!?”

Gov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) similarly stood up for Whitmer, unsurprisingly, as a fellow governor with presidential aspirations whose state has experienced multiple natural disasters.

“As a governor, when any president of any party does something that helps your people, you ought to give them credit,” Beshear told Fox News. 

Aside from the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) in Congress, who have held rallies with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and found their voice on social media, respectively, it is Democratic governors who appear to be leading the charge against Trump during his second administration as they protest his agenda in court and the court of public opinion. 

“Governors have more levers to pull,” Democratic strategist Stefan Hankin told the Washington Examiner. “I mean, there's nothing Democrats can really do in Congress, or very little.”

To that end, after recent demonstrations that did not take place as early as they did during Trump's first administration and the president's poor polling, Democrats seem more emboldened to disagree with the commander in chief following Trump winning last year's election by 86 electoral votes and more than 2 million ballots.

Another Democratic strategist, who did not wish to be identified, relayed her relief that Democrats are “finally fighting back” after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was scrutinized for his decision to support a Republican-led federal funding bill to avoid a government shutdown in March. Many voters have become frustrated by what Pritzker last weekend described as “do-nothing Democrats” in the face of Trump's drastic reforms to domestic and foreign policy.

As Democrats find their way forward, be it Whitmer's or Pritzker's approach, Hankin encouraged his counterparts not to condemn their own — yet.

“Maybe she didn't need to hug him, but, you know, it's fine,” Hankin said of Whitmer and Trump. “Democrats have to give other Democrats kind of a bit of a break here in that everyone's figuring out different ways to deal with it, and eventually we'll figure out the best way, but attacking each other isn't super awesome.”

Meanwhile, Michigan Democrats have also reserved judgment concerning their governor, whose response to the Supreme Court‘s repeal of Roe v. Wade before the 2022 midterm elections salvaged her reputation, damaged during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically after her own husband defied her strict public health restrictions.

“I can't speak for the party and what [it] is exactly they want, however, I see Gov. Whitmer's action in approaching Donald Trump as a very pragmatic, needed action,” Sameh Elhady, vice chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party's Arab American caucus, told the Washington Examiner. “She has an obligation to take care of it, and she made her position clear before in his first term that she is against him, but now, in the interest of the people of her state, she needs to swallow her pride and work with him.”

TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS: WHERE THINGS STAND IN INITIAL MONTHS OF HIS SECOND TERM

Michigan Republican strategist Jamie Roe gave credit to Whitmer for being at the Trump event this week, calling the endeavor of getting a new fighter mission for the air base a decadeslong one, but he criticized Democrats who are afraid to be seen working with the president as “just ridiculous.”

“If working with a president on behalf of the state is a problem for the Democrat Party, it shows that Trump derangement syndrome is a terminal problem for their party,” Roe told the Washington Examiner.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Elon Musk's SpaceX has a company town in Texas after residents in the area voted to create the new municipality on Saturday. 

On May 3, voters approved a measure that allowed SpaceX to incorporate its South Texas rocket launch site as a new city called Starbase. The voters, mostly SpaceX employees who have moved out to the roughly 1.5 square mile area in Cameron County, approved the small city for Musk's company by 212 votes in favor to 6 against, according to the Cameron County Elections Department.

“Starbase, Texas Is now a real city!” Musk celebrated in a post to X.

TRACKING WHAT DOGE IS DOING ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

The news gives Musk greater control over the area where Space X launches its rockets, expanding the company's ability to control local planning, taxation, and other issues, such as extending housing and managing road closures during rocket launches. As a city, it could also potentially be handed powers to close a nearby beach and state park for launches. 

Earlier this year, Cameron County denied Space X's request to build more housing for its employees. As a company city, Starbase will now be able to approve construction projects itself, allowing up to approximately 3,000 employees who commute from nearby Brownsville to live where they work. 

Given its new designation as a Type C city, meaning the municipality must hold fewer than 5,000 people, Starbase will also hold the power to levy a property tax of up to 1.5% on residents, according to the Texas Municipal League.

On Saturday, voters also approved measures, electing senior SpaceX executive Bobby Peden as mayor and creating positions for two Starbase city commissioners. 

If passed, two bills running through the Texas state legislature would give Peden and his cohort the authority to close a local highway and limit access to the nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park, instead of being required to coordinate through Cameron County for approvals. 

During rocket launches and other company activities such as engine tests, access to those locations must be restricted or eliminated altogether. The two companion bills running through the legislature would shift authority over access away from Cameron County to the new city's mayor and city council, even though local officials, including Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino, Jr., have opposed such a measure. 

The United States has a long history of company towns. In the late 1880s, Pacific Lumber Co. developed a site in California for loggers and mill companies that lasted for over 100 years; in the early 1900s, Milton Hershey formed a company town that helped take his famous chocolate utopia to the masses. Other prominent examples include George Pullman's company town in Chicago that housed an estimated 12,000 railway workers and their families.  

However, the creation of Starbase highlights the shift away from industrial hubs toward the tech-based industry. And Musk's SpaceX is only one of multiple Big Tech companies in recent years that have looked to expand corporate power through the company-town model. 

MUSK GETS HIS TEXAS WISH. SPACEX LAUNCH SITE IS APPROVED AS THE NEW CITY OF STARBASE

Meta, Amazon, and Google are among other companies looking to set up company towns, according to Business Insider. 

“Faith in democracy is weak, and so you have this view of, ‘We can create an ideal city and ideal world,'” Grant Bollmer, a senior lecturer in digital media at the University of Queensland in Australia, said. “‘We can structure it according to the principles that are built into these technologies that we've created and the values that we've created.'”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump added yet another twist to the monthslong saga to fill the role of United Nations ambassador, forcing Republicans to relive the Signalgate controversy as they usher Mike Waltz's nomination through the Senate.

Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee, the panel weighing Waltz's nomination, are expected to heavily litigate his judgment after he mistakenly added the Atlantic‘s editor-in-chief to a Signal group chat detailing sensitive military plans.

Trump removed Waltz from his post as national security adviser on Thursday, which was viewed as a firing prompted by the controversy. However, the president simultaneously named Waltz ambassador to the U.N. Waltz's deputy, Alexon Wong, is also reportedly being removed.

The move capped off weeks of uncertainty and drama surrounding the ambassadorship, the only unfilled position of Trump's 22-member Cabinet. He previously nominated and then pulled Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) from consideration due to concerns over Republicans' slim House majority.

Stefanik has since returned to a post in House leadership as she eyes a run for governor of New York.

Waltz, a former House member, has enjoyed support from within the party, and on Thursday, Republicans suggested he would have no trouble filling the vacancy.

“I think most Republicans in the Senate know Mike and like him and have confidence in him,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), an adviser to GOP leadership and Foreign Relations Committee member, told the Washington Examiner. “Obviously, the president still has confidence in him in order to put him in this key role.”

However, Waltz's involvement in the Signal debacle, in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive information about impending strikes in Yemen, promises to bog the party down in negative confirmation hearing headlines.

News of Waltz's nomination caught Republican senators off guard as they departed the Capitol following the final Senate vote of the week on Thursday.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who was informed by reporters of the nomination, quipped that perhaps Stefanik should switch with Waltz and become national security adviser. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is temporarily filling the role.

“Poor Elise Stefanik,” Hawley said.

Cornyn said it was important to “get to the bottom” of the Signal security lapse, but he added that he prefers the Department of Defense's inspector general to continue handling the investigation.

Hawley also projected confidence in Waltz when asked about his prospects: “Unless there's something I'm really missing here, I think [Waltz] would be perfectly fine.”

Lawmakers are increasingly anxious to fill the U.N. post, which has been vacant for three months in Trump's second term. Senators on both sides of the aisle have, in recent days, felt a pressing need to confirm an ambassador as Trump clashes over trade and tries to broker an end to foreign conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war.

“Clearly, the sooner the better,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), another Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee. “The U.N. has a lot of challenges in terms of terrible policies that we see coming out of the U.N., and the sooner we have a strong leader … the better off America is going to be. And the world, frankly.”

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the top committee Democrat, described Trump's withdrawal of Stefanik as “unfortunate” because it was based on “political considerations, not on qualifications.”

“We really need to be pushing back against China and the Russian Security Council,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), another panel Democrat. “It's not good to have us not fully represented by a confirmed ambassador.”

Trump announced his intent to nominate Waltz for the U.N. post via his Truth Social platform. He praised Waltz's former military experience, time serving in the House, and short stint as national security adviser.

TRUMP MOVES EMBATTLED MIKE WALTZ FROM NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO UN

“From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,” Trump said. “I know he will do the same in his new role.”

Waltz responded on social media that he was “deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

It is crunch time on Capitol Hill for Republicans trying to finish President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” before they recess for August. If the final legislation is to be fiscally sound, it must slow the growth of federal spending. There is no way to do that without reforming Medicaid. Nowhere is the problem with Medicaid made clearer than in New York, where out-of-control spending now finances more than 620,000 home healthcare jobs, making it the most common profession in the state.

Social Security and Medicare make up larger components of federal spending, but Medicaid is growing far faster than either of those programs. The urgent problem is in the way Medicaid is administered and financed. 

Unlike Medicare, which is run by the federal government, Medicaid eligibility is set by the state, which also determines which benefits are covered. The federal government requires all states to cover certain vulnerable populations, such as children, pregnant women, the elderly, and the disabled, and to provide them with core benefits such as doctor services and hospital visits. However, states can use Medicaid to fund other populations, including able-bodied adults and poor families. They can also expand the benefits covered, and have in various places covered rehabilitation, dental care, and home health services.

Letting one set of people decide on what to spend but not obliging them to find the money is a recipe for abuse and ballooning bills. This is what has happened with Medicaid. States expand the Medicaid population and the services covered, but the federal government, which means all taxpayers, foot the bill. Bizarrely, the federal government actually pays states more to cover the non-vulnerable than they do to cover the vulnerable. In many communities, the state only gets a 50% reimbursement for covering children but a 90% reimbursement for covering a fully able adult.

States have no incentive to control spending or prevent fraud, which accounts for as much as 25% of all Medicaid payments.

In some states, Medicaid spending is so out of control that it pays for more “private” sector jobs than any other industry. In New York, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data, 623,000 people work as home health aides, mostly paid for through Medicaid. The next most popular profession in the state, retail sales, employs only 233,000 people. 

The surge in home health aides is not caused by a predominantly older population. There are 171 home health aides for every 1,000 New York residents over 65. The national average is 68, and in Florida, the number is 18.

States controlled by the Democratic Party bleed federal taxpayers in this way and others. California leads the league in taxing Medicaid providers, who bill the state government, which is then reimbursed for the cost of the taxes from the federal government. New York allows doctors who provide emergency services to Medicaid patients to be reimbursed at private insurance levels, often thousands of dollars higher than the standard Medicaid reimbursement rate for each procedure.

Fiscally responsible Republicans in the House want to end the grifting by Democratic states without harming Medicaid's core beneficiaries. As Trump said this week in Michigan, “We want to preserve Medicaid for the most vulnerable, for our kids, our pregnant women, the poor and disabled.”

DEMOCRATS HAVE A PATRIOTISM PROBLEM

That is the right message. Some proposals during reconciliation negotiations include equalizing the Medicaid reimbursement rates for each population. This would mean more money for pregnant women and children and less for able-bodied, working-age adults. Other ideas include capping federal funding per enrollee, eliminating reimbursements for illegal immigrants, and ending the provider-tax loophole.

If Republicans are unable to slow the growth of Medicaid, which is set to grow 25% over the next decade even under Republican reconciliation targets, the tax cuts will either fail to pass, or this Congress will become the most fiscally irresponsible ever.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The U.S. Threat Looming Over Canada","https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/05/canadians-fear-war-trump/682674/","Sun, 04 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The consequences if Trump followed through on his belligerent rhetoric about a “51st state” would be catastrophic.

The idea of a war between Canada and the United States was inconceivable even a few months ago. Most Americans still don't believe it's a possibility, or simply haven't noticed their president's occupationist rhetoric, or can't imagine a world in which a neighbor they have been at peace with for 150 years is suddenly an enemy. The very idea seems completely absurd.

But Canada does not have the luxury of dismissing White House rhetoric as trolling. Canadians are imagining the unimaginable because they have to.

Donald Trump's pointless and malicious trade war has been, by his own account, a prelude to softening up Canada economically so that it can be appropriated as the 51st state. He has brought up his plans for incorporating Canada into the union with Prime Ministers Justin Trudeau and Mark Carney in private calls. The definitive end of the status quo came with the president's casual comment that he would sell only deliberately downgraded F-47s to allies who purchased American military hardware, “because someday, maybe they're not our allies.” From that point on, spending on equipment from the American military-industrial complex is a form of national suicide for any country in the free world. Canada could no longer comfortably sit within the American military sphere.

In this stark moment, our nation has abruptly become an adversary of the most powerful country in the world.

An American military threat is Canada's worst nightmare. And Canada is unprepared precisely because it never considered the U.S. to be a potential threat. Trust made Canada vulnerable. For 60 years at least, both Conservative and Liberal governments have worked toward greater integration with the United States. Our country's trade and security policies have been built on the premise of American sanity. That assumption, it turned out, was a mistake, hopefully not a fatal one.

What would a continental conflict look like? Conventional war between the United States and Canada would be highly asymmetric, to say the least. The U.S. possesses an enormous military, comprising more than a million men and women under arms. Canada's armed forces have 72,000 active members. Even worse, because of its deep-seated trust in the United States, Canada has built its forces around interoperability with U.S. forces, both for mutual continental protection, in binational projects such as the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and for expeditionary forces such as the NATO mission to Afghanistan.

This vulnerability does not mean that Canada would be there for the taking. “The U.S. military does not have the capacity to seize the country,” Scott Clancy, who served as a Colorado-based director of operations for NORAD, told me recently. Clancy served 37 years in the Royal Canadian Air Force and rose to the rank of major-general, and is intimately familiar with U.S. and Canadian military capabilities. “They would have to seize specific points. And the more they went into cities, the more it would become unmanageable from an American military point of view.” A continental war would, then, likely play out as an insurgent conflict in Canadian North America—and across the U.S. homeland, as well. “Let's say they just hold the oil fields,” Clancy said, referring to a U.S. military occupation of Canadian oil reserves. “We're not gonna roll over. And just because you attacked Alberta doesn't mean that we're not gonna strike at you in New York.”

Read: The Liberals who can't stop winning

When I interviewed half a dozen experts on insurgent conflict for my book The Next Civil War, they all agreed that insurgent conflict was the least predictable and containable. Aisha Ahmad, a political-science professor at the University of Toronto, told me she does not think Canada's reputation for gentleness would make it any less brutal as an opponent. “There's no such thing as a warrior race,” said Ahmad, who is an expert on insurgency who has conducted field work in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Lebanon, Mali, and Kenya. “Nobody is born an insurgent. Insurgency is what happens when someone kills your mom.” Just one soldier firing on a protester at a rally could be the spark. “All of these cute, latte-drinking TikToker students,” she said. “You look at them and you don't see insurgents. But if you kill their moms, the Geneva Convention will not save you.”

An occupying military force has three strategies for dealing with insurgent conflicts, none of which work. The first we could call “Groznification”: complete suppression, as the Russian army did in Chechnya at the turn of the century. Even the destruction of any means of resistance works only temporarily, as Colonel Gaddafi learned in Libya. “Hearts and minds,” the strategy applied in Iraq and Afghanistan, is also ineffective: If you build hospitals and then fill them with corpses, you just generate more insurgents. The third option is “decapitation,” but the systematic targeting of insurgent networks' leaders—the idea behind the recent U.S. air strikes on the Houthis in Yemen—can easily be countered by detailed succession plans. And killing leadership has the unintended consequence of fragmenting the insurgency's power structures, so that, if you ever do want to negotiate a peaceful settlement, you have dozens of mini-insurgencies to deal with, rather than a single contained force.

The Canadian population would present particular challenges to any counterinsurgency strategy. “The Taliban would look lightweight,” Ahmad told me. “Canada has all of the attributes to have an even fiercer insurgency than the other places in the world where I study these problems.” Canada has the most educated population in the Group of Seven advanced industrial nations, which for a resistance movement would be “an asset in being able to identify pressure points, in being able to know what critical infrastructure is, in being able to develop technology and weapons that can be highly disruptive,” Ahmad said. “The scale and the capacity would be so much higher.” If only one in 100 Canadians took up arms against an American occupation, that force would be 10 times the estimated size of the Taliban at the outset of the Afghan War. And that force would consist of machine-learning specialists and petroleum engineers rather than shepherds and subsistence farmers.

Canadians are already a well-armed population. More than a quarter of Canadian households own a gun. Consider, also, the Canadian landscape, which is vast beyond imagination and would provide ideal cover for insurgents. To give you an idea of that wilderness, Manitoba alone, one of 10 Canadian provinces, has some 90,000 unnamed lakes—even Canadians can't keep track of their territory.

In short, a continental conflict would be an unmitigated act of murderous folly. But murderous folly is not beyond the capacity of this new iteration of the United States.

David Frum: How the U.S. lost the Canadian election

Already, the once-unthinkable idea of a war between Canada and the United States is growing less unthinkable. Before the 2024 U.S. election, 12 percent of Republicans viewed Canadians as “unfriendly” or “an enemy.” Now that number is 27 percent. Persuading the military to carry out an attack on Canada would probably be more difficult than convincing the population to support such an attack. The American officer class is trained, from the beginning, in “the duty not to follow orders,” and combat operations against Canada would involve fighting against fellow soldiers who shed blood beside them in Afghanistan and other theaters. Canadian and American soldiers have attended a great number of one another's funerals.

But turning the U.S. military is far from impossible. The Trump administration fired the commander of a Space Force base in Greenland the moment she expressed a position wavering from his annexationist aims there. The Naval Academy has already purged its library and canceled various speakers. At least some of the U.S. military's leaders are on board with the ideological purification of their institutions.

The conditions required for the occupation of Canada would also mean the end of American democracy. That, too, is not an impossible outcome—and a U.S. military adventure might even have both objectives in view. “The orchestration of a security crisis allows the incumbent government to declare emergency powers and bypass ordinary politics,” Ahmad said. “The Trump administration has already signaled that it wants a third term.” The 2028 election will be a watershed. If Trump decides to run again, a manufactured emergency over Canada would be a convenient excuse for overturning the constitutional barriers.

Nobody wants to believe that a continental conflict could happen. Very few Ukrainians, right up until the point of Russia's 2022 invasion, believed that their malignant neighbor would invade. Canadians cannot afford complacency.

Reflecting on U.S.-Canadian relations in happier times, President John F. Kennedy said: “Geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has made us allies. Those whom nature hath so joined together, let no man put asunder.” Now, and for the foreseeable future, Trump has sundered us. And yet, even so, our fates remain entwined. The end of America would destroy Canada. The occupation of Canada would destroy America.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Destruction of the Department of Justice","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/trump-destroying-doj/682681/","Sun, 04 May 2025 11:53:04 GMT","

When people at the department embrace Trump's scorn for the law, the law, as a practical limitation on government action, ceases to exist.

When Thomas Paine asked what made America different from England, he had a ready answer: “In America, the law is king.” America has not always upheld that ideal, but, taking the long view, it has made great progress toward that principle. In recent decades, the Department of Justice has become an institutional embodiment of these aspirations—the locus in the federal government for professional, apolitical enforcement of the law, which is in itself a rejection of the kingly prerogative. That is why Donald Trump's debasement of the DOJ is far more than the mere degradation of a governmental agency; it is an assault on the rule of law.

His attack on the institution is threefold: He is using the mechanisms of justice to go after political opponents; he is using those same mechanisms to reward allies; and he is eliminating internal opposition within the department. Each incident making up this pattern is appalling; together, they amount to the decimation of a crucial institution.



Investigations should be based on facts and the law, not politics. Yet Trump has made punishing political opposition the hallmark of his investigative efforts. The DOJ's independence from political influence, long a symbol of its probity (remember how scandalous it was that Bill Clinton had a brief meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch?), is now nonexistent.

This development should frighten all citizens, no matter what their political persuasion. As Attorney General Robert Jackson warned in 1940, the ability of a prosecutor to pick “some person whom he dislikes and desires to embarrass, or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, [is where] the greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies.” Choosing targets in this way flies in the face of the DOJ's rules and traditions—to say nothing of the actual, grave harm it can inflict on people.

Read: The Supreme Court has no army

Far from eschewing the possibility of abuse, Trump and his allies at the Department of Justice positively revel in it. The most egregious example was Trump's recent issuance of an executive order directing the government to investigate the activities of two of his own employees in the first administration, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor, who later came to be political opponents of his. (Both men are friends and colleagues of mine.)

Their offense of perceived disloyalty is perhaps the gravest sin in Trump world, and as a result, they will now be individually targeted for investigation. The personal impact on each of them is no doubt immediate and severe. Krebs, who is a well-respected cybersecurity leader, has quit his job at SentinelOne and plans to focus on his defense. If Trump's DOJ pursues this investigation to the limit, the two men could face imprisonment.

The cases of Krebs and Taylor do not stand in isolation. Recently, the U.S. attorney in New Jersey (Trump's former personal attorney Alina Habba) launched an investigation into the state of New Jersey for its alleged “obstruction” of Trump's deportation agenda. In other words, because New Jersey won't let its own employees be drafted as servants of Trump's policy, the state becomes a pariah in Trump's mind, one that must be coerced into obedience.

Meanwhile, Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced that the U.S. government is suing Maine because of the state's refusal to ban transgender athletes from playing on girls' high-school sports teams. Not content with threatening Maine, Bondi has also announced an investigation of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Office because of its alleged opposition to the Second Amendment and its “lengthy” process for approval of gun permits. And she recently announced that she would target leakers of classified information by going after journalists, rescinding a policy that protected journalists from being subpoenaed to assist government-leak investigations.

But the most aggressive abuser of the criminal-justice system has to be the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin. Martin has asked the FBI to investigate several of President Joe Biden's EPA grantees for alleged fraud—a claim so weak that one of Martin's senior subordinates resigned rather than have to advance it in court. He has also begun to investigate, or threatened investigations of, Georgetown University, Senator Charles Schumer, and Representatives Eugene Vindman and Robert Garcia, among others. More recently, in mid-April, Martin sent a series of inquiry letters to at least three medical and scientific journals, asking them how they ensured “competing viewpoints,” with the evident intention of suggesting that the failure to include certain minority opinions was, in some way, content discrimination.

A less-well-known example of Martin's excess is his use of threats of criminal prosecution to empower DOGE. When DOGE was first denied entry into the U.S. Institute of Peace, one of the lawyers for USIP got a call from the head of the U.S. attorney's criminal division, threatening criminal investigation if they didn't allow DOGE into the building. Magnifying that power of criminal law, Martin sent D.C. police officers to the agency, telling the police that there was “an ongoing incident at the United States Institute of Peace” and that there was “at least one person who was refusing to leave the property at the direction of the acting USIP president, who was lawfully in charge of the facility,” according to the journalist Steve Chapman.

A final example of DOJ overreach is, perhaps, the most chilling of all. In a recently issued presidential memorandum, Trump directed the attorney general to “investigate and take appropriate action concerning allegations regarding the use of online fundraising platforms to make ‘straw' or ‘dummy' contributions and to make foreign contributions to U.S. political candidates and committees, all of which break the law.” Were the investigation neutral in nature, this might be understandable. But it isn't.

In fact, there are two major fundraising platforms in use—WinRed (the Republican platform) and ActBlue (the Democratic one). Even though WinRed has been the subject of seven times as many FTC complaints as ActBlue, the Trump memorandum involves only the latter. By targeting his opponents' fundraising, Trump is overtly marshaling the powers of federal law enforcement in his effort to shut down political opposition.

In essence, Trump is using the department to try to ensure future Republican electoral victories. One can hardly imagine a more horrifying variation on Lavrentiy Beria's infamous boast: “Show me the man and I'll show you the crime.”



Just as the Justice Department is being used to punish Trump's enemies, it is likewise being used to reward Trump's friends.

The first and most notorious of these rewards requires little introduction. On his very first day in office, Trump pardoned nearly all of the January 6 rioters or commuted their sentences, including those, such as Stewart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio, who had been convicted of orchestrating the violence. When convicted insurrectionists—people who have been subject to a fair trial and been found guilty by a jury of their peers—are rewarded with pardons and commutations, the bedrock of legal accountability is fractured beyond recognition.

Other examples of favors for friends abound: In one prominent case, Trump moved to dismiss the federal corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams on the transparently pretextual grounds that the case had been a political assault by the Biden DOJ. The order caused a mass resignation among prosecutors who worked on the case. As the federal judge reviewing the dismissal concluded, it amounted to an illegitimate political quid pro quo intended to reward Adams for his political support and induce him to lend further assistance to Trump's anti-immigrant agenda. Not content with being slapped down by the judge, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche demanded that three of Adams's prosecutors “admit” that the office had been wrong in prosecuting the case. They refused and resigned instead.

If these were the only two instances of using the legal system to repay friends, they would still, in any other era and with any other president, be a scandal of immense consequence. Under Trump, they are only the appetizer to an entire meal of political rewards to his supporters—the crypto industry, police unions, oligarchs, and others.

For example, to benefit his crypto allies, Trump has closed the cryptocurrency-fraud investigation unit at the DOJ. The decision to no longer investigate crypto mixers will give far greater leeway to their activities. To a similar effect, Trump's decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht can only be seen as fan service for the crypto bros. Ulbricht was convicted of crimes related to the creation of Silk Road, an online crypto marketplace for illegal drugs and other illicit goods, but he is a cult hero to the crypto industry.

Support from police unions was a key component of Trump's electoral victory. As their reward, Trump has ordered the DOJ to delete its database of police misconduct, making it harder to track the activities of bad cops. He has also frozen the DOJ's review of police departments engaged in systemic unlawful behavior, reducing the possibility of reform and entrenching existing union power.

Trump's Justice Department has also significantly cut the staff at the FBI office charged with investigating domestic terrorism, including actions by right-wing militias. At the same time, he has rewarded Elon Musk by launching a task force to investigate anti-Tesla attacks. As a further sop to his cultural supporters, the president has destroyed the DOJ's civil-rights division. His assistant attorney general of that division, Harmeet Dhillon, has boasted that more than 100 attorneys under her have left because Trump has reoriented their work away from cases involving police reform and abortion access to keeping transgender athletes out of women's sports and ending alleged liberal “indoctrination” in K–12 education.

The depth of the corruption of the DOJ's independence extends even to more trivial acts, such as restoring the actor and MAGA hero Mel Gibson's right to carry a gun despite his domestic-violence conviction. Meanwhile, the rich personal and corporate supporters get richer. Some, like Paul Walczak, the son of a Trump-campaign supporter, benefit directly through yet more pardons.

Others benefit through transparent changes in DOJ policy that have the effect of benefiting their bottom line. For example, after proposing the virtual closure of the DOJ's tax division and distributing its resources across the nation—a move that would eliminate a source of legal expertise directed at finding well-heeled tax cheats—the department pivoted to an only slightly less-bad idea: splitting the division into two pieces (civil and criminal) and redistributing them to the civil and criminal divisions, respectively. Meanwhile, large corporations also benefit from Trump's executive order “pausing” prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, on the grounds that prohibiting bribery of foreign officials limits American competitiveness, as if bribery should be a part of how American corporations compete in the world. This “pause” has resulted in the delay or dismissal of at least five cases.

In short, it pays to have friends in high places—especially when they give you the special justice rate.



None of these abuses of power could have happened if the career staff at the DOJ had refused to comply. That's what occurred, more or less, in Trump's first administration. Recognizing the lawlessness of his conduct, the career staff resisted, both overtly and covertly.

Trump learned his lesson from that failure. The final part of his campaign to destroy the department is sidelining any attorney who opposes Trump's will.

To cite one prosaic example, the Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney is responsible for assessing and making recommendations on when and to whom the president should issue pardons. In Mel Gibson's case, the pardon attorney, Elizabeth G. Oyer, declined to recommend the restoration of his firearm rights because, under traditional standards, he did not qualify. Oyer was fired.

Around the same time, Trump's team took steps to limit scrutiny of their actions more generally. To that end, they fired the head of the Office of Information Policy (which handles Freedom of Information requests) and placed the head of the Office of Professional Responsibility (whose job it is to make sure that DOJ employees act ethically) on administrative leave, thereby removing those responsible for external and internal oversight.

These reassignments were just the start. More than a dozen career lawyers who worked, as assigned, on the criminal investigations of Trump during the Biden administration were let go. And the immigration attorney who forthrightly told a court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador due to an administrative error was relieved of his position.

Other dismissals were intended to marginalize or dismiss career leadership who might balk at Trump's misuse of power: At least six senior members of the FBI leadership, whose only apparent error was leading the FBI while Biden was president, were given a choice of resigning, retiring, or being fired. Career lawyers at the DOJ's national-security and criminal divisions who have historical expertise and knowledge, including Bradley Weinsheimer, the department's top ethics official, were reassigned or forced to retire; four career lawyers in the environment division who led enforcement efforts were reassigned to immigration work. Meanwhile, Trump significantly reduced the staffing at the Public Integrity Section—the part of the Justice Department that is responsible for investigating corrupt acts by elected officials and that, in an ideal world, would be responsible for holding Trump in check.

And those who have not been fired or reassigned have been effectively incapacitated. Employees in the Office of Legal Counsel are considered the government's in-house lawyers; among other duties, they typically review all White House executive orders to make sure they are legal under constitutional and statutory authority. But that office has been without a leader since Trump's inauguration and reportedly has barely been consulted about Trump's controversial executive orders—no doubt one reason that so many of them have failed in the courts.

Likewise, the Office of the Solicitor General is responsible for all of the government's litigation before the Supreme Court. Rather than advance Trump's overly aggressive arguments, at least half of the legal staff, some of the very best lawyers in government, are on their way out the door.

The inevitable result of this bloodletting? Many of those who remain behind are cowed into further submission. One anonymous DOJ lawyer described their experience at work in recent weeks to The Economist: “As time went on, a chill descended on the department. The hallways used to be a hubbub of chatter about cases, family life, weekend plans, but then they grew quiet. Conversations moved behind closed doors, and we became furtive and reticent. People cried in meetings. I often wondered why I still had a job.”



The phrase rule of law can easily become a shibboleth, signifying little. But the rule of law is the basis of any decent society. On one side of the coin, acceptance of the rule of law by those who govern is at the core of individual liberty. By abiding by the rules, government restrains its own abusive tendencies. And on the other side of the coin, trust in that restraint enables individual freedom, giving citizens the confidence to act as they wish, free from fear of retribution. If the government moves to punish those who speak out in opposition, merely the thought of that possibility can cause self-editing.

Without confidence in the rule of law, citizens live in fear of arbitrary and capricious exercises of power. That fear is enough to make anti-Trump political figures, such as Mona Charen, look over their shoulders. It is enough, even, to make senators (including Republican ones) concerned. “We are all afraid,” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska recently told the Anchorage Daily News. “It's quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before. I'll tell you, I'm oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that's not right.”

That threat of retaliation is rampant; it underlies Trump's assault on the independence of universities and large law firms. And it is enabled only by his diminution of the Department of Justice.

Read: The pathetic, cowardly collapse of Big Law

The DOJ's disregard for the rule of law is not confined to the DOJ; it leads to disregard for the rule of law by other agencies of government as well. The DOJ typically provides legal advice that instructs agencies to do as the courts require. Now, however, the department is systematically assisting other agencies (most notably the Department of Homeland Security) in evading their obligations to the court system and judges. As a result, the DOJ's lawlessness spreads. One federal judge has already found probable cause to believe that the Trump administration is in criminal contempt of an order relating to its illegal flights of immigrants to El Salvador. The administration is also risking being held in contempt of another court's efforts to manage the facilitation of the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States. None of this would be possible without the DOJ's destruction, and none of it would be permissible in any other administration.

These are hardly the only instances of contempt for the justice system. Trump has also effectively written out of existence the anti-TikTok law passed by Congress. And he has ignored the order of one of his own district-court appointees to let the Associated Press back into the Oval Office. When those at the Justice Department who enforce the law embrace Trump's scorn and no longer care about its content or consider it binding, the law, as a practical limitation on government action, ceases to exist.

But worst of all, when we lose the rule of law, we lose the system that undergirds our democracy. Law is not self-enforcing. It exists and animates our society because we believe it does. When that belief crumbles under Trump's assault, we all suffer.

The Ronald Reagan–appointed conservative jurist J. Harvie Wilkinson issued an opinion the other day denying an attempt by the administration to delay its efforts to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., saying that Trump is creating “a conflict that promises to diminish both” branches of government. “The Judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by dent of custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply. The Executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions. The Executive may succeed for a time in weakening the courts, but over time history will script the tragic gap between what was and all that might have been, and law in time will sign its epitaph.”

At the end of April, Trump's DOJ charged Hannah Dugan, a Wisconsin judge, with obstructing justice for the alleged crime of preventing ICE from arresting an illegal alien in her courtroom. The specter of using force to intimidate judges is a direct effort to undermine judicial independence and cow into submission the last branch of government that stands in the president's way. Attorney General Pam Bondi used the incident to go on cable TV to say that the administration was “sending a very strong message” and that “we will come after you and we will prosecute you.”

The United States once revered the rule of law. Americans believed that those who rule the country should be governed by it, and that it should be applied equally to each of us. Being subject to law means that government action is, as a general matter, less arbitrary, more predictable, less commanding, less subject to personal whims, and, in the end, less coercive. The rule of law is what makes citizens freer to say and do what they please.

Maintaining the rule of law is premised on the neutrality of DOJ employees. They must be committed to treating similar cases and defendants alike. They must apply the law without regard to political and social factors. And they must act without creating a fear of retribution or an expectation of receiving favors in return.

That is what Americans should be crying out for today. I fear it might already be too late to restore the faith in law we once had. The courts cannot save themselves, and Congress is supine. Significant damage to institutions has already been done.

Americans must reject the nightmare that lies ahead. They must work to restore a society of laws, and they can do so at the ballot box. But first, they must recognize the disease; only then can they demand a cure.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Sorry, a robot is probably a safer driver than most humans.

by  Bryan Walsh

I have some bad news: You are almost certainly a worse driver than you think you are. 

Humans drive distracted. They drive drowsy. They drive angry. And, worst of all, they drive impaired far more often than they should. Even when we're firing on all cylinders, our Stone Age-adapted brains are often no match for the speed and complexity of high-speed driving. There's as much as a 2.5-second lag between what we perceive and how fast we can react in a vehicle traveling 60 mph, which means a car will travel the equivalent of two basketball court lengths before its driver can even hit the brake. 

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

The result of this very human fallibility is blood on the streets. Nearly 1.2 million people die in road crashes globally each year, enough to fill nine jumbo jets each day. Here in the US, the government estimates there were 39,345 traffic fatalities in 2024, which adds up to a bus's worth of people perishing every 12 hours. 

The good news is there are much, much better drivers coming online, and they have everything human drivers don't: They don't need sleep. They don't get angry. They don't get drunk. And their brains can handle high-speed decision-making with ease. 

Because they're AI.

The average American adult will spend around three years of their life driving. If robots could take the wheel instead, well, think of all the Netflix shows we could stream instead.

But the true benefit of a self-driving revolution will be in lives saved. And new data from the autonomous vehicle company Waymo suggests that those savings could be very great indeed.

In a peer-reviewed study that is set to be published in the journal Traffic Injury Prevention, Waymo analyzed the safety performance of its autonomous vehicles over the course of 56.7 million miles driven in Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco — all without a human safety driver present to take the wheel in an emergency. They then compared that data to human driving safety over the same number of miles driven on the same kind of roads. 

The results of the study, almost certainly the biggest and most comprehensive research on self-driving car safety yet released, are striking.

Compared to human drivers, the Waymo self-driving cars had:

Had the typical human-driven fleet of cars covered those same 56.7 million miles, the Waymo researchers project it would have resulted in an estimated 181 additional injury crashes, 78 additional air-bag crashes, and 11 extra serious-injury crashes.

But the numbers really get eye-popping when you extend this data across all 3.3 trillion vehicle miles driven by humans in the US in a typical year. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that if the same 85 percent reduction seen in serious crashes held true for fatal ones — a big if, to be clear, since the study had too few fatal events to measure — we'd save approximately 34,000 lives a year. That's five times the number of Americans who died in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. 

Of course, there are plenty of caveats to the Waymo study and even more obstacles before we could ever achieve anything like what's outlined above.

In part because serious injury crashes are (thankfully) very rare, even 56.7 million miles isn't long enough for researchers to be really sure that such crashes would occur significantly less often with robot drivers, so more data will be needed there. Waymo's cars were also being driven largely in warm, sunny locations, operating in geofenced areas that had been heavily mapped by the company. It's far less certain how they might do in, let's say, the snowy streets of Boston in the winter. 

This is also a company-run study, though it has been peer-reviewed by outside experts. And even if we decided to go all in on AI drivers, actually producing enough autonomous vehicles to begin to replace human-driven cars and trucks would be an enormous undertaking, to say the least.

Still, the data looks so good, and the death toll on our roads is so high that I'd argue slowing down autonomous vehicles is actually costing lives. And there's a risk that's precisely what will happen. 

Too often the public focuses on unusual, outlier events with self-driving cars, while the carnage that occurs thanks to human drivers on a daily basis is simply treated as background noise. (That's an example of two common psychological biases: availability bias, which causes us to judge risk by outlier events that jump easily to mind, and base-rate neglect, where we ignore the underlying frequency of events.) This misapprehension is something I often see in news coverage and consumption, and it's one of the reasons I started Good News.

The result is that public opinion has been turning against self-driving cars in recent years, to the point where vandals have attacked autonomous vehicles on the street. And of course, given that nearly 5 million Americans make their living primarily through driving, any wide-scale movement to self-driving vehicles would bring significant economic disruption. 

But still, 34,000 lives saved on an annual basis would represent tremendous progress. Maybe, after about 100 years of trying, it's time to give something else a chance behind the wheel.

Two cast members of the hit Netflix reality TV show on what the HHS secretary misunderstands about autism.

by  Avishay Artsy

Two stars of the popular Netflix reality dating show Love on the Spectrum said Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial comments about autism couldn't be further from their reality — and they have the potential to do tremendous damage to the community. 

Last month, Kennedy ignited a furor when he said that “autism destroys families” and is an “individual tragedy as well.” The Health and Human Services secretary described autistic children as people who “will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.” 

Dani Bowman and James B. Jones spoke to Today, Explained host Noel King about Kennedy's comments and called for him to resign.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

Bowman founded and leads DaniMation, a company that teaches animation skills to youth on the autism spectrum, and Jones has worked in technical support for over a decade. They are both in committed relationships and said that Kennedy's depictions of autistic people don't describe them or the vast majority of people on the spectrum.

Kennedy is looking to fast-track research into the root causes of autism, and has repeatedly raised debunked theories about childhood vaccines and environmental toxins. He also laid out a plan to amass government medical records and collect private health data from pharmacies, hospitals, and even smartwatches and fitness trackers about autistic people. Those plans were revised after an outcry over privacy concerns. But, as Stat News has reported, autistic people and parents of autistic kids are trying to get their diagnoses erased and canceling doctors' appointments over fears about a national registry.

Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever else you get your podcasts.

Noel King: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made some comments not long ago about autistic people having limitations. What did you think about what he said?

Dani Bowman: It really honestly broke my heart because words like that don't describe reality; they shape it. They can either build people up or tear them down. And the idea that autistic people are automatically a burden? That kind of thinking destroys hope. And let's be clear, this isn't about politics. It's not about being red, blue, or whatever side you're on. It's about the language we use, and how that language either fuels hope or crushes it. We people on the autism spectrum are capable human beings. All we need is a loving push from the support of our friends and family to keep moving forward to independent, fulfilling lives.

Noel King: James, what did you think when you heard Secretary Kennedy make those remarks?

James B. Jones: Sadly, I was not surprised because he has had a habit of saying things that I feel are very ignorant and uneducated, or, sorry, uninformed is the better word there. So I was not at all pleased. I have been alive for 37 years, so I have many, many years of experience with this matter. 

“All we need is a loving push from the support of our friends and family to keep moving forward to independent, fulfilling lives.”

Noel King: Do you mean you've heard lots of people criticize autistic people in a way that you think is unnecessary?

James B. Jones: Yes, exactly, and I've been in situations where, in the past, my social skills were not as developed as they are now. So through experience, I developed my social skills to the point where they are now.

Noel King: The thing about those comments that got a lot of attention was when Secretary Kennedy listed the limitations, as he sees them, of people with autism. Do you believe that you have limitations?

Dani Bowman: Of course I do. I do have some certain limitations, and I do have a challenge called verbal apraxia, which means I have a hard time articulating with my words, or sometimes my words come out as word salad. However, as we people on the autism spectrum are working together to challenge these roadblocks, we can make it better.

James B. Jones: Of course, everyone has limits. I will confess that some of my limits may perhaps be related to my autism. But I've been able to minimize those limitations and work with them. 

I certainly must say that the idea that people with autism are incapable of driving vehicles, paying bills, or living independently is completely false. I've had my driver's license for 20 years, since I was 17. I pay practically all of my own expenses, and I work a 40-hour-per-week job with benefits that I've held steadily since 2017. Other than the fact that I still live with my parents, I believe myself to be quite independent and self-sufficient. The fact I still live with my parents is due to factors that are beyond my control, because houses are extremely expensive right now.

Dani Bowman: I understand why people might think that we're a burden, but if you had met me as a kid, you wouldn't say that. I didn't speak until I was almost 6, and when I moved in with my aunt and uncle at 11, I barely had any functional language and struggled to connect with anyone. But they didn't see it as a burden.

Noel King: Can I ask you guys a sensitive question?

James B. Jones: I suppose you may ask. Whether or not we answer is another matter entirely.

Noel King: I think that sounds fair. After Secretary Kennedy made those comments, a lot of people were clearly upset, including a lot of people like the two of you who have autism. 

I also read some essays by parents of kids who are severely autistic, who said, “This actually does speak to my experience. My kid is really having trouble. And probably won't ever get a job or write a poem or date.” They said, “Whether I like his position on vaccines, whether or not I think he addressed the issue sensitively enough or not, he is talking about what it's like to be me as a parent of a kid like this.” Do you think that he has a point when it comes to autistic people whose needs are much greater than the two of yours? 

Dani Bowman: I do have a cousin who is severely autistic, and even though he seemed to be getting better at knowing how to use the restroom by himself, I feel bad for my cousin. There's other nonverbal people on the spectrum that can get a degree. I met this one lady who is nonverbal and is capable of getting a PhD. She uses a communication device. No matter, nonverbal or not, people on the spectrum still need the loving push.

Noel King: We talked to a reporter who said, “One of the distinctive things about Secretary Kennedy is that he said, ‘We are going to find what causes autism quickly, and we're gonna do something about it.'”

James B. Jones: Ugh, I do not like that at all. For anyone who has studied history, those are very ominous words indeed. The reason that more people are diagnosed with autism is because doctors and psychologists have become more adept at identifying, at diagnosing autism. Plus, of course, people who have autism are now not as afraid to hide their condition, to hide their symptoms as they may have been in ages past. And of course, society is much more accepting of autism in recent years as well.

Noel King: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a lot of power. He can order that research be conducted. He can draw attention to the cause. What do you want RFK Jr. to know about you? And what do you want him to do, if anything, about people who live with autism?

Dani Bowman: I would say, please listen. Listen to people who actually live this experience. We don't need pity; we need opportunity. We don't need stereotypes; we need understanding. We're not broken; we're just wired differently. And given the chance, we can do incredible things. All we need is just a loving push.

“We don't need pity; we need opportunity. We don't need stereotypes; we need understanding.”

James B. Jones: I'll be diplomatic and say I wish Mr. Kennedy would resign from his position. Let someone who's actually competent take that role. That's a lot more diplomatic than what I was originally planning to say. 

The secretary of Health and Human Services needs to be someone who actually understands these various issues, understands matters of this nature. Yes, we need to provide support mechanisms for people who have autism or similar neurological conditions. People who have autism or similar conditions need special programs that are tailored for them. Every student needs to have their own customized curriculum.

Dani Bowman: I definitely agree with what James says. I would have RFK Jr. resign.

Ukraine said it shot down two Russian fighter jets with naval drones, describing it as the ""first time in history"" the technology had destroyed a crewed combat aircraft.

A Defence Intelligence of Ukraine (GUR) special operations unit said on Saturday that it destroyed a Russian Su-30 fighter jet in the Black Sea on Friday by using a missile launched from a naval drone.

Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the GUR, then told The War Zone that a second Russian Su-30 was also downed by the missiles from the naval drones in the attack. The Su-30 fighter jets are estimated to cost about $50 million per unit.

The GUR shared a video of an aircraft in the sky that appears to have been shot from below, which shows an aircraft-shaped object breaking apart and falling.

The GUR said the strike was carried out by a missile launched from a Magura naval drone platform, which can carry missiles that the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence previously said would target Russian aircraft.

Budanov told The War Zone that Ukraine used the Magura-7 version of the naval drone and that it used AIM-9 Sidewinder infrared-guided air-to-air missiles.

The Su-30 is a multirole fighter that can do both air-to-air and air-to-ground attacks. Ukraine has destroyed others in its fight back against Russia's invasion.

The GUR said the jet on Friday ""was engulfed in flames mid-air before crashing into the sea"" after the attack, which was done in coordination with the Security Service of Ukraine and the Defence Forces of Ukraine.

It said the strike happened near Russia's Novorossiysk port in Western Russia. Russia previously moved many of its vessels there from Sevastopol, the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian region of Crimea, as Ukraine damaged so many of its vessels there with attacks.

Ukraine has also launched attacks on Novorossiysk.

Ukraine has developed a fleet of naval drones that have menaced Russia's navy.

They, along with Ukraine's other weaponry, have allowed Ukraine to largely neutralize Russia's Black Sea Fleet without having any real navy of its own.

The naval drones have also caused problems for Russia in the skies. Ukraine said in December that it destroyed a Russian helicopter with a naval drone for the first time, saying a Magura was used in that attack too.

A spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Defence did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett stunned the audience at his annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday when he announced his plan to resign at year's end after a nearly six-decade run as the leader of the trillion-dollar empire.

Reactions have poured in from business leaders who know and admire the billionaire investor. One person who is more familiar with Buffett's life than most is Alice Schroeder, a journalist who wrote the 2008 bestselling biography of Buffett, ""The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,"" after spending a decade getting to know him and his family.

She spoke with Business Insider about the iconic investor's legacy amid news of his planned resignation.

This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

First things first — what's your initial reaction to the news? How are you feeling?

My initial reaction is: For heaven's sake, he deserves to retire at 94 years old from the day-to-day responsibilities of being a CEO, which are quite considerable. It's amazing that he has kept that role until now. I'm sure he's going to remain involved and will be consulted by those who want his advice — and who wouldn't want his advice? But I think it's a great move on his part, and I hope he enjoys a very well-earned retirement.

Well-earned indeed. Have you been in contact recently? Was this something you knew was on the horizon?

I have not been in contact with him in a few years, not because of any issue, but because he's at an age where he's not chit-chatting on the phone with everybody he knows all the time. But I was not surprised. I knew that he would remain CEO as long as he could, but he would not remain CEO beyond a certain point where he either wasn't enjoying having that responsibility, or for any other reason — I'm not going to speculate about anything related to his health because I don't know enough, but anybody at age 94 has got some things going on. So this day was going to come sooner or later.

What do you think this means for the future of Berkshire Hathaway?

I've been thinking about this since Warren was in his 60s because he's literally not replaceable, and so, of course, Berkshire Hathaway will be different. He has talked about the investment results of his deputies not being as stellar, perhaps, as his earlier record. In addition, Greg Abel obviously has his own style of leadership and management, and it is not Warren's style.

That said, I have never believed Berkshire's decentralized leadership style would survive Warren stepping down as CEO. Warren has been very candid in saying: Don't expect the company's results to be that much better — or necessarily any better — than the market as a whole over the long term after he's gone. Well, the long term has arrived, and now a lot of things are going to change.

I think Berkshire has tremendous advantages. It's got internal diversification, it's got strong, stable businesses. Those will obviously survive. And I think he will achieve the one goal that he told me he had a long time ago, which is that he constructed it to survive and still be a viable, reasonable, successful company for 30 years after he's no longer running it. So I think those who own the stock should not be worried because the business side could be almost put on autopilot, but there's a certain element of magic that is departing now, of course.

Are there any extenuating circumstances you see that could disrupt that stability? Or do you think he's built something steady that is going to survive this moment of economic turmoil and well into the future?

Warren's business career began during the Great Depression when he was a child and has spanned Vietnam, various financial crises, and the pandemic. He has done everything possible to construct a robust business that could survive what I would call normally foreseeable events. Can you think of a black swan that might disrupt the business? Sure, but they'd be very one-off scenarios, and I think you'd have to go many standard deviations away from even extreme outcomes for that to happen.

What about advice for Buffett's likely successor, Greg Abel? Are there any things that you think that Warren might or might not say to him, or things that you would advise him to do as he steps into these shoes?

I think it would be pretty presumptuous for me to give advice that Warren Buffett hasn't given, but with that caveat, his greatest focus for his successor has always been that his successor would allocate capital wisely, not go on a merger spree, overpay for other businesses, start divesting businesses, or repurchase stock at excessive valuations. I believe he has actually hammered that into people's heads, and it's unlikely to happen.

With that said, Berkshire has been, for some time, generating much more capital than it can use. So I think that the possibility of a dividend could be there under someone other than Warren. But I wouldn't expect Berkshire to change its approach to managing risk or asset liability management or anything like that.

Do you think a dividend might be a short-term play to reassure investors after his departure?

I don't think a dividend will be announced in the short term. I think that it will go from being absolutely ruled out to being potentially on the table at some point. But what I think will steady investors is seeing that nothing remarkable happens without Warren in the CEO role, because there is a magic to him and the things that he says, of course, and there will be a reaction to him not being in the day-to-day role. So we'll have to go through a period where he's not in the day-to-day role and see that the businesses actually are robust. You can't predict how investors will react, and I do know that most investors would agree that he's irreplaceable, but we also have known that this was coming for a long time as he's gotten older, so hopefully, people are prepared.

How long do you think it'll take for that confidence to return?

Right now, predicting anything in the market would be foolish. Berkshire would be as affected as any other business by things like tariffs or the fact that the United States has changed its stance on dealing with the rest of the world. So I don't want to predict anything.

Do you think the political environment played a role in his decision to step down in this timeframe?

I mean, he's 94 — it's reasonable for him to step down. I do not want people to think that the political environment is the reason. If it were, he probably would have said so, because he's pretty straightforward about his views on macroeconomics. And if that truly was a major factor, I think he would have identified it.

Looking back at your relationship with him, what lessons did he share with you that you think of now, in light of him taking this step?

I learned almost everything I know about dealing with people, managing people, and negotiating from him, including in my personal life. I credit him with making a major change in my marriage, and I'm now very happily married to my second husband, and that is directly, directly due to Warren Buffett.

I don't think I've ever told this story, but when I got married to my second husband, he had veto power over who I chose. That's how much I trust his judgment about people. I was happy to give him veto power. Thankfully, he liked David.

He is amazing at dealing with people, but there are also the timeless kinds of things that he has hammered home over and over: what makes a good business, how to compare two businesses and know which one is better, how to manage risk personally in your portfolio.

Do you have a favorite Buffett-ism, either personally or something he's shared with the world, that particularly resonates with you?

One thing that he has said to me, in a number of different ways, is that if you are talking to someone, and you say 99 things about them that are positive, and throw in one small criticism, the only thing they'll remember is the criticism — and that's how he manages people. I did not really understand that until I spent so much time with him, but I've seen it since in life, over and over, that you really have to give undiluted praise if you want people to feel it, and if you have something negative to say, tell them privately.

I know you mentioned you haven't been in touch in a while, but have you reached out since you heard the news?

I haven't yet, but I plan to write him a letter. He enjoys receiving mail; he particularly appreciates it, and I know he keeps it. You attract a lot of correspondence if you're as famous as he is, and, of course, some people are unhinged. In fact, that was one of the most important things that he taught me: Being both rich and famous is a terrible curse. You can't trust anybody, you have no privacy, you can't go anywhere without being interrupted, and it really disrupts your life — but if you want to really say 'here's what you've meant to me,' then the best way for Warren is to send a letter.

What else should people know about him?

He's always wanted his legacy to be as a teacher. I think his shareholder letters, all the amazing quotes and stories that are in my book, or things other people have written about him, those are his body of work, and his teachings will have an enduring value. He initially started out wanting to teach investors, but he increasingly branched into the personal, how to live your life — you don't want to wind up being somebody that, if you had a heart attack while you were giving a speech and fell off the stage, nobody would call 911, and he told me about people he knew that were in that situation. So I think he shared lots of lessons like that in terms of deciding what's important. If you really look at it, he's spent almost his whole life teaching people, so I think that will be his greatest legacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","A software engineer shares the résumé that got him to the final rounds at Google, Meta, Amazon, and Netflix — and hired at a Magnificent 7 company","https://www.businessinsider.com/software-engineer-shares-resume-got-him-hired-magnificent-7-tech-job-2025-5","Sun, 04 May 2025 10:07:00 GMT","

You could call Maulik Suchak something of a résumé expert.

His résumés have gotten him to final-round interviews at Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Atlassian, and led to multiple offers, including at Yelp, Microsoft, SurveyMonkey, and the Magnificent 7 company he's been at for nearly five years out of his 14-year career.

But, as the 34-year-old lead software engineer told Business Insider, ""My deep dive into résumés didn't start because I was job hunting — it started because I was building a product.""

In 2013, at 23 years old, Suchak co-created a résumé-building platform, CVsIntellect, with another engineer. The idea came from wanting to solve a very real problem; Suchak and his cofounder noticed their peers struggling to craft strong résumés, especially those without access to mentors or design tools.

Their vision was to make the résumé-creation process easier by offering a tool that didn't just generate résumés, but helped guide users toward stronger content and structure. This side project became Suchak's crash course in résumé content.

""I wasn't just writing my own résumé — I was reviewing hundreds of others,"" he said.

The platform grew rapidly, attracting thousands of users worldwide and surpassing over 100,000 résumés reworked via the site.

""This gave me deep insights into both the content and presentation side of résumés: what stands out, what gets ignored, and how different audiences interpret the same information,"" he said.

Two years after launching CVsIntellect, while working as a software engineer in India, Suchak leveraged his learnings to finesse his own job-search materials.

""I knew how to write in a way that hiring managers would respond to, because I'd spent so much time thinking like one,"" Suchak said. Crafting a breakthrough résumé was about storytelling, positioning, and clarity — skills that ultimately helped him first break into Big Tech and later nab a role at his current Magnificent 7 company.

His efforts led to multiple job offers from companies such as Microsoft and Yelp. He accepted the Yelp offer and relocated to San Francisco, California, at the end of 2015.

In just under five years at Yelp, Suchak grew to lead a team of 14 software engineers as an engineering manager. In this capacity, he  gained hiring responsibility, which gave him another foray into résumé review.

He also began mentoring other aspiring engineers. ""Whenever someone reaches out for feedback on their résumé, I try my best to help,"" Suchak said. ""Every résumé I read adds to my mental library of patterns — what works and what doesn't, what stands out visually and what falls flat, and how different people articulate their strengths.""

Suchak followed his natural curiosity about how people at top companies present their experience. ""I've spent a lot of time reading LinkedIn profiles, GitHub READMEs, and personal portfolios to understand how engineers craft their narratives — especially those in roles I admire,"" he said. 

His research furthered his understanding of the language and structure common to strong résumés for Big Tech roles.

In 2019, Suchak moved to Silicon Valley and began applying to a flurry of Big Tech jobs, including several Magnificent 7 companies.

He reached the final round interviews at Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Atlassian, and SurveyMonkey, again receiving several offers. In 2020, he accepted the job at his current Magnificent 7 company.

He attributes much of this success to the first impression his compelling résumé set. ""With my résumé, I not only effectively initiated a lot of connections with recruiters and hiring managers, but I landed a job that I'm really proud of,"" Suchak said.

Here's the exact résumé that helped Suchak achieve these victories — and five strategies he feels played a major role in ensuring his résumé told a persuasive enough story to open the right doors.

Every bullet point on his résumé included a tangible result — metrics or improvements that demonstrated real impact. This framed his work as meaningful and effective, not just functional.

""I always asked myself, 'What changed because I did this?'"" Suchak said. ""For example, instead of saying 'Worked on improving Yelp Cash Back sign-up page,' I wrote 'Improved Cash Back sign-up pages with various A/B tests with Python and JS resulted in 2X higher conversion.'""

Suchak treated his résumé like a narrative. In describing the roles he'd held earlier in his career, he focused on smaller-scale project impact; in his more recent roles, he showcased how he led product decisions or mentored others.

""Each role built logically on the previous one, and I highlighted progression — either in scope, skillset, or leadership,"" he said. ""The idea was to show momentum and intentional career moves rather than random hopping around.""

When building his résumé platform, Suchak often saw résumés that were three or more pages, filled with every job, internship, or online course candidates had ever done.

But when he realized most recruiters review résumés for less than 10 seconds, he wanted to do it differently.

""Each bullet was one to two lines max, and I avoided buzzwords,"" he said. ""This made it easier for a recruiter or hiring manager to scan quickly and still get a full picture of my strengths.""

In Suchak's early career, he spent a lot of time collecting technical certifications that he now feels didn't mean much. Over time, he shifted his strategy to emphasize actual working projects over just any certificate.

""In my résumé, I made sure to link to real-world projects, ideally hosted live or on GitHub,"" he said. He even mentioned one of his projects in a Magnificent 7 interview, he said, ""because it showed initiative, technical depth, and a bit of product thinking.""

Suchak has also tried to highlight independence. ""I'd done a lot of projects on my own from end-to-end, which my employer now really appreciated,"" he said.

A ""last but not least"" job-search principle Suchak believes in is that even the best résumé content can be overlooked if the formatting is messy.

""A readable résumé feels more professional, even before a single word is read,"" Suchak said.

He opted for clean fonts, consistent spacing, and clear section headers. He also avoided dense blocks of text and added just enough white space to make for a comfortable reading experience.

He even printed his résumé out first to see how it looked on paper before submitting it online.

""Looking back, if I could change anything about the résumé that got me into my Mag 7 job, I'd highlight more personal projects with shorter descriptions of each,"" he said. ""I'd also try to add even more impact and numbers.""

While many career experts suggest customizing your résumé for each job and company you apply to, Suchak didn't tweak his résumé at all for the job he ended up landing.

He now recognizes the value in tailoring résumés to the position you want, studying job descriptions, and integrating keywords from them to get past ATS filters.

""This is one I learned the hard way — while I received multiple offers, I also used to get a lot of rejections,"" he said. ""Instead of sending the same generic résumé everywhere, I'd now match my experience to each role,"" Suchak said.

Trump has placed tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese imports. China has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on American imports.

Speaking to the Telegraph, Peter Navarro said the UK “has been an all too compliant servant of the Chinese Communist Party because of the string-laden gifts that China gives as a way of spreading its soft power.” He said the UK and European Union should resist becoming “dumping grounds” for the products that China would otherwise sell to the US.

The Oracle of Omaha plans to step down at Berkshire Hathaway. But his legacy will echo across markets for generations.

In a league of his own.

Photographer: Bloomberg News

Now that Warren Buffett, the philosopher king of modern investing, has announced that he will step down as Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s chief executive officer at the end of the year, it's a good time to marvel again at his career.

Any discussion of Buffett must start with his astonishing track record. He is the greatest investor of all time. No one has even come close to what he has achieved, and I doubt anyone ever will.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Trump administration's plan to modernize the aging US air traffic-control system has gained fresh urgency after vulnerabilities with the existing system pushed United Airlines Holdings Inc. to cut flights at the second-busiest hub serving New York City.

Now the Abu Dhabi-based carrier wants to squeeze its premium offering into far more constrained quarters: the narrow confines of an Airbus SE A321 long-range aircraft that joins its fleet in the next few months. While Etihad has dispensed with its Residence servant in tailcoats and white cotton gloves, the airline promises amenities like sliding privacy doors, lie-flat seats, and large screens, all packed into an aircraft no wider than a city bus.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Bela Bajaria has had an incredible nine-year run at Netflix. She joined in 2016 to oversee unscripted and scripted series, led the streaming giant's push into live events and sports, and worked her way up to becoming the company's chief content officer.

But before then, she has what she calls a ""big public failure"" which turned out to be ""the greatest learning lesson"": She was fired from her job as president of Universal Television after a five-year tenure and big accomplishments, including building a strong comedy roster with top creators like Tina Fey and Mike Schur.

""There's amazing books and quotes and all this stuff about [how] you learn so much from failure, and failure is important, and you're not trying hard enough if you're not failing,"" Bajaria told CNBC's Julia Boorstin at the recent 2025 Changemakers Summit in Los Angeles. ""And all of that is true, but then when you fail, nobody wants to talk about it.""

There's plenty of gendered stigma that keep women from discussing their firings, Bajaria added, ""because we're supposed to be perfect"" and a dismissal is ""a blemish.""

The first few months after her firing were especially tough, she said. She found it hard to separate her personal identity with her professional status and she wondered if the hard work she put into her career was worthwhile.

Bajaria recalled thinking: ""All those amazing shows, all these great relationships I built; I treated people so fairly. We had a lot of success — it meant nothing.""

The actual response to her firing challenged that, she said. ""I quickly realized, as the phone rang and I got job offers, and everybody reached out, and people were really supportive — it all mattered. The way I treated people, what I had done, the impact I left — it all mattered,"" Bajaria said.

""I knew I could always look at myself in the mirror and [think] I liked what I had done. I didn't have any shame around what I did. I thought it was really a great, successful run,"" she added.

Bajaria was quick to note that coming to terms with her firing, and finding the upside of it, is easier after nearly a decade of distance. ""The first three months were really rough,"" she said.

""In retrospect I am so grateful that it happened,"" Bajaria said. ""I'm not scared of getting fired. It's very liberating, actually.""

Under Bajaria's leadership, Netflix has become a destination to watch live events including comedy specials, awards shows, WWE programming and NFL games.

Netflix films and series like ""Bridgerton"" and ""Emily in Paris"" have become global phenomena and boosted economies by hiring massive crews and encouraging tourism to the shows' settings.

Last year, Netflix received the most nominations for a single studio at both the Oscars and the Emmys with 107 nominations across 35 series, TV movies and specials.

A missile launched by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen on Sunday briefly halted flights and commuter traffic at Israel's main international airport after an impact left a plume of smoke and caused panic among passengers.

The Houthi rebels have been striking Israel throughout the war in Gaza in solidarity with Palestinians. The attack on Ben-Gurion International Airport came hours before top Israeli Cabinet ministers were set to vote on whether to intensify the country's military operations in the Gaza Strip. The army, meanwhile, began calling up thousands of reserves in anticipation of a wider operation in Gaza, officials said.

The missile launch Sunday set off air raid sirens in multiple parts of Israel. A plume of smoke was visible at the airport, according to footage shared by Israeli media. Passengers were heard yelling and scrambling for cover.

It was not immediately clear whether the projectile, which landed in a field near an access road leading to airport parking lots, was the missile or its fragments, or an interceptor from Israel's air defense systems. It left a deep crater in the ground and a nearby road was littered with dirt.

Police said that air, road and rail traffic were halted following the attack. The traffic resumed after about an hour, Israel Airports Authority said. Israel's paramedic service Magen David Adom said four people were lightly wounded.

Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said in a video statement that the group fired a hypersonic ballistic missile at the airport.

Houthi rebels have been firing at Israel since the war with Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, and the missiles have mostly been intercepted, although some have penetrated Israel's missile defense systems, causing damage.

Israel has struck back against the rebels in Yemen and the U.S., Israel's top ally, also launched a campaign of strikes in March against them.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed retribution for the airport attack: ""Whoever harms us, we will harm them sevenfold.""

An Israeli official said the influential security Cabinet would meet on Sunday evening to vote on plans to expand the fighting. A military official said the country was calling up thousands of reserves. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, in an interview with Israeli Army Radio, said he wanted to see a ""powerful"" expansion of the war, but did not disclose details as to what the new plans would entail.

""We need to increase the intensity and continue until we achieve total victory. We must win a total victory,"" he said. He demanded that Israel bomb ""the food and electricity supplies"" in Gaza.

The plans to escalate fighting in Gaza more than 18 months after the war there erupted come as a humanitarian crisis in the territory deepens.

As part of its efforts to pressure the militant group Hamas to negotiate on Israel's terms for a new ceasefire, Israel in early March halted the entry of goods into Gaza. That has plunged the territory of 2.3 million people into what is believed to be the worst humanitarian crisis since the war began.

An eight-week-long ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that brought a lull in fighting and freed Israeli hostages collapsed in March. Israel resumed its strikes on Gaza on March 18 and has captured swaths of the coastal enclave. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the fighting resumed, according to local health officials.

At least seven Palestinians including two parents and their two children, ages 2 and 4, were killed in Israeli airstrikes in southern and central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medics said. Asked about the strikes, the Israeli military had no direct comment.

The Israeli military said Sunday that two soldiers were killed in combat in Gaza, bringing the number of soldiers killed since fighting resumed in March to six.

The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. Israel says 59 remain in Gaza, although roughly 35 are said to be dead.

Israel's offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children according to Palestinian health officials, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count.

The fighting has displaced more than 90% of Gaza's population, often multiple times. Hunger has been widespread and the shortage of food has set off looting.

In some U.S. cities, it now takes more than twice the income to afford a median-priced home than to afford a median-priced apartment — and the gap keeps growing.

Nationwide, a recent Redfin analysis finds that U.S. homebuyers must earn $116,633 to afford such a home — 82% more than the income needed to cover the cost of a median-priced rental. The figures are based on the standard assumption that housing costs shouldn't exceed 30% of gross income, a common affordability benchmark.

The estimates reflect national and metro-level data for the three months ending in February 2025, comparing median home sale prices with median asking rents for newly listed apartments in buildings with five or more units. Homeownership calculations assume a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 15% down payment and a 6.84% interest rate, and also factor in insurance and property taxes.

Since 2021, the income needed to afford a home has climbed at a much faster pace than what's needed to rent — with the gap between the two more than quadrupling. That's largely due to soaring home prices and high mortgage rates, while rent growth has mostly stalled.

""It has become increasingly challenging for American renters to make the shift to homeownership thanks to the triple whammy of rising home prices, high mortgage rates and a shortage of houses for sale,"" writes Redfin senior economist Elijah de la Campa.

For buyers, demand has far outpaced supply in recent years, as a pandemic-era slowdown in construction worsened an already tight housing market. With too few homes available to buyers, prices surged 43% from 2020 to 2025, per Redfin's data.

For rentals, prices have remained flat over the past two years, driven by a wave of new apartment construction that has boosted supply, according to Redfin.

In 13 of the 42 largest U.S. metro areas, the income required to afford a median-priced home is now more than double what's needed to rent a median-priced apartment.

Big cities tend to have higher home costs because they attract people for jobs and opportunity, driving up demand and pushing home prices higher — especially when supply is limited.

Here are the metros with the widest income gaps between what's required to buy and rent:

The steepest disparity is in San Jose, where buyers need to earn $408,557 annually — more than three times the income required to rent. The smallest gap is in Pittsburgh, where buyers need to earn just $66,350 to afford a home — only 14.4% more than what's required to rent.

President Donald Trump took credit for the ""good parts"" of the economy in an exclusive interview with NBC News airing Sunday, but said that the ""bad parts"" are former President Joe Biden's economy.

Trump defended his tariffs, even amid the economic uncertainty stemming from the sweeping announcement.

""Ultimately, I take responsibility for everything, but I've only just been here for a little more than three months,"" Trump said.

""The tariffs have just started kicking in. ... The tariffs are going to make us rich. We're going to be a very rich country,"" he added.

It's not the first time that Trump has tried to shift blame to his predecessor. Just last week, he put the onus on Biden for the U.S. economy contracting in the first quarter of the year.

Trump also doubled down on comments he made during a Cabinet meeting earlier in the week, when he dismissed concerns that his tariffs would lead to supply shortages.

""I don't think a beautiful baby girl needs – that's 11 years old – needs to have 30 dolls,"" Trump said.

""I'm just saying [children] don't need to have 30 dolls, they can have three, they don't need to have 250 pencils, they can have five,"" he added.

In the interview, Trump also downplayed the possibility of long-term negative impacts from his tariffs on the U.S. economy, even if the U.S. experiences a recession in the short term.

""Look, yeah, it's — everything's OK. What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we're going to do fantastically,"" he told Welker.

Relationships don't fall apart overnight. More often than not, they crumble under the weight of small missteps that quietly accumulate — until they become too heavy to manage.

As a psychologist who studies couples, I've seen many versions of this. Partners come into my office thinking their problem has something to do with frequent fights or arguments. But when we dig deeper, we often find the same root cause: what they say to each other in their arguments.

There's one phrase I've seen come up in these exchanges that's more damaging than you think: ""Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?""

If you use this toxic phrase, your relationship is in trouble. 

At first glance, it might seem like a throwaway line or a sigh of frustration in the middle of an argument.

What couples fail to recognize is that the person named is actually irrelevant, whether it's an ex, a best friend's girlfriend, or even ""how you used to be."" The real message will always remain the same: ""You're not enough, and someone else — anyone else — could do a better job at being my partner.""

Over time, this kind of comparison can give rise to irreparable insecurity issues. Rather than feeling loved for who they are, the person on the receiving end will start questioning their worth and constantly wonder if they're living up to expectations.

DON'T MISS: How to successfully change careers and be happier at work

Relationships can't thrive when we ask our partner to be someone they're not. Happiness can only be achieved when we communicate what we need clearly, without shame or comparison.

That's why this phrase itself isn't the real problem. It's usually a symptom of a much deeper dysfunction: the fear of openly speaking up.

Research helps explain why some partners might not express their frustrations openly — at least, not at first. According to one study, when a partner feels uncertain about the relationship, or unsure of how their partner will respond, they're more likely to hold back. 

Rather than just saying outright, ""I feel disconnected when we don't spend quality time together,"" they compartmentalize it. These moments only pile up over time, until the day comes that they inexplicably blurt out something like, ""Why can't you be more like Sarah's husband? He actually plans dates."" 

It's not necessarily that they want a different partner; it's that they don't feel safe enough to voice their needs plainly. The more secure and emotionally close a person feels in their relationship, the more likely they are to communicate directly. 

Instead of pointing to someone else as a model, turn the spotlight inward. What are you really asking for? And why are you so afraid to ask it plainly?

A group of unconventional antiheroes has jumpstarted the summer box office.

Disney and Marvel's ""Thunderbolts*"" tallied an estimated $76 million during its domestic opening weekend, the third highest debut of 2025.

Including international ticket sales, the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe flick snared an estimated $162.1 million globally.

""With the debut of 'Thunderbolts*,' May is shaping up to be one the best on record,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.

Last year, the summer box office — which kicks off the first weekend in May and runs through Labor Day — struggled at the start, with Universal's ""The Fall Guy"" only snapping up $28 million in its first three days. It was the first year since 2009 that a Marvel film wasn't on the slate to start the season.

Marvel films have struggled in recent years to live up to the record-setting achievements of ""Avengers: Endgame"" in 2019. For every box office hit there was a major miss, and audiences bemoaned the studio's quality inconsistencies. Even in the last year, ""The Marvels"" and ""Captain America: Brave New World"" underwhelmed, while ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" overperformed.

""Every franchise movie faces its share of tailwinds and headwinds, inherent and external factors that dictate what audience anticipation and response will be,"" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. ""But there's no doubt 'Thunderbolts*' is a moment worth a victory lap for Marvel after several years of wildly varying sentiment toward multiple films and streaming series.""

While $76 million is middle of the pack for the MCU, it's a strong performance for ""Thunderbolts*,"" box office analysts told CNBC.

""To launch an ensemble of junior varsity characters unfamiliar to many outside the core fan base, and to do so with some of the best word of mouth the MCU has seen from critics and audiences in years, is a fresh reminder of what Marvel is capable of when the creative engine fires on all cylinders,"" Robbins said.

""Thunderbolts*"" currently holds an 88% ""Fresh"" rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, from 257 reviews and a 94% rating from audiences.

""The opening weekend performance of 'Thunderbolts*' is just the beginning for this well-reviewed crowd-pleaser,"" said Comscore's Dergarabedian. ""[It] looks to follow in the tradition of 'A Minecraft Movie' and 'Sinners,' with long-term playability.""

In recent weeks, Warner Bros.' ""A Minecraft Movie"" and ""Sinners"" have consistently lured in moviegoers, with smaller-than-average weekly attendance drops. The hope is that ""Thunderbolts*"" will continue that trend.

Singapore's ruling People's Action Party returned to power in a landslide victory, handing the city-state's governance once again to Lawrence Wong as prime minister at a time when trade turmoil has rocked the globe. The PAP bagged 87 seats in the 97-seat parliament, while the main opposition Workers Party held on to its 10 seats in the country's 14th general election that saw a record-low turnout of 92.47%, according to domestic media. Voting in Singapore is compulsory for citizens above 21.

Votes were cast for 92 seats, after the PAP won five seats in a walkover on Nomination Day on April 23.

The ruling party also increased its vote share, garnering 65.57% of the national vote compared to the 61.2% in the 2020 election.

This election was Wong's first as prime minister, and was dominated by cost of living issues, jobs and economic growth, according to local media outlet CNA. Wong is the first PAP leader to have improved the party's vote share in his first election. The PAP's vote share fell in the 1991 and 2006 elections, when Singapore saw a change in prime minister in 1990 and 2004. 

Wong, who is also finance minister, took over from Lee Hsien Loong in May 2024. Lee currently serves as Senior Minister in Wong's cabinet.

The PAP has ruled Singapore since 1959, when the city-state under the British gained full self-government. Singapore became independent in 1965.Speaking after the election, Wong said that he was ""deeply humbled and grateful for the results,"" adding that ""Singaporeans have given the PAP a clear and strong mandate to govern.""The results will put Singapore in a better position to face this turbulent world. Many are watching the elections closely, whether it's international media, investors or foreign governments, they will have taken note of tonight's results. It's a clear signal of trust, stability and confidence in your government.""

Early Sunday morning, the U.S. State Department congratulated Wong on the PAP's victory, saying it looks forward to working closely with the new government to strengthen economic growth and defense ties. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also said in a post on X that the EU valued its ""excellent cooperation"" with Singapore. 

""Our partnership is deepening, in trade and investment, and also defence, security, innovation,"" she added.

The election also comes as Singapore grapples with slowing economic growth and an uncertain trade situation. 

In April, Singapore had downgraded its GDP growth forecast to 0%-2%, with the country's monetary authority easing policy twice this year.First-quarter GDP for the country came in lower than expected, at 3.8%. Wong had warned earlier this year that Singapore might go into a recession in 2025, and had formed a task force led by Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong in April to help businesses and workers navigate the immediate uncertainties arising from U.S. tariffs and related global developments. 

Gan held a call with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last month. Singapore is seeking concessions for pharmaceutical exports to the U.S., while also working with Washington to strengthen export controls for high-end AI chips, Gan said following the meeting.

He also said Lutnick conveyed that the 10% baseline tariff imposed by the Trump administration in early April was an ""umbrella,"" and not likely subject to negotiation.

Singapore was hit with the 10% tariff, despite having a trade deficit with the U.S. and a free trade agreement since 2004.

Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, Kentucky, in a thrilling fight to the finish line on Saturday to capture the first leg of U.S. thoroughbred racing's famed Triple Crown.

The bay colt thrived in the wet and sloppy conditions at Churchill Downs to finish the 1-1/4-mile race in two minutes and 2.31 seconds, beating the heavy favorite Journalism down the final straight.

Journalism finished about a length behind while Baeza was third.

The race marked famed trainer Bob Baffert's first trip to the derby after a three-year ban from the track. Churchill Downs had suspended him after his horse, Medina Spirit, failed a drugs test after winning the 2021 Kentucky Derby.

His horse, Citizen Bull, took the early lead from the pole position, hanging on through much of the race as a dense chase pack followed.

Sovereignty and Journalism made their move at the same time, navigating around the outside on the final turn, battling nose-to-nose through the final 16th of a mile before Sovereignty pulled away in the final moments.

""I saw him gearing up when he left the half-mile pole, he started to pick up his momentum, and I lost him a little bit,"" trainer Bill Mott said in televised remarks. ""He made up a lot of ground in a hurry.""

Mott previously trained Country House, who won the derby in 2019 when Maximum Security became the first horse in the history of the race to be disqualified after crossing the line first.

It was the first Kentucky Derby win for jockey Junior Alvarado, who deftly navigated through the pack from the unenviable 18th post position and said he never doubted the horse he called ""Mr. Mud"" would thrive in the mucky conditions.

""I thought I had a great chance,"" said Alvarado, who was sidelined with a reported fracture in his shoulder only five weeks ago.

""I was so confident the whole way.""

Baeza, who drew in after another Baffert-trained horse, Rodriguez, scratched on Thursday, sneaked into third as jockey Hector Berrios made a gutsy last minute move.

The Panama Canal has spent the past few years battling extreme weather, with the El Niño phenomenon and severe drought leading to a water-level crisis. Now, it's President Trump's trade war that is threatening the global trade gateway. A critical passage for U.S. East Coast bound ocean freight container traffic, the Panama Canal is facing a potential business slump as a result of Trump's China tariffs and a rapid decline in manufactured goods being ordered by U.S. shippers.

Forty percent of all U.S. container traffic travels through the Panama Canal every year, and in all, $270 billion in cargo annually. The U.S. and China are the top users of the Panama Canal, and its role in global shipping has increased in recent years due to the disruption of global supply chains. The Panama Canal Authority's revenue hit $3.38 billion last year, despite drought conditions, and revenue has increased every year since 2017.

The trade war uncertainty and Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese goods — which will start to hit goods arriving from China to U.S. ports on May 27 based on the four to six weeks it takes for ocean freight to reach the U.S. from Asia — has already resulted in a massive pause on U.S. imports bound from China. According to data from supply chain intelligence firm Project44, there has been a 300% increase in blank sailings (cancelled freight vessels) from China to the United States since Trump's so-called ""Liberation Day"" tariffs announcement on April 2.

West Coast ports in the U.S. are already being hit and the impact on East Coast ports is expected to increase, with the pullback in vessels a result of the decrease in manufacturing orders for Chinese factories: less products manufactured translates into less shipping containers for ocean carriers.

For the Asia to North America East Coast trade route, Sea-Intelligence has recorded a cumulative blanked capacity of 261,822 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs.) over the last six weeks. This decrease in containers and vessels can impact Panama Canal revenue. The Panama Canal makes its money off of the number of vessel transits and containers moving through the waterway.

""Since close to 75% of our cargo goes to or from the United States, any recession worldwide or in the United States will impact somehow the Panama Canal,"" said Boris Moreno, vice president of operations for the Panama Canal Authority. ""That's for sure.""  

One of the ""Seven Wonders of the Modern World,"" according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the canal has been a lightning rod for controversy in recent years in the battle for global supremacy between the U.S. and China. Trump has claimed the canal's key ports are being controlled by China, and has threatened to reassert U.S. control over the canal, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates. China, along with government of Panama, have denied those claims.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth both visited with Panamanian government officials in recent months.

""I think that Panama over the last five years has inched closer and closer to China and away from the United States,"" Federal Maritime Commissioner Louis Sola said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year. ""I've seen China and Brazil take away $20 billion with direct contracts. We definitely need to at least have a game there.""

Ricaurte Vasquez, administrator for the Panama Canal Authority, tells CNBC that with the U.S. being the world's largest economy, it is reviewing Trump's concerns.

""Whatever is said in Washington has repercussions all over,"" said Vasquez. ""We try to stay cool, calm and collected.""

He added, ""It is not true that we are run by Chinese. It is not true that we differentiate rates. It is not true that 38,000 people die in the construction of the Panama Canal. Everyone that wants to sail sails through the Panama Canal. And we are open to the world. That is the neutrality treaty. We have to remain open.""

In March, an investment group led by U.S. firm BlackRock announced it was trying to purchase two ports at either end of the canal, as well as about 40 others from Hong Kong based-CK Hutchison. The outcome of that deal remains unclear.

In this article

Investors with concerns about the risks facing the economy may want to add some stable income to their portfolio in the form of dividend-paying stocks.

To this end, Wall Street experts' recommendations can help pick lucrative dividend stocks that have the ability to make consistent payments despite near-term pressures.  

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This week's first dividend stock is telecom giant AT&T (T). The company recently reported first-quarter results, driven by strong postpaid phone and fiber net subscriber additions. The company retained its full-year guidance and stated that it plans to commence share buybacks in the second quarter, given that its net leverage target of net debt-to-adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is in the 2.5-times range.

AT&T offers investors a quarterly dividend of $0.2775 per share. With an annualized dividend of $1.11 per share, AT&T stock offers a dividend yield of 4.0%.

In reaction to the company's Q1 print, RBC Capital analyst Jonathan Atkin raised his price target for AT&T stock to $30 from $28 and reiterated a buy rating. The analyst noted that the company exceeded estimates even after excluding $100 million of one-time EBITDA benefits.

Atkin added that AT&T's revenue surpassed expectations, thanks to the strength in both wireless and wireline businesses. Among other positives, the analyst noted that the company promptly addressed the slowdown seen in January and delivered robust postpaid phone net additions of 324,000, with gross additions growing 13% and helping to overcome higher churn.

""Management signaled confidence in its execution amidst a challenging environment by reiterating guidance and introducing a buyback program that commences in Q2,"" said Atkin.

Atkin ranks No. 85 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.3%. See AT&T Hedge Fund Trading Activity on TipRanks.

We move to Philip Morris International (PM), a consumer goods company that is focused on transitioning completely to smoke-free alternatives from cigarettes. The company reported solid results for the first quarter of 2025, driven by strong demand for its smoke-free products.

Philip Morris rewarded shareholders with a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share. At an annualized dividend of $5.40 per share, PM stock offers a yield of nearly 3.2%.

Encouraged by the results, Stifel analyst Matthew Smith reaffirmed a buy rating on PM stock and increased the price target to $186 from $168, noting strong momentum across the board. The analyst said that three growth engines – smoke-free product mix, pricing and volume growth – boosted Philip Morris' Q1 performance and drove a 10% rise in organic revenue, 340 basis points of gross margin expansion and 200 basis points of increase in operating profit margin.

""Each of these engines support durable growth in 2025 and beyond as smoke-free continues to increase as a portion of PMI's portfolio, now over 40% of revenue and gross profit,"" said Smith.

The analyst expects 170 basis points of operating profit margin expansion in 2025, driven by smoke-free products, including Iqos and Zyn. In particular, Smith noted that Zyn's Q1 U.S. volumes benefited from robust demand and earlier-than-anticipated improvement in supply chain capacity. He now expects 824 million cans for 2025, reflecting a 42% growth. Also, Zyn's capacity is expected to reach 900 million cans this year, supporting potential upside to his estimates, especially in the second half of the year when inventories are expected to normalize.

Smith ranks No. 642 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 15%. See Philip Morris Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

This week's third dividend stock is Texas Instruments (TXN), a semiconductor company that designs and manufactures analog and embedded processing chips for several end markets. The company's first-quarter earnings and revenue easily surpassed Wall Street's estimates, reflecting strong demand for its analog chips despite the threat of tariffs. Also, TXN's guidance for the June quarter was better than the consensus estimate.

Meanwhile, Texas Instruments pays a quarterly dividend of $1.36 per share. At an annualized dividend of $5.44 per share, TXN stock's dividend yield stands at 3.3%.

Reacting to the strong Q1 results, Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated a buy rating on TXN stock with a price target of $248, saying, ""We're buyers of TXN post a beat and raise 1Q25 print."" He stated that TXN remains a top analog pick for Evercore.

Lipacis contended that while bears will argue that the upside to Texas Instruments' Q1 results and Q2 2025 outlook were due to tariff-driven order pull-ins, his analysis shows that the company's inventories have overcorrected in the supply chain. In fact, numerous checks by his firm indicate that many entities in the supply chain have now taken their inventories well below normal levels.

The analyst expects TXN to be early into the upward revision cycle, given that it was the first large-cap analog company to enter the inventory correction phase. He expects the company to deliver upside surprises through 2025 and into 2026. Additionally, he expects TXN stock to sustain a premium price-earnings multiple as it is exiting its capital expenditure cycle, which will drive its free cash flow per share higher from a trailing 12 months' trough of $1 to $10.30 by 2027.

Lipacis ranks No. 69 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.4%. See Texas Instruments Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

Texas has a brand new city, and its name is Starbase.

A vote Saturday to decide whether to turn part of south Texas into a new city centered around Elon Musk's SpaceX delivered a victory to the tech billionaire and his rocket company. As expected, the measure passed with broad support, paving the way for a newly incorporated city made up almost exclusively of SpaceX employees and people connected to the company.

The initial vote tally was 173 in favor of incorporation and 4 against; only 143 votes were needed for the measure to pass.

""It's officially statistically impossible for the measure to fail,"" Cameron County Elections Administrator Remi Garza said Saturday night. ""Cameron County is about to have a new city.""

Now that the vote has passed, commissioners in the county will canvass the results within two weeks, Garza said. A judge will then assign an order declaring the results of the election and the official incorporation of the new city.

The new city of Starbase covers about 1½ square miles at the southern tip of Texas, a coastal spot nestled against the Mexico border. The area is home to SpaceX headquarters, and it's where the company builds its boosters and engines and launches its huge Starship rocket on test flights.

The ballot result was a much-needed win for Musk, who has faced widespread backlash over the past few months for his involvement with President Donald Trump's administration. Musk was installed as chief of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and oversaw sweeping layoffs and cuts across federal agencies.

In response, protests against Musk erupted around the country and profits plummeted at the billionaire's electric car company, Tesla.

Now, SpaceX will have the company town that Musk first publicly proposed in 2021.

In addition to incorporating the new city, Saturday's election also selected Starbase's first mayor — Bobby Pedden — and two city commissioners — Jordan Buss and Jenna Petrzelka. The candidates for all three positions ran unopposed, and all three are employees of SpaceX.

There were 283 people eligible to cast ballots in Saturday's Cameron County special election, according to county election records. Eligibility was determined based on if a resident's home would fall within the boundaries of the proposed new city.

Neither SpaceX nor Musk has detailed the purpose of incorporating a city around the rocket company's operations. There has been speculation, however, that having greater municipal control of the area could ease some of the bureaucracy and restrictions around SpaceX's tests and rocket launches.

At the moment, SpaceX must obtain permission from authorities in Cameron County to close a highway and shut down public access to Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park to keep people safe during rocket launches.

The frequent closures have contributed to legal complaints against SpaceX, and have drawn protests from local residents and activists, including the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas, the South Texas Environmental Justice Network and Border Workers United, as reported by CNBC.

Now that SpaceX operates within the newly incorporated city of Starbase, things may soon change — though perhaps not without resistance.

""Right now that authority lies solely within Cameron County and my office, and we think that we've proven to be good collaborators and partners with SpaceX in their operations and also in making sure and providing enough notice and public access to Boca Chica Beach,"" Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino told NBC News.

Trevino said any changes to the established procedures would be unnecessary.

""If it's not broken, it doesn't need to be fixed,"" he said

 Arizona state senator and Bitcoin advocate Wendy Rogers said, “Bitcoin doesn't need Arizona, Arizona needs Bitcoin."" 

Bitcoiners and United States government officials have criticized Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs' decision to veto a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves.

“This will age poorly,” Casa co-founder and cypherpunk Jameson Lopp said in a May 3 X post. Bitcoin (BTC) entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said, “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.”

“If she can't outperform Bitcoin, she must buy it,” Pompliano said. Crypto lawyer Andrew Gordon said, “We need more elected officials who understand that Bitcoin and crypto are the future.”

Wendy Rogers, who co-sponsored the bill with State Representative Jeff Weninger, also voiced her disappointment.

“Politicians don't understand that Bitcoin doesn't need Arizona. Arizona needs Bitcoin,” Rogers said.

On May 2, Hobbs vetoed the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which would have permitted Arizona to invest seized funds into Bitcoin and create a reserve managed by state officials. “Today, I vetoed Senate Bill 1025. The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Hobbs said.

Rogers said she would refile the bill during her next session. Rogers also pointed out that Arizona's state retirement system already holds stocks of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR).

“Which is basically a leveraged Bitcoin ETF. Arizona's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill will be back. HODL,” Rogers said. The stock price of Strategy rose 32% in April, the most significant monthly gain since November 2024.

However, well-known crypto skeptic Peter Schiff sided with Hobbs. “The government should not be making decisions to use public funds to speculate in cryptocurrencies,” Schiff said.

Arizona would have become the first US state to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve if it had passed.

Arizona joins several other US states where similar efforts have failed. Similar proposals in Oklahoma, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have stalled or been withdrawn recently.

""We've ended the war on crypto, and I think we're trying to stop the regulatory capture that benefits large incumbents,"" Sacks, who worked with Tesla billionaire Elon Musk in the early days of PayPal and advised him on his takeover of Twitter and its rebranding to X, said during an episode of the All In Podcast.

“I do think that this sets us up for a Trump boom in the future,"" Sacks said, pointing to “other things that that have been done on the economy as well,"" and predicted “a lot of these changes take time to to play out.”

Last week, the Federal Reserve quietly rolled back Biden-era rules that prevented Wall Street from fully embracing crypto, while the Trump administration is fast tracking stablecoin legislation that's expected to rewire the global financial system.

The bitcoin and crypto market has lost steam since Trump's inauguration, with the bitcoin price dropped from its January all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting along with the stock market as the Trump administration embarked on a global trade war.

The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last year, recovering from a dip following U.S. president ... More Donald Trump's return to the White House in January.

However, the bitcoin price, which has somewhat supported the wider crypto market, has held up better than many had expected, helped by growing fears swirling around the future of the U.S. dollar and bitcoin's reputation as “digital gold.”

“This renewed risk-on mood is setting the stage for bitcoin to make a run at $100,000,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments.

“The $95,000 level had been a key resistance zone in recent weeks, and once bitcoin cleared it with strong volume, momentum accelerated quickly. With equities pushing higher and liquidity expectations rising, bitcoin is behaving like a high-beta macro asset–closely tied to investor appetite for risk and reflation trades.”

Other bitcoin and crypto investors have cheered the latest bitcoin price rebound, emboldening them to double-down on their bullish bitcoin price predictions.

“I definitely would not be surprised [to see bitcoin reach] $200,000, or $250,000 this year,"" Joe Burnett, director of market research Unchained, said during an X broadcast.

“If the price gets going soon and breaks a new all-time high, I think things could get really crazy, [and] actually go parabolic... all the narratives are set, the macro conditions are great.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Cryptocurrency mining facilities can blanket towns with ‘constant' noise. They're likely to get louder under Trump

First came the dogs' balding – leathery pink patches on otherwise glossy fur coats.

The veterinarian told Shenice Copenhaver it was genetic. But it wasn't long before one of the hairless puppies began stealing blankets to burrow beneath furniture and hide for long stretches.

Around the same time, in the summer of 2022, she first heard the noise: a deep, mechanical howl that becomes shrill closer to the facility. Copenhaver didn't know it then, but bitcoin miners had come to town. Less than a mile away from her home in east Texas, a cryptocurrency mining facility was rumbling to life.

The hum has since become the soundtrack to life for hundreds of residents in the small city of Granbury, with a population of 12,600. It echoes across agricultural land and forests, chasing away deer. It seeps into walls, vibrating bedrooms and dinner tables. Copenhaver's neighbor Cheryl Shadden imagines it is what standing on the edge of Niagara Falls might sound like. Copenhaver says it's like a jet engine is forever stationed nearby.

A video of the site from Shadden's home, recorded on 23 April, shows green pastures against a backdrop of billowing smoke and the roar.

“It wakes you up,” says Copenhaver. “I'll be asleep, and everything will be fine, and then I'll wake up because I can feel it in my chest.”

Large-scale cryptocurrency mining operations began popping up across the United States a decade ago. But it was China's crackdown on miners in 2021, leading many to relocate to the US, that cemented the country's role as the global hotspot for minting bitcoin. With at least 137 commercial-level facilities across the country, clustered mostly in Texas, the sector uses up to 2.3% of the nation's grid, according to estimates by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), a government agency that gathers and disseminates statistics on energy use. Whereas Joe Biden had promised to crack down on the industry, Donald Trump wants bitcoin to be “mined, minted and made in the USA”, setting the scene for bitcoin mines to roar louder throughout the rural US in the coming years.

“President Trump and his administration have done a lot to deliver on the promises that they made during the campaign, and we see this industry growing rapidly” Fred Thiel, the CEO of Mara, the world's largest miner and owner of the 300-megawatt (MW) site in Granbury, told Fox Business in March. “We want to see the US be the dominant bitcoin mining country in the world.” Shortly before that interview, the firm acquired a 354-MW Texan wind farm to power a new mine, and has begun tapping natural gas from oilfields to fuel new facilities.

Expansion plans published by mining companies show an expanding array of more data centers and more machines across the country. Miners have tapped investors for $3.7bn in bonds since November to fund future growth.

Miners nationwide have likewise unveiled plans to add at least another 2.42 GW in capacity, according to announcements compiled since November. That's equivalent to almost 2m US households, according to EIA estimates.

Bitcoin's “hash rate” – the collective amount of computing power securing the network, of which the US maintains one-third – has increased by one-quarter since Trump's election victory. The respective hash rates of miners Mara and TeraWulf shot up over 40% between October and December last year, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Eric Trump even launched his own mining firm last month, America Bitcoin, a subsidiary of the publicly traded miner Hut 8 Corp.

“Simply buying bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity,” the president said about his son's endeavor. Trump has launched his own cryptocurrency as well.

Polaris Technology Inc is one of many firms expanding. The company is moving to double its footprint in Muskogee, Oklahoma, raising its capacity to use the same amount of energy as approximately 400,000 homes, despite noise complaints from locals. Likewise, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, CleanSpark opened a new site earlier this year.

“They promised to be good neighbors, but so far their noise is constant,” says Dave Simpson, who lives a quarter of a mile from the Wyoming site. The facility is yet to reach full capacity. Simpson worries about how a constant drone will affect his property's valuation. “I miss the quiet times,” he says.

In Granbury, Copenhaver says that the noise has gotten worse since November. Her decibel reader – a must-have for many residents – has been notching higher, she says, now reaching between 80 to 100 decibels on any given day.

Digging for digital gold makes noise for several reasons.

Row after row of industrial-grade fans are typically used to prevent mining computers, known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, from overheating, which can create an enormous din. Crypto mining often also consists of rows of smaller mobile containers in the open air, in contrast to the US's other major construction boom of tech infrastructure: artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are housed in closed structures.

Mary Willis, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University, has spotted a pattern when it comes to the location of mines. Underwritten by bigger budgets, AI data centers are built on large plots of remote land. Miners, on the other hand, flock to the cheapest power and easy grid access, which often means old factory towns.

Miners are increasingly building next to aging power stations – they call such projects co-locations – and striking deals with energy companies to bring underused plants back to life. Mara's Granbury mine is co-located with two gas power stations, both owned by Constellation Energy, which has fought locals over the past year to build a third plant.

Cryptocurrency miners in Texas pay less for electricity than residents on average, according to an Earthjustice report. In 2023, residential ratepayers paid 22.25 cents per kilowatt-hour for their electricity, while specific crypto mining operations paid just 2.5 per kWh, the group estimates. Bitcoin mining raises the cost of electricity for non-miners in Texas by $1.8bn per year, roughly 4.7%, per consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

Trump has also given miners impetus to grow through his commitment to solidifying bitcoin's place in traditional finance, and thus its long-term appreciation. Its price currently sits at roughly $97,000. In December 2024, it topped $100,000 for the first time.

Crypto mining computers race against one another to solve cryptographic puzzles. The correct answer verifies a new batch, or “block”, of bitcoin transactions. The block is added to the blockchain, which functions as a public ledger of all transactions within the network. The computer that cracks the code first is rewarded 3.125 bitcoins.

So, when bitcoin rallies, miners often look to dial up power. But because price surges bring more miners online, the hash rate also grows. This increases mining difficulty, a measurement for how time – consuming it is to solve the cryptographic puzzles needed to validate a block. Unlocking the mining reward requires more guesses, which means more computing power.

Miners thus must increase their facilities' computing power each time hashrate goes up in order to stay profitable, or they must raise the efficiency of their existing equipment.

For instance, for every $1,000 increase in bitcoin price, US mining energy consumption increases by approximately 0.058 terawatt-hours per month, according to a recent study by the Berkeley Lab.

Bitcoin may have lost some of its initial gains following the election, when it rose 50% in just three months, but much of the crypto world anticipates that its long-term rally will resume once new policies take shape. Major financial institutions are increasingly trusting of bitcoin, and Trump plans to create a reserve of cryptocurrency owned by the US government.

Trump issued an executive order on 23 January, “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology”, which promotes the right to mine, and he has hosted crypto mining executives at both Mar-a-Lago and the first White House Crypto Summit. Meanwhile, his promise to unleash domestic oil and gas is welcome news for an industry whose profitability is dictated by access to cheap energy.

Echoing the federal mood, Republican senator Ted Cruz introduced the Facilitate Lower Atmospheric Released Emissions (Flare) Act on 31 March, which proposes using Texas's “stranded” natural gas, a designation indicating the gas would cost more to recover than it would sell for, to help power bitcoin mining.

Trump's promises offer a stark contrast to Biden's proposed 30% tax on miners' electricity and a first-of-its-kind survey of their energy usage. The EIA has no plans to resume this survey.

Anti-mining protests play out in town halls across red states, where activists challenge local officials on why they have showered the industry with tax breaks and subsidized power. Riot Platforms has received almost $136m in power credits from Texas's grid operator since 2022, profiting more in credits than bitcoin mined in certain months, according to company filings.

Despite this, Hood county, where Granbury is located, voted 82% for Trump in 2024, including many of the activists fighting against Mara. Copenhaver admits crypto did not factor into her vote.

On the 600-member Bitcoin Noise Hood County Facebook group, videos are posted each week showcasing the hum while simultaneously praising Trump. One post, shared the morning after the election, shows sunlight streaming through a canopy of trees, as a symphony of birds competes with a deep thunder. “November 6, thank you lord for getting Trump elected,” the video begins, before the narrator details how the sound has destroyed her peace.

Jackie Sawicky, a resident of Corsicana, Texas, had led the 800-member Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining over the past few years. Sawicky got involved in the movement after Riot Platforms began constructing a site in her city. Although the site has so far not raised noise complaints, when finished it will have the 1 gigawatt of capacity – about the same consumption as 600,000 Texan households.

One member told Sawicky they voted for Trump because of abortion. “The unborn babies can't go deaf, but you and yours can,” she replied. “And there are children in your community who are already losing their hearing because of this.” Disillusioned, she has taken a step back from the movement since the election and plans to leave the state.

“If there are policies that support increased mining, there's going to be more pollution and more community impacts,” says Mandy DeRoche, the deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice. DeRoche represents plaintiffs suing miners in three cases across the US, including five Granbury residents who filed a lawsuit against Mara in October, alleging noise-related damage to their health, wildlife and air.

The sound has unleashed a number of health issues, plaintiffs say, including tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss and heart arrhythmia, on top of insomnia and anxiety. Chronic exposure to low-frequency noise is known to affect health, but doesn't receive the attention that water contamination or air pollution attracts, says Willis.

“Disrupted sleep causes a cascade of other issues in someone's life. Lack of sleep is linked to depression, higher stress levels and chronic diseases like hypertension,” she says.

Cyndie Roberson witnessed rampant sleeplessness change her community in Cherokee county, Georgia, when the noise from a mine began to echo through around 800 nearby homes. Neighbors became increasingly anxious, confrontational and angry. One suffered a heart attack. Another left due to acute emotional distress. “There was so much lack of sleep. They weren't the same as they were before,” Roberson says. She sold her “dream retirement cabin” in 2022 and left the county.

In Granbury, Shadden says the sleepless nights have left her anxious and irritable. She endures chronic migraines and struggles at work. A nonstop buzzing in her ears also affects her sleep. After consulting an audiologist last year she was diagnosed with permanent conduction hearing loss.

“It's never going to come back,” she says.

Mara disputes the accusations.

“There is no established link, medical or otherwise, between Mara's operations and the ailments that are being alleged,” the company said in a statement.

The industry contends that noise can be mitigated with immersion-cooled machines, where ASICs are stored in dielectric oil, and by building sound walls.

But critics dispute the efficacy of this promise.

“I wish it were true,” says DeRoche, on the question of immersion cooling. “We can tell from both the research and from the experience on the ground that immersion cooling will decrease the sound in some way, but only by a percentage. It doesn't eliminate the sound,” she says. Immersion cooling often requires external dry coolers, which can be equally as noisy when deployed at scale.

In response to the complaints from Granbury residents, Mara says that by November 2024, a sound wall had been constructed, two-thirds of machines had been replaced with immersion cooling, and an independent sound survey found levels to be below the legal limit of 85 decibels.

The city's residents won an unexpected victory on 31 March. Constellation Energy withdrew its permit application for a third gas plant, citing community concerns and lower-than-expected returns. “This is truly the best news I've had in a year and a half,” said Shadden.

Meanwhile, the noise drones on. “I just want quiet,” says Copenhaver. “We're all feeling very defeated.”

Three years on, she's still waiting for all of her dogs' fur to return. It may never. They're no longer puppies, and they've never known a home undisturbed by the hum of the mine.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"

Buterin believes that simplifying Ethereum by reducing the consensus-critical code will lead to the blockchain's resilience.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that the blockchain's long-term resilience and scalability hinge on making it simple, like Bitcoin. In a blog post on May 3, he described how “Ethereum 5 years from now can become close to as simple as Bitcoin.” Buterin wrote:

“One of the best things about Bitcoin is how beautifully simple the protocol is.”

According to Buterin, Bitcoin's minimalist design and simplicity makes it accessible, so that even a high-school student can grasp the concept and architecture of the protocol. Simplicity, Buterin argued, also brings other benefits, like cutting the cost of creating new infrastructure and maintenance of existing infrastructure, as well as reducing the risk of bugs.

Recent upgrades like proof-of-stake (PoS) and Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) integration have made Ethereum more robust. However, neglecting simplicity of design has added to Ethereum's costs. Buterin explained:

“Historically, Ethereum has often not done this (sometimes because of my own decisions), and this has contributed to much of our excessive development expenditure, all kinds of security risk, and insularity of R&D culture, often in pursuit of benefits that have proven illusory.”

In November, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake proposed a consensus layer upgrade called the ‘Beam Chain.' Buterin believes that the Beam Chain is “well-positioned to be much simpler” than its outdated predecessor, the current beacon chain.

This is because the beam chain will allow for 3-slot finality redesign, which will eliminate complex concepts like separate slots, epochs, and sync committees, Buterin noted. He also highlighted that a basic implementation of 3-slot finality can be achieved through about 200 lines of code, making it much simpler.

The beam chain will also reduce the number of active validators at a time, which would make it “safer to use simpler implementations of the fork choice rule,” Buterin wrote.

The beam chain will also incorporate STARK-based aggregation protocols, which means anyone can be an aggregator. Buterin noted:

“The complexity of the aggregation cryptography itself is significant, but it is at least highly encapsulated complexity, which has much lower systemic risk toward the protocol.”

Buterin added that the reduction of active validators and incorporation of STARK-based aggregators will “likely enable a simpler and more robust” P2P architecture. He went on to say that there is an opportunity to rethink and simplify several facets, from validator entry and exit to inactivity leak. And this can be achieved both by reducing line-of-code (LoC) count and by creating “more legible guarantees.”

Buterin highlighted that the consensus layer is “relatively disconnected” from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) executions, which provides a “relatively wide latitude” to make improvements compared to the execution layer.

Last month, Buterin proposed replacing EVM contract language with RISC-V to boost efficiency by up to 100x. Buterin argued that the adoption of RISC-V will also increase simplicity, since the “RISC-V spec is absurdly simple compared to the EVM.”

However, this would mean ensuring that backwards compatibility for existing applications are preserved. Buterin wrote:

“The first thing that is important to understand is: there isn't one single way to delineate what is the “Ethereum codebase” (even within a single client).”

According to Buterin, the orange area cannot be decreased. The goal, Buterin claimed, is to minimize the green area, by moving code to the yellow area, that indicates “code that is very valuable for understanding and interpreting the chain today, or for optimal block building, but is not part of consensus.” Buterin likened this process to how Apple achieves long-term backwards compatibility through translation layers. He wrote:

“Importantly, the orange and yellow areas are encapsulated complexity, anyone looking to understand the protocol can skip them, implementations of Ethereum are free to skip them, and any bugs in those areas do not pose consensus risks.”

This is why code complexity in the orange and yellow areas have “far fewer downsides” compared to code complexity in the green area.

To reduce the green area, Buterin proposed the following steps:

Phase 1: New precompiles will be written in RISC-V.

Phase 2: Developers will have the option to write contracts in RISC-V.

Phase 3: All precompiles will be replaced with RISC-V implementations through a hard fork.

Phase 4: Implement an EVM interpreter in RISC-V and push it onchain as a smart contract.

The above steps would ensure that Ethereum consensus would “natively” understand only RISC-V, Buterin stated.

Buterin proposed sharing “one standard across different parts of the stack” as a path towards simplification.

For instance, Buterin suggested using a single erasure code for data availability sampling, P2P broadcasting, and distributed history storage. This would minimize the total lines of code, increase efficiency and ensure verifiability, he argued.

Similarly, he proposed having a single shared serialization format across the three Ethereum layers: execution layer, consensus layer, and smart contract calling Application Binary Interface (ABI). Buterin suggested using SSZ, which is easy to decode and widely used.

Lastly, once the EVM has been replaced with RISC-V or another simple language, Buterin proposes switching to a binary tree from the hexary Merkle Patricia tree, both for the consensus and execution layers. This transition could improve efficiency and reduce costs while ensuring that all Ethereum layers can be accessed and interpreted using the same code, Buterin wrote.

Buterin concluded by proposing that Ethereum, following the example of Tinygrad, adopt an explicit maximum line of code target. The goal, Buterin reiterated, is to make “Ethereum consensus-critical code close to as simple as Bitcoin.”

But more importantly, Ethereum needs to adopt an ethos where the simpler option is chosen wherever possible. This would mean favoring encapsulated complexity over systemic complexity.

Buterin reassured that code that deals with processing Ethereum's historical rules will continue to exist with his latest proposal. However, such code should be kept outside the consensus-critical code, or the green area.

In 2020, Monika immersed herself in crypto, maintaining skepticism yet firmly believing blockchain could address key issues like financial disparity and transparency. A book-lover, she's also a passionate food enthusiast.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is doubling down on what he believes is the most underrated strength in crypto: privacy. In a latest X post, he referred to it as the ""true alpha,"" highlighting a focus not only just on scalability, but on decentralization to protecting users' data and autonomy in an increasingly monitored world.

Buterin's take is grounded in both philosophy and code, which is usual for the Ethereum (ETH) creator.

He recently shared technical updates involving advanced zero-knowledge proof systems — mathematical tools that let users prove things without revealing underlying information. These tools aren't just abstract theory anymore; they are being built into privacy-focused Ethereum apps.

Privacy was always the true alpha. https://t.co/fCAO1lENSn pic.twitter.com/oD3If4l62k

His broader message is clear and was voiced in April's essay — without privacy, other values in crypto like openness and decentralization start to break down. He describes privacy as essential for freedom, social order and innovation.

It gives individuals the space to act without constant fear of judgment or manipulation, and in a world where AI and biometric tech are advancing fast, protecting personal data is more urgent than ever, according to Buterin.

ByArman Shirinyan





Vitalik Buterin believes the ""true alpha"" of privacy is not just about protecting individual users, but about keeping larger systems functional. From fair elections to unbiased AI, too much transparency — of the wrong kind — can lead to manipulation and chaos. Privacy, used correctly, helps keep those systems balanced.

Key Points

If you haven't sold your Ethereum (ETH 0.57%) yet despite its decline of about 40% so far this year, you're almost certainly convinced of its long-term utility and there are plenty of reasons to support that thesis.

But if you're holding this coin for the long haul, you should be aware of one insidious risk in particular that's quickly emerging. It's an issue that's probably significant enough to encourage some investors to sell their holdings right now. Let's evaluate this new threat to see if that's a smart move or not.

As you may know, for each transaction processed on Ethereum's network, the transactor must pay a ""gas fee"" with the blockchain's coin, Ether. As of noon on May 1, the average gas fee to make a swap of one token for another is $1.15 on average. The majority of each gas fee gets burned -- in other words, destroyed, removing coins from the total supply.

The fact that gas fees are destroyed means that Ethereum's total supply is constantly under downward pressure. At the same time, new Ether is slowly disbursed by the protocol to the network's stakers to reward them for locking up their capital. So the coin's supply isn't inherently inflationary or deflationary, though it has trended toward mild to moderate inflation during most of its existence so far.

Separately, the Ethereum network has long struggled with high gas fees compared to its competitors. Its efforts to fix that have involved a series of upgrades to its technology as well as a few innovative solutions, like spinning off as much traffic as possible to more efficient independently operated subnetworks called Layer 2s. Those efforts have been phenomenally successful in absolute terms, even if they haven't yet made the Ethereum chain as cheap to use as its peers. During the past three years, average Ethereum transaction fees have fallen by more than 98%.

But that's a problem from the perspective of the coin's total supply. As gas fees have fallen dramatically, so have the amounts of the coin burned with each transaction. With much weaker downward pressure on supply, the impact of its new coin issuance is higher, and because of the tech upgrades already made -- not to mention future updates on the way that will likely send gas fees even lower -- there's not going to be as strong of a counterweight to its supply growth ever again. There's thus now a risk that Ethereum's value will get steadily diluted more rapidly over the next few years.

For investors who had expected Ethereum to retain its value over time -- as misguided of an expectation as that may have been -- this new risk is doubtlessly quite alarming.

Let's put the risk in context. Right now, Ethereum's supply is expected to grow by about 0.7% annually. Meanwhile, its total supply only rose by 9% during the past five years.

That means that supply growth is not a reason to sell your coins. Nor is it a reason for panic.

The Ethereum protocol could be adjusted to be net-neutral or even slightly deflationary given gas fees that are the same or even lower than they are now. That would likely further drive down the rewards for staking, discouraging some investors from parking capital on the chain, but it would at least protect the value of the coin over time. There is also a chance that volume could increase on the network in a durable fashion if sentiment improves, which would result in a higher burn rate and a reduction of the already fairly low supply growth rate. So there are at least a couple of ways this risk could be defused entirely.

There are also a couple of ways that the supply growth could escalate into a real problem that would warrant selling your holdings. Those would likely require strategic mistakes by the chain's developers (such as orienting tech development in a direction that doesn't result in a better ability to compete in growth segments) or for capital devoted to staking to flee to another chain. Neither of those two things is destined to occur, but the chance of at least one of them happening at some point is moderate, and it's important to recognize that a bad strategic move would likely spur capital flight.

In short, this is an issue worth keeping an eye on even if it isn't extremely threatening today. The longer you plan on holding Ethereum, the more you should care about whether it's trending toward a higher inflation rate or not.

BRANDED CONTENT

The best altcoins to buy now may not be the quiet builders or legacy layer 1s, this cycle, meme coins are taking the lead. 

With liquidity flowing into culturally-driven tokens that move fast and market well, many investors are shifting their focus. 

But it's not just memes for the sake of it. 

Coins with actual functionality, like Dawgz AI, which combines AI trading tools with meme energy, are drawing early capital. 

As BTC consolidates near all-time highs, altcoins with strong community momentum and accessible narratives are gaining the upper hand.

Summary

It's easy to dismiss meme coins as short-lived hype, but this cycle tells a different story. Meme tokens aren't just back, they're outperforming. And it's not random, the way capital is rotating right now says a lot about how the market has evolved.

Traders are looking for high-velocity opportunities, especially as Bitcoin holds near the $90K–$95K range. Meme coins offer that, not because they're jokes, but because they move with community, culture, and speed. 

They're liquid, highly shareable, and can tap into viral momentum better than most altcoins with complex tech stacks and slow rollouts.

What's different in 2025 is that some meme coins are adding real features. Staking, AI tools, and DeFi utility are becoming common extensions..

In a market that's becoming more narrative-driven by the day, meme coins are no longer fringe. They're at the center of where early capital is flowing.

Meme coins aren't fading, they're evolving. Below are some standout altcoins gaining real traction by blending viral energy with actual functionality.

Dawgz AI is quickly emerging as a frontrunner in the new wave of meme altcoins. Still in its presale phase at $0.004, the project has already raised over $3.4 million, signaling strong early interest. 

But what makes Dawgz different isn't just the branding, it's the way it ties meme appeal to real use cases.

At the heart of Dawgz AI is an ecosystem of automated crypto trading bots designed to help users generate passive income. 

Combined with staking rewards, audited smart contracts, and fair tokenomics, Dawgz offers more than speculation, it gives holders tools to stay active in the market.

Here's what's attracting early investors and giving this project an edge as altcoin momentum builds:

For an in-depth look at Dawgz AI, you can check the video below by NASS Crypto where he explains why $DAGZ could be one of the best altcoins to buy right now.

<iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/HxKdWsG2c3w?si=EnVYqgMtbASuD63e” title=”YouTube video player” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share” referrerpolicy=”strict-origin-when-cross-origin” allowfullscreen></iframe>

Bonk continues to stand out as one of the most actively traded meme coins in the current cycle, especially within the Solana ecosystem. 

Despite its modest price of $0.00001844, Bonk has a market cap of $1.45 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $166.53 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap. These numbers show it's not just a speculative flyer, it's a meme coin with real trading presence and visibility.

With a circulating supply of 78.89 trillion BONK out of a max supply of 88.87 trillion, the token is already broadly distributed, which reduces risks tied to large, delayed unlocks. And with a volume-to-market cap ratio of 11.46%, Bonk is clearly seeing active demand on exchanges, even amid short-term pullbacks.

Bonk's appeal isn't limited to its branding, it's about liquidity, fast-paced trading action, and being a go-to meme asset in a chain (Solana) that's been regaining serious attention. That combination keeps it firmly on the radar for traders hunting momentum plays.

Turbo has emerged as one of the strongest meme coin performers this week, with a sharp daily surge of 25.51% and volume climbing over $282.53 million, according to CoinMarketCap. 

Priced at $0.005784, Turbo is showing breakout behavior, supported by a market cap of $399.16 million and a tight supply structure of 69 billion tokens, all of which are already in circulation.

This fully circulating supply and high volume-to-market cap ratio (70.78%) suggest that traders aren't just holding, they're actively rotating capital into it. 

The sharp upward trend on the chart reflects strong momentum, likely fueled by renewed retail interest and fast-growing community engagement.

With over 53,000 holders and a chart that's trending bullish in a relatively flat market, Turbo is catching attention as a meme coin with legs, driven not just by branding, but by measurable trading activity and rapid market response.

When meme coins take the lead, things move quickly. Prices can shift in minutes, and trends often explode before most people even notice. That's why getting in early matters more than usual.

These coins don't wait for perfect setups, they react to community buzz, volume spikes, and momentum. If you're watching closely, you'll spot them gaining traction before they hit the news. Waiting too long usually means entering at the top and holding through a dip.

In cycles like this, timing isn't just luck, it's about paying attention to early signals and acting before the crowd does.

Meme coins in 2025 aren't just jokes anymore. Many are starting to add real features, things like staking, trading tools, and reward systems that give people more reason to hold.

This shift means some meme tokens are building actual communities, not just chasing viral pumps. People stick around longer when there's something to use, not just something to talk about.

Dawgz AI is a good example of this change, it still has meme energy, but it also gives users access to AI tools and staking rewards. That kind of balance is what makes certain meme coins last beyond the initial hype.

The best altcoins to buy now are the ones gaining real momentum and this cycle, meme coins are leading the way. 

They're fast-moving, community-driven, and in some cases, offer real utility. 

Timing matters, and early entries are key. 

Projects like Dawgz AI show how meme coins are evolving, combining viral appeal with features like staking and AI tools, making them strong contenders in 2025.

The list shifts often, but some of the most talked-about altcoins right now include tokens like Dawgz AI, especially as meme coins lead the market. These coins are getting attention for their momentum, strong communities, and growing use cases.

No coin can guarantee 1000x gains, but Dawgz AI is one that traders are watching closely. It's still in presale, has a low market cap, and combines AI tools with meme energy, the kind of setup that's delivered huge returns in past cycles.

Meme coins with real engagement and smart tokenomics are strong candidates. Dawgz AI is gaining early traction, and coins like Turbo are seeing rapid growth. As new narratives take hold, these types of altcoins could easily lead the next breakout wave.

Altcoins that offer both community support and real features tend to perform well. Dawgz AI stands out for its AI-based tools and staking model, while Bonk and other Solana-based tokens are also gaining momentum thanks to fast trading and strong liquidity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Altman's eyeball-scanning biometric blockchain orbs officially come to America","https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/04/sam_altman_startup_world/","Sun, 04 May 2025 12:43:00 GMT","

On Thursday, six stores across America opened their doors with a curious proposition: Come on in, let a metal orb scan your irises, and walk out with a new online profile that promises you're an individual human – and a few bucks in crypto for your troubles.

The US retail stores are the latest outgrowth of the World (formerly known as WorldCoin) project - the flagship initiative from Tools for Humanity, a startup co-founded in 2019 by OpenAI boss Sam Altman, along with Alex Blania and Max Novendstern.

World allows you to verify you are an actual person so that you can log into services that require the platform. It specializes in attempting to distinguish real humans from bots and AI-generated imitators. The idea being, if you're running a site or app – internet gaming or dating, say – and you really want to make sure each of your users are genuine individuals and not automated fakes, World provides that level of user identity and authenticity management.

Here's the catch: The most reliable way to do this, the startup argues, is with biometric scanning.

World's key components include the Orb (a glossy sphere that photos your iris and face), World ID (a blockchain-based so-called proof-of-personhood system), the World App (where users manage their ID and get access to services), and Worldcoin (aka WLD, A cryptocurrency distributed to users as a reward).

Unsurprisingly, regulators around the world have raised concerns about this whole idea of an upstart collecting and storing people's biometric data. South Korea fined the startup over $800,000 for privacy violations. Hong Kong ordered it to cease operations entirely, and Germany, Kenya, and Spain have initiated various legal actions against the firm.​

But never mind all that - on to America! The upstart has now set up shopfronts in Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco, with its eyeball-scanning Orb devices. Since SF is also the home of Vulture West, we decided to pop in and have a look.

The store, nestled between Macy's and Louis Vuitton in the city's Union Square, is a tad ramshackle and barely painted. A wooden structure in the center of the room houses eight soccer ball-sized Orbs at varying heights.

World's San Francisco outlet ... The Apple Store it ain't

Here's how it works for us netizens. We'll assume you need to create (or anticipate creating) a verified-human profile on World that's required by an app or service you want to use.

First, you must download the World App, sign in, and after entering the store, wait as it links with a nearby Orb. The app tells you where to stand in relation to the sphere and how to position your head, and the scan of your eyes and face takes a few seconds to complete. That data is used to build a blockchain-based World ID unique to you based on your physically biometric info.

Specifically, that biometric scan is encrypted and sent directly to your phone to be converted into that unique identity token, after which the info is deleted on the Orb itself, the project says. As an incentive, the World app is credited with Worldcoins worth a little over $16 in real-world money. That token is then used later on when logging into things to prove you are a unique, genuinely real human.

Despite all the scrutiny, the startup claims to have 26 million people using its app around the world, with 12 million people having added their biometric data.

At a Wednesday event in SF, Altman and Blania officially launched the organization in the US – there have been trials around the world – and said the outfit wanted to have 7,500 Orbs - four times the total current installed base - in place across the States by the end of the year. The biz has set up a factory in Texas to pump out Orbs for America and the rest of the world, and is working on a miniaturized version to increase verification.

“I'm a very proud American, I think America should lead innovation, not fight it off,” Altman said at the shindig, which you can watch below.


Youtube Video


At the gathering, Blania said the three areas the business will be focusing on are gaming, online dating, and social media, mainly to eliminate bots masquerading as real people. World IDs can help assure people they are chatting to actual people online, he claimed. That said, it's not a panacea; we can think of some drawbacks.

World announced two partnerships during its US launch. A Visa-backed debit card will be issued later this year, and Match.com in Japan will be using World ID to reassure nervous daters.

During our store visit, an assistant said the amount of traffic for the Orbs had been very high, but we observed only a handful of people giving it a try in the 15 minutes in the shop. One man, a visitor to the RSA Conference happening just down the road, said he'd heard about it at the show and ""free money is free money."" We hope he's right. ®

Crypto World News

May 4, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

What if the next top crypto project isn't already sitting at the top of the charts, but is quietly rewriting how digital finance works? While big names enjoy the spotlight, deeper shifts are happening under the radar—real tech upgrades, real-world use, and massive presale momentum. One of them is already catching serious heat.

Qubetics ($TICS) is leading a silent revolution, fixing what the old giants ignored. It's not about hype—it's about utility, scale, and seamless interoperability. Qubetics isn't riding a trend. It's creating the path for cross-chain freedom, real-world asset integration, and a Web3 experience that doesn't require jumping between apps, wallets, or blockchains. If there's one project suited for the future of global blockchain use, this is the one. Let's find out the best crypto to join now.

Qubetics is the world's first full-stack Web3 aggregator. It's on a mission to unify fragmented blockchain ecosystems—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, you name it—into one seamless framework. Through deep-layer interoperability, it allows cross-chain transactions, smart contract execution, and asset movement without switching apps or paying third-party gas fees.

Imagine a business accepting payments from five different blockchains—Qubetics allows it to manage those transactions from a single dashboard. A DeFi app developer builds once, deploys on multiple chains instantly. A logistics firm tracks cross-border shipments using Qubetics' API that reads and writes data on multiple chains in real-time. It's smoother, cheaper, and way more efficient.

The numbers are lighting up. The presale is in its 32nd stage. Current price is $0.2093, with over $16.6 million raised, 25,600+ holders, and 510+ million $TICS sold. And here's where the urgency hits: If $TICS hits $1 after presale—that's 378% ROI. At $5, it becomes 2,289%. $10? That's 4,678%. $15? A mind-blowing 7,066% ROI. This is hands-down the best crypto to join now for those chasing real-world utility and insane upside.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Qubetics is solving problems others ignored. Its utility, interoperability, and ROI potential set it apart. It's not a gamble—it's a blueprint for the next-gen digital economy, one of the best crypto presale.

Filecoin is shaking up decentralized storage by letting people rent out unused disk space. With data demand booming—from dApps to NFTs to AI—storage is gold. Filecoin provides that infrastructure. It's not flashy, but it's absolutely foundational.

It's also becoming faster and more programmable. Its recent network updates now support smart contracts and reduce transaction times, making it ideal for builders launching apps that need permanent, decentralized file hosting. And Filecoin's decentralized cloud competes with giants like AWS but without centralized control or censorship risk.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because the need for decentralized, permanent storage is exploding. Filecoin is the only one doing it at scale. It's easily among the best crypto to join now for long-term infrastructure gains. In 2025, storage is the backbone of everything—content platforms, metaverse files, machine learning data. 

Litecoin might be old, but it's not outdated. It's got lightning-fast block times, low fees, and strong adoption across payment platforms. While newer chains experiment with flashy tech, Litecoin just works—and that matters.

It's also getting leaner and meaner. After its last halving, Litecoin's supply growth rate dropped, increasing scarcity. Its blockchain is still actively used for peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce, and ATM withdrawals globally. It's the “digital silver” for a reason—solid, proven, and efficient.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because trust and reliability matter. Litecoin delivers utility without hype. For anyone watching the best crypto to join now, this is a legacy coin still pulling weight. With institutions slowly adopting Litecoin again, and with upcoming integrations on major wallets and Layer 2 platforms, the stage is set for another run.

VeChain is quietly becoming the default blockchain for logistics, inventory, and compliance. It helps businesses track goods, validate authenticity, and reduce fraud through blockchain-powered transparency.

From pharmaceutical traceability to luxury goods verification, VeChain provides tools that eliminate middlemen and boost trust. Its native VET token fuels these operations, ensuring smooth on-chain transactions. It's also exploring carbon credit systems and government-backed digital IDs, all built on its high-performance Thor blockchain.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it has real-world partnerships and proven solutions. VeChain is practical, efficient, and highly scalable—perfect for the best crypto to join now list. In a world that's demanding more transparency in how products are sourced and shipped, VeChain is in the right place at the right time. 

There's no shortage of tokens in 2025. But when it comes to real-world value, smart tech, and ROI potential, only a handful stand out. Qubetics leads the charge with its interoperability tools and best crypto presale numbers that hint at game-changing upside.

Meanwhile, Filecoin anchors decentralized storage, Litecoin delivers unmatched payment speed, and VeChain powers logistics with next-level transparency. These aren't just speculative assets—they're the infrastructure of tomorrow.

The real wins won't come from the loudest names, but from projects quietly fixing the flaws of yesterday. That's why each of these deserves its place among the best crypto to join now.

A new class of blockchains like Berachain, Story (IPfi), Unichain, Monad, and MegaETH are leading a wave of specialized blockchain launches designed to serve increasingly diverse decentralized finance applications. But these chains aren't just niche alternatives—they're breaking users free from the constraints of the general-purpose status quo. This approach challenges the long-standing notion that a handful of general-purpose networks can support all use cases—and declares that the future isn't one monolithic chain to rule them all, but a unit of optimized environments competing, collaborating, and coexisting.

Institutions are entering with expectations shaped by decades of traditional finance, and the demand is clear. They want performance-optimized platforms that cater to high-speed trading, tokenized intellectual property, and sophisticated real-world asset markets. As these ecosystems grow, questions around cross-chain interoperability, institutional adoption, and competitive dynamics in DeFi infrastructure become increasingly relevant. The game is changing under our feet, and those who cling to general-purpose chains could be left behind.

General-purpose blockchains are beginning to show their cracks as financial institutions start stepping into DeFi. Proponents of specialization rightly argue that tailored infrastructures deliver more than technological advances, providing stronger security guarantees, improved scalability, and compliance features that appeal to institutional participants. For financial institutions exploring on-chain finance,  predictable execution environments, regulatory-friendly frameworks, and reduced counterparty risk are especially mission-critical. These areas where specialized chains offer an edge, with these features already embedded to meet real-world demand, where general-purpose chains would require retrofitting to adapt. 

Some critics warn that a highly fragmented landscape could dilute liquidity and create inefficiencies, making it harder for assets to flow seamlessly across different platforms. Even though cross-chain solutions such as trust-minimized bridges and universal liquidity layers aim to mitigate these risks, their effectiveness remains a critical factor in whether specialization can scale without introducing friction. Thus, the trillion-dollar question remains: can we build this connective tissue fast enough to pace specialization?

Nevertheless, emerging data from beta deployments indicates that specialized networks can attract robust ecosystems, offering developers more freedom to innovate in areas like algorithmic credit scoring, IP rights management, and tokenized commodities. Specialization may struggle in theory, but it's already working in practice.

Recent traction in venture funding reinforces this shift, with projects integrating advanced data-validation methods and cross-chain bridges that facilitate rapid asset movement.  Institutions aren't watching from the sidelines. Adoption is soaring, driven by firms seeking on-chain access to structured financial products and real-world assets on their terms, creating further demand for the compliance-friendly environments that specialized blockchains increasingly provide. 

Experiments in liquid staking, real-world asset tokenization, and hybrid on-chain/off-chain data verification further validate the need for these chains as key infrastructure layers for the next wave of institutional DeFi. However, skeptics argue that increased complexity in managing assets across multiple chains may hinder mainstream adoption. While hurdles are to be expected, UX problems like these can be solved. And in a rapidly diversifying DeFi ecosystem, fragmentation is often a sign of progress. The challenge lies in developing seamless user interfaces and robust interoperability mechanisms that abstract away technical friction.

To many investors, this fragmentation is an opportunity to diversify risk and foster a more competitive market, where specialized chains drive innovation without relying on monopolistic blockchain networks. In other words, it's not fragmentation for fragmentation's sake, but strategic and competitive modularity.

Competing networks such as Berachain and Unichain may redefine how DeFi applications are built and adopted, fostering a more mature market structure where specialized blockchains thrive alongside established platforms. If these emerging networks can sustain liquidity, seamlessly integrate with existing ecosystems, and maintain institutional trust, they could unlock a new era of on-chain finance—one with highly tailored solutions that don't rely on a one-size-fits-all approach. This isn't just a technical shift, but a philosophical one.

The long-term viability of this multi-chain paradigm will depend on whether interoperability frameworks can facilitate frictionless asset movement and whether institutions gain confidence in the governance and security of specialized chains. Whether this shift leads to a more efficient DeFi landscape or a web of isolated networks remains uncertain, but specialization is already reshaping the blockchain industry's trajectory. What is sure is that the future of blockchains is not monolithic. It's modular, specialized, and taking off.

4th May 2025 – (New York) Apple has revised its U.S. App Store policies to permit apps to connect to external payment systems, a development applauded by the crypto community for simplifying access to NFTs, wallets, and decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms while bypassing Apple's charges. Apple's Updated US App Store Guidelines Simplify Crypto App Transactions and NFT Access

Apple's App Store Policy Adjustment Enables Crypto Transactions via External Links

Effective from 2nd May, 2025, these alterations come in response to a federal court ruling that found Apple in breach of a 2021 injunction from Epic Games' antitrust lawsuit. The injunction mandated Apple to allow developers to guide users to alternative payment methods outside the App Store, where the company had previously levied commissions of up to 30%.

With the new regulations, U.S. developers can now seamlessly incorporate buttons or hyperlinks to external websites for digital acquisitions without requiring Apple's endorsement or charging fees. This marks a departure from Apple's previous practice of imposing substantial fees on such transactions and displaying cautionary prompts regarding external payment risks.

The crypto industry perceives this change as a watershed moment. Applications dealing with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi), and wallet services can now sidestep Apple's fees, retaining a higher percentage of revenue per transaction, ranging from 15% to 30%. Developers also have the liberty to leverage third-party payment processors like Stripe, thereby enhancing the adaptability of crypto-native transactions.

Social media responses have largely been optimistic. One individual posted on 3rd May, 2025, stating, “Mobile crypto just got unleashed,” emphasising the advantages for NFTs and DeFi adoption. Nonetheless, some individuals urged caution. Critics highlighted that this update exclusively impacts the U.S. App Store, thereby constraining global crypto initiatives, and pointed out that Apple still prohibits apps facilitating initial coin offerings (ICOs) or cryptocurrency mining.

This policy adjustment aligns with the prevailing global antitrust climate, exemplified by the EU's Digital Markets Act, which exerts pressure on tech behemoths to foster open ecosystems. Apple has expressed disagreement with the court ruling and intends to challenge it, suggesting the possibility of future policy revisions.

In a crypto world where many projects promise the world but few deliver, Solaxy is quickly emerging as one of the rare projects poised to make a real impact. 

For investors who believe in Solana's potential, Solaxy stands out as a project that could lead the next wave in the ongoing bull run.

Summary

With its $33 million presale milestone, Solaxy has officially become the largest ICO of its kind — entering uncharted territory in the crypto market.

Unlike other projects, Solaxy is building the world's first Layer 2 solution for Solana, bringing scalability improvements similar to Ethereum's successful Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. 

However, Solaxy stands apart as the only major player currently focused on scaling Solana, positioning it as the frontrunner in the ecosystem's next phase of evolution.

Designed to tackle Solana's key challenges — including failed transactions, network congestion, and performance slowdowns — Solaxy uses advanced scaling technology to deliver faster, cheaper, and more reliable transactions for both users and developers. 

The team has already launched a testnet block explorer that provides real-time visibility into Layer 2 activity and is preparing to roll out additional features like its cross-chain bridge, integrated development environment (IDE), and official project wiki.

Currently priced at just $0.0017 per token, Solaxy's presale is generating massive interest. Supporters believe the project could deliver substantial returns after launch, with some speculating on potential 50x to 100x gains. 

With Solana reclaiming the $140 mark, sentiment around scaling solutions like Solaxy continues to heat up.

Looking ahead, Solaxy's roadmap highlights plans to operate as a multi-chain asset, compatible with both Solana and Ethereum ecosystems.

 This cross-chain flexibility could give the project a distinct edge as the crypto industry moves toward more interconnected platforms. Branding itself as “the next evolution in Layer 2 technology,” Solaxy aims to unlock the full potential of Solana's infrastructure. 

As new features roll out and token listings draw nearer, the project is poised to attract attention from both Solana loyalists and the broader crypto investment community.

Investor demand is clearly strong — with Solaxy emerging as one of the most heavily funded presales in the market today.

Adding to its appeal, the project offers staking rewards reportedly reaching up to 123%, providing both a technological and financial incentive for early adopters. 

For those seeking storage options, Best Wallet has been spotlighted by crypto platforms as a preferred non-custodial wallet supporting over 60 blockchains, including Solaxy. 

Beyond secure storage, Best Wallet offers portfolio management tools and reward opportunities without the need for KYC — features that are likely to resonate with the growing Solaxy community.

With record-breaking presale figures and strong early technical progress, Solaxy is quickly establishing itself as a leading project in the ecosystem. 

Having raised over $33 million and becoming the largest ICO to date, it stands out as the first true Layer 2 solution designed to enhance transaction speed, reduce costs, and improve reliability. 

As the network looks toward its next wave of scalability solutions, Solaxy's continued development could position it as a dominant force in the space. 

Supported by growing platforms like Best Wallet, the project is positioning itself as the frontrunner in scalability — making now a great time for investors to get involved before its full launch. Visit Solaxy.

According to Lookonchain, an early Ethereum ICO participant sold another 1,500 ETH worth $1.76 million six hours ago, bringing his total sales since April 17 to 16,500 ETH ($29.35 million) at an average price of $1,779. The participant still retains 13,500 ETH valued at approximately $24.82 million. These large-scale sales from a dormant wallet have increased short-term selling pressure on ETH and may impact price dynamics for traders monitoring whale movements.

Shiba Inu has finally cleared its April range, supported by a MACD crossover and rising money flow, but it still needs to hold above $0.000015 to keep the SHIB bullish signal alive. Dogecoin's price prediction is also leaning bullish, with DOGE pushing against a descending resistance line near $0.175.

While SHIB and DOGE battle resistance, BlockDAG (BDAG) is distributing value in real time. Its daily Buyer Battle just awarded 25.29 million BDAG to a single wallet after unmet sales triggered a coin transfer.

With $225M raised, 19.6 billion coins sold, and a special entry price of $0.0019 live until May 13, BlockDAG's breakout looks inevitable. Those who accumulate as much as possible now stand to benefit the most, and if their buy is large enough, they might even win the next Buyer Battle!

After spending most of April trading between $0.000010 and $0.000014, Shiba Inu is showing signs of life. A breakout above the neckline at $0.000011 has triggered a Shiba Inu bullish signal, supported by rising money flow and a confirmed MACD crossover.

Adding weight to the setup, the 90-day Mean Dollar Invested Age has dropped, suggesting dormant tokens are now moving. This change in behavior often lines up with price expansion. For now, the Shiba Inu bullish signal hinges on holding above $0.000015. If that happens, the next target sits near $0.000019.

Dogecoin is currently holding near $0.175, sitting just below a key descending resistance trendline that has capped its progress since February. According to the latest Dogecoin price prediction data, the next few sessions could be critical.

A daily close above $0.19 may shift the structure toward a broader move targeting $0.21 and $0.24, provided volume supports the breakout. At the same time, support between $0.167 and $0.15 remains under pressure. Any slip below $0.167 could send the token back toward $0.13, invalidating the bullish setup.

Every 24 hours, BlockDAG sets a coin sale target. Some days, that target is met. Other days, it isn't. And when that happens, something rare unfolds: The unsold coins are given away, in full, to the highest buyer of the day.

Not long ago, the network set a target of fifty million BDAG. By the end of the day, only 24.71 million had been sold. The remaining 25.29 million? They went straight to the buyer who made the biggest purchase that day.

This is the logic behind Buyer Battles. Every day is a new chance for someone to walk away with much more than they paid for, simply because they acted when others didn't.



Right now, BlockDAG is in Batch 28, priced at $0.0262 per coin. But until May 13, buyers can access a limited rate of $0.0019 per coin. So far, the presale has raised over $225 million and moved more than 19.6 billion BDAG, clear signs that conviction is already turning into capital.

Early participants from Batch 1 have already seen up to 2,520% ROI. And with price forecasts reaching $1 in 2025, what today looks like a small advantage could soon become a defining one.

For now, BlockDAG's Buyer Battles run daily, which means every day brings a chance to stash massive profits. Even if someone doesn't walk away with the surplus, BlockDAG's price predictions and past ROI already prove the game is well worth the candle!



Most breakout signals tell you where momentum might show up: the Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish signal points toward $0.000019, while the Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction suggests its structure could unlock higher targets if it clears $0.18. Both setups are valid. But neither comes with a guaranteed payoff.

That's where BlockDAG separates itself. Its Buyer Battle continues rewarding decisive action every day. One wallet already claimed 25.29 million BDAG in a single day simply by leading when others paused.

What's more, BlockDAG's entry price is now slashed to just $0.0019—but this rate is only available until May 13. Compare that to the $1 forecast for 2025, and it's clear why BDAG is one of the top crypto coins today!

Central Asia is quickly becoming one of the most interesting regions for crypto adoption.

Kyrgyzstan has partnered with Binance to roll out crypto payments across the country, letting people pay with digital assets in real life.

Kazakhstan is working on a national stablecoin settlement system linked to its exchange, while the Kyrgyz central bank has granted legal status to its CBDC prototype and begun testing.

As governments pivot toward digital solutions, the door is wide open for alternative stablecoins that actually serve the people. That's where SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) comes in – a community-driven project that's quietly becoming one of the best altcoins to watch.

Central Asia is rapidly emerging as a hotbed for crypto innovation, with governments embracing digital finance at a pace that's catching global attention.

In Kyrgyzstan, Binance has launched a new crypto payments system through a partnership with local fintech provider O!Money.



This move allows everyday people to make purchases in cryptocurrency at a growing number of retail locations, marking a significant step toward mainstream adoption.

Meanwhile, Kazakhstan is moving forward with plans to integrate a stablecoin settlement system into its national stock exchange. The idea is to modernize financial infrastructure by enabling faster, blockchain-based transactions – a sharp contrast to the traditional systems that dominate much of the region.

This positions the country among the early adopters exploring sovereign digital currencies.

Together, these initiatives show a clear trend: Central Asia isn't just experimenting with crypto – it's laying down a foundation for digital finance at scale.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) isn't just another new crypto project floating in the DeFi sea – it's the backbone of a growing Web3 ecosystem built for the next generation of fans.

At its core, $SUBBD fuses AI-powered content creation, crypto staking, and token-fueled fan experiences into one all-in-one platform. No middlemen. No clunky payment processors.

The token powers everything from premium content access and instant crypto tipping, to early access to beta features and exclusive creator drops.

It also boasts staking rewards – 20% APY during presale – and real-time creator payments in fiat or crypto.
Right now, you can buy $SUBBD for $0.055325, and it has already raised over $300K in its presale.



Price forecasts suggest it could hit $0.08 to $0.301 in 2025, and climb as high as $2.50 by 2030 if adoption scales. Not bad for a token that hasn't even launched on major exchanges yet.

Unlike meme coins that ride hype cycles like emotional rollercoasters, $SUBBD is built to last – and built to reward participation, not speculation. In a market full of fluff, that's worth paying attention to.

In regions like Central Asia, where trust in banks is shaky and cross-border money movement is still stuck in the stone age, $SUBBD offers something refreshingly modern.

It's fast, permissionless, and built for the real world, not just DeFi whales and Discord day traders.

$SUBBD is already delivering that. Through instant, low-fee payments, followers can tip creators, unlock content, and subscribe without needing a bank account or a currency exchange. It's crypto that works like cash, only smarter.



And because it's community-owned, $SUBBD doesn't suffer from the same risks as corporate-controlled stablecoins.

There's no centralized vault, no board of directors, and no algorithmic house of cards ready to collapse. Just a network of everyday people shaping the future of how we consume and support digital content.

If you're looking for new crypto projects with actual substance – and not just the latest pump-and-dump – $SUBBD is one of the best altcoins to keep on your radar.

The global financial landscape is evolving – and Central Asia is quickly becoming a blueprint for what comes next.

As governments, businesses, and everyday users embrace crypto-powered solutions, it's clear that the old system is running out of road.

If you're watching this shift and wondering where it's all headed, SUBBD Token offers a glimpse of the future. It's not just another token – it's the engine behind a new kind of digital experience that puts people, not institutions, in control.

But as always, don't forget to do your own research (DYOR) before investing into crypto.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Binance to launch crypto payments in Kyrgyzstan with new partnership","https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-launches-crypto-payments-kyrgyzstan-partnership","Sun, 04 May 2025 09:49:08 GMT","

 Binance has partnered with Kyrgyzstan to roll out crypto payments and launch blockchain education programs in the country. 

Binance has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Kyrgyzstan's National Agency for Investments to introduce crypto payment infrastructure and blockchain education in the country.

The MoU was formalized during the inaugural meeting of the Council for the Development of Digital Assets, attended by Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, the exchange said in a May 4 press release.

As part of the agreement, Binance will introduce Binance Pay to Kyrgyzstan, enabling crypto-based transactions for visitors and residents.

The partnership also focuses on educational collaboration. Binance Academy will work with Kyrgyz government agencies and financial institutions to develop blockchain-focused learning programs.

“Binance is excited to partner with the National Agency for Investments of the Kyrgyz Republic to drive forward the development of crypto-assets in the region,” Kyrylo Khomiakov, Binance's regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, said.

On April 4, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said he would begin advising Kyrgyzstan on blockchain and crypto-related regulation after signing an MOU with the country's foreign investment agency.

Despite its growing interest in crypto and digital assets, Kyrgyzstan has also revealed intentions to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

On April 18, President Japarov signed a constitutional law authorizing the launch of a CBDC pilot project while also giving the “digital som” legal tender status.

Notably, Kyrgyzstan has a track record in cryptocurrency mining. The country's abundant hydroelectric resources have made it an attractive location for crypto miners seeking low-cost energy.

Over 30% of Kyrgyzstan's total energy supply comes from hydroelectric power plants, but only 10% of the country's potential hydropower has been tapped, according to a report by the International Energy Agency.

Binance's new partnership with the Kyrgyz government comes as the exchange has recently expanded its collaborations with governments worldwide, aiming to strengthen its global presence and influence in the cryptocurrency sector.

In an April 17 interview, CEO Richard Teng said the exchange has been advising multiple governments on establishing strategic Bitcoin reserves and formulating crypto asset regulations.

“We have actually received quite a number of approaches by a few governments and sovereign wealth funds on the establishment of their own crypto reserves,” Teng said.

On April 7, former CZ was appointed as an adviser to Pakistan's Crypto Council, a newly formed regulatory body tasked with overseeing the country's embrace of blockchain technology and digital assets.

Cryptocurrency mining facilities can blanket towns with ‘constant' noise. They're likely to get louder under Trump

First came the dogs' balding – leathery pink patches on otherwise glossy fur coats.

The veterinarian told Shenice Copenhaver it was genetic. But it wasn't long before one of the hairless puppies began stealing blankets to burrow beneath furniture and hide for long stretches.

Around the same time, in the summer of 2022, she first heard the noise: a deep, mechanical howl that becomes shrill closer to the facility. Copenhaver didn't know it then, but bitcoin miners had come to town. Less than a mile away from her home in east Texas, a cryptocurrency mining facility was rumbling to life.

The hum has since become the soundtrack to life for hundreds of residents in the small city of Granbury, with a population of 12,600. It echoes across agricultural land and forests, chasing away deer. It seeps into walls, vibrating bedrooms and dinner tables. Copenhaver's neighbor Cheryl Shadden imagines it is what standing on the edge of Niagara Falls might sound like. Copenhaver says it's like a jet engine is forever stationed nearby.

A video of the site from Shadden's home, recorded on 23 April, shows green pastures against a backdrop of billowing smoke and the roar.

“It wakes you up,” says Copenhaver. “I'll be asleep, and everything will be fine, and then I'll wake up because I can feel it in my chest.”

Large-scale cryptocurrency mining operations began popping up across the United States a decade ago. But it was China's crackdown on miners in 2021, leading many to relocate to the US, that cemented the country's role as the global hotspot for minting bitcoin. With at least 137 commercial-level facilities across the country, clustered mostly in Texas, the sector uses up to 2.3% of the nation's grid, according to estimates by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), a government agency that gathers and disseminates statistics on energy use. Whereas Joe Biden had promised to crack down on the industry, Donald Trump wants bitcoin to be “mined, minted and made in the USA”, setting the scene for bitcoin mines to roar louder throughout the rural US in the coming years.

“President Trump and his administration have done a lot to deliver on the promises that they made during the campaign, and we see this industry growing rapidly” Fred Thiel, the CEO of Mara, the world's largest miner and owner of the 300-megawatt (MW) site in Granbury, told Fox Business in March. “We want to see the US be the dominant bitcoin mining country in the world.” Shortly before that interview, the firm acquired a 354-MW Texan wind farm to power a new mine, and has begun tapping natural gas from oilfields to fuel new facilities.

Expansion plans published by mining companies show an expanding array of more data centers and more machines across the country. Miners have tapped investors for $3.7bn in bonds since November to fund future growth.

Miners nationwide have likewise unveiled plans to add at least another 2.42 GW in capacity, according to announcements compiled since November. That's equivalent to almost 2m US households, according to EIA estimates.

Bitcoin's “hash rate” – the collective amount of computing power securing the network, of which the US maintains one-third – has increased by one-quarter since Trump's election victory. The respective hash rates of miners Mara and TeraWulf shot up over 40% between October and December last year, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Eric Trump even launched his own mining firm last month, America Bitcoin, a subsidiary of the publicly traded miner Hut 8 Corp.

“Simply buying bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity,” the president said about his son's endeavor. Trump has launched his own cryptocurrency as well.

Polaris Technology Inc is one of many firms expanding. The company is moving to double its footprint in Muskogee, Oklahoma, raising its capacity to use the same amount of energy as approximately 400,000 homes, despite noise complaints from locals. Likewise, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, CleanSpark opened a new site earlier this year.

“They promised to be good neighbors, but so far their noise is constant,” says Dave Simpson, who lives a quarter of a mile from the Wyoming site. The facility is yet to reach full capacity. Simpson worries about how a constant drone will affect his property's valuation. “I miss the quiet times,” he says.

In Granbury, Copenhaver says that the noise has gotten worse since November. Her decibel reader – a must-have for many residents – has been notching higher, she says, now reaching between 80 to 100 decibels on any given day.

Digging for digital gold makes noise for several reasons.

Row after row of industrial-grade fans are typically used to prevent mining computers, known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, from overheating, which can create an enormous din. Crypto mining often also consists of rows of smaller mobile containers in the open air, in contrast to the US's other major construction boom of tech infrastructure: artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are housed in closed structures.

Mary Willis, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University, has spotted a pattern when it comes to the location of mines. Underwritten by bigger budgets, AI data centers are built on large plots of remote land. Miners, on the other hand, flock to the cheapest power and easy grid access, which often means old factory towns.

Miners are increasingly building next to aging power stations – they call such projects co-locations – and striking deals with energy companies to bring underused plants back to life. Mara's Granbury mine is co-located with two gas power stations, both owned by Constellation Energy, which has fought locals over the past year to build a third plant.

Cryptocurrency miners in Texas pay less for electricity than residents on average, according to an Earthjustice report. In 2023, residential ratepayers paid 22.25 cents per kilowatt-hour for their electricity, while specific crypto mining operations paid just 2.5 per kWh, the group estimates. Bitcoin mining raises the cost of electricity for non-miners in Texas by $1.8bn per year, roughly 4.7%, per consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

Trump has also given miners impetus to grow through his commitment to solidifying bitcoin's place in traditional finance, and thus its long-term appreciation. Its price currently sits at roughly $97,000. In December 2024, it topped $100,000 for the first time.

Crypto mining computers race against one another to solve cryptographic puzzles. The correct answer verifies a new batch, or “block”, of bitcoin transactions. The block is added to the blockchain, which functions as a public ledger of all transactions within the network. The computer that cracks the code first is rewarded 3.125 bitcoins.

So, when bitcoin rallies, miners often look to dial up power. But because price surges bring more miners online, the hash rate also grows. This increases mining difficulty, a measurement for how time – consuming it is to solve the cryptographic puzzles needed to validate a block. Unlocking the mining reward requires more guesses, which means more computing power.

Miners thus must increase their facilities' computing power each time hashrate goes up in order to stay profitable, or they must raise the efficiency of their existing equipment.

For instance, for every $1,000 increase in bitcoin price, US mining energy consumption increases by approximately 0.058 terawatt-hours per month, according to a recent study by the Berkeley Lab.

Bitcoin may have lost some of its initial gains following the election, when it rose 50% in just three months, but much of the crypto world anticipates that its long-term rally will resume once new policies take shape. Major financial institutions are increasingly trusting of bitcoin, and Trump plans to create a reserve of cryptocurrency owned by the US government.

Trump issued an executive order on 23 January, “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology”, which promotes the right to mine, and he has hosted crypto mining executives at both Mar-a-Lago and the first White House Crypto Summit. Meanwhile, his promise to unleash domestic oil and gas is welcome news for an industry whose profitability is dictated by access to cheap energy.

Echoing the federal mood, Republican senator Ted Cruz introduced the Facilitate Lower Atmospheric Released Emissions (Flare) Act on 31 March, which proposes using Texas's “stranded” natural gas, a designation indicating the gas would cost more to recover than it would sell for, to help power bitcoin mining.

Trump's promises offer a stark contrast to Biden's proposed 30% tax on miners' electricity and a first-of-its-kind survey of their energy usage. The EIA has no plans to resume this survey.

Anti-mining protests play out in town halls across red states, where activists challenge local officials on why they have showered the industry with tax breaks and subsidized power. Riot Platforms has received almost $136m in power credits from Texas's grid operator since 2022, profiting more in credits than bitcoin mined in certain months, according to company filings.

Despite this, Hood county, where Granbury is located, voted 82% for Trump in 2024, including many of the activists fighting against Mara. Copenhaver admits crypto did not factor into her vote.

On the 600-member Bitcoin Noise Hood County Facebook group, videos are posted each week showcasing the hum while simultaneously praising Trump. One post, shared the morning after the election, shows sunlight streaming through a canopy of trees, as a symphony of birds competes with a deep thunder. “November 6, thank you lord for getting Trump elected,” the video begins, before the narrator details how the sound has destroyed her peace.

Jackie Sawicky, a resident of Corsicana, Texas, had led the 800-member Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining over the past few years. Sawicky got involved in the movement after Riot Platforms began constructing a site in her city. Although the site has so far not raised noise complaints, when finished it will have the 1 gigawatt of capacity – about the same consumption as 600,000 Texan households.

One member told Sawicky they voted for Trump because of abortion. “The unborn babies can't go deaf, but you and yours can,” she replied. “And there are children in your community who are already losing their hearing because of this.” Disillusioned, she has taken a step back from the movement since the election and plans to leave the state.

“If there are policies that support increased mining, there's going to be more pollution and more community impacts,” says Mandy DeRoche, the deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice. DeRoche represents plaintiffs suing miners in three cases across the US, including five Granbury residents who filed a lawsuit against Mara in October, alleging noise-related damage to their health, wildlife and air.

The sound has unleashed a number of health issues, plaintiffs say, including tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss and heart arrhythmia, on top of insomnia and anxiety. Chronic exposure to low-frequency noise is known to affect health, but doesn't receive the attention that water contamination or air pollution attracts, says Willis.

“Disrupted sleep causes a cascade of other issues in someone's life. Lack of sleep is linked to depression, higher stress levels and chronic diseases like hypertension,” she says.

Cyndie Roberson witnessed rampant sleeplessness change her community in Cherokee county, Georgia, when the noise from a mine began to echo through around 800 nearby homes. Neighbors became increasingly anxious, confrontational and angry. One suffered a heart attack. Another left due to acute emotional distress. “There was so much lack of sleep. They weren't the same as they were before,” Roberson says. She sold her “dream retirement cabin” in 2022 and left the county.

In Granbury, Shadden says the sleepless nights have left her anxious and irritable. She endures chronic migraines and struggles at work. A nonstop buzzing in her ears also affects her sleep. After consulting an audiologist last year she was diagnosed with permanent conduction hearing loss.

“It's never going to come back,” she says.

Mara disputes the accusations.

“There is no established link, medical or otherwise, between Mara's operations and the ailments that are being alleged,” the company said in a statement.

The industry contends that noise can be mitigated with immersion-cooled machines, where ASICs are stored in dielectric oil, and by building sound walls.

But critics dispute the efficacy of this promise.

“I wish it were true,” says DeRoche, on the question of immersion cooling. “We can tell from both the research and from the experience on the ground that immersion cooling will decrease the sound in some way, but only by a percentage. It doesn't eliminate the sound,” she says. Immersion cooling often requires external dry coolers, which can be equally as noisy when deployed at scale.

In response to the complaints from Granbury residents, Mara says that by November 2024, a sound wall had been constructed, two-thirds of machines had been replaced with immersion cooling, and an independent sound survey found levels to be below the legal limit of 85 decibels.

The city's residents won an unexpected victory on 31 March. Constellation Energy withdrew its permit application for a third gas plant, citing community concerns and lower-than-expected returns. “This is truly the best news I've had in a year and a half,” said Shadden.

Meanwhile, the noise drones on. “I just want quiet,” says Copenhaver. “We're all feeling very defeated.”

Three years on, she's still waiting for all of her dogs' fur to return. It may never. They're no longer puppies, and they've never known a home undisturbed by the hum of the mine.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"

According to @Cobie on Twitter, while many cryptocurrency market participants claim their primary interest is technology, trading data and investment flows show most capital is directed toward speculative assets rather than foundational blockchain tech projects (source: @Cobie, Twitter). This trend highlights a disconnect that traders should consider when evaluating project fundamentals versus token performance, as market momentum often favors highly volatile, speculative coins over genuine technological innovation.

Adopting Michael Saylor's strategy of buying for the balance sheet has clearly taken off among many publicly traded firms, substantially enriching their stock prices and shareholders. 

But what does it mean for the future of the bitcoin price? NYDIG Research crunched the numbers, and the results are striking. 

""If we apply a 10x ""money multiplier""—a rule of thumb reflecting the historical impact of new capital on bitcoin's market cap—and divide by the total supply of bitcoin, we arrive at a rough estimate of the potential price impact: a nearly $42,000 increase per bitcoin,"" NYDIG said in a research report. 

To reach this conclusion, the analysts at NYDIG reviewed Strategy (MSTR), Metaplanet (3350), Twenty One (CEP), and Semler Scientific's (SMLR) cumulative equity valuation since they adopted the bitcoin buying strategy. This gave the analysts an outline of how much money they could theoretically raise by issuing shares at current stock prices to buy more bitcoin. 

If this analysis comes true, the projected price is nearly a 44% increase from the current spot price of $96,000 per bitcoin. If capitalized, Wall Street money managers perhaps wouldn't mind showing this PnL chart to their clients, especially given the current volatility and uncertainty in the market. 

""The implication is clear: this 'dry powder' in the form of issuance capacity could have a significant upward effect on bitcoin's price,"" NYDIG Research said. 

Bitcoin's limited supply also bodes well for the analysis. Publicly-traded companies already hold 3.63% of bitcoin's total supply, with the lion's share of those coins being held by Strategy. Adding private company and government holdings, the total is at 7.48% according to BitcoinTreasuries data.

Demand could also grow further in the near future if the U.S. government finds “budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin” for its strategic bitcoin reserve.

 A group of nine US Senate Democrats say they will oppose the stablecoin bill in its current form, threatening its chances of passing. 

A group of US Senate Democrats known for supporting the crypto industry have said they would oppose a Republican-led stablecoin bill if it moves forward in its current form.

The move threatens to stall legislation that could establish the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins, according to a May 3 report from Politico.

Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made.

Among the signatories were Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Andy Kim — all of whom had previously backed the bill when it passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March.

The bill, introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty, is formally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act.

The Senate is expected to begin floor consideration of the bill in the coming days, with the first vote potentially taking place next week.

The bill has been championed by the crypto industry as a landmark step toward regulatory clarity. However, the Democrats' about-face reflects growing unease within the party.

Although revisions were made to the bill after its committee approval to address Democratic concerns, the lawmakers said the changes fell short. They called for stronger safeguards related to Anti-Money Laundering, national security, foreign issuers, and accountability measures for noncompliant actors.

The statement was also signed by Senators Raphael Warnock, Catherine Cortez Masto, Ben Ray Luján, John Hickenlooper and Adam Schiff.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Angela Alsobrooks were absent from the list, who co-sponsored the bill alongside Hagerty.

Despite their objections, the Democratic senators emphasized their commitment to shaping responsible crypto regulation. They reportedly said they “are eager to continue working with our colleagues to address these issues.”

On April 27, Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, criticized the US Federal Reserve for quietly maintaining a key anti-crypto policy that favors big-bank-issued stablecoins, despite relaxing crypto partnership rules for banks.

Long explained that while the Fed recently rescinded four prior crypto guidelines, a Jan. 27, 2023, statement was left intact in coordination with the Biden administration.

The guidance, according to Long, blocks banks from engaging directly with crypto assets and prohibits them from issuing stablecoins on permissionless blockchains.

However, Long noted that once a federal stablecoin bill becomes law, it could override the Fed's stance. “Congress should hurry up,” she urged.

 Arizona state senator and Bitcoin advocate Wendy Rogers said, “Bitcoin doesn't need Arizona, Arizona needs Bitcoin."" 

Bitcoiners and United States government officials have criticized Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs' decision to veto a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves.

“This will age poorly,” Casa co-founder and cypherpunk Jameson Lopp said in a May 3 X post. Bitcoin (BTC) entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said, “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.”

“If she can't outperform Bitcoin, she must buy it,” Pompliano said. Crypto lawyer Andrew Gordon said, “We need more elected officials who understand that Bitcoin and crypto are the future.”

Wendy Rogers, who co-sponsored the bill with State Representative Jeff Weninger, also voiced her disappointment.

“Politicians don't understand that Bitcoin doesn't need Arizona. Arizona needs Bitcoin,” Rogers said.

On May 2, Hobbs vetoed the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which would have permitted Arizona to invest seized funds into Bitcoin and create a reserve managed by state officials. “Today, I vetoed Senate Bill 1025. The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Hobbs said.

Rogers said she would refile the bill during her next session. Rogers also pointed out that Arizona's state retirement system already holds stocks of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR).

“Which is basically a leveraged Bitcoin ETF. Arizona's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill will be back. HODL,” Rogers said. The stock price of Strategy rose 32% in April, the most significant monthly gain since November 2024.

However, well-known crypto skeptic Peter Schiff sided with Hobbs. “The government should not be making decisions to use public funds to speculate in cryptocurrencies,” Schiff said.

Arizona would have become the first US state to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve if it had passed.

Arizona joins several other US states where similar efforts have failed. Similar proposals in Oklahoma, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have stalled or been withdrawn recently.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","‘Everything is lining up' — Tokenization is having its breakout moment","https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenization-breakout-moment-blackrock-multibank-telegram","Sun, 04 May 2025 12:31:49 GMT","

 Tokenization is gaining real traction as BlackRock, Libre, and MultiBank make billion-dollar moves, signaling the shift from theory to execution. 

Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is evolving from an abstract concept to a practical financial tool as institutional players increasingly test and deploy blockchain-based infrastructure at scale.

This past week alone saw a flurry of announcements from both traditional financial institutions and blockchain-native firms advancing their RWA initiatives.

On April 30, BlackRock filed to create a digital ledger technology shares class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust fund. It will leverage blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for investors.

The DLT shares will track BlackRock's BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY).

On the same day, Libre announced plans to tokenize $500 million in Telegram debt through its new Telegram Bond Fund (TBF). The fund will be available to accredited investors and usable as collateral for onchain borrowing.

The week's biggest headline came from Dubai, where MultiBank Group signed a $3 billion RWA tokenization deal with United Arab Emirates-based real estate firm MAG and blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk. The deal is touted as the largest RWA tokenization initiative to date.

“The recent surge isn't arbitrary. It's happening because everything's lining up,” Eric Piscini, CEO of Hashgraph, told Cointelegraph:

Related: Real-world asset tokenization: Unlocking a new era of finance

Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of RedStone, said the recent announcements “demonstrate that tokenization has moved beyond theoretical discussions into practical application by market leaders.”

He added that the growing adoption by big institutions gives the space more credibility, making others feel more confident to join in and help boost new ideas and investments.

Kazmierczak stated that the renewed interest in RWA tokenization is primarily driven by US President Donald Trump's pro-crypto administration and growing regulatory clarity.

Trump, who has pledged to “make the US the crypto capital of the world,” has taken a different approach to crypto compared to the Biden administration. That era saw an aggressive crackdown from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), prompting many firms to withdraw from US operations.

However, the narrative appears to be shifting. Since Trump's election victory, the SEC has dropped or paused over a dozen enforcement cases against crypto companies.

Additionally, the DOJ recently announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency enforcement unit, signaling a softer approach to the sector.

Aside from regulatory clarity, advancements in technological capabilities, especially in wallets, have also played a key role in driving tokenization adoption, Felipe D'Onofrio, chief technology officer at Brickken, said.

“In parallel, macroeconomic pressures are pushing institutions to search for efficiency and liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets,” he added.

Ethereum continues to serve as the primary hub for RWA tokenization, thanks to its mature ecosystem, broad developer support and robust infrastructure.

“Ethereum remains by far the most suitable blockchain for large-scale RWA issuance due to its unparalleled security, developer ecosystem, and institutional adoption,” Kazmierczak said.

However, he noted that dedicated RWA-specialized ecosystems like Canton Network, Plume, and Ondo Chain are building compelling alternatives with features designed explicitly for compliant asset tokenization.

According to data from RWA.xyz, the market value of tokenized US Treasurys currently stands at $6.5 billion. Ethereum accounts for the lion's share of the market, hosting over $4.9 billion in tokenized Treasurys.

Herwig Koningson, CEO of Security Token Market, said companies like BlackRock have shown that it's possible to build large-scale tokenized products, worth billions of dollars, using more than one blockchain at the same time.

He said this shows that the success of tokenizing assets doesn't depend so much on which blockchain is used, but rather on what the company needs the system to do.

“This is why you will see many banks and traditional firms use permissioned blockchains or even private DLT systems,” Koningson said.

Yet hurdles remain. Regulation continues to be a significant barrier, especially for risk-averse institutions requiring guarantees around compliance and privacy.

Technical limitations also persist, chiefly the lack of interoperability between blockchain platforms, according to Piscini. However, he said hybrid models are gaining traction by offering the privacy of permissioned systems with optional future interoperability with public chains.

Looking ahead, Piscini estimated that more than 10% of global financial assets could be tokenized by the end of the decade. D'Onofrio also made a modest projection, estimating that between 5% and 10% of global financial assets could be tokenized by 2030.

On the other hand, RedStone's Kazmierczak predicted that approximately 30% of the global financial system will be tokenized by the end of this decade.

In terms of numbers, STM.co predicted that the world's RWA market will be anywhere between $30 and $50 trillion by the end of 2030.

Most firms predict that the RWA sector will reach a market size of between $4 trillion and $30 trillion by 2030.

If the sector were to achieve the median prediction of about $10 trillion, it would represent more than 50 times the growth from its current value of around $185 billion, including the stablecoin market, according to a Tren Finance research report.

 Binance has partnered with Kyrgyzstan to roll out crypto payments and launch blockchain education programs in the country. 

Binance has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Kyrgyzstan's National Agency for Investments to introduce crypto payment infrastructure and blockchain education in the country.

The MoU was formalized during the inaugural meeting of the Council for the Development of Digital Assets, attended by Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, the exchange said in a May 4 press release.

As part of the agreement, Binance will introduce Binance Pay to Kyrgyzstan, enabling crypto-based transactions for visitors and residents.

The partnership also focuses on educational collaboration. Binance Academy will work with Kyrgyz government agencies and financial institutions to develop blockchain-focused learning programs.

“Binance is excited to partner with the National Agency for Investments of the Kyrgyz Republic to drive forward the development of crypto-assets in the region,” Kyrylo Khomiakov, Binance's regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, said.

On April 4, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said he would begin advising Kyrgyzstan on blockchain and crypto-related regulation after signing an MOU with the country's foreign investment agency.

Despite its growing interest in crypto and digital assets, Kyrgyzstan has also revealed intentions to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

On April 18, President Japarov signed a constitutional law authorizing the launch of a CBDC pilot project while also giving the “digital som” legal tender status.

Notably, Kyrgyzstan has a track record in cryptocurrency mining. The country's abundant hydroelectric resources have made it an attractive location for crypto miners seeking low-cost energy.

Over 30% of Kyrgyzstan's total energy supply comes from hydroelectric power plants, but only 10% of the country's potential hydropower has been tapped, according to a report by the International Energy Agency.

Binance's new partnership with the Kyrgyz government comes as the exchange has recently expanded its collaborations with governments worldwide, aiming to strengthen its global presence and influence in the cryptocurrency sector.

In an April 17 interview, CEO Richard Teng said the exchange has been advising multiple governments on establishing strategic Bitcoin reserves and formulating crypto asset regulations.

It wasn't supposed to be there.

These days, we would call them proprietary blends. But in the late 1500s and early 1600s, individual alchemists called the medicines they cooked up in their labs ‘secrets'. And  thanks to a study published in Heritage Science, we now know a little bit more about the secrets of one alchemist in particular. 

It turns out that Tycho Brahe, mostly known for his study of astronomy, had his own basement laboratory for mixing medicines—including some particular elements.

Brahe's famed observatory, located in his castle-like Uraniborg observatory on the island of Ven, in what is now Sweden, was dismantled following his death in 1601. But recently, a team of researchers from the University of Southern Denmark and National Museum of Denmark analyzed five shards rescued from what would have been the site's old garden between 1988 and 1990. It's believed those shards came from the basement alchemical laboratory.

The authors examined cross sections of the shards for 31 trace elements using mass spectrometry by converting sample molecules into charged ions. While there was plenty of the expected elements on the shards (four of which were glass and one of which was ceramic)—including nickel, copper, zin, tin, antimony, gold, mercury, and lead—there was one find that surprised the experts: tungsten. 

“Tungsten is very mysterious,” Kaare Lund Rasmussen, archaeometry expert at the University of Southern Denmark, said in a statement. “Tungsten had not even been described at that time, so what should we infer from its presence on a shard from Tycho Brahe's alchemy workshop?”

That's a question that doesn't have a clear answer. Rasmussen said that while tungsten does occur naturally in certain minerals, and could have made its way into Brahe's laboratory that way, there's another plausible theory: Brahe had a secret substance to help create his medicines for Europe's elite. 

Not classified as an element until the 1780s, tungsten likely first popped up in German chemistry as ‘Wolfram,' and Brahe's medicine were known to have German influence. “Maybe Tycho Brahe had heard about this and thus knew of tungsten's existence,” Rasmussen speculated. “But this is not something we know or can say based on the analyses I have done. It is merely a possible theoretical explanation for why we find tungsten in the samples.” 

“Most intriguing are the elements found in higher concentrations than expected,” Rasmussen said, “indicating enrichment and providing insight into the substances used in Tycho Brahe's alchemical laboratory.” 

The business of creating medicines was a secret one. Brahe, like others of the day, didn't share the makeup of prescriptions. Brahe was known for his plague medicine—a highly complicated remedy to create that could have had up to 60 ingredients, including everything from snake flesh and opium to copper, oils, and herbs. Could the resulting medicine have also included tungsten as part of the finished product?

“It may seem strange that Tycho Brahe was involved in both astronomy and alchemy, but when one understands his worldview, it makes sense,” said Poul Grinder-Hansen, senior researcher and museum curator at the National Museum of Denmark, in a statement. “He believed that there were obvious connections between the heavenly bodies, early substances, and the body's organs.” 

Gold and mercury were often used by alchemists (including Brahe) in medicines, and it was common for alchemists to link the Earth's elements to properties in space and the human body. And there's a whole list of those connections. Silver tied to the Moon and the brain, while gold was a link to the Sun and the heart. Jupiter and the liver were connected through tin, Venus and copper by the kidneys, Saturn and the spleen by lead, Mars and the gallbladder by iron, and Mercury and the lungs by (of course) mercury. In this thinking, gold was a common ingredient for medicines of the day, including ones Brahe took. 

Where tungsten fits into the mix, however, isn't clear. So far, it remains a secret.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Phony Physics of Star Wars Are a Blast","https://www.wired.com/story/the-phony-physics-of-star-wars-are-a-blast/","Sun, 04 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

I'm a huge fan of Star Wars. The first movie (no, not Episode 1) came out when I was young, so I grew up thinking about the Millennium Falcon and lightsabers. Perhaps it sparked my interest in science—even if it's not exactly science fiction. Oh, there's a nice way to start a nerd fight: Is Star Wars “science fiction” or is it “space fantasy”?

Either way, you have to admit there are things in there that look like science. I mean, anytime you deal with stuff in space, it's an opportunity to talk about science. That's exactly what I'm going to do, since today is Star Wars Day. May the 4th be with you!

What scientific things in Star Wars are just not scientific? I'm going to go over some of the more interesting ideas, but don't get me wrong. I'm using these errors as a way to talk about science, but I don't think they need to be fixed. A more realistic Star Wars would probably be boring. Read on, you'll see what I mean.

The opening scene in Star Wars shows a massive Star Destroyer pursuing a smaller rebel ship. You hear the rumble of the engines, and it gives you the impression of a powerful vessel. Unfortunately, it's just not possible.

Let's think about sound for a moment. Suppose you tap a coffee mug on the side with a spoon. You hear a nice little plink. That's because the tap caused the ceramic material to oscillate back and forth, which pushes on the air around it, compressing it. This compressed air then pushes on other nearby air as it expands. The whole process produces a pressure wave, and this pressure wave is what we call sound.

Is it possible to have a sound wave without air? Sure. You don't need air, but you need something for the pressure wave to travel through. This could be a solid or water or really anything that lets a higher pressure push on parts with lower pressure. Sound waves need some kind of medium to “wave” in. In space there's … nothing.

Well, that isn't totally true. There are charged particles like protons and electrons moving through space—remnants of solar wind or debris from exploding stars. In a solar system there's also some dust. Still, the density of this “gas” would be so tiny, you could hardly measure it. Much too low to transmit sound.

So why do moviemakers put sound out there in the void? Well, most of us have never been in space, and when things collide silently it just seems wrong. The sound of that massive Star Destroyer reminds us of a big ocean vessel passing close by—something we can relate to.

One of the big ideas in physics is that forces change the motion of an object. If you apply a constant, continuous force to an object—and there is no counterforce like wind drag—that object will speed up and continue to speed up forever.

We call this Newton's second law, and it works for multiple forces on an object by replacing them with a single force called the net force, as shown below. Here m is the mass of the starship and a is its acceleration.

So if a starship is running its engines, it won't travel at a constant speed. The only way you could do that is by turning the engines off. Instead, you're rushing faster and faster toward what appears to be a moon … Wait, that's no moon! Too late.

There's another problem with the motion of starships: How do you turn? There are two things to think about here. First, both the acceleration and the velocity of the ship are represented by vectors (the symbols with the arrow on top). That means direction matters. Moving to the left is different than moving to the right.

The second thing to consider is the definition of acceleration. It's the rate of change for velocity, and we can write it as the following:

Since velocity is a vector, changing direction means it's accelerating, even if the speed is constant. But wait, we just saw that Newton's second law says you can't accelerate without a force. So in order to turn your cool starfighter, you need a force that pushes perpendicular to the direction of travel—a sideways force.

Take a look at the X-wing fighter. Does it have any thrusters on its side to help it turn? Nope. Instead, it turns to the left by rolling a little to the left and performing a banked turn. This is exactly how an airplane on Earth flies.

But what does an airplane have that an X-wing doesn't? Right, the answer once again is air. For an airplane, there is this external force due to the interaction between the air and the wing, which we call lift. If a plane tilts to the side a little bit, this lift force can be used as a sideways force to make it change direction. That's how things fly down here.

So, there's your problem. The X-wing and other spacecraft use this same banking move to turn in space, even though there's no lift on the wings. If you watch the battle over the Death Star, those TIE fighters and X-wings are zipping around like it's a WW II dogfight. Again, it's wrong, but I'm fine with it.

Star Wars isn't very explicit about what is shot out of a handheld blaster or from the cannons on an X-wing. They sure look like lasers beams, and I think that's what most people imagine. But they can't be lasers. Why not? Two reasons.

First, a laser beam is light, and we know the speed of light: 3 x 108 meters per second. If an X-wing shot a laser at a TIE fighter that was 1 kilometer away, it would take just 3 millionths of a second to hit the target. If you have a film (like the real movie) that plays at 30 frames per second, each frame lasts 0.03 seconds. That means the laser would be so fast you wouldn't see it. It would be like it's instantaneous. That's not good for movies. You want to see the shot.

Second, even if it was slower, the beam would be invisible in space. Remember, we see things when light enters our eye. That means there are two kinds of things you can see: things that produce light, like your phone screen, and things that reflect light. Your hand doesn't give off visible light, but the sunlight bounces off your hand and hits your retina.

Now, a laser produces “collimated” light that all goes in the same direction. So the only way you can see it is if there's something in the path of the beam that reflects light into your eye. On Earth there is something: air. And not just air, but dust and stuff. I took this picture below, and I amped it up even more by spraying fake fog into the beam.

But you know what you don't have in space? Yep, air. So the only way you could see a laser beam is if it hits you right in the eye. That would be bad. Bottom line: Laser beams are invisible in space.

When you call a friend, your phone transmits electromagnetic waves to the nearest cell tower. That tower sends a signal (through a wire) to another tower, which then sends an EM wave to your friend's phone. None of these signals can move faster than the speed of light, so if you're calling from New York to London, your words would take 0.02 seconds to get there. No big deal, they can wait two-hundredths of a second.

Now imagine you want to communicate with another friend on the surface of Mars. Well, Mars is much farther away, so information traveling at the speed of light can take up to 20 minutes to arrive, depending on the positions of the planets. It's still not a big issue, but it is annoying.

OK, one more example. You have just one more friend, and they recently took a new job near the star Alpha Centauri—one of the closest stars to Earth. How long would it take to send a phone call to that star? The answer is 4.4 YEARS. No one has time for that.

You see the problem. In Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, Obi-wan sends a transmission from the planet Geonosis to Coruscant. If these planets are in different star systems, the signal could easily take 10 years to arrive. That really makes for a complicated plot. It's much simpler to just make communications instantaneous.

But really, maybe Star Wars isn't even wrong here. I mean, it is in a whole different galaxy, and they have special powers like The Force. Perhaps they figured out a way to send information faster than the speed of light. One thing is certain: Ignoring the science makes for great entertainment. But understanding the science sure makes you appreciate our home on Earth. Go outside right now and listen to all the sounds!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Why Pigeons at Rest Are at the Center of Complexity Theory","https://www.wired.com/story/how-a-problem-about-pigeons-powers-complexity-theory/","Sun, 04 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

They say a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, but for computer scientists, two birds in a hole are better still. That's because those cohabiting birds are the protagonists of a deceptively simple mathematical theorem called the pigeonhole principle. It's easy to sum up in one short sentence: If six pigeons nestle into five pigeonholes, at least two of them must share a hole. That's it—that's the whole thing.

“The pigeonhole principle is a theorem that elicits a smile,” said Christos Papadimitriou, a theoretical computer scientist at Columbia University. “It's a fantastic conversation piece.”

But the pigeonhole principle isn't just for the birds. Even though it sounds painfully straightforward, it's become a powerful tool for researchers engaged in the central project of theoretical computer science: mapping the hidden connections between different problems.

The pigeonhole principle applies to any situation where items are assigned to categories, and the items outnumber the categories. For example, it implies that in a packed football stadium with 30,000 seats, some attendees must have the same four-digit password, or PIN, for their bank cards. Here the pigeons are football fans, and the holes are the 10,000 distinct possible PINs, 0000 through 9999. That's fewer possibilities than the total number of people, so some people must have the same digits.

This proof is notable not just for its simplicity, but also for what it leaves out. Many mathematical methods for proving that something exists are “constructive,” meaning they also show you how to find it. “Nonconstructive” proofs, like ones based on the pigeonhole principle, don't have this property. In the football stadium example, knowing that some people must have the same PINs won't tell you what they are. You can always go through the stands asking each person in turn. But is there a simpler way?

Questions like this one, about the most efficient way to solve problems, are at the heart of the branch of computer science known as computational complexity theory. Complexity theorists study such questions by lumping problems into classes based on certain shared properties. Sometimes the first step toward a breakthrough is simply defining a new class to unite problems that researchers hadn't previously studied together.

That's what happened in the 1990s, when Papadimitriou and other complexity theorists began to study new classes of problems, in which the goal is to find something that must exist because of the pigeonhole principle or another nonconstructive proof. That line of work has led to important progress in disparate fields of computer science, from cryptography to algorithmic game theory.

Christos Papadimitriou (inset) and Oliver Korten showed that the empty-pigeonhole principle connects to important problems in math and computer science.

By January 2020, Papadimitriou had been thinking about the pigeonhole principle for 30 years. So he was surprised when a playful conversation with a frequent collaborator led them to a simple twist on the principle that they'd never considered: What if there are fewer pigeons than holes? In that case, any arrangement of pigeons must leave some empty holes. Again, it seems obvious. But does inverting the pigeonhole principle have any interesting mathematical consequences?

It may sound as though this “empty-pigeonhole” principle is just the original one by another name. But it's not, and its subtly different character has made it a new and fruitful tool for classifying computational problems.

To understand the empty-pigeonhole principle, let's go back to the bank-card example, transposed from a football stadium to a concert hall with 3,000 seats—a smaller number than the total possible four-digit PINs. The empty-pigeonhole principle dictates that some possible PINs aren't represented at all. If you want to find one of these missing PINs, though, there doesn't seem to be any better way than simply asking each person their PIN. So far, the empty-pigeonhole principle is just like its more famous counterpart.

The difference lies in the difficulty of checking solutions. Imagine that someone says they've found two specific people in the football stadium who have the same PIN. In this case, corresponding to the original pigeonhole scenario, there's a simple way to verify that claim: Just check with the two people in question. But in the concert hall case, imagine that someone asserts that no person has a PIN of 5926. Here, it's impossible to verify without asking everyone in the audience what their PIN is. That makes the empty-pigeonhole principle much more vexing for complexity theorists.

Two months after Papadimitriou began thinking about the empty-pigeonhole principle, he brought it up in a conversation with a prospective graduate student. He remembers it vividly, because it turned out to be his last in-person conversation with anyone before the Covid-19 lockdowns. Cooped up at home over the following months, he wrestled with the problem's implications for complexity theory. Eventually he and his colleagues published a paper about search problems that are guaranteed to have solutions because of the empty-pigeonhole principle. They were especially interested in problems where pigeonholes are abundant—that is, where they far outnumber pigeons. In keeping with a tradition of unwieldy acronyms in complexity theory, they dubbed this class of problems APEPP, for “abundant polynomial empty-pigeonhole principle.”

One of the problems in this class was inspired by a famous 70-year-old proof by the pioneering computer scientist Claude Shannon. Shannon proved that most computational problems must be inherently hard to solve, using an argument that relied on the empty-pigeonhole principle (though he didn't call it that). Yet for decades, computer scientists have tried and failed to prove that specific problems are truly hard. Like missing bank-card PINs, hard problems must be out there, even if we can't identify them.

Historically, researchers haven't thought about the process of looking for hard problems as a search problem that could itself be analyzed mathematically. Papadimitriou's approach, which grouped that process with other search problems connected to the empty-pigeonhole principle, had a self-referential flavor characteristic of much recent work in complexity theory—it offered a new way to reason about the difficulty of proving computational difficulty.

“You're analyzing the task of complexity theory using complexity theory,” said Oliver Korten, a researcher at Columbia.

Korten was the prospective student with whom Papadimitriou had discussed the empty-pigeonhole principle right before the pandemic. He came to Columbia to work with Papadimitriou, and in his first year of grad school he proved that the search for hard computational problems was intimately linked to all other problems in APEPP. In a specific mathematical sense, any progress on this one problem will automatically translate into progress on a host of others that computer scientists and mathematicians have long studied, such as the search for networks that lack simple substructure.

Korten's paper immediately attracted attention from other researchers. “I was quite surprised when I saw it,” said Rahul Santhanam, a complexity theorist at the University of Oxford. “It's incredibly exciting.” He and others have since built on Korten's breakthrough to prove a flurry of new results about connections between computational difficulty and randomness.

“There is amazing richness to this,” Papadimitriou said. “It goes to the bone of important problems in complexity.”

Spotify generates the vast bulk of its income from ads and subscriptions, but for the past few years the music-streaming giant has also been quietly building out a developer tooling business. Backstage, a project it open-sourced in 2020, has been adopted by more than 2 million developers across 3,400 organizations, including Airbnb, LinkedIn, Twilio, and American Airlines.

Backstage helps companies build customized “internal developer portals” (IDPs), bringing order to their infrastructure chaos by combining all their tooling, apps, data, services, APIs, and documents in a single interface.

Want to monitor Kubernetes, view cloud costs, or check your CI/CD status? Enter Backstage.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which accepted Backstage as an incubating project in 2022, reports that Backstage was one of its top 5 projects last year in terms of velocity and activity. And it's this momentum that is leading Spotify to double down, with various premium tools and services on the horizon.

Companies can already use the core Backstage product for free, including an array of open source plugins that extend its functionality. But Spotify started selling premium plugins in 2022, such as Backstage Insights, which displays data related to active Backstage usage within an organization. And last year, Spotify got serious about its dev tools business play, announcing Spotify Portal for Backstage in beta: a premium, oven-baked incarnation for those lacking the resources (or inclination) to set everything up themselves. “Backstage in a box,” is the general idea.

The fully managed SaaS product is now edging toward general availability in the coming months, with design partners and customers including the Linux Foundation and Pager Duty already on board.

“We discovered that there were a lot of different customer profiles,” Tyson Singer (pictured above), Spotify's head of technology and platforms, explained to TechCrunch in an interview at KubeCon last month. “Our original theory was that Backstage was going to be bigger for mid-size to large enterprises dealing with a lot of complexity, but we found that small companies also see these same problems. And so having a hosted version makes everything so much easier.”

Spotify also teased a couple of new premium Portal plugins at KubeCon, including AiKA (“AI knowledge assistant”), which is basically a chatbot initially developed internally for its own employees.

The result of a 2023 hackathon, Spotify says that AiKA is now used by 25% of its workforce weekly to query the company's collective knowledge base. So rather than bombarding support channels in Slack, employees can just ask AiKA, which is trained on its own internal documents and data. 

Singer also says that AiKA's utility — providing instant answers to questions — motivates employees to make sure all their documents are up-to-date because it makes AiKA smarter. If someone doesn't get a good response to a question, they can see what source was used in the response, and provide feedback to ensure the source document is improved.

“It [AiKA] kind of sounds simple, but it's powerful, and we got super-high adoption very quickly internally,” Singer said. “[I think why is because] it's not just developers that are using it — everybody in the R&D organization has gotten into it, which also brings more people into the Backstage ecosystem. But also it creates this very positive fly-wheel between quality and discovery.”

Spotify has confirmed that an alpha version of AiKA is set to launch for third parties imminently. And while it won't be at feature parity with its own internal version initially, it should go some way toward bolstering Backstage's stickiness as a premium product in the long run.

Backstage isn't the only home-grown developer product Spotify is looking to monetize. Some 20 months ago the company announced Confidence, an A/B experimentation platform that has remained in stealth ever since.

“We have a few customers who are paying [for Confidence], but we are really focused on Portal right now,” Singer said. “We're being very selective about the customers that we let in the door.”

According to Singer, Spotify will have more to say about Confidence later this year, though he did hint at potential synergies between Confidence and Portal in the form of a plugin that brings some simple feature-flagging functionality into Portal.

When all is said and done, creating a developer tooling side-hustle on top of its day job as an online music emporium has surely been a major undertaking. But there has been good reason for all of this. More than a decade ago, Spotify created its own container orchestration platform called Helios to support its transition to a microservices architecture. While Spotify eventually open sourced Helios to spur wider uptake, it ultimately lost out to Google's Kubernetes, which went on to conquer the world.

Spotify ditched Helios and joined the throngs on Kubernetes — a “painful” decision at the time. And what we're seeing now with Backstage is a response to that: an effort to ensure that Backstage is the industry standard IDP, and that its own developers aren't forced to transition to something else that comes along.

“When you have a product that gets replaced by an external product, particularly an open source one, that migration cost is just tremendous,” Singer said. “And so we decided that we don't want that to happen to a product that is literally the foundation of how we do development at Spotify.”

While Spotify went some way toward heading off that problem when it open-sourced Backstage in 2020, the premium stuff that's now following is really to ensure that it sticks. 

“We're a business — and we also want to build a healthy business on top of all this,” Singer said. “We're not just trying to cover costs. At the end of the day, we have a lot of value trapped inside Spotify right now.”

If you took high school biology, you probably learned about cell division: a crucial process in all life forms officially called mitosis. For over one hundred years, students have learned that during mitosis, a parent cell becomes spherical before dividing into two daughter cells of the same size and shape. A new study, however, might rewrite many, many biology textbooks.

Researchers revealed that mitosis doesn't always feature cell rounding (when a parent cell becomes spherical), meaning that the resulting daughter cells aren't always symmetrical, nor do they carry the same function. Their work is detailed in a study published Thursday in the journal Science, and holds important implications for understanding cell division in diseases such as cancer.

“Students learn that when a cell divides, it will generate a uniform spherical shape. Our study, however, shows that in real living organisms, it is not as simple as that,” Shane Herbert, co-lead author of the study and a researcher at the University of Manchester's faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, said in a university statement.

In the new study, researchers observed blood vessel formation in zebrafish embryos. The growth of new vessels consists of slow-moving cells led by a single fast-moving cell. When the lead cell underwent mitosis, it didn't become spherical or experience rounding. The asymmetrical division allowed it to form two different cells: one slow-moving cell and one fast-moving cell to take the lead in the parent cell's place. Previously, scientists had mainly associated asymmetric cell division with specialized cells called stem cells.

“Using transparent 1-day old zebrafish embryos allows us to study a dynamic process like cell division inside a living organism,” said Holly Lovegrove, co-lead author of the study and a lecturer in cardiovascular sciences at The University of Manchester. “We are therefore able to make movies of this fundamental cell behaviour and in doing so reveal exciting new aspects of how tissues grow.”

Furthermore, the researchers noted that the shape of the parent cell can determine whether its division will be symmetrical or asymmetrical. For example, they observed that shorter and wider cells were more likely to become spherical and split into two similar daughter cells. In contrast, longer and thinner cells didn't “round-up,” and as a result, divided asymmetrically.

To further investigate this, Herbert, Lovegrove, and their colleagues manipulated the size of human parent cells via micropatterning. “Micropatterning allows us to generate specifically shaped microscopic patches of proteins that cells can stick to,” explained Georgia Hulmes, co-first author of the study and a postdoctoral research associate at The University of Manchester's School of Biological Sciences. “The cells will then take the shape of the patch. This therefore allows us to change the shape of the cells and test how these shapes impact on the subsequent cell division.”

“Our research suggests that the shape of the cell before it divides can fundamentally direct whether a cell rounds, and importantly, if its daughters are symmetric or asymmetric both in size and function,” Herbert said.

As a result, scientists might one day be able to generate cells with different functions by controlling the shape of their parent cells. More broadly, their analyses suggest that asymmetric divisions play an important role in the creation of different tissues and organs. The study also holds important implications for diseases such as cancer, in which asymmetric division could lead to different cell behaviors potentially associated with cancer progression.

In the meantime, our thoughts are with all the students, parents, and school administrators who might soon have to spend an exorbitant amount of money on updated textbooks.

A dating app that, just this week, announced a creepy new wearable, has been found to have publicly exposed users' data. The data was granular and personal, including their approximate locations.

The app, Raw, says it is dedicated to promoting “real and unfiltered love” through its unique user interface, which resembles BeReal (it utilizes the front and back cameras of your phone), but for dating. Raw also recently announced a bizarre new piece of hardware, called the Raw ring, which purports to allow users to track the location of their lovers to ensure they're not cheating (there's no way that could ever lead to problematic scenarios, right?). Unfortunately, it would appear that Raw has also been promoting something else in quite an “unfiltered” fashion: users' data.

TechCrunch reports that due to a lack of basic digital security protections, Raw was accidentally leaving users' personal information open to public inspection. Indeed, prior to this week, anyone with a web browser would have been able to access detailed app user information, including their date of birth, display names, sexual preferences, and quite specific “street-level” location data.

TechCrunch says it discovered the security deficiencies during a brief test of the company's app. Raw was downloaded onto a virtualized Android device, and then TC staffers used a network monitoring tool to observe the data being transmitted to and from the app. The analysis showed that the personal data was not being protected with any sort of authentication barrier. TC says it discovered the problem within the first “few minutes” of using the app. TC also notes that, while Raw claims to protect users with end-to-end encryption, it found no evidence that E2EE was present. They break down the security loophole like so:

When we first loaded the app, we found that it was pulling the user's profile information directly from the company's servers, but that the server was not protecting the returned data with any authentication. In practice, that meant anyone could access any other user's private information by using a web browser to visit the web address of the exposed server — api.raw.app/users/ followed by a unique 11-digit number corresponding to another app user. Changing the digits to correspond with any other user's 11-digit identifier returned private information from that user's profile, including their location data. This kind of vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a type of bug that can allow someone to access or modify data on someone else's server because of a lack of proper security checks on the user accessing the data.

Gizmodo reached out to Raw for more information. According to statements made to TechCrunch, the security issues have been patched as of Wednesday.  “All previously exposed endpoints have been secured, and we've implemented additional safeguards to prevent similar issues in the future,” Marina Anderson, the co-founder of Raw dating app, told the outlet.

It's not uncommon for companies to poorly secure user data. Strange as it may sound, security is not a particularly huge priority in the software industry. It can be time-consuming, expensive, and may slow down other parts of production, so many companies simply don't bother with it. With a dating app, however—a business which is dedicated to handling users' most intimate (literally) and sensitive data—it obviously pays to spend a little bit more time locking stuff down. As they say: wrap it before you tap it.

If you live in El Paso, Las Cruces, or Ciudad Juárez and feel like you've been inhaling the Chihuahuan Desert lately, you're not imagining things. The Borderplex region is experiencing its dustiest season since the Dust Bowl, the period of devastating dust storms that hit North America a century ago.

NASA's Aqua satellite captured an image of the airborne dust from low-Earth orbit on April 27. The swaths of airborne particles are part of an ongoing set of storms pummeling the Borderplex, the transnational area that includes southern New Mexico, West Texas, and the Mexican state of Chihuahua. The imaged storm is just the latest in a string that is yeeting dried-up lake beds and parched soil into the southern skies.

This year's drought-exacerbated dusty season is “truly exceptional—one for the record books,” said Thomas Gill, an environmental scientist at the University of Texas at El Paso, in a NASA Earth Observatory release. Gill has tracked dust activity across the planet (and the Borderplex specifically) for decades.

The event imaged above is the tenth “full-fledged” storm of the year—a full-fledged event being a storm that reduces visibility to less than half a mile, Gill said. That's more than five times the average of 1.8 storms per year—and makes 2025 the worst dust season since 1936, when the Dust Bowl swept America, laying into El Paso with 11 storms.

Why are there so many storms this year? You can blame it on a climatic cocktail of drought and record-breaking wind. March was the windiest month the region has seen in over 50 years, Gill said, and the area is in “the worst drought we've seen in at least a decade.” My allergy clogged sinus is thanking its lucky stars it isn't in the Southwest right now.

But dust storms aren't just an eyesore. The events contribute to traffic accidents and raise the risk of cardiorespiratory problems, and may worsen the spread of Valley Fever, a fungal infection. Gill and his colleagues estimated that dust storms rack up over $150 billion in damage nationally each year, hitting farmers, the energy and healthcare industries, and households especially hard.

NASA's satellites and modeling tools are helping scientists monitor and better understand how dust travels—and way up in the atmosphere, the particles can traverse significant distances. One March storm sent particles all the way to Greenland, according to Santiago Gasso, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Maryland who is based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in the same release.

So far in 2025, the Borderplex has accrued 28 dusty days—already exceeding the annual average of 22 over the last quarter-century—and more dust is in the forecast for the region this weekend. If you don't have to, you may want to hold off on cleaning your windows.

If you've found yourself thinking about Fullmetal Alchemist lately and considering a re-read, WebToon's got you covered.

The updated take of Hiromu Arakawa's shonen classic will come to the digital comics platform, fully colored and formatted for vertical scrolling. The aim is to make it more accessible and expand its reach, and joins other notable IP like DC Comics and Dropout's Dimension 20 in coming to WebToon in recent years. Yongsoo Kim, WebToon's global head, called Fullmetal ” the kind of story that stays with you for life. Bringing this iconic series to audiences gives both longtime fans and first-timers a new way to enjoy this story. Seeing it in full color, reformatted for a digital reading experience will make the iconic story more accessible and immersive than ever.”

Fullmetal Alchemist is no stranger to re-releases: along with republished editions in the past few years, it was retold as a more faithful anime in 2009's Brotherhood, and its saga was covered across a live-action film trilogy released in 2017 and 2022. This year marks the 15th anniversary since the end of the original manga (on June 11, 2010) and Brotherhood (July 4, 2010), so the WebToon version's coming out at an appropriate time.

For those curious to see how it turns out, Fullmetal Alchemist will hit WebToon starting Tuesday, May 7. If you want more of Arakawa's work, she's currently writing and drawing the manga Daemons of the Shadow Realm and did character design for Netflix's Moonrise anime.

Neuralink has allowed some paralyzed patients to regain some control of their lives.

Bradford Smith is just the third patient to be fitted with a Neuralink Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) yet, impressively, advancements in the technology have allowed him to edit and post a YouTube video using just his thoughts. Smith is affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or ALS, a disease wherein the nerves that control his muscles degenerate, which has led to him being unable to move and talk. However, Elon Musk's investments in Neuralink are finally paying off, and the patient was able to make so many advancements that were previously unheard of.

It was just February last year that the first human Neuralink implantee was reportedly able to move a mouse around by just using their brain. One month later, the patient has grown comfortable enough with the tech that they're already playing chess and Civilization 6 using the BCI. These achievements are already impressive in their own right, but the second Neuralink patient upped the ante a few months later. In July 2024, Alex, who suffered from a spinal cord injury, received the BCI implant. After a month of getting used to the system, he was reportedly able to use CAD applications to build a custom 3D-printer charging accessory for the implant and play Counter-Strike 2 with his teammates

In the video we embedded, Smith shared what the BCI looked like: a small cylindrical stack about the size of five quarters with several fine electrode threads sticking out of it. It was implanted into his brain by a robot, ensuring that no blood vessels were damaged during the process. From there, the Neuralink connects to a MacBook Pro via Bluetooth, which processes all the neural data gathered from his brain.

Smith noted that the Neuralink is attached to his motor cortex, meaning it can only read his intended movements — not his thoughts and words. Initially, he tried moving his hands to move the cursor, but the system did not respond well. After further study, the engineers working on his implant discovered that moving his tongue is the best way to move the cursor. Bradford said that he doesn't think about his tongue when moving the cursor, much like how you don't think about moving your arm or wrist when operating a mouse. His subconscious quickly took over the operation, and he now controls a computer seamlessly through his BCI.

Aside from operating the mouse, the third patient was finally able to regain his voice with AI. Bradford and his team used old video and audio recordings, from before his ALS diagnosis, to train a speech synthesis AI. This allows us to hear him once again, narrating a video which he created himself — something that would've been impossible just over a year ago.

BCI technology is advancing at remarkable speed, with patients now able to use it to operate a computer by themselves. Elon Musk's firm isn't by any means the only one working on it. For example, a Chinese company was reportedly working on a competing tech called Neucyber in April last year with the backing of Beijing. The government has even started working on a plan to standardize the technology, which would hopefully make it easier for different companies to cooperate.

Advancements in BCIs are helping paralyzed patients get some control over their lives back, allowing them to use computers without external assistance. And as this tech matures even more, maybe we will have a future where ALS and other debilitating diseases would no longer be a life sentence for those affected.

It may not be fully compliant with the Wi-Fi 7 spec, but the Roamii BE Lite is an affordable option for bargain shoppers.

Affordable pricing

Full-featured web interface and smartphone app

Wall mounts included for satellites

Only two downstream 1 GbE ports and no USB

Dual-band only


Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


For better or worse, the Wi-Fi 7 router market has bifurcated into two distinct groups. On the one hand, full-featured tri- or quad-band routers support 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to give customers the best possible performance from the latest wireless standard. However, many manufacturers are courting cost-conscious customers with dual-band routers that only support the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The lower price point comes at the expense of outright performance that we expect from the best Wi-Fi routers.

MSI's Roamii BE Lite is a dual-band router that is available in a two-pack. Each wireless node has just two 1 GbE downstream ports, and no USB ports are available for adding network storage. However, with a price tag of just $225 and the ability to cover up to 5,800 square feet, the Roamii BE Lite is an affordable option if you want to take advantage of the added capacity afforded by Wi-Fi 7, and not necessarily the speed boosts.

Whereas competitive offerings like the Amazon Eero 7 and the TP-Link Deco BE5000 are short and stubby, the Roamii BE Lite takes on a taller tower-esque design. However, MSI switches things up with satellite nodes that have a triangular base, making each a three-sided tower. One of the front-facing sides has a large “7” molded into the plastic, while the other side features an “MSI” logo and an LED strip that displays the status of the network.

The third side is the rear panel, which includes a Sync button to pair the satellites, two 2.5 GbE ports, a 2.5 GbE WAN port, and a proprietary barrel-style port for power. There are also latches on the back for attaching the satellites to a wall with included wall mounts. This is an appreciated and surprising addition from MSI, as satellite wall mounts are often available as an optional add-on from the manufacturer or as a third-party aftermarket accessorIncluding of the mounts in a mesh router system that costs just over $200 is admirable.



The top triangular portion of each satellite is home to ventilation slits to keep the electronics inside cool.

Wi-Fi Standard

Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)

Wi-Fi Bands

2.4 GHz: up to 688 Mbps

5 GHz: up to 4,323 Mbps

CPU

1.5 GHz quad-core processor

Memory

2GB RAM, 256MB NAND Flash

Number of Internal Antennas

4

Coverage

5,800 square feet, as-tested, with two nodes

Ports

2 x 1 GbE for LAN, 1 x 2.5 GbE for WAN

MSI recommends that you complete the initial configuration of the Roamii BE Lite using its smartphone app, which is appropriately called MSI Roamii. Once installed, you'll need to scan the QR code on the back of the satellite. In my case, the app then located the primary router (it doesn't matter which you choose as the primary gateway).

Once the app identified the gateway, I assigned an administrator username and password. After some additional configuration and optimizations worked in the background, the Roamii app confirmed that the setup process was complete.

The Roamii BE Lite satellites come pre-paired, so you don't have to go through any additional steps during the setup process. I plugged both units in at the start of the setup process, and both showed up as being online once the installation was complete.

The Roamii BE Lite is configurable using a web GUI or the MSI Roamii app. I preferred to use the former on this review unit, although the smartphone app is just as full-featured. This is a welcome change compared to similarly priced mesh routers like the Deco BE5000 and the Eero 7, which feature app-only controls.

The main dashboard that appears when you first login to the web GUI (accessible via http://msirouter.login/ ) provides a high-level overview of the network. You get charts for CPU and memory utilization along with a traffic analyzer. You'll also see the network topography, connected nodes, and internet status.

There are comprehensive controls for wireless settings, including wireless mode (i.e., 802.11 a/n/ac/ax/be mixed mode), WPA2/WPA3 security, and a ""soft"" activation for Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). An IoT network can be enabled, with further settings to only give connected devices access to the internet, with no private network access.

You can even prevent IoT devices from talking with each other on the network. For families, MSI includes a Child Network option, which allows you to schedule times when a child can access the internet on their device. So, if you don't want your elementary-school-age kids accessing content on their tablets after bedtime, you can lock them down here.

When it comes to added security, MSI provides its FortiSecu software, which Trend Micro powers. It allows for remote device management, enhanced parental controls, and additional privacy and data security controls. This security suite comes free of charge with the Roamii BE Lite, which is a nice add-in considering that Amazon required you to sign up for Eero Plus to get this kind of protection on its Eero routers.

As we mentioned in the introduction, the Roamii BE Lite already has one hand tied behind its back regarding performance – it lacks the high-performance 6 GHz band, which we've seen allow some flagship mesh routers, like the Asus ZenWiFi BQ16 Pro, to surpass 3.5 Gbps in our throughput tests.

The Roamii BE Lite also only supports 240 MHz channels instead of 320 MHz for the full Wi-Fi 7 spec (although 240 MHz is still higher than the 160 MHz supported by Wi-Fi 6E). With that said, the Roamii BE Lite does leverage other benefits of the Wi-Fi 7 spec, like 4K-QAM and multi-link operation (MLO).

As always, our Wi-Fi client testbed is a Windows 11 desktop with an MSI Pro B650M-A Wi-Fi motherboard, AMD Ryzen 5 7600 CPU, 32GB of DDR5, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, and an MSI Herald-BE Wi-Fi 7 PCIe adapter. All these devices use the most recent software, BIOS, firmware, and drivers (where applicable).

The iPerf3 throughput tests are conducted with our Windows 11 server equipped with an onboard 10 Gbps wired network card connected to the 1 Gbps LAN port on the primary Roamii BE Lite node. Wireless tests are then performed multiple times at 6-foot and 25-foot distances. Wireless tests are initially run with the network free of added traffic from other clients. Next, the tests are repeated with simulated traffic from additional users accessing the network (for our testing, we use six clients streaming 4K video from YouTube Premium).

At first glance, the 6-foot iPerf3 tests might seem a little disappointing, with the Roamii BE Lite topping out at 934 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, which fell behind the Deco BE5000 (1,070 Mbps) and the Eero 7 (1,097 Mbps). However, once we extended the test to 25 feet, the Roamii BE Lite pulled into first place at 541 Mbps. The Deco BE5000 fell to 472 Mbps, while the Eero 7 plummeted nearly a third of its 6 feet performance to 346 Mbps. This strong, long-distance performance (against its rivals) would echo in later tests.

The 2.4 GHz iPerf3 test saw the Roamii BE Lite take the gold in the 6-doot and 25-foot tests.

Moving to congested traffic runs, the Roamii BE Lite slipped into second place at 6-feet (825 Mbps) behind the Eero 7 (886 Mbps), but ahead of the Deco BE5000 (791 Mbps). But again, its 25-foot performance put it on top, with 433 Mbps compared to 335 Mbps and 189 Mbps for the Eero 7 and Deco BE5000, respectively.

The 2.4 GHz test again showed strong performance for the Roamii BE Lite. It far outpaced its rivals, hitting 108 Mbps at 6 feet and maintaining 65 Mbps at 25 feet. The Eero 7 and Deco BE500 were far behind in both metrics.

Overall, I saw consistent performance from the Roamii BE Lite, with no hiccups in our testing. No router crashes, no software bugs in the web GUI, and the smartphone app was rock solid.

MSI's Roamii BE Lite was a strong performer across the board in our Wi-Fi throughput tests, and it proved to be stable with multiple devices connected (at one point, I had over 40 Wi-Fi devices connected across the two satellite nodes).

My main hangup with the Roamii BE Lite echoes what I've said about previous dual-band Wi-Fi 7 routers – they aren't fully compliant with the spec, which leads to confusion among consumers shopping to upgrade their older routers. The Roamii BE Lite is limited in performance by not including the 6 GHz band, although its 5 GHz performance is competitive with its peers.

It would also have been nice if MSI could include 2.5 GbE across the board, not just for the WAN port. Instead, we get two 1 GbE downstream ports. The Deco BE5000 and Eero 7 include at least one 2.5 GbE port for LAN on each satellite.

The Roamii BE Lite is priced at around $225 online. For comparison, the Deco BE5000 is $179 for a two-pack, and the Eero 7 2-pack sells for $279. Given its performance credentials, I'd consider that competitive pricing. If the 1 Gbps LAN ports aren't a big deal to you, we consider the Roamii BE Lite to be the pick of this dual-band Wi-Fi 7 mesh router litter.

Former U.S. women's national team star Carli Lloyd was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame on Saturday. In her speech, the two-time World Cup winner and Olympic gold medalist acknowledged the cost of success and apologized to her former teammates for being distant.

“I wasn't there to make friends or follow the crowd. I was there to push myself to the very top while helping my team win championships. That drive often meant keeping people at a distance,” Lloyd said, donning her new red Hall of Fame blazer. “I avoided unnecessary drama. I rarely showed weakness, and vulnerability wasn't something I allowed myself to express. I wouldn't say I have regrets, but if there is one thing I do wish, I wish I had let more people understand me over the years.

“I operated like an emotionless machine. I was intense and I truly believed that the only way for me to survive in such a cutthroat environment was to be that way. So, to my teammates, I want to say this: I'm sorry I wasn't always able to give you all of me.”

The 42-year-old, who was inducted in her first year of eligibility as part of the 2025 class, gave a 20-minute speech reflecting on her expansive career, sharing a vulnerable side rarely seen throughout her 17 years on the pitch.

 

 

A post shared by National Soccer Hall Of Fame (@soccerhof)



“I finally had the space to truly reflect on my career,” Lloyd said, pausing to settle her emotions. “I knew I didn't need to stand up here and talk about how much I loved the game or how hard I worked. Most of you already know that about me. What I wanted to share wasn't from a perspective of a competitor, but as a person, a human being, and what I kept coming back to again and again was one simple question, was it all worth it?”

Lloyd retired in 2021, ending her playing career with her hometown club, NJ/NY Gotham FC, in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She is considered one of the most impactful players in USWNT history. She is best remembered for her performance in the 2015 World Cup final against Japan, in which her 16-minute hat-trick led the U.S. to its first World Cup title in 16 years. Her third goal is one of her most iconic.

In her speech, Lloyd reflected on her love of winning, which often cost her relationships with those around her.

“There was nothing I loved more than winning but winning comes at a cost, and I paid that price,” Lloyd said, “Yet in return, I gained more than I ever could have imagined. Soccer provided me with the tools to conquer anything that life throws my way.”

She alluded to the controversial moments, both professional and personal: from the snubs that fueled her, to the trainer who drove a wedge between her family and her — a relationship that was later repaired.

Lloyd's acceptance included a nod to her six-month-old daughter, Harper, whom she called her “greatest accomplishment.” Lloyd and her husband, Brian, welcomed Harper in October after struggles with unexplained infertility.

“I always knew I wanted a child, but I had no idea how this little baby could completely change me as a person,” Lloyd said. “Unlike during my playing career, I have been present. I have allowed myself to be vulnerable, emotional and fully engaged in every moment I get to spend with her.

“Being her mom is my greatest joy, and thanks to everything I experienced in my career, I now have the tools to help her navigate this world. I want to teach her how to be strong, to chase her dreams and to understand that nothing in life is handed to you, you earn it.”

Lloyd was inducted into the 2025 class alongside another USWNT great, Mary Harvey, who was the goalkeeper on the 1991 World Cup-winning team.

While Harvey's playing career was brief by today's standards, the seasoned soccer executive has been involved in World Cup bids, founded U.S. Soccer's Athletes' Council and held key roles with Women's Professional Soccer as well as FIFA. She is currently the CEO of the Centre for Sport and Human Rights.

Harvey is credited with inspiring the U.S. culture of giving back through sport. That was most evident with her role in introducing her former teammate and current U.S. Soccer president, Cindy Parlow Cone, to the power of sport governance by bringing her to her first Athlete Council meeting when she was only 17 years old.

“Sport is one of society's great social inventions, and has so much to offer us all, and clearly, it has left an indelible positive imprint on my life and led me to a career path dedicated to the impact and purpose that I never expected,” Harvey said. “Part of that journey has been to be, and continue to be, an agent of change, make it better for those who come after you, which is what we said way back then.”

The 2025 Hall of Fame class also includes Mark Abbott, the former MLS Deputy Commissioner, Chris Armas, head coach of the Colorado Rapids, and former U.S. men's goalkeeper Nick Rimando.

With a professional soccer career that spanned 17 years for the U.S. Women's National Team, legendary forward Carli Lloyd was officially inducted into the national Soccer Hall of Fame at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas.

“There was no greater honor than wearing the red, white and blue,” Lloyd said. “Yes, it was extremely hard. There were countless sacrifices along the way, but every bit of it was worth it, because I loved the game, the lessons I learned, the relationships that I forged and the experiences I gained were more than I ever could imagine.”

The National Soccer Hall of Fame inducted a total of five members for the 2025 class: Mark Abbott, Chris Armas, Mary Harvey, Nick Rimando, and Lloyd.

With the USWNT, Lloyd won two FIFA Women's World Cup championships in both 205 and in 2019. She also earned two Olympic gold medals in 2008 and in 2012 and added a bronze medal to her resume in 2020.

Although Lloyd contributed a wealth of time into her career with 316 caps and 134 international goals, the two-time FIFA Player of the Year (2016, 2017) set the tone with the all-time fastest hat trick in FIFA World Cup history. She's also the only player to score a hat trick in a FIFA World Cup Final.

At the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Final against Japan, Lloyd scored her first goal in the third minute and went on to score a total of three in 17 minutes. Her third goal was most iconic as her long shot stemmed from 54 yards out and gave the USA a 3-0 lead. The USWNT went on to defeat their long-time opponents 5-2.

From her performance, Lloyd received the Golden Ball and the Silver Boot as the No. 2 goalscorer in the tournament.

Lloyd's grit in the game was a pattern for the USA in critical moments as she also led the team to a crucial win at the 2012 London Olympics. Lloyd opened the game with a goal in the eighth minute and after Japan equalized, Lloyd led the team to victory as her brace secured the win.

Along with Lloyd's successful international career, she also played in two professional soccer leagues.

Lloyd began her career in the Women's Professional Soccer league with the Chicago Red Stars, Sky Blue, and Atlanta Beat and she went on to play in the National Women's Soccer League with Western New York Flash, Houston Dash, and ended her career in her home state with Gotham FC.

Following her retirement, Lloyd became a mom in October 2024 as she and her husband welcomed their daughter Harper Anne Hollins into the world.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

Post

The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) has officially announced a change in the date of the 2025 Egypt Cup final. 

The final, originally scheduled for May 20, will now be played on June 5, 2025.

The decision comes in light of Pyramids FC's involvement in the CAF Champions League final, where they are going to face South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns in the first leg on May 24 in South Africa. 

The EFA opted to grant Pyramids more time to prepare, especially with their congested schedule in both domestic and continental competitions.

Pyramids are also scheduled to play Petrojet on May 17 in the seventh round of the Nile Egyptian League title phase, which means it would be congesting to play the Egypt Cup final three days later then travel to South Africa and play on May 24.

In contrast, Zamalek's schedule is not significantly affected by the original Cup final date. 

The White Knights are going to face Pyramids on May 13 in the sixth round of the title phase, followed by a match against Petrojet on May 24.

One additional storyline impacted by the Cup final's new date involves Ahmed Mostafa “Zizo”, Zamalek's star player. 

Al Ahly must officially announce Zizo's signing after the end of the current season—following the Egypt Cup final on June 5.

However, Al Ahly will depart for the United States on June 4 to participate in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. 

As a result, Zizo will not be able to travel with the squad and will instead have to join the team later, after the Cup final and the official join to Al Ahly.

He spoke in Vitoria-Gasteiz after the 0-0 tie

Atlético Madrid coach Diego Simeone spoke following the team's 0-0 draw against Deportivo Alavés on Saturday to reflect on an even battle, and also look forward to what the team is left fighting for in the closing weeks of the campaign.

However, the coach denied accusations that the season is already over for Atlético Madrid, as he responded, “not for me, there are still four games left and something we've earned on our own merits competing with Barça and Madrid, which is the Club World Cup, no small feat for all this work over four years”. 

Speaking further on the tournament, which will be held in the United States starting in June, he added that, “it will be new and will generate real enthusiasm in all the teams who participate”.

“Neither team was able to have superiority, neither in link-up play nor in attacking play, there were no shots in the first half. It was played in the middle of the pitch, without danger. In the second half we went from less to more, around the 20th minute we had a better pace, more bravery in the duels, putting in more crosses, with people in the box, combining at more speed.... They had a chance from Kike, but Jan saved it. We were left with a draw in which neither of us were able to score.”

“When we won the league it also happened to us in Almeria, with Levante... It's part of the game. It doesn't mean that if you go to play with the bottom team you have to win. You have to play well, you have to play better, you have to have chances, you have to be convincing... When we had them, we had to win.”

“They look like easy games, but they are not. Just because they're at the bottom doesn't mean you're going to win. You have to earn it. In Leganés, in the first half, there were three or four important situations, but the goalkeeper was very good and we even had a penalty. In Getafe we were 1-0 up with 10 minutes to go and we got ourselves into trouble. In Las Palmas, the goalkeeper made two incredible saves and in the second half they scored. Today, Alavés almost won it with that close call from Kike.”

“I don't agree. In Las Palmas the first half was very good and the second half was very bad. Phases of the match, moments of the game? At the start there is a different tension, a different rhythm of intensity, everyone thinking about not making mistakes... In the second half, there are some imbalances, and that's why they tend to be more fun.”

Former Milan and Brazil star Marcos Cafu makes a surprising admission by warning he would not hire Carlo Ancelotti until after the 2026 World Cup.

Although negotiations have been at times chaotic, with over the last few days reports a deal had been done only to fall apart, then be delayed by his confused status on the Real Madrid bench, many still expect Ancelotti to be the Brazil coach after the end of this season.

The Brazilian Football Federation has been pushing hard for his signature for well over a year and seem to finally be close to their top choice, but not everyone is convinced.

“I would choose either Rogerio Ceni or Renato Gaucho for the short term,” Milan and Brazil legend Cafu told ESPN Brasil.

“Once the 2026 World Cup is over, then they can decide. They need to choose a coach, start this work, make it go through its natural progression, then a natural end.

“The problem with the Brazil team at the moment is that there is no plan, because the coaches who are hired have no guarantee they will be able to start work and see it through.”

Cafu would prefer them to wait until after the 2026 World Cup, which is to be co-hosted by the USA, Canada and Mexico, then bring in Ancelotti.

The qualifiers for the tournament are already in full swing and he would have very few games to get to grips with the squad at his disposal.



Ancelotti should never consider coaching Brazil . Why would he want to lead them to a World Cup and not Italy ? I find this a betrayal . He always said he didn't want a national team becasue he liked day to day work . Not he is ok to coach Brazil of all teams . I lost respect for him he should have helped Italy when they called him back in 2018

Canada booked its ticket to the inaugural FIFA Futsal Women's World Cup in dramatic fashion by defeating Mexico in a penalty shootout Saturday to reach the final of CONCACAF W Futsal Championship.

The two finalists at the eight-team CONCACAF tournament will represent the region at the 16-team FIFA Futsal World Cup, slated for Nov. 21 to Dec. 7 in the Philippines.

Futsal is a five-a-side indoor game played in two 20-minute halves. Like hockey, teams can make changes on the fly.

The semifinal at the Domo Polideportivo in Guatemala City, Guatemala went to a shootout after finishing tied 4-4 following two five-minute periods of extra time.

Mexico scored three unanswered goals in the first half before Canada answered with four of its own in the first four minutes of the second half. Trailing 4-3, Mexico tied the game with 1.8 seconds remaining on a goal by Rubi Gomez with its net empty.

Joelle Gosselin, Esther Brossard, Jade Houmphanh and Cynthia Gaspar-Freire scored for Canada in the shootout. Stephie-Ann Dadaille had her shot saved.

Goalkeeper Lea Palacio-Tellier stopped shots by Evelyn Gonzalez and Gomez before Gaspar-Freire roofed her penalty for a 4-3 Canada win.

Sunday's final will see Canada face Panama, which downed Costa Rica 3-1 in the other semifinal.

The Canadians moved into the semifinals after beating the U.S. 3-1 to finish runner-up to Costa Rica at 2-1-0 in Group B.

Mexico won Group A with three straight wins and a tournament-high 13 goals. Canada, meanwhile, tied for the tournament's stingiest defence with just four goals allowed in pool play.

The Canadians are coached by Alexandre Da Rocha, a former coach of the Quebec's women's futsal team and assistant coach with the Canadian men's futsal side.

Female futsal players have long campaigned for a FIFA championship. In 2022, the International Women's Futsal Players Association condemned FIFAs ""public neglect towards women futsal players.""

FIFA held the first Futsal Men's World Cup in 1989 with the 2028 edition featuring 24 teams. Defending champion Brazil has won six of the 10 tournaments to date, finishing runner-up once and third twice.

Canada has not participated since being one of the 16 invited countries for the inaugural men's tournament, failing to advance out of the first round after losing to Argentina and Belgium before downing Japan.

That 1989 futsal team included Paul Dolan, Pat Harrington, Nick De Santis, Eddy Berdusco, Lyndon Hooper and Alex Bunbury. Dolan was also a member of Canada's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad in Mexico.

There have been eight editions of the CONCACAF Men's Futsal Championship with Canada participating in four of them. The Canadians' best showing was making the quarterfinals, in both 2021 and 2024.

Real Madrid stumbled to three thoroughly undeserved points on Sunday as Arda Guler and Kylian Mbappe's individual quality bailed them out in a 3-2 home win over Celta Vigo.

Guler seemed, for long stretches, the only player who could make things happen while his Madrid team-mated strolled around in his orbit. Earlier this week, Carlo Ancelotti tipped the winger for a more central role going forward - and it was easy to see why here as Guler danced around, finding all of the right angles and pockets of space. His wonderful left foot delivered the opener, too, as he provided na curled effort into the top corner after 33 minutes following a painfully languid opening half an hour for Madrid.

A moment of magic from Mbappe made it 2-0, as Frenchman dashed through on goal before battering the ball into the top corner. He added a second shortly after half-time, too, when he slotted past a stranded goalkeeper after Guler's angled through ball.

Poor defending saw Madrid lose control of the game in the final 20 minutes, however, as Lucas Vazquez's sloppy clearance off the line handed Javi Rodriguez a tap-in before Celta grabbed another when Iago Aspas found Williot Swedberg, who finished calmly.

A Celta equaliser seemed inevitable as Aspas orchestrated in the final third, but it never quite came off for the visitors, and Madrid secured a victory that they didn't really deserve and that keeps them four points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona ahead of next week's crucial Clasico.

Jack Draper's Madrid Open campaign has helped seal yet another rise up the ATP Rankings – and seen him make yet more history.

Already one of just six British men to reach the top 10 of the ATP Rankings since they were introduced in 1973, Draper is now only the fourth man from the country to reach the top five.

Draper, 23, was not even ranked inside the top 30 of the ATP Rankings twelve months, though he has surged up the rankings since then.

The Brit won his first ATP Title on the grass in Stuttgart and then reached the US Open semi-final last September, before winning his first ATP 500 title in Vienna towards the end of the season.

Draper started 2025 inside the top 15 but cracked the top 10 in March after his stunning run to the Indian Wells title, beating Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-final and Holger Rune in the final.

He was sitting at his career-high of sixth before Madrid, with his quarter-final victory over Matteo Arnaldi ensuring that he would reach the top five no matter what happened across the rest of the week.

One of just three British men in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam singles final, Rusedski was runner-up to Pat Rafter at the US Open in 1997.

Rusedski was a surprise finalist at the time, but that run helped propel him up the ATP Rankings, and he reached his career-high of world No 4 just weeks later in October 1997.

The Brit had also reached the quarter-final of Wimbledon that year, and won 15 ATP Tour singles titles before his retirement in 2007.

Competing in the same era as Rusedski, Henman matched his compatriot by reaching a career-high of world No 4 in the ATP Rankings, doing so in July 2002.

Henman is best remembered for reaching four Wimbledon semi-finals, though he also reached the last four of the French Open and US Open in 2004.

His six Grand Slam semi-finals are the most of any man in the Open Era to not reach a major final, though he was the winner of an impressive 11 ATP Tour titles.

Well out in front at the top of this list is Murray, who is the only British player – male or female – to top the official singles rankings.

The Brit rose to world No 1 for the first time in November 2016 and held the top ranking for an impressive 41 weeks until August 2017.

Murray is best celebrated for his two Wimbledon titles in 2013 and 2016, and for his US Open triumph in 2012, though he reached a further eight Grand Slam singles titles.

He also won back-to-back Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016, and won a staggering haul of 46 ATP Tour singles titles.

Venus Williams will be back on our screens this year.

The 44-year-old tennis legend will serve as a broadcaster for TNT Sports at this year's French Open as she joins a star-studded broadcast team.

Williams is on commentary duties alongside Andre Agassi, Chris Evert, Jim Courier, Lindsay Davenport, John McEnroe, and Caroline Wozniacki.

This will be Williams' first major broadcasting role at a Slam since stepping back from full-time competition.

The move follows TNT Sports becoming the US television rights holder for Roland Garros, taking over from NBC.

The five-time Wimbledon champion will also be a lead analyst.

Williams hasn't played in a singles match since 2023, but has enjoyed a career that has established her as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. 

""I know what it's like to battle on the clay, and I'm looking forward to sharing that experience,” Williams said in a press release.

The seven-time major winner has never won the French Open in singles but was a finalist in 2002.

She did win twice in doubles alongside her sister Serena in 1999 and 2010.

Williams' arrival in the commentary booth will be a welcome addition in the tennis world.

Her tennis career is filled with trophies, and her informed insights and analysis should go down well with fans.

Williams' last Grand Slam appearance was at the 2023 US Open and her last victory at any level came against Veronika Kudermetova in Cincinnati two weeks before that.

The last time the seven-time Grand Slam champion played a full schedule on the tour was in 2019.

Much of Williams' time off the court has been occupied by her business commitments -- she owns the interior design company V Starr.

While her inactivity on tour has made many think she has unofficially retired, the fact that she has not called it quits at the age of 44 is a remarkable feat, especially given her physical circumstances.

In 2019, she was diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune condition that can cause fatigue and joint pain.

Although with seven Grand Slams in singles and 14 in doubles, Williams is likely satisfied with what she has achieved in her career.

Home › News › Broadcasters › Venus Williams joining TNT French Open roster

2K7B2RJ Aurelien Morissard / IP3; Ambiance in the Philippe Chatrier court of the French Open tennis tournament at Roland Garros in Paris, France, 27th June 2020.

TNT Sports has assembled the usual suspects for its Grand Slam tennis debut, plus some prominent newcomers.

TNT has hired Venus Williams as an analyst for its French Open coverage, according to a promotional video aired during “Inside the NBA” Saturday night. Neither Williams nor her sister Serena, by a wide margin the two most prominent American tennis players of the past 25 years, have ever worked in sports broadcasting.

Williams, who is technically not retired from tennis, would not be the only broadcasting novice on the TNT team. As previously announced — and noted in Saturday's promo — the network has hired Andre Agassi, who has also not previously worked in broadcasting.

Other TNT analysts featured in the Saturday promo were ESPN regulars Chris Evert, John McEnroe, and Caroline Wozniacki, Tennis Channel regulars Jim Courier and Lindsay Davenport, and active player Sloane Stephens, who has most recently been making frequent appearances on the “T2” morning show “Second Serve.”

TNT play-by-play voice Brian Anderson is also slated to cover the event.

TNT Sports begins carrying the French Open for the first time later this month, the first Grand Slam tennis on the networks since TNT aired Wimbledon in the early 2000s. (Back then, Ernie Johnson hosted and Marv Albert did some play-by-play.) While the TNT Sports networks are new to the event, corporate sibling Eurosport is entering its 35th season of coverage.

Tennis fans are in for a treat this summer — even if a few of their favorite stars won't be competing on the clay.

TNT Sports has officially unveiled its elite commentary crew for Roland Garros 2025, and the announcement came with a surprise addition: Venus Williams is all set to join the star-studded broadcast team. One of the most iconic names in tennis history, Venus will lend her voice and insight to what promises to be one of the most elite commentary lineups in recent memory.

She joins a legendary group that includes Andre Agassi, Chris Evert, Jim Courier, Lindsay Davenport, John McEnroe, and Caroline Wozniacki. Another notable name on the list is Sloane Stephens, signaling that she has not yet made her return from injury and will not be participating as a player in this year's French Open.

Though Venus Williams and Sloane Stephens will not be taking the court at the French Open this year, fans will still have the chance to connect with them — through their voices, stories, and first-hand perspectives. Both players bring Grand Slam experience and precious viewpoints that will no doubt elevate TNT's live coverage.

This marks a new chapter for Venus, who has rarely taken on commentary duties in the past. Known for her strategic intelligence, calm demeanor, and unmatched achievements both on and off the court, Venus's presence in the broadcast booth is expected to be a major draw for viewers.

On the other hand, Stephens, a former U.S. Open champion and Roland Garros finalist, has previously hinted at exploring media work while recovering from her injury. Her role in the commentary team all but confirms she won't be competing at Roland Garros 2025, disappointing fans who had hoped to see her back in action. However she has made frequent appearances on the tennis channel along with the broadcasting team.

Roland Garros 2025 may be missing a few stars on the court, but thanks to TNT's powerhouse commentary team, the tournament coverage is already looking like a Grand Slam.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Former British tennis player says who he thinks is favorite to win the Roland Garros title out of Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/former-british-tennis-player-says-who-he-thinks-is-favorite-to-win-the-roland-garros-title-out-of-aryna-sabalenka-and-iga-swiatek/","Sun, 04 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The second Grand Slam of the season is now less than a month away as the stars of the women's game prepare for Roland Garros.

America's Madison Keys won the Australian Open in January, shocking the world's top two players, Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka, on her way to the title.

However, she likely won't be the favorite on the clay, as three-time defending champion Swiatek looks to become the first player to win four in a row in Open Era history.

World number one Sabalenka is also likely to challenge, having picked up another ‘big' clay-court title recently.

Immediately after Sabalenka's Madrid Open victory, one former British star revealed who he is picking to win Roland Garros in 2025.

Speaking to Sky Sports after Sabalenka took down Coco Gauff in the Madrid Open final, former British doubles star Colin Fleming made his French Open predictions.

“I think she [Aryna Sabalenka] is now pretty firm favourite for Roland Garros, with all that has gone on, as we stand here in Madrid,” he said.

“Before this tournament started, I would still have picked [Iga] Swiatek as the favourite, despite the fact she was out of form, because I would have said I think she will find something in Madrid and Rome and by the time Roland Garros comes around [she'll be back].

“But although Iga made the semis you would say it's not a terrible result, the manner of the semi-final I just think there is a question mark of how she will be in Rome and Roland Garros.”

Swiatek lost to Gauff, 1-6, 1-6, in this year's Madrid Open semi-finals, suffering her worst loss on a clay court since she won just one game in defeat to Simona Halep at the French Open six years ago.

The Brit is far more confident of Sabalenka's chances after watching her dominate the WTA Tour in 2025.

“Sabalenka is just going from strength to strength,” said Fleming.

“I know she has not won every tournament this season, but she has been close, if not won it, and she is the one primed and ready to get that first Roland Garros title.”

Sabalenka has remarkably reached the final at six of the eight tournaments she's played in 2025, picking up three titles, the most of any player in women's tennis.

Barring a minor blip in the Middle East, Sabalenka has been a consistent feature in the latter stages of WTA tournaments this year, helping her further extend her gap at the top of the world rankings.

When the next set of rankings are released on Monday, Sabalenka will lead her closest rival, Swiatek, by 4,345 points.

With Swiatek set to defend 3,000 points (Italian Open/French Open victories) over the next month or so, it certainly looks like the Belarusian will hold on to the number one spot for quite some time.

The 26-year-old has accumulated 36 total weeks as world number one, placing her 15th in the all-time list.

Fleming thinks the world number one will pick up her maiden Roland Garros title next month, and when looking at form, the prediction makes a lot of sense.

But how has Sabalenka actually performed in the French capital over the years?

Sabalenka came closest to reaching the French Open final two years ago, when she lost a three-set thriller to Czech star Karolina Muchova, 6-7, 7-6, 5-7.

The three-time Major champion holds a 16-7 record (70%) at Roland Garros, but would no doubt love to take her game to another level on the clay in 2025 and lift the Suzanne-Lenglen Cup for the first time.

Sabalenka will begin her 2025 French Open campaign when the tournament begins on Sunday, May 25.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

There's something uniquely British about Wimbledon. Beyond the swift rallies and the clink of champagne flutes, it's a tournament steeped in tradition, decorum and (of course) strawberries and cream. But if you're lucky enough to score tickets to the world's oldest and most prestigious tennis event, be warned: what you wear, how you behave, and even when you clap matters. Here's your definitive guide to doing Wimbledon the right way.

""Ladies and gentlemen... if you are opening a bottle of champagne, don't do it as the players are about to serve"" 🍾The most #Wimbledon warning ever from umpire John Blom 🤣 pic.twitter.com/57GBixnM4U

Wimbledon may be the only place on earth where queuing is treated like a sacred rite. Fans often camp overnight in hopes of snagging same-day show court tickets. In pre-pandemic times, this meant arriving with a two-person tent, following the official Queuing Code of Conduct, and keeping your Queue Card safe like a golden ticket. Fans should check the official website for updates. During COVID years, the iconic queue was temporarily replaced by digital ticketing and reduced crowds. But with the queue back in action, patience, civility, and common sense are non-negotiable.

Wimbledon isn't Royal Ascot, but it's no place for flip-flops and beer-logo tees either. There's no formal dress code for general spectators, but understated elegance is always in style. Think: summer dresses, linen shirts, and loafers. Avoid ripped jeans, dirty trainers, gym clothes, and slogan tees. Big hats are discouraged—they block the view—and flashy logos or political messaging is a hard no.

Now, if you're invited to the Royal Box, it's a whole different ball game. Gentlemen are expected to wear a jacket and tie, while ladies must opt for formal daywear. No exceptions.

As for the players? They face perhaps the strictest dress code in professional sport: all white, right down to undergarments and trim. Even a hint of colour can lead to mid-match wardrobe changes or disqualification.

Jeans at Wimbledon...is a violation of etiquette. K... pic.twitter.com/7lyJimLqQP

It's tempting to let out a celebratory whoop after a jaw-dropping backhand from Alcaraz, but etiquette demands restraint. Clapping mid-rally or yelling a player's name before serve? Taboo. Save your cheers for between points, and never, ever applaud a double fault or a lucky net cord. It's just not cricket (or tennis, for that matter).

When it comes to moving around the court, stewards are strict. You'll only be allowed to enter or leave during changeovers—typically after every third game. If you're seated during play, stay put and enjoy the action.

Few food pairings are as iconic as Wimbledon's strawberries and cream. Each year, around 190,000 portions of English strawberries are served at the tournament, washed down with 320,000 glasses of Pimm's.

While the grounds offer a range of food options—from posh bistros to snack bars—many seasoned fans prefer packing a picnic. Just remember: alcohol is limited to one bottle of wine or two cans of beer per person, and glass bottles, thermos flasks, or opaque containers are not allowed.

Final tips from the club's playbook

Carry an umbrella: The British weather loves drama.

Leave the selfie sticks at home: They're banned.

Silence your phone before entering any court.

Be nice to stewards: They're just doing their job—and might save you from breaking a rule.

Keep your ticket or Queue Card on you at all times. No re-entry without it.

Whether you're courtside at Centre Court or picnicking on Henman Hill, remember this: at Wimbledon, tradition reigns supreme. Dress well, clap politely, and always follow the rules. Because at the end of the day, tennis is as much about grace off the court as it is about grit on it.

The future of tennis legend Novak Djokovic hangs in the balance as experts predict a drastic decision post Wimbledon. Former doubles world number one Todd Woodbridge has sounded the alarm, stating that the next five to six weeks are critical for Djokovic's career.

At 37 years old, Djokovic, with an impressive 24 Grand Slam titles to his name, is facing a challenging period by his lofty standards. His recent performances have been lackluster, with exits from tournaments becoming more frequent. The Serbian star has not clinched a title since the beginning of 2024, raising concerns about his form and motivation on the court.

Woodbridge highlighted that Djokovic's aura of invincibility has diminished in the eyes of his opponents, potentially pushing him towards retirement if his game doesn't improve by Wimbledon. The tennis icon must now confront a pivotal moment in his career, with doubts looming over his physical condition and ability to bounce back.

As Djokovic approaches his 38th birthday, speculation swirls about his next move in professional tennis. Will he reclaim his dominance and continue to compete at the highest level, or is the end of an era on the horizon for one of the sport's greatest players?

The tennis world eagerly awaits Djokovic's upcoming performances at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, as his fate in the sport hangs in the balance. Stay tuned as the saga of Novak Djokovic's future unfolds in the coming weeks, shaping the landscape of men's tennis for years to come.

 WTA
                        

When it was over and the ecstatic crowd at La Caja Magic jumped to its collective feet in applause, Aryna Sabalenka did not fall to the crushed red clay beneath her, didn't scream or pump her fists or even openly exult. She merely raised her arms in a perfect V -- for victory.

And then, blowing kisses to the camera, strolled to her changeover chair, fished a camera out of her bag, crossed the court and snapped a picture of her team. After that thoroughly professional 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory over Coco Gauff on Saturday, Sabalenka is now a three-time Mutua Madrid Open champion. That equals the record total of Petra Kvitova and, not insignificantly, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as well.

Winning is never guaranteed, but in Sabalenka's mind, this was expected. Her will manifested itself in the moments that mattered. Sabalenka's earned that confidence because -- by an uncommonly wide margin -- she is the best player in the sport.

On Monday, the World No. 1 will become only the third woman to amass more than 11,000 ranking points and is nearly 4,000 ahead of No. 2 Iga Swiatek in the PIF WTA Rankings. That gap is likely to grow. With Swiatek defending titles in Rome and Paris, she'll also be defending 3,000 points across the next month. And because Sabalenka missed Wimbledon last year, this year's result will be a ranking points windfall.

Sabalenka is more than 1,600 points clear of No. 2 Madison Keys in the PIF Race to the WTA Finals in Riyadh. She's the only player with three titles so far -- Brisbane, Miami and Madrid -- and has collected back-to-back WTA 1000 titles on vastly different surfaces. Her 31 match-wins are also the most among Hologic WTA Tour players.

This was Gauff's 10th match against Sabalenka in six years. How has her game evolved?

“I feel like she just got a lot better in everything,” Gauff said. “I think she just probably is more confident, so that's why the consistent results are happening.”

Examine the timeline and you'll find that the catalyst for all of this, oddly enough, was a loss.

Back in January, Sabalenka was going for her third consecutive Australian Open but Keys was simply too good in the final. For Sabalenka, who started the year 11-0, it was a devastating loss. She left the Middle East in something of a funk, having lost an unheard of three of four matches.

But then, she rallied and reached four straight finals -- Indian Wells, Miami, Stuttgart and Madrid -- winning two of them. Sabalenka's won 19 of her past 21 and even with the slow surfaces in Rome and Paris looming, she's going to like her chances.

A few hours after the win in Madrid, Sabalenka fielded some questions from wtatennis.com:

Looking back, how did losing that Australian Open final motivate you to produce the best start of your career heading into Rome?

Sabalenka: Yeah, honestly, that final was the toughest one. I really struggled to accept that match, tough loss. And I think, February I was kind of trying to figure my way. Then I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder. Kind of explains to me that you have to really work hard in finals and you have to earn your victories. It was a good push for me.

Your last two matches, four of six sets went to seven games -- you won them all … how proud are you of the fact you competed so well in the most important moments?

Sabalenka: I'm super happy that I was able to bring the level in those key moments. Super happy with the level I played this week and hopefully I can keep going the way everything is going. 

Your defense doesn't get a lot of attention, but … against Coco how important was it to stay in some of those long points?

Sabalenka: It's very important to not only be an attacking player, but in those key moments to be a good defender and dig really deep in there, try to steal a few points. It definitely brings more confidence in your game.

Only four women in 40 years won their first six matches against Top 10 players in straight sets – their names are Martina Navratilova (1986), Steffi Graf (1994, 1995 and 1996), Serena Williams (2014) -- and Aryna Sabalenka … what do you think of that?

Sabalenka: I … don't know. I mean, they are legends. They achieved so much, these players I look up to. Me, being in the same line with them … it just sounds crazy and I couldn't be more proud.

Of all the ups and downs you've experienced, how good do you feel about your game right now?

Sabalenka: I definitely feel really good about my game. But I think the key for me was that I was always looking for something to improve. And now, still, I want to get better.

Three Madrid titles … the way you're playing, in your mind, can you win in Rome or Paris for the first time?

Sabalenka: [Laughing]. I mean, in my mind, in my dreams, yes I can. But sometimes the reality is different. I will definitely go out there and compete and fight and see if my dream will be the same in real life.

Williams duo keen to 'play with strategies' as they target strong result in Miami after impressive Qualifying

Cadillac unveil their team logo and brand during dazzling Miami launch event ahead of 2026 entry

STRATEGY GUIDE: What are the tactical options for the Miami Grand Prix?

Verstappen vs Norris into Turn 1 and Antonelli after redemption – What To Watch For in the Miami Grand Prix

What the teams said – Sprint day and Qualifying in Miami

Lewis Hamilton was left to rue Ferrari's “big time” struggles after ending Qualifying for the Miami Grand Prix in P12, with the seven-time World Champion admitting that progressing into Q3 is often proving “tough” at the moment.

Hamilton's Saturday at the Miami International Autodrome began in slightly more promising style after the Briton climbed from P7 to P3 in the Sprint. However, Qualifying again proved challenging, with Hamilton unable to improve on his lap time in Q2 which resulted in him exiting in 12th place.

Given that team mate Charles Leclerc has also spoken of the squad's pace difficulties during the weekend, Hamilton was quizzed after Qualifying on whether the Scuderia have an idea of the direction to take in order to make improvements to the SF-25.

“We'll keep trying, we're only six races in, but we're struggling big time,” the 40-year-old told Sky Sports F1. “We're trying our hardest not to make big set-up changes, but no matter what we do, it's so inconsistent every time we go out.

P12 Hamilton says his Ferrari is ‘a bit of a mess at the moment balance-wise'

“We've got problems with brakes, we've got problems with this instability that we're struggling with. We're just generally not quick enough – just to get into Q3 is tough for us at the moment, and once you're then on that backfoot it's hard to pick up those points.”

As such, Hamilton – who in a separate interview described the Ferrari as “a bit of a mess at the moment balance-wise” – predicted that Sunday's Miami Grand Prix could prove to be a tricky day.

“Tomorrow's going to be hard work, but we'll try again tomorrow,” he conceded. “But it's the same thing for me – I mean, I'm used to it, it is what it is and I just keep trying. [I'll] get back in the factory next week and just keep going.”

Saturday was equally eventful for Leclerc, who suffered a crash in wet conditions on his way to the grid prior to the Sprint getting underway which ultimately left him unable to start the 100km dash.

The Monegasque returned to action for Qualifying and, while he bettered Hamilton by reaching Q3, could finish no higher than eighth.

‘It's just not good enough' – Leclerc demands improvement from Ferrari after P8 in Miami Qualifying

Pushed on how difficult it is to accept that the performance is not currently there in the car, Leclerc responded: “The fact is that I'm not accepting it! It's just not good enough.

“It's frustrating because it's those kinds of days, there's been quite a few races already that I feel I'm doing a really good job but when you are finishing P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, it's just a shame. I have no satisfaction of doing a good job.

“I'm just hoping that we can turn the situation around as soon as possible, but at the moment that's the situation we are in and there's not much I can do.”

Having displayed better race pace during recent Grand Prix weekends – including last time out in Saudi Arabia, where he claimed a debut podium of the campaign – Leclerc was then asked if this gave him any hope for Sunday's event in Miami.

“A little bit, but not so much either,” the 27-year-old said. “I don't think we can expect any miracles from us tomorrow. It's been a difficult race weekend since FP1 and it's difficult to recover.

“I'll give my best, I hope the race pace will be as strong as in Jeddah but it's a very different characteristics of track here. I think that on paper it's going to be more difficult.”

From Max Verstappen versus Lando Norris on the front row to Kimi Antonelli looking for redemption, and from Lewis Hamilton trying to fight through the field, to an even higher chance of rain than had been forecast for Saturday, here are five things to keep an eye out for when we go racing for the second time this weekend in Miami…

We became quite accustomed to fights between Max Verstappen and Lando Norris towards the end of last season, but this year has only seen a true battle between the pair in Australia and Japan, with each boasting a win apiece.

Oranje rather than papaya took top honours in the Sunshine State on Saturday afternoon when we got our second pole position driver of the weekend. Max Verstappen put a dismal Sprint result behind him to deliver a mighty lap when it mattered, edging out Lando Norris by a matter of hundredths of a second.

Norris wasn't too disconsolate, however, having bested drivers' championship leader and team mate Oscar Piastri. There was only a tenth between the two McLarens, but that was sufficient space for Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli to crowbar his way in, delivering his second impressive qualifying performance of the weekend.

Marvel's star-studded ensemble pic led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan is winning over critics and audiences alike as it kicks off the summer box office season.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Marvel's Thunderbolts* is storming to a promising domestic opening in the $73 million to $77 million range after topping Friday's chart with $31.5 million, including $11.5 million in Thursday previews.


	The star-studded movie, led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan, is kicking off the summer box office in what's become a tradition for Kevin Feige‘s studio with only a few exceptions. The pic is winning over critics and audiences alike; Thunderbolts* boasts a glowing 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, making it the third-highest score for a title in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a tie with Spider-Man: Far From Home and behind Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (98 percent) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (97 percent). It's still early, of course, and scores can change by one or two points as the weekend wears on. And on PostTrak exit polls, audiences are giving it a rave 4.5 out of 5 stars, while it received an A- CinemaScore.

	Heading into the weekend, tracking suggests the movie will open in the $70 million to $73 million range domestically and $160 million to $175 million globally, against a $180 million production budget before marketing. Word of mouth is seeing that number climb higher, although some rivals see it coming in between $72 million and $75 million.


	As a comparison, Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World had an audience RT score of 92 percent when opening to $88.8 million earlier this year. (That film's critics score was a rotten 48 percent, compared to 88 percent for Thunderbolts*.)


	The unexpected spring bloom is currently underway at the box office — led by Ryan Coogler's sleeper sensation Sinners — proves that people want the communal experience of watching a film together. Regarding Sinners, the Warner Bros. hit is enjoying a phenomenal third weekend, even if it falls to second place. The supernatural vampire pic continues to break all the rules and could fall just 26 percent this weekend to $33.7 million for a domestic tally north of $180 million.


Thunderbolts* is a pivotal moment for Marvel as it kicks off a new hoped-for franchise. Directed by Jake Schreier, the film brings together a band of dysfunctional outsiders — and lesser-known comic book characters — who discover their potential to be heroes when working together.

	











	In addition to Pugh (Yelena Belova) and Stan (Bucky Barnes), the movie features Wyatt Russell (John Walker), David Harbour (Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian), Lewis Pullman (Bob), Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost), Olga Kurylenko (Taskmaster) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (CIA director Valentine Allegra de Fontaine).


	“Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan lead a gratifyingly fresh and soulful Marvel adventure,” The Hollywood Reporter‘s chief film critic David Rooney writes in his review. “While a handful of the characters and the actors playing them have appeared in previous entries, there's a disarming freshness to this first-time assembly, not to mention something even more unexpected: heart. That's due to an appealing ensemble cast and the new blood of a creative team with a distinctive take on the genre.”


	In the film, Louis-Dreyfus' villainous character has positioned a number of MCU loners and rejects to kill each other for her own nefarious reasons. But they instead decide to team up in response to the obvious setup, bringing along newcomer Bob, who suffers from a mental illness that has catastrophic consequences after he's subjected to cruel experimentation.


	Overseas, Thunderbolts* is opening everywhere timed to its release in North America, including in China.


	No other major studio dared open a wide release opposite the Marvel event pic. Elsewhere, Alec Baldwin's controversial-laced Rust finally opened in select theaters while also being available on premium VOD. The Western appears to be bombing — at least in cinemas — with an estimated opening gross of just $25,000 from 115 theaters.

	











	The movie opens four years after Baldwin, who co-wrote and produced the film, accidentally discharged a weapon he thought only had blanks. A live round was in the chamber, and the bullet fatally wounded cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and also hit director-wirter Joel Souza. What followed was a dramatic, closely reported story that revealed on-set negligence and raised questions about industry practices around gun safety. Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Still, his case was dismissed after new evidence came to light that Baldwin's lawyers alleged had been buried by the prosecutors. The film's prop armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was also charged and is serving an 18-month prison sentence. 


	Baldwin paid a settlement to Hutchins' surviving family and Matthew Hutchins, the widower, was made an executive producer on the project. In a recent interview, Souza said the family ultimately wanted to finish the film, and asked that he return. When all is said and one, he says he regrets ever making the movie.

It was the biggest show of the pop star's career that drew some 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach.


							By 

	The Associated Press



	Police in Brazil said on Sunday that two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro.


	The event, on Saturday, was the biggest show of the pop star's career that drew some 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach.




	Rio de Janeiro's state police said they had worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt an attack allegedly planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community. Police said the group sought to radicalize and recruit teenagers to carry out attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives.

	“The plan was treated as a ‘collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,” the police said.


	Authorities said they arrested two people in connection with the planned attack — the alleged leader of the group on illegal weapons possession charges in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a teenager on child pornography charges in Rio.


	Authorities said police raided the locations of 15 suspects across several states in Brazil and confiscated phones and other electronic devices.


	Lady Gaga's publicists and concert promoters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


	The Justice Ministry said members of the group falsely presented themselves online as “Little Monsters” — Lady Gaga's nickname for her fans — in order to reach teenagers and lure them into “networks with violent and self-destructive content.”


	Police said they carried out the operation quietly on Saturday “avoiding panic or distortion of information among the population.” The ministry said there was no impact on those attending the free concert.

The 'Abbott Elementary' creator-star returns to host the NBC sketch comedy show for the second time, alongside musical guest Benson Boone. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Sabrina Carpenter made a surprise cameo during Quinta Brunson‘s Saturday Night Live monologue, during which they performed a song all about honoring short people.


	Brunson began her SNL monologue by noting its her second time hosting the beloved show, before making a joke about being “proof you can do anything you put your mind to even if people look down on you.”




	“Whether it's because of where you come from or literally because you're only 4'11,” she joked. “Yeah, that's right. I'm short… But I love being short, and I want other short people to know the sky's the limit. So shorties, tonight, this one's for us!”

	The host then launched into a song about her height: “Being short is amazing, being short is just fine. I'm a cheap date cause I get wasted off of one glass of wine.”


	Brunson went on to reference some of the most notorious “shorties,” including Simone Biles, Kendrick Lamar and Tom Holland, before the camera then panned over to reveal the Grammy winner, surprising Brunson, who asked, “Sabrina, what are you doing here?”


	Carpenter replied, “I mean, you were talking about being short, so I thought I'd stop by.”


	“Sabrina, can I ask you something one shorty to another?” the host asked the singer. “Anything,” she responded to which Brunson joked, “When you eat short rib does it taste just like rib?”


	“I never thought about it like that, but yeah,” the “Espresso” singer responded, before Carpenter offered another height-related joke query: “Wait, here's a question for you. When you read short stories, do they feel like novels?”


SNL cast member Marcello Hernandez then joined Brunson and Carpenter on stage, where he poked fun at their height. “I just thought I would come stand next to you because it makes me look super tall.”


	“Come on, Marcello, you should be proud of being short,” Carpenter noted, before former NBA champion Dwyane Wade joined them on-stage. “Dwyane, sorry, what are you doing here?” Brunson asked, to which Wade responded, “Well, I was just in the audience watching SNL, and I heard your song about being short, and I felt seen.”


	“But, you're tall, you're 6'4″,” Brunson pointed out. “Yeah, but I'm 6'4″, and in basketball world, it's like 4'10″, Shaq's like 7'1″, and I just really want to be in the song,” he responded. 

	











	“Alright, I can't say no to you, Dwyane Wade,” Brunson affirmed, and the “shorties” closed out the opening monologue.


	Earlier in the night, SNL's cold open poked fun at Donald Trump's first 100 days in office — specifically joking about the president's many executive orders.


	“Well, it's been 100 years since I became president. Excuse me, days, wow, feels longer, but people are saying that what I've done so far has single-handedly helped win people elections, mostly in Canada,” James Austin Johnson's Trump joked. “Also I signed 147 executive orders, everything from banning paper straws to defunding PBS. I understand Elmo has now been apprehended by ICE, brought to you by the letter ‘L' for El Salvador. He's not coming back.”


	Johnson's Trump invited Stephen Miller (played by Mikey Day), the White House's deputy chief of staff, to introduce the varying new executive orders. The duo even issued a “pardon” to J.K. Rowling.


	“Jackie, Jackie Rowley,” he said. “We love Jackie. You know, she created a whole wizarding world, a wonderful place for overweight millennials to stake their entire identity well past the point of it being cute. I'm a Hufflepuff. No, bitch, you work at Staples.”


	Earlier in the cold open, they touched on Bill Belichick's controversial CBS Sunday Morning appearance where his girlfriend Jordon Hudson awkwardly interrupted his interview.


	“Sir, this order will make it socially acceptable for a man in his 70s to date a 24-year old,” Day's Miller said, to which Johnson's Trump added, “That's right, we're calling it the Belichick Law.”

	











	“We're gonna make girlfriends young again, OK?” he added. “Old men can now date far younger women. We like that, it's hot, but in reverse it's quite disgusting, right? Very Dateline, you know.”


	“Did you see Belichick's girlfriend? She's pretty hot, right?” the faux Trump asked. “Yes, she is a beautiful creature,” Day's Miller added.


	Brunson, the star and creator of Abbott Elementary, returned to host SNL for the second time alongside Benson Boone as the night's musical guest. Saturday's show notably marked the Grammy nominee's first appearance on the show and Brunson's first hosting gig since April 2023.


	Brunson and Boone are two of the final hosts and musical guests for SNL‘s landmark 50th season. Next week, The White Lotus star Walton Goggins will host with musical guest Arcade Fire, with Scarlett Johansson and Bad Bunny closing out season 50 on May 17 as host and musical guest, respectively.

It marked the pop star's first performance in Brazil in over a decade.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Lady Gaga performed to a record-breaking crowd during her free concert at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Saturday (May 3).


	“Tonight, we're making history,” she told the massive audience. “Thank you for making history with me.”


	The concert began around 10 p.m. local time, with the 39-year-old pop icon opening with her 2011 track “Bloody Mary.” She followed it with a hit-filled set including fan favorites like “Poker Face” and “Alejandro,” as well as music from her latest Billboard 200-topping album, Mayhem.


	Concert organizers estimated that approximately 2.1 million people attended the free Copacabana Beach show, according to Associated Press. The event is now the highest-attended concert by a female artist in history, surpassing Madonna's 2024 performance at the same venue, which drew 1.6 million.


	The largest concert crowd in history is still held by Rod Stewart, who drew 3.5 million fans to a New Year's Eve performance at Copacabana Beach in 1994, according to the Guinness World Records.

	











	Gaga's performance drew over 1 million Brazilians and approximately 500,000 Little Monsters who flew in for the show, generating more than $100,000 for Rio's economy, NPR reports. The city's tourism department has announced that free concerts will continue to be held at Copacabana Beach at least through 2028.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The Rio concert marked Gaga's first performance in Brazil since 2012.


	“I've missed you so much,” the superstar told the crowd during a soundcheck the night before the show, according to Rolling Stone. “I know that this is not the first show here, I know this is just a rehearsal, it feels like it's the real show.”


	In 2017, Gaga canceled her Rock in Rio performance due to “severe physical pain,” later revealing she had been hospitalized at the time.

The pop singer's launching her third studio album.

	Ashley Iasimone



Ava Max‘s new album Don't Click Play is arriving this summer. The set, featuring lead single “Lost Your Faith,” will be her third full-length album.


	Max unveiled the album's release date and its cover art on Thursday (May 1). Pop fans will be able to click play on Don't Click Play on Aug. 22.


	The album cover features Max handling the heat in a triangle of fire, her hands grasping edges that are going up in flames — perhaps serving as a visual of the fire-emoji vibes she hopes listeners will feel when they do click play. The triangle is in the form of the familiar symbol that's recognized as a play button.

	She's dabbling in the art of reverse psychology with this album cycle. Last month, the singer led folks to the website DontClickPlayOnAvaMax.com, which under the guise of an online petition actually teased an unreleased track. She also shared a photo of a roadside “Don't Click Play on Ava Max” billboard.

	With Max's album reveal on X on May 1, she also played on Atlantic Records labelmate Ed Sheeran's Play album announcement, quoting his HQ account's post from the same day; both announcements, of course, made use of the handy play button icon.


Don't Click Play is the follow-up to 2023's Diamonds & Dancefloors (which reached No. 34 on the Billboard 200 albums chart) and 2020's Heaven & Hell (Max's debut LP, which peaked at No. 27 and included breakthrough single “Sweet But Psycho,” a Top 10 hit on the Hot 100 in 2018).

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM: Thunderbolts* at a $76M opening, isn't the most stellar of Disney Marvel Studios' openings, but, heck, this is significantly better than the start of summer a year ago when Universal's original action romcom, The Fall Guy, fell on his face with a $27.7M start. With a $162.1M global opening, Thunderbolts* is just $3M shy of where we forecasted. The movie cost before P&A, $180M. 


	There can be agita in the industry when a movie doesn't exactly wow and kick off summer with a $100M-plus opening, however Thunderbolts* start isn't anything to worry about knowing that Memorial Day is teed up for a possible record-breaking 4-day weekend with Disney's Lilo & Stitch eyeing at least $120M and Paramount's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning at $80M+. 

	











	With an A- CinemaScore, plus other great exists in PostTrak and Rotten Tomatoes, Disney is hoping that Thunderbolts* holds better than recent less-than-$100M openers, i.e. Eternals ($71.2M, -62% second weekend drop, B CinemaScore, $164.8M final) and Captain America: Brave New World ($88.8M opening, -68% second weekend plummet, B- CinemaScore, $200.2M domestic final). With 38% women giving Thunderbolts* an A, there's anticipation that more of them will show up next weekend for Mothers Day; the pic's only competition being Lionsgate's Kerry Washington-Omar Sy movie, Shadow Force. Also, Thunderbolts* skewed young at 62% under 35, which was another promising sign to Disney in regards to more business down the road. Comscore says there's 32% of all colleges are on summer break next Friday, increasing to 49% on May 12. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	What's going on here with Thunderbolts*? Why wasn't it higher? We knew it was in the $70M-range heading into the weekend. Not to rain on Disney's parade, because, really, exhibition is thankful for a deep bench of titles with the entire weekend doing $146M +98% from a year ago), but there wasn't a great degree of FOMO for this antiheroes movie about Yelena Belova, Winter Soldier, etc; they aren't exactly a gang of Paul Kerseys multiplied by five with questionable and acerbic methods. DC's Suicide Squad could roll the Thunderbolts in a barrel. 


	The focus of Disney's marketing campaign for Thunderbolts* was ‘Not Super. Not Heroes' with an angle on the sarcastic twist of assembling assassins forced to work together from the movie Black Widow and series Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Hawkeye. The marketing also highlighted Florence Pugh's performance and complex duality, while also emphasizing the heroes' chemistry. 

	











	Marvel, of course, began the campaign for Thunderbolts* at last July's San Diego Comic-Con when they gave Hall H a first look at the trailer and assembled the cast onstage. There was a Super Bowl 30-second spot and an absolute cinema trailer via Letterboxd. 


	There was a promotional partner campaign valued at $75M, which was bigger than other stand-alone MCU titles, led by Tide, HD and Wheaties. The intent was to partner with brands that aligned and mirrored the irreverent, edgy and fun nature of the movie. 


	Tide's campaign included Captain America and a situation involving “collateral stains” with a spot featuring a news van crew during an action-packed moment from the trailer.


	Harley Davidson had their largest cinematic collaboration to date, with the movie timed to their launch of the 2025 Pan America ST bike placed in the film, a spot, in-dealership support and an editorial feature for their exclusive magazine with interviews of stunt professionals.


	Very clever: Disney and Wheaties created a first-of-its-kind limited-edition Wheaties box, which also became something of a promo one-sheet and theater lobby standee. In addition, popcorn boxes at the premiere were emblazoned with the image. 


	Mike and Ike hosted a branded road trip activation featuring custom-wrapped trucks that visited 80+ colleges across the country. Students received co-branded product and Fandango movie ticket giveaways. 


	There was also a joint partnership with Cupra Kiro and Formula E, the premier competition for electrically powered, single-seater racing cars, including a co-branded Cupra Kiro race car livery competing in races in Miami (broadcast exposure on CBS Sports) and Monaco, co-branded driver helmet, spot, and in-stadium content integration during the races.

	With LinkedIn, Marvel and Disney leveraged the “Red Guardian Limo Service” content piece to reinforce their message to job seekers and professionals. 


	Perfect Sports, the leading brand in the protein powder/performance nutrition, had Thunderbolts* branded products via Walmart.com, Amazon, GNC and Vitamin Shoppe, with in-gym exposure throughout Canada, and social/influencer campaigns.


Thunderbolts* repped Arizona Iced Tea's first-time co-branding with a movie. Ten million cans were splashed with the movie's logo at major convenience stores including 7-Eleven, AM/PM, and Circle K.


	Some of the digital and social stunts included the cast member's arriving in CinemaCon in Red Guardian's limo then crashing Disney's presentation in character. 

A post shared by Marvel Studios (@marvelstudios)


	Speaking of the Red Guardian Limo Service, there was a micro campaign created for social with a commercial and stunted outdoor to coincide with tickets on sale telling moviegoers to dial 1-833-RED-LIM0.


	A jump featurette highlighted Pugh's stunt work as she leaped off the second highest building in the world. 


	EntTelligence reports that 4.7M people went to see Thunderbolts* this weekend, 1M less than Captain America: Brave New World. 


	Also per EntTelligence today, those trailers pushed in-theater on Thunderbolts* were Fantastic Four: First Steps (100%, July 25), Predator: Badlands (86%, Nov. 7) and Tron: Ares (85%, Oct. 10).

SATURDAY AM: Marvel Studios and Disney's Thunderbolts* has a shot at coming in a bit better for the weekend at $73M-$77M. As we told you, Friday was close to $32M, with Disney calling it at $31.5M.


	While we'd expect more and want more from Marvel during the first weekend of summer, when you include Thunderbolts* in with all the other holdovers in the marketplace, there's nothing to complain about with all titles doing an estimated $145M this weekend. This is where originals now live with Marvel post Covid. However, what Thunderbolts* has going for itself are its exits. Audiences gave it a solid A- as compared to the B- they smacked Captain America: Brave New World with, and the Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Hannah John-Kamen and Geraldine Viswanathan-led movie has a great 71% definite recommend on PostTrak. All of that bodes well for this pic holding in the summer to come. You'll remember, there was some cynicism with the bowing of Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3 with a $118.4M opening, and that yielded a -19% ease in its second weekend and a 3x domestic multiple with a near $359M cume.


	More upbeat results from Thunderbolts*: 75% told PostTrak they want to see a sequel, while 40% said they went to watch because of the cast and 53% mentioned the big reason why they bought a ticket was because it's a Marvel movie. Diversity demos are 42% Caucasian, 26% Hispanic and Latino, 17% Black and 10% Asian. Men over 25 came in at 45%, women over 25 at 25%, men under 25 at 20% and women under 25 at 10%. This is a very similar turnout in terms of demo ages as Captain America: Brave New World; men under 25 were a little lower at 18%. Also diversity demos on that movie were 36% Caucasian, 26% Hispanic and Latino, 23% Black and 10% Asian.


	IMAX and PLF are repping 39% of the weekend with 3D generating separately 11% (Disney has to get moviegoers back in a 3D mindset so they're primed for Avatar: Fire & Ash later this year). Best plays are East, Mountain and West. The AMC Dine-In Disney Springs (Fla.) leads single-location gross at $106K.

	











Thunderbolts*‘ social media universe stands at 570M according to analytics corp RelishMix, which is not far from Captain America: Brave New World‘s near 600M, but lower than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3‘s 709.7M followers across TikTok, YouTube, X, Instagram and Facebook. Pugh is not only the key cast driver in the run-up, but her well-boosted videos have driven over 23M views. Also on board are Harbour at 9.4M fans and Julia Louis-Dreyfus at 1.8M.


	Meanwhile, Warner Bros' Sinners is shaping up for a massive $33M third weekend, -28%. That is, of course, the best third weekend for a horror movie ahead of It‘s $29.7M third weekend. The 70MM Imax screenings which are coming back on May 15 are selling out, sources say. More depth to the box office has Warners' A Minecraft Movie at $13M for the weekend in third.


	Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 is now looking at a second weekend of $9.8M, -60% and a running 10-day of $41.4M.


	Also opening this weekend is Roadside Attractions' pick-up of Cannes title The Surfer starring Nicolas Cage, and it's shaping up for a 3-day around $750K after a $325K Friday at 1,085 theaters. Audiences at 48% on Rotten Tomatoes aren't catching the wave like critics are with an 86% certified fresh critical score. 


	The Alec Baldwin Rust western opened on 115 theaters to a very low estimated $25K or $217 per screen. That's not good — but here's what's going on. This is a theatrical day-and-date movie, so the marketing spend, which is minimal here, is weighted to promoting the movie on digital. Furthermore, whenever a theatrical distributor does a day-and-date PVOD release, contractually with the cable companies and digital OTT services, they have to open the movie in a specified amount of theaters. Falling Forward Films, the distributor of Rust, is a gun-for-hire by the producers. Funds from the pic go back to the family of late DP Halyna Hutchins, who was shot on the set. The better share of the film's revenues lie in PVOD, not theatrical. With PVOD, 80% of the revenue generally goes back to the distributor vs. the 50/50 exhibitor-distributor rental from the domestic box office.


	The Sailesh Kolanu crime thriller follows Arjun Sarkaar, a top Homicide Intervention Team officer from Visakhapatnam, who is sent to Jammu and Kashmir to investigate a series of brutal murders. As he pursues a group of elusive killers, the case tests his skills and mental strength. Best markets are Austin, Dallas, Seattle, Toronto, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York City and Baltimore.


AFTERNOON UPDATE: Marvel Studios and Disney's Thunderbolts* is looking at $32M today, including last night's $11.5M previews, for what's shaping up to be a $70M-$75M opening at 4,330 theaters, which has more or less been par for the course for an MCU original title post Covid. The movie has great reviews and immediate thumbs-up from fans. Clearly by tomorrow night, we'll know if it catches on and enters the Guardians of the Galaxy threshold ($94.3M), but as of this minute, no one is seeing it at that altitude.

	











	The opening of Thunderbolts* alone will exceed the total amount that all films made a year ago during the first frame of May ($73.9M, per Box Office Mojo). That's because the strikes pushed the release of Marvel's Deadpool & Wolverine to late July; Universal's The Fall Guy didn't excite anyone with a $27.7M start. The top five movies alone have the potential to do $137M in business, making this a solid weekend.


	Staying strong is Warner Bros' Sinners with $9M today and a 3-day between $30M-$35M at 3,347 — a terrific hold at -23% to -34% in Weekend 3. By comparison, Jordan Peele's Get Out posted a third weekend of $20.7M in 2017, -27%. Cume by Sunday will be $176.6M-$181.6M.


	Warners had bragging rights for third place as well with Legendary co-production A Minecraft Movie at 3,571 sites doing $3M today — $13M, -43% in its fifth weekend — for a running total of $397.5M.


	Fourth goes to Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 with a Friday of $3M, second weekend of $11.2M, -51%, and a running total of $41.6M, which is 12% behind the 2016 original at the same point in time.


	Sony Screen Gems' Until Dawn at 3,055 locations is in fifth with $1M in its second Friday and a $3M second weekend, -59% for an estimated running total by Sunday of $13.8M.


UPDATE AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Disney's official figure Thunderbolts* last night is $11.5M. More good news for Thunderbolts* this weekend: Out of the gate it has 4 1/2 stars on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak and a great 74% definite recommend. Also, 5 stars with kids under 12 and parents.


	The figure isn't that far from the $12M chalked up by February's Captain America: Brave New World; that preview repped 29% of the Anthony Mackie pic's first Friday, which turned into an $88.8M 3-day. Last night's money for the Pugh, Harbour and Stan-led movie is also under that of Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3 which posted $17.5M in previews for a $48.1M Friday and $118.4M 3-day.


	Warner Bros' Sinners ends its second week with $69M at 3,347 theaters, -11%, and a running cume of $146.6M. Yesterday was $4.8M, -20% from Wednesday. Even with Sinners ceding its premium screens this weekend, it's expected to have a robust hold. It was announced that the Ryan Coogler-directed title will return to nine select IMAX 70MM theaters from May 15-21.


	Disney/20th Century Studios' Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith didn't play on Thursday; however, the re-release's gross through Wednesday is $34.1M. The lifetime cume of the George Lucas Episode III is $414.3M.


	Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 is third for the week with $31.6M at 3,610 screens, after a $1.2M Thursday, -18% from Wednesday. The Ben Affleck Artists Equity sequel is slightly behind the original movie's first week tally of $33.8M.


	Warner Bros' A Minecraft Movie ends its fourth week with $27.2M at 3,841 sites, -49%, and a running cume of $384.5M. Thursday's take was $950K, -7% from Wednesday. 


	Sony Screen Gems' Until Dawn has a first week of $10.5M after a $527K Thursday, -5% from Wednesday. 


EXCLUSIVE: Disney and Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* is off to a very good start with around $11M tonight, we hear from non-Disney sources. Always know that forecast can swing higher or lower by the time late night monies come in Friday AM. Hopefully tonight's previews are an indicator to better days at the summer B.O. and that the current momentum from A Minecraft Movie and Sinners keeps up.

	











	Marvel had to postpone last year's summer kickoff pic, Deadpool & Wolverine, to late July due to the impact of the strikes. 


	Not only does the Pugh and Stan vehicle have a solid start, but it's also winning fans over tonight with a 96% Rotten Tomatoes audience score after its 88% certified fresh rating with critics. That's better than the MCU's Captain America: Brave New World from February (48% critics, 78% audience) which saw an $88.8M 3-day, $100M 4-day over the Valentine's Day/President's Day weekend, which translated to $200.2M stateside and $414.8M global take.

	Tonight's previews are roughly a million under Captain America: Brave New World's $12M, but they're also ahead of 2021's Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings ($8.8M) and Eternals ($9.5M). The weekend projection yesterday for the ragtag superhero movie — which is sort of a sequel to Disney+ series The Falcon and Winter Soldier and Hawkeye, as well as the movie Black Widow — was $70M-$75M stateside at 4,300 sites and $175M on the high end of its global start. Thunderbolts* (not to be confused with Thundercats) has all the premium ticket upcharges in IMAX, Dolby, ScreenX, 4DX, etc.


	We told you in the past week that previews/presales for Thunderbolts* are behind Captain America: Brave New World. However, presales for the Jake Schreier-helmed MCU title continue to be ahead of 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings ($75.3M) and Eternals ($71.2M opening).


	We'll have more intel on Warner Bros' Sinners‘ third weekend tomorrow; however, some rivals are estimating that the Ryan Coogler-directed, Michael B. Jordan-starring period vampire movie is headed to a 3-day of $35M, which would be a remarkable dip of -23%. Forecasts had Sinners easing -25% to -30% in its third weekend for $32M-$34.2M yesterday.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


SUNDAY UPDATE: Coming in a touch lower than where we saw it heading yesterday, Marvel Studios/Disney's Thunderbolts* has opened to $162.1M globally, including $86.1M from the international box office. The worldwide bow is within the pre-weekend projected opening range. 


	Overseas, the Florence Pugh-starrer launched at No. 1 or No. 1 non-local in nearly all major markets as well as most smaller markets. The international debut is estimated to be 45% ahead of Shang-Chi, 13% above Ant-Man and 7% over Guardians of the Galaxy in like-for-like markets at current rates (excluding China).

	The film played best in Latin America and smaller Asian markets, while Europe was a bit mixed. Although overall Saturday bumps didn't pan out as hoped, parts of Europe saw some of the biggest Friday-Saturday increases which reflects the impact of changing weather. Similar to the U.S., reviews and social sentiment internationally are generally strong, and Thunderbolts* has runway before the next major wide opener.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Before we dig into further detail, a note about the other top players: Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie currently stands at $873.4M global after an international weekend of $26.6M (-33%). The overseas total is $475.2M. Also from WB, Sinners had an impressive -27% hold in its third offshore frame. The international cume to date is $57M for $236.7M worldwide.


	Back to Thunderbolts*. It released day-and-date globally, and, as previously noted, was not expected to do mega business in China and Korea (see below). China nevertheless is the top opening market (it started on a non-traditional Wednesday) with $10.4M through Sunday.


	After that, the UK, which had super summer weather heading into the weekend, grossed $7.7M. 


	In Latin America, Thunderbolts* opened at No. 1 in every market and had the 2nd highest debut of 2025 across the region, Brazil (including previews) and Mexico (including previews) as well as Central America, Chile and Paraguay. The regional opening weekend was ahead of Ant-Man, Shang-Chi, Eternals and Captain America: Brave New World.


	Across Europe, Thunderbolts* opened at No. 1 in all markets except for Finland and Sweden which were behind the continued play of Minecraft.


Thunderbolts* had the 2nd highest opening of 2025 in the Middle East and 3rd highest opening of 2025 in France and Spain as well as Iceland, Portugal and South Africa.

	











	Across Asia-Pacific, Thunderbolts* was No. 1 non-local in all markets except for Japan where it was the No. 2 studio title. It scored the 2nd highest studio opening of 2025 in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand; and the best non-local opening of 2025 in Hong Kong, India, Malaysia and Singapore.


	The Top 10 starts were: China ($10.4M), UK ($7.7M), Mexico ($7.3M), Brazil ($4M), France ($3.8M), Germany ($3.6M), Korea ($3.5M), Australia ($3.4M), Japan ($3.2M) and Spain ($2.8M).


A Minecraft Movie, meanwhile, continues to climb, with an overseas drop of just 33%, propelled by increases in China (+38%), Chile (+8%), Brazil (+7%), Japan (+5%) and Argentina (+2%). Other notable holds include Norway (-15%), Spain (-16%), Denmark (-19%), Mexico (-21%), Peru (-23%), Colombia (-24%), Poland (-25%), Holland (-32%), Korea (-33%), and Germany (-45%).


	In the Nordics, the film has become the all-time biggest video game adaptation topping The Super Mario Bros. Movie by 14%. Note that the original game hails from Sweden. The $475.2M international running total has surpassed the lifetime offshore grosses of fellow WB titles The Dark Knight, Wonka, Wonder Woman, The Batman and Dune: Part Two.


	The Top 5 so far are the UK ($69M), Germany ($35.7M), Australia ($33.5M), Mexico ($31.2M) and China ($27.5M).

Colin Jost left his ‘Weekend Update‘ post to poke fun at his ongoing side venture with Pete Davidson.


	On this weekend's Saturday Night Live, the comedian made a rare sketch appearance to try and offload the pair's decommissioned Staten Island ferry, which they infamously purchased for $280,100 in 2022.


	The cameo came at the end of a recurring sketch in which Mikey Day plays a man who gets cut off in traffic while driving with his daughter, played by Chloe Fineman, exchanging vulgar insults and very literal hand gestures with host Quinta Brunson on a ferry.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“This ticks me off too, 'cause I usually love the ferry,” says Day after conceding to Brunson, which cues Jost to pop up at Fineman's window.

	











	Jost shouts, “Hey! You said you love ferries? If you love ferries, would you like to buy one?”


	“Oh my god, is that Colin Jost?” asks Fineman, to which Day responds, “Yeah, that's Colin Jost. … Don't make eye contact. Just look straight ahead.”


	“Please buy it! Hey, I'm Pete Davidson. Hi!” adds Jost.


	Last March, Jost and Davidson's business partner Ron Castellano noted that their plans are still underway for a potentially $34 million project to convert the vessel into a floating entertainment complex complete with bars, restaurants and possibly a hotel.


	As the architect, Castellano explained that the SNL stars “have input,” adding: “I think right now, we have six bars and two venues operated separately or combined. We have outdoor event space, we have restaurants — two restaurants. It's a big boat, almost 300 feet long, 65,000 square feet.”

Saturday Night Live opened in the Oval Office, where Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson) was joined by Stephen Miller (Mikey Day) to sign a slew of new executive orders.


	Among them: An order to “make it socially acceptable for a man in his 70s to date a 24 year old.”


	“We're calling it the Belichick law,” Trump explained. “We're going to make girlfriends young again, OK. Old men can now date far younger women.”


	“We like that. It's hot. But in reverse, it's quite disgusting, right?”


	The quip was a reference to Bill Belichick, 73, the University of North Carolina head coach who is dating Jordon Hudson, 24.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The cold open was a return to familiar territory, but understandable given the way that Trump has dominated the news in his first months in office. 


	The skit opened with Trump boasting of signing 147 executive orders so far, “everything from banning paper straws to defunding PBS. I understand Elmo has now been apprehended by ICE brought to you by the letter L for El Salvador. He's not coming back.”


	Trump then introduced Miller as “lord of the shadows,” and Day played the White House deputy chief of staff as unusually creepy.


	As absurd as some of the executive orders sounded, in some cases they are not far off from reality.


	For example, one executive order, to reduce the number of interracial couples in TV commercials, isn't far off from the Trump administration's actions to eliminate DEI. The president's FCC chairman, has opened investigations into NBC-parent Comcast and other media companies over their diversity, equity and inclusion policies, even though they are private companies.


	Johnson's Trump remarked of the diversity in advertising, “It's just too many, right? You see them in the kitchen together making a meal from Hello Fresh. She's got tight braids. You're like, Where'd they meet, you know? What do they even talk about. It's insane.”


	Making an appearance in the sketch was Marco Rubio (Marcello Hernandez), as Trump signed an executive order forbidding all Hispanic babies from getting their ears pierced.


	“I mean, we got grown white American tweens trying to get into Claire's, and they gotta wait behind a thousand tiny Latina babies to get their ears pierced,” Trump said.


	The sketch ended with Trump signing an executive order to shorten the word “recession.”

	











	Trump said, “Recession will now be called recess. Fun, right? So America, get ready for a historically long recess.”


	Watch it above.

Quinta Brunson made her Saturday Night Live with a shorty celebration that conjured a 5′ pop icon.


	During this weekend's episode of the NBC sketch comedy show, the Golden Globe winner used her opening monologue to perform a song about being 4'11”, for which she was joined by Sabrina Carpenter and other special guests.


	“Yeah, that's right, I'm short. It's OK,” she said. “They even tried to cast me as a kid on Abbott Elementary, and I wrote that. But I love being short, and I want other short people to know the sky's the limit. So shorties, tonight, this one's for us.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	After being presented with a comically tall microphone stand, Brunson launches into a song about how “there's nothing wrong with being short,” listing some famous shorties in the lyrics.

	











	“When you're short you can do anything / You can flip like Simone [Biles], Olympic superstar / Or start a war with Drake, like you're Kendrick Lamar / You can be like Tom Holland and marry a ten / Or like Sabrina Carpenter and—”


	Carpenter then appears. “Wait. Sabrina, it's the real you. What are you doing here?” asked Brunson, to which the 2x Grammy winner responded: “I mean, you were talking about being short, so I thought I'd stop by.”


	They were also joined by SNL cast member Marcello Hernandez and retired NBA star Dwyane Wade, who said he “felt seen” because he's 6'4″ but “in the basketball world, that's like 4'10”, Shaq's like 7'1″—I just really wanna be in the song.”

	This weekend's episode of Saturday Night Live might have fans wondering… if Benson Boone married Quinta Brunson, would he take her last name to become Benson Brunson?


	As the Grammy nominee made his SNL debut, he briefly serenaded the Golden Globe winner with his single ‘Sorry I'm Here for Someone Else' after doing one of his signature backflips off the piano.


	Brunson, who's back for her second hosting gig, stuck around for a few seconds after introducing the Fireworks & Rollerblades artist, giving him a flirtatious side-eye as he sang to her before returning to the mic stand.

	Boone, who previously demonstrated his tumbling skills for Brunson in an SNL promo, later returned to the stage with a performance of his track ‘Mystical Magical'.


	The appearance comes after Boone made his Coachella debut last month, covering ‘Bohemian Rhapsody' with help from Queen's Brian May. He also announced his second album American Heart, which is set to drop on June 20.

The competition on “Rock the Block” has heated up, with three episodes and three different teams scoring wins so far.

But even if you're one of the huge number of fans who have tuned in every Monday to watch the designers go head-to-head, you haven't see everything.

HGTV has posted a behind-the-scenes look at season six on YouTube that gives fans and inside peek at just what it takes to knock out the massive renovations in just six weeks.

In the nearly 12 minute video, each team talks about their strategies to win not just the room-by-room challenges, but the whole competition.

A post shared by HGTV (@hgtv)

If you're loving the style the designers are bringing to their homes this season, shopping the look couldn't be easier.

Whether you love Jonathan and Jordan Knight's Modern Farmhouse vibe, the DeBoer's Cowboy Contemporary, the Kalamas Moody Modern or Alison and Michel's Refined Rustic look, you can shop everything from small accessories to large furniture pieces on Wayfair's “Rock the Block” page.

The page has items divided not only by episode but also by the teams. So if you liked something from episode 3 but can't remember whose house it was in, you're covered.

In fact, each episode has a QR code at the end. Scan it and you'll go right to the Wayfair Rock the Block homepage

A post shared by Ty Pennington (@thetypennington)

While you'll find plenty of home decor inspiration on season six of “Rock the Block,” you likely won't find a lot of fashion inspiration.

You may have noticed that everyone on every team is wearing the same thing every episode. No, that's not your imagination. That's a production strategy.

Contestants from previous seasons of “Rock the Block” have addressed this in the past.

In a 2022 Facebook post, “Fixer to Fabulous” star Jenny Marrs wrote, “The other big Rock the Block question we keep getting: do we really wear the same outfits the entire six weeks?

The answer is yes! We all wore the same clothes the entire time. We each brought several shirts and jeans and did a lot of laundry. The reason behind the outfit consistency is to help the editors out. If we changed each day, it would have been so hard for them to edit the show and keep track of who was wearing what on which day in which room. This kept things more consistent for them and made it simple for us when getting ready each day.”

Seasons four and five star Page Turner put up an Instagram video addressing her lack of wardrobe variety as well, writing, “Here's a quick & funny Rock the Block PSA – Ya'all won't break MY soul asking why we wear the same outfits on #RocktheBlock Errrrr'day! 🤣🤣😜 It's all for editing! That's it, nothing deep and no TV tricks 🤣🤣”

9.2

You call them. A dial tone. They stopped answering the phone months ago. Still, you try. The empty space between each tone becomes unbearable. You get desperate. Despite the memories of sunset kisses along the Seine and their breath on your neck in a dark London club, there is nothing to salvage. A last attempt. Another dial tone. You get a clue and, with time, self-respect. You hang up, embrace the silence. C'est fini, mon amour.

The romantic preoccupations of Japanese vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Noriko Sekiguchi—known by the stylized mononym nOrikO—transcend language. She's in the proud history of voices that break through the rave fog, carrying the la-da-dee, la-dee-das and the sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing. In her songs as POiSON GiRL FRiEND, she recounts love's highs and lows with simple honesty. Her mischievous sing-song mourns and reminesces in English, French, and Japanese over layered blends of 1980s-style club beats and synthetic strings with the melancholic sensibility of trip-hop. The music blooms to fill the space left in love's absence.

Born in Yokohama, Japan as the daughter of an international banker, nOrikO spent part of her childhood in Rio de Janeiro. She received primary education in French schools, coming home to a mother with a penchant for chanson. Returning to Japan as a teenager in the '80s, she took advantage of lax ID requirements to attend legendary Japanese rock DJ Kensho Onuki's London Nite parties, dancing the night away to ska, soul, and the Beatles.

After securing a contract with Polydor to make a singer-songwriter record, nOrikO embarked on a long trip through Europe. She dove headfirst into London nightlife, rubbing elbows with the New Romantics and the goths, entranced by clubs where a single night hosted wide-ranging sounds: new wave, indie rock, house, techno. One night on a dancefloor in Soho, the DJ played an ambient piano mix of Lil Louis' acid house classic “French Kiss,” and somewhere in the transcendence of the slowed-down beat and the sampled moan and the bass' seemingly infinite drone, the Japanese girl who'd arrived in the UK enamored by the Smiths and the Cure decided to focus her energies on the drum machine.

Back in Japan, she made friends at a new wave night called “Club Psychics,” according to one of her few interviews in English, with the blog Fond/Sound. nOrikO and two friends formed POiSON GiRL FRiENDS, taking the name from Scottish art rocker Momus' second album, 1987's The Poison Boyfriend. The trio released one self-titled EP, featuring a jangly early version of “Hardly Ever Smile (without you).” The more popular recording of the song opens Melting Moment, reimagined with a chugging drum machine, a low swell of synths, and cinematic strings that stand in somber contrast to the earlier “alternative guitar version.” It is now inarguably nOrikO's signature song. Her subdued delivery strikes a nerve with the directness of its yearning, whispered over an icy trip-hop beat: “I'd give up all my life for just your kiss.”

After the trio disbanded, nOrikO retained the name. She went on to shape her debut solo EP with a motley crew of collaborators that included house producer Tetsushi Fujita, early techno producer Baby Tokio, electronic body musician and sound engineer Yuji Sugiyama, violinist and Killing Time band member Neko Saito, and keyboard player and guitarist Makoto Otsu of Phew. Like those unforgettable club nights in London, Melting Moment would be a harmonious marriage of rock and electronica.

Though it runs just 35 minutes, Melting Moment feels grandiose in scope. “Fact 2,” the song that plays out like a disconnected call with an ex, is a tense storm of competing sounds: the cowbell-like breakbeat, the low rattle of what could pass for tambourine, the screechy guitar. Apart from that opening goodbye—It's over, my love—nOrikO's voice doesn't break through the hurricane until about halfway through. When she speaks, her words pierce the heart: “Do you love me like you used to do?/I still love you more than everything.” By letting the production do the talking, nOrikO invites us into the strained feeling on the far side of a tense phone call. At a 1992 label showcase, she held a mobile phone to the mic and let it screech. She ends the song on a note of longing, whispering, “I still love you.”

To create in a language that is not your mother tongue can feel like a form of displacement, an attempt to locate one's intended meaning in a completely different landscape. Often the writing produced is simple, to the point, and (sometimes, to native speakers) strange; consider the reception to Shakira's Laundry Service, where the Spanish-speaking pop star jumped boldly into writing in English after studying the poetry of Walt Whitman and Leonard Cohen. nOrikO's early cultural adaptations surely informed her writing: From a Japanese-speaking family, she learned some Portuguese as a child, attended a French school, and eventually spoke English in London. nOrikO is humble about her lyrics, describing herself as a musician who writes first from the melody. The language the lyrics come out in is a matter of channeling. Chalk it up to the ways our brains transform in diaspora.

nOrikO's music is affecting because it also plumbs another form of displacement: that of the heart. If we gain a different perspective from migrations, what do we gain in expanding the geography of our feelings? If we boil it down, nOrikO's emotional core is very French. It's a tendency most prominent in her cover songs, gentle transformations that feel emblematic of a particularly Parisian mode of longing, like her gossamer version of French singer Michel Polnareff's 1966 ballad “Love Me, Please Love Me,” or a 2014 recording of “Light My Fire” that turns one of the Doors' signature songs into something akin to bossa nova.

But the first time nOrikO tapped into romance à la française was her version of Jane Birkin's “Quoi,” which appears near the end of Melting Moment. The bilingual cover song, which also draws English lyrics from the jazz standard “All of Me,” is driven by an omnipresent piano riff, downtempo breakbeats, string and guitar melodies, and a vocal delivery so breathy it could have made Birkin blush. nOrikO's voice is a bell on the high notes, capturing the doe-eyed softness and shameless romanticism that keeps yé-yé divas like Catherine Ribeiro and Françoise Hardy eternally on lovers' mixtapes.

For all its ethereal fancy, nOrikO's romance is grounded in a real search for meaning. On the following year's full-length for Columbia, Love Me (named in part for the Polnareff tune), she spends a whole song attempting to define the feeling: “Love is light/Love is hope/Love is real/Love is hopeless/Love is lose/Love is hate.” At times her yearning is platonic, too: The second half of Melting Moment opens with “Those Were the Days,” a song popularized as Welsh singer Mary Hopkin's 1968 debut single. Over a beat reminiscent of UK garage, a jolly bar song becomes filled with melancholy nostalgia. nOrikO's voice rumbles deep and tired, stirring low as she contemplates days when she and her friends “would fight and never lose.” In her assessment, the rapture and dissolution of love and friendship is also an apocalypse.

Melting Moment appeared just after the golden age of Western-inspired genres in Japan such as city pop and shibuya-kei, but despite taking inspiration from England and France, the EP's snapshot of a wandering soul seeking absolution in big-city nightclubs was never a mainstream success. “In Japan, it was popular among young people who like edgy music, but it didn't resonate with the general public who listened to J-pop,” nOrikO told Resident Advisor in 2024. After Melting Moment, she released a few more albums as POiSON GiRL FRiEND before taking an extended break from the project. She went on to live in France, occasionally DJing or performing live, collaborating on music under the names Dark Eyed Kid and Kiss-O-Matic, and documenting her life on her blog.

In recent years, Melting Moment's borderless viewpoint and open-minded approach to genre has attracted a global audience that recognizes it as a quietly revolutionary piece of music, and its creator as an unsung electronic pioneer. In 2021, “Nobody,” a song from POiSON GiRL FRiEND's 1993 release, Shyness, was included on the well-received compilation Heisei no oto: Japanese Left-Field Pop From the CD Age (1989-1996), sparking renewed interest. In 2023, Melting Moment received a vinyl reissue, and nOrikO's distinctive, feather-light voice featured on “So Many Ways” by Kiss Facility, Mayah Alkhateri and Sega Bodega's shoegaze duo. As POiSON GiRL FRiEND found new audiences, a world tour took nOrikO to China and the U.S. In 2025, she's set to tour Europe, starting with a sold-out show in Paris.

On Melting Moment's closing title track, nOrikO sings in English, French, and Japanese, her voice piercing as she makes peace with a relationship that's evaporated into words left unsaid. The record ends with a violin solo and elegant piano, a moment as restorative as the sunlight and breeze on your face as you exit the party, body depleted from dancing out a broken heart. Perhaps what continues to draw new generations to this underground gem is its sense of fragile hope. Over ambient textures and breakbeats on “The Future Is Now,” nOrikO contemplates a crumbling world and grabs our shoulders to give them a shake: “Why don't we try/To save our planet for our children?” (Another simple, key exclamation: “Don't be negative!”) Melting Moment is a small utopia, radiating human warmth to resist the modern world's ever-encroaching isolation. It's an invitation to step into the present.

	President Donald Trump, when asked if he has an obligation to uphold the Constitution as president, said, “I don't know.”


	Trump made the disturbing comment during an interview with Kristen Welker on NBC's Meet the Press while discussing his campaign promise to deport millions of immigrants. Trump, who himself is free because he exploited his own due process rights, has denied those same rights to immigrants he sent without trial to an infamous mega-prison in El Salvador.


	“Your Secretary of State says everyone who's here, citizens and non-citizens, deserve due process. Do you agree, Mr. President?” Welker asked Trump.


	“I don't know. I'm not, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know,” he said.

Welker: Do you agree that everyone who is here deserves due process? Citizens and noncitizens?Trump: I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.Welker: The 5th amendment says as much.. Don't you need to uphold the constitution?Trump: I don't know pic.twitter.com/1y8POREX9S


	It's a terrifying answer from a president who, like other presidents before him, swore while taking the oath of office to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”


	When Welker pressed Trump, pointing out that the Fifth Amendment entitles everyone in the U.S. to due process, he again said, “I don't know.”

	











	“It seems — it might say that, but if you're talking about that, then we'd have to have a million or two million or three million trials,” Trump continued. “We have thousands of people that are some murderers and some drug dealers and some of the worst people on Earth.”


	The Fifth Amendment states that “no person shall… be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” making no distinction between citizens and non-citizens.


	Welker then asked Trump whether he needs to “uphold the Constitution of the United States as president.”


	“I don't know,” Trump said, adding that his lawyers “are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.”


	But, he added, “What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. They have a different interpretation.”


	The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Trump must bring back Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man that Trump's own lawyers have admitted was accidentally deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's deportation was a violation of an earlier “protection from removal” order by a judge that should have prevented him from being sent out of the U.S.

	The court late last month also temporarily blocked Trump from deporting another group of Venezuelan immigrants using the Alien Enemies Act without first granting them an opportunity to contest their deportation.

	











	While Trump has whined that “communist, radical-left judges” are impeding his deportations, despite the fact that he nominated three sitting Supreme Court justices. Even a Trump-appointed federal district judge ruled that his use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport undocumented immigrants and deny them due process is unlawful. 


	“The President cannot summarily declare that a foreign nation or government has threatened or perpetrated an invasion or predatory incursion of the United States, followed by the identification of the alien enemies subject to detention or removal,” District Court Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. wrote in a ruling on Thursday. 


	But in the interview Trump insisted that he has an electoral mandate to deport undocumented immigrants.

	“I was elected to get them the hell out of here and the courts are holding me from doing it,” he said.


	In a recent NewsNation-DDHQ poll, a slim majority of respondents (51 percent) said that immigrants without legal status are entitled to a hearing a due process before being deported.

Julien Baker and Torres have canceled the remainder of their tour in support of new album Send a Prayer My Way, the duo announced Sunday.


	“Due to recent events, Julien Baker is prioritizing her well-being and taking time to focus on her health,” read a statement posted on Baker's Instagram. “Therefore, the Julien Baker & Torres ‘Send A Prayer My Way' Tour has been canceled. This decision was not made lightly, and we understand the disappointment this may cause for fans. We deeply appreciate your understanding.”

A post shared by Julien Rose Baker (@julienrbaker)


	The duo's tour kicked off April 23 in Richmond and was scheduled to run through Sept. 13. In addition to their standalone shows, they booked gigs at festivals like Utah's Kilby Block Party, Oregon's Pickathon, the Newport Folk Festival, San Francisco's Outside Lands, Milwaukee's Summerfest, and Louisville's Bourbon and Beyond Fest. 


	Baker and Torres played a sold-out show Thursday, May 1 at New Orleans' Tipitinas, and were next scheduled to perform Sunday night in San Antonio before the trek was nixed.

Lady Gaga performed to a record-breaking crowd Saturday at Rio De Janeiro, Brazil as an estimated 2.5 million people attended the singer's free concert on Copacabana Beach.


	The gig marked the highest attended concert by a female artist in history, according to the singer's reps, eclipsing the 1.6 million people Madonna drew to the same venue last year.


	“Tonight, we're making history… Thank you for making history with me,” Lady Gaga told the crowd, which included over a million Brazilians as well as a reported 500,000 Little Monsters who flew in for the special show, which injected over $100 million into Rio's economy, NPR reported.


	The record holder for largest concert crowd in history — according to Guinness World Records — remains Rod Stewart, who attracted a crowd of over 4 million to Copacabana Beach on New Year's Eve in 1994.

	The Copacabana Beach concert marked Lady Gaga's first concert in Brazil since 2012. “I've missed you so much”, she told an enormous crowd that gathered the previous night just to watch her soundcheck. “I know that this is not the first show here, I know this is just a rehearsal, it feels like it's the real show.”

She'll next travel to Singapore for four shows in that country later this month before the North American arena leg of the Mayhem Ball tour begins in July.


	Rio De Janeiro's tourism department previously announced plans to continue staging free Copacabana Beach concerts until at least 2028

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took aim at Donald Trump imagining himself as the next Pope, as well as the president's claim that he actually isn't ruining the economy and Americans should just “be patient.”


	“Well, guys, it happened. Last night, Trump posted an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope, apparently ordering a one-way ticket to hell,” Colin Jost joked. “Who posts a photo of themselves dressed as a guy who died a week ago? Trump was at the Pope's funeral. That means he walked past an open casket and was like, ‘We should do a Who Wore It Best.'”


	“As a Catholic, I just feel like Trump's photo was really disrespectful,” Jost continued. “Also, if Trump really wants to be Pope, he should probably stay away from JD Vance.”


	Co-anchor Michael Che then turned to Trump pleading with Americans to “be patient” when it comes to the contracting economy, while also continuing to blame his predecessor.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“If his brain gets any worse, he's going to be patient,” Che joked as an image of Trump in a mental health facility showed on screen.

	











	Also on the economy, Jost reacted to Trump saying at a recent Cabinet meeting that, due to his tariffs, children may have to make do with two dolls “instead of 30” this Christmas.


	“Now I rarely talk directly to the president, but you listen, and you listen good: If I wake up on Christmas morning and run downstairs to find only two dolls under my tree, I will lose my f—ing mind,” he joked. “There better be a second tree with 28 dolls. And you know what? I've put up with a lot under Trump so far. He might be cutting social security. Okay, they're old. Screw 'em. He's deporting innocent kids? They've gotta grow up some time. But if only two dolls show up when I've made tea for thirty? Oh hell, no!”


	Che then riffed on Elon Musk stepping back from his role in DOGE.

	Brazilian police revealed Sunday that they thwarted a terror attack that would have targeted Lady Gaga's record-breaking concert at Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach.


	The Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro state and Brazil's Justice Ministry announced two arrests the morning after the concert, adding that suspects were planning to carry out a bomb attack at the concert that drew an estimated 2.5 million people.


	According to police (via Reuters), the plot was orchestrated by a group “promoting hate speech [against the LGBTQ community] and the radicalization of teenagers.” 


	“The suspects were recruiting participants, including minors, to carry out coordinated attacks using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails,” the police said in a statement. “The plan was treated as a ‘collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media.”


	One male suspect described as the group's leader was arrested in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul for illegal possession of a firearm, while a teenager in Rio de Janeiro was detained for storing child pornography.

	The plot was uncovered through the Justice Ministry's the ministry's Cyber Operations Lab following a tip from Rio state police intelligence, which found online evidence of digital cells encouraging violence toward the Copacabana Beach attendees.

Saturday Night Live host Quinta Brunson sang about what it's like being under five feet tall–something that Sabrina Carpenter popped in to say she could relate to.


	The Abbott Elementary creator and star, who last hosted SNL in April 2023, prefaced her showtune: “I'm proof you can do anything you put your mind to, even if people look down on you, whether it's because of where you come from or literally because you're only 4′11.” 


	Brunson then sang about how some experiences at her height unintentionally turn out well.


	“I went for a walk in the park the other day, and didn't even realize I had won a limbo competition,” Brunson revealed. 


	After comparing herself to the 4'8″ Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Simone Biles, the 5'5″ rapper Kendrick Lamar, and the 5'7″ actor Tom Holland, Carpenter sidled up to her.

	Brunson asked: “One shorty to another: When you eat short ribs, does it just taste like ribs?”

	











	“I've never thought about it like that, but yeah!” Carpenter replied. “Here's a question for you: When you read short stories, do they feel like novels?”


	The two traded off lines until 5'6″ SNL cast member Marcello Hernandez joined in, followed by former NBA star Dwayne Wade, who towered over them all at 6'4″.


	Yet being that height in the league, Wade said, made it seem like he was 4'10”.

Khao Kala, located just three hours north of Bangkok, has earned its reputation as a UFO hotspot due to persistent claims from locals. Many residents say they have seen flying saucers or strange lights in the sky, with some asserting these sightings are a nearly daily occurrence. 

A mysterious hill in Thailand is drawing global attention after villagers claimed to have frequent encounters with unidentified flying objects (UFOs). American vlogger Travis Leon Price recently visited Khao Kala in Nakhon Sawan province—dubbed Thailand's Area 51—to uncover the truth behind the astonishing reports.

Khao Kala, located just three hours north of Bangkok, has earned its reputation as a UFO hotspot due to persistent claims from locals. Many residents say they have seen flying saucers or strange lights in the sky, with some asserting these sightings are a nearly daily occurrence. The hill is nestled in a region known as Nakhon Sawan, or ""City of Heaven,"" adding to the mystique of the location. According to a report by CNN, villagers believe that telepathic communication with aliens is possible, especially during meditation sessions in front of Buddha statues found on the hill.

Intrigued by the reports, Travis Leon Price visited the site and recorded his journey in a video shared across his social media platforms. During his exploration, Price was guided by a local who passionately described frequent alien encounters. The area even features a UFO club, where like-minded believers gather to exchange stories and engage in group meditation.

Towards the end of his visit, Price joined a nighttime watch session. His footage captured twinkling lights moving oddly in the sky, something many believe to be evidence of alien activity. While sceptics may argue otherwise, Price left viewers to draw their own conclusions.

Some locals do not see conflict between their Buddhist faith and extraterrestrial beliefs. In fact, they interpret alien messages as spiritually aligned with traditional religious teachings. In 2024, a local sect even hosted Thailand's first UFO music festival, drawing believers and curious visitors from across the country. Festival attendee Siwadon Chantanasewi told the South China Morning Post, “I thought the aliens might fly past, maybe just pop by for a moment. I had this strong feeling they knew about the festival.”

Due to growing crowds of UFO seekers, Thai officials have expressed concern about Khao Kala's status as a protected forest area. While visitors are welcome to hike up the hill and visit religious sites like the large Buddha statue and the Buddha footprint, camping or overnight stays are strictly prohibited.

A new water tower is being built at Hamilton Road and Morris Avenue in south Bloomington. 

FLICK LITE: Our latest listings, as offered by the readers and your own resident Lite Boy ...

Look! Up into the sky!

It's not a bird.

It's not a plane.

It's … uh ... uh ...

... uh, what is that?

At the corner of Hamilton Road and Morris Avenue in south Bloomington these days, something odd and new is taking shape.

Motorists are slowing down. Folks on Facebook and NextDoor are asking questions. They're snapping photos, wondering if — just maybe — the world's largest salad bowl is about to open for business.

Apparently, no. Sorry.

It's the City of Bloomington's newest water tower — topless for a moment — and drawing stares, like some leftover from a NASA garage sale.

That upside-down cone at the bottom?

City spokesperson Katherine Murphy tells us it'll be hoisted to the top of the tower that will eventually reach 12 stories, forming the base of a tank that'll hold 1 million gallons of water.

A million gallons? We fired up the calculator.

That's roughly 250,000 dishwasher runs, 625,000 flushes of the toilet, or about 50 summertime fill-ups for the average Central Illinois backyard pool, give or take a cannonball or two.

Rumors are, Bloomington native and Normal Community West grad Adam Kinzinger is considering a move back to Illinois from his current Texas home (home of his wife, Sofia Boza-Holman). And we can only conclude it might be because of a potential U.S. Senate run for a soon-vacant Senate seat or even JB Pritzker's spot as Illinois governor.

""Nope. No plans yet,"" replies Adam.

Lots of job openings in Illinois, we remind Mr. Kinzinger.

""Well, I wouldn't rule anything out,"" he amusedly responds.

Another name thrown out as a potential candidate for the warmth of Durbin's chair: Michelle Obama.

Or even Oprah!

— Jim and Ann Merry. Of Normal, they're celebrating 50 years since they decided to be merry and marry, too.

— Barbara Buffaloe. The new mayor of Columbia, Missouri, she apparently buffaloed her opponents.

— Jeff Kraft. Head brewer at Titletown Craft Brewery in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and very popular during the recent NFL draft.

You know how countless times in a day or week, you grab a pen, only to find it doesn't work, or the pen ink skips, and you're consequently looking for a piece of scratch paper to see if you can get it to work?

Presto!

At St. John's Lutheran Church in Bloomington, near its “welcome center,” someone has thought ahead and already reached a solution before the problem even exists.

Near a box of pens, the church has a pad set aside for attendees to make sure a pen works before committing to using it.





The welcome center at St. John's Lutheran Church in Bloomington has a pad set aside for attendees to make sure a pen works before committing to using it.

As spotted in Bloomington, in this case along Euclid Avenue, a handwritten sign/message on the back of a traveling utility trailer:

“I VOTED FOR THE CONVICTED FELON. HOW ABOUT YOU?”

An odd announcement spotted on a vehicle driving on Euclid Avenue in Bloomington reads, ""I voted for the convicted felon. How about you?""

(As offered by the readers)

— Startup, Washington

— Romeo, Michigan

— Nutterville, West Virginia

There you are, near sunset, strolling downtown Bloomington — maybe near the McLean County Museum of History.

And, you hear it.

Cawing.

Errant bird jabber.

It's echoing on the square, like an Alfred Hitchcock feature.

You look up.

But you see no birds at all!?!

Exactly!

That's thanks to a new weapon in the museum's ongoing war against its uninvited, un-housebroken guests: crows. It's called the BirdXPeller. It emits pre-recorded distress calls and predator squawks, all designed to make a crow think, “Let's roost somewhere less terrifying.”

And, to seal the deal?

Metal whirligigs now also dangle from the trees along Washington Street. They flash, whirl and allegedly drive crows bonkers — or at least out of downtown.

This isn't about the noise.

“It's the poop,” confides Julie Emig, the former city councilperson and museum's executive director. “Our entrances are mottled each night with fresh poop and feathers.” (When's the last time you heard someone use the word 'mottle'? We love it!)

Will it work?

We read crows tend to migrate in spring, so maybe they were already packing.

But here's the kicker — over in the museum's “Cruisin' with Lincoln on Route 66” gift shop?

They're now selling (not a joke) crow finger-puppets.

Says Emig with a shrug and a laugh: “How could we not?”

Herb Eaton works in downtown Bloomington on Wednesday, April 30, 2025, to install a tassel on the 10-foot-tall corn cob sculpture he created in 2000 using wood, fiberglass, canvas, stainless steel and hemp. The piece was originally created for Bloomington's 150th anniversary, along with some 28 other corn cob sculptures decorated by local artists, placed around town for display, and eventually auctioned off. A Creative Catalyst Grant from the Illinois Arts Council made it possible to restore Eaton's work, and it is now part of the McLean County Museum of History's collections. The sculpture will be displayed on the southwest lawn of the museum until November, when the Livingston's Department Store Santa will replace it. 

Herb Eaton, right foreground, assisted by Dennis Wentworth, behind Eaton, Craig Hullinger, left, and David Bentley move Eaton's 10-foot-tall corn sculpture onto a trailer on Wednesday, April 30, 2025. The idea for the work, called ""Star Crossed Pollinators,"" came as Eaton was playing for the Heartland Jazz Orchestra, which at that time was performing “Star Crossed Lovers” by Duke Ellington.

After being on display outside the Eaton Gallery on Center Street for over two decades, Eaton said it was a bigger project to restore the sculpture than to create it in the first place.

Most of our adult life, we invent stories or believe in stories told by others, rather than seek supporting evidence for these stories. The reason is simple. Evidence-based reasoning is hard and story-telling is easy. But in the words of John F. Kennedy during his speech at Rice University in 1962 (which happens to be my birth year): “We choose to […] do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.”

The tendency to tell stories rather than do the hard work of collecting evidence applies also to some scientists. When I led an expedition to retrieve meteoritic materials from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean based on NASA data, some scientists published papers arguing that they do not believe the data about this meteor and that we will not find anything. Once we retrieved meteoritic materials with an anomalous chemical composition, they argued that we retrieved coal ash and probably went to the wrong place. These scientists preferred to tell stories without access to the materials we actually retrieved, instead of pursuing the hard work of evidence-based science that my research team carried out.

The attraction to story-telling is even more prevalent in the realm of politics. During my recent visit to Washington DC, I heard stories that the U.S. Government is in possession of vehicles manufactured by alien civilizations. In order to believe these stories, we must see the vehicles for the same reason that we would hesitate to buy a used car without an inspection.

A millennium ago, numerous people were willing to testify under oath with great conviction that the Earth is at the center of the Universe. A popularity poll back then would have concluded that their consistent views must be correct beyond a reasonable doubt. Yet, in 1992 even the Vatican admitted that this widely-believed story in ancient times was wrong. Yes, we can make progress in our knowledge, as long as we are curious and courageous enough to collect evidence that might contradict our preconceptions.

Gaining new knowledge requires funding for the related research effort. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary funding. The Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb, cost 2 billion dollars by 1945 — equivalent to over 30 billion dollars today. Like nuclear weapons, UAPs could represent new technologies of utmost importance for national security. Figuring out their nature deserves 3% of the Manhattan Project budget or about a billion dollars today.

In an interview with the brilliant Natasha Zouves from NewsNation last night, I argued that congress should allocate a billion dollars to a “UAP-Manhattan Project” that will develop artificial intelligence (AI) software to search for outliers among the objects detected by state-of-the-art sensors, in a nationwide effort to figure out the nature of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). Under the conservative assumption that all technological vehicles are human made, the Department of Defense will benefit from a new alert system to national security threats. We must be able to identify objects smaller than the 2023 Chinese spy balloon, and avoid the embarrassment of admitting UAPs in multiple congressional reports that were filed by the director of national intelligence in recent years. All objects in our sky must be identified in order for taxpayers to feel safe and rest assured that the trillion-dollar defense budget for Fiscal year 2026 is protecting American citizens from the drones and balloons of adversarial nations.

As the cherry on top, the UAP-Manhattan Project also holds the potential for discovering a rare extraterrestrial vehicle and answering the question: “Are we alone?” It would be unwise to invest 10 billion dollars in NASA's Habitable World Observatory and search for microbes on distant exoplanets, without allocating 10% of this expenditure to the study of anomalous technological artifacts near Earth.

Given the potential for discovering extraterrestrial vehicles, I am confident that a UAP-Manhattan Project will attract the best minds in science to the task. The All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in the Pentagon focused mostly on past data which is of limited utility because it cannot be verified. In addition, AARO does not currently employ the best and the brightest in the scientific community. The UAP-Manhattan Project will develop new AI tools for multi-modal analysis of the vast amount of data accessible with state-of-the-art cameras and multi-wavelength sensors.

With a billion dollars in funding, the UAP-Manhattan Project will collect new evidence and transform UAPs from the category of “unidentified anomalies” to that of “identified phenomena”. Getting the Nobel Prize by answering the biggest question in science would be a welcomed bonus. But at the very least, American taxpayers will sleep better at night knowing that we understand all objects flying in our sky.

What would it mean for humans if there were another species out there, and how big is the challenge when the human species is just a speck among others in space? The bigger problems and challenges mankind faces today might already have solutions in a different world.

For example, other life forms could have already mastered climate adaptation in ways that could be implemented on Earth as it battles climate change. In other words, alien life could help secure and reimagine humanity's future.

Whatever the results of finding life outside this planet, it would mean a transformation in many forms for society. New finds on Earth, such as discovering that the ocean wasn't always blue and that its original color could be a clue to finding alien life, bring humanity closer every day to discovering whether they're the only species out there, or not!

Over 75 years after its discovery, scientists are still baffled by a strange crater that seemingly defies all rational explanations.

According to NASA, aliens may exist simply because there's no concrete evidence that they don't. But scientists urge everyone to remember a few things. First, life comes in many forms. People tend to picture the alien lifeforms from space movies that belong to intelligent civilizations, but extraterrestrials are likely microbial organisms hidden on planets with oceans or oxidized atmospheres.

NASA states that while the only evidence of life is right here on this planet, if anyone found an exoplanet atmosphere or other “telltale signs of life,” that would prove that extraterrestrials are out there. So, the better one understands life, the higher the chance one has of finding it elsewhere.

Many scientists are turning to the Earth's most remote corners to study evolution and the nature of life. A Chinese robot has recently reached the deepest point on the planet, the Mariana Trench, and it's looking for life. Meanwhile, other experts are turning to the stars. The James Webb Space Telescope has been crucial in this approach, and NASA believes it might detect alien lifeforms before anything else can.

Intelligent life

Light or atmospheric pollution emitted by their civilization is visible from human telescopes; sounds made over far distances by the alien lifeforms are detected on humans' radios; alien lifeforms with highly advanced technology travel from far away to either visit this planet or stumble upon it

Primal/floral life

Photosynthesis or other chemical processes done by flora or fauna are detected by humanity's telescopes; scientists find water on another planet with a composition similar to Earth's; humans' telescopes spot atmospheres or seas that behave similarly to people's own on other planets

""This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.""

Finding alien life wouldn't just be thrilling for UFO hunters and curious scientists. It would help humans better understand their own and nature's origins. Finding extraterrestrials somewhere less familiar than Earth would illuminate the diverse conditions that can support life.

Space is an extreme environment, and such a discovery would also help scientists understand the world's “extremophiles”. Unknown lifeforms pop up all the time across the globe, including those responsible for stunning structures in the Namibian desert, another extreme environment. Alien lifeforms could be similar to those in humanity's neck of the woods or galaxy.

Historically, the world may have been wrong about life's origin on Earth, and gaining any further insights could be critical in untangling the mystery of existence, nature, and survival.

The planet pulses like a human heart, but on a much larger scale.

The world is attempting to solve climate change and its affiliated natural disasters, sometimes with controversial measures such as dimming the sun. However, finding extraterrestrial life could offer alternatives that humanity has not considered. With a comparable planet to learn from, people could see what adaptation looks like beyond what has been created on Earth.

An entire organization is dedicated to preventing people from contaminating other planets. NASA's Office of Planetary Protection promotes “responsible exploration” through policies that resemble the 'leave-no-trace' principle.

Ultimately, finding alien life would, at the very least, remind the world that this planet, like all of them, is fragile. Perhaps confirming this could motivate policymakers and lawmakers to reevaluate their stances and unite with a singular direction for sustaining humanity as it's known today.

iQiyi is surely breathing a sigh of relief with the reception for it's fantasy supernatural period C-drama The Demon Hunter's Romance. The shelved for nearly two years drama airdropped in early April once the ban on female lead Song Zu Er was lifted and the result was better than expected. The drama got stronger than expected reviews especially for male lead Allen Ren who many felt was back to his strong suit in playing the stoic yet still emotionally aware male lead. Song Zu Er has long been a top among the flowers of her generation for both her visuals and her acting so her performance here was par for the course. It helps that the directing was sharp and the vignette stories interesting, and the drama recently wrapped its run and opened with a solid 7.3 Douban ratings.



This drama is definitely joining my list of rewatchable dramas.

Mine too. I watched to support Song Zu'er and it exceed my expectations. I dont want to compare it to others great Chinese dramas, this was entertaining for me. Even Allen Ren was watchable.

It's making me look forward to Xu Kai and Tian Xiwei's Moonlit Reunion as well, where the male lead is also a demon hunter.

I hope this drama will be good for Xu Kai… He is not a bad actor, he looks good but there something lacking in his dramas… I wish him well this time.

He seems to do well when he has chemistry with his co-star. The most recent drama which I think he's good in is As Beautiful As You.

It's such well made drama, in terms of writing, and cinematography, it's beautiful. Director did a great job, and usually lifeless  Allen Ren is very suited for role. Love it.

I think if iQIYI didn't mess up with AI open ending the rating Douban would be higher.

The stories were interesting and engaging. I know I have hard time finishing dramas but this one, I've finished it in one week. The open ending was absolutely not necessary though.

Starring Monika Panwar as Madhu, a simple girl who moves to Delhi for a job, the series skillfully blends supernatural horror with a parallel storyline about a serial killer.

Starring Monika Panwar as Madhu, a simple girl who moves to Delhi for a job, the series skillfully blends supernatural horror with a parallel storyline about a serial killer.

Imagine this: A young girl from Gwalior, new to Delhi, with no place to stay, stumbles upon a ladies' hostel and decides to call it home. Little does she know, the girls in the hostel are wary of her, especially the ones next to her room. They warn her about a supernatural presence in her room, claiming that the girl who stayed there before died under mysterious circumstances. This is the eerie premise of 'Khauf', a horror series directed by Pankaj Kumar and Surya Balakrishnan. Starring Monika Panwar as Madhu, a simple girl who moves to Delhi for a job, the series skillfully blends supernatural horror with a parallel storyline about a serial killer. If you're on the fence about watching, here are a few reasons why 'Khauf' is worth your time:

The intriguing premise 'Khauf' follows a well-established horror formula: a haunted location, an unsuspecting protagonist, and a gripping mystery. What sets this series apart is its ability to make the premise instantly compelling. Madhu, the main character, is thrust into a world of eerie events in her new room, which the girls around her claim is haunted. The uncertainty about whether the room is truly supernatural or just a figment of overactive imaginations keeps viewers hooked. From the first episode, you're drawn into the mystery, why are the girls so hostile? Is the ghost of the previous tenant still lurking? The tension builds with each passing minute, and as the story unfolds, the involvement of a serial killer adds another layer of intrigue, creating an even deeper web of suspense. The way these two plotlines are interconnected makes the show even more engaging.

Monika Panwar's standout performance as Madhu Monika Panwar, playing Madhu, is absolutely magnetic in this role. From the moment she steps into the hostel, you feel her vulnerability and determination. As the supernatural events start to unfold, her performance captures both the terror and the emotional weight that Madhu carries from her past. Panwar doesn't just portray fear; she embodies it, and you can't help but feel her helplessness as she tries to make sense of the chaos around her. You're not just watching her react to terror, you're living it with her.

A talented ensemble cast that elevates the story While Monika Panwar takes centre stage, the supporting cast adds depth and complexity to the story. From Rajat Kapoor to Shilpa Shukla and Geetanjali Kulkarni, each actor brings something unique to the table. Their performances complement the main narrative, making the tension in the hostel feel even more palpable. The interactions between Madhu and the girls who warn her about the room are filled with unease, and every moment feels charged with suspicion. The chemistry between the cast members gives the series a sense of realism, grounding the supernatural elements in a world that feels just a little too real.

A good blend of supernatural and psychological horror 'Khauf' doesn't rely on the usual scares; it takes a deeper, more unsettling approach by blending supernatural events with psychological horror. The series makes you question what's real and what's all in Madhu's head. Madhu's past has already put her through hell, and now, the stakes are even higher. Can she handle the weight of the horrors that keep piling on? Adding another layer to the mystery is the serial killer, who seems oddly connected to the strange happenings, and he knows more than he's letting on. But what's his role in all of this? It's not just the supernatural elements that make 'Khauf' so eerie; it's Madhu's deeply rooted fear and pain that make the horror feel disturbingly real and intensely personal.

A popular Plymouth clairvoyant who's been “guiding” locals for years has left some ""absolutely gobsmacked”. I decided to give her a visit after speaking with her on the phone in December 2024 - as she spookily seemed to pick up on a few things about me then, even though we'd never met in person.

Sam Hatch set up The Psychic Shop in Devonport about 30 years ago, but she told me she's been “reading people” for 40 years - and generations of Plymothians have visited her in that timeframe. I'd spoken to other people who were familiar with the clairvoyant - and even some sceptics said this woman's predictions were spot on.

I've always found fortune telling possibilities intriguing - of course, I realise there is no actual scientific proof in this spiritual practice of prediction. However, the age-old profession of clairvoyance goes back hundreds of years and many people still flock to a fortune teller with a good reputation even in this day and age.

Google reviews of Sam's predictions show that many customers are impressed. One recent reviewer said she was “absolutely gobsmacked”. Sam was “so accurate” the reviewer wrote, adding that she “cannot recommend her enough”.

Another reviewer wrote: ""I have met Sam twice, both times everything she predicted happened. No other psychic has been that accurate.""

When I walked into The Psychic Shop it felt very calming and although it's situated on the busy Albert Road in Devonport, once inside it was very peaceful. The shop itself is a treasure trove full to the brim with dream catchers, crystals, books and lots of other bits and pieces related to the spiritual world - and the premises has its own resident ghost, I was told.

I sat beside a wishing well while waiting for my reading, all coins put into the wishing well are collected for animal charities. A notice by the well reads: “Be careful what you wish for. Wishes made in a psychic shop are sure to be heard” - of course I made a wish.

Then I went into a separate room and met Sam for my reading. I sat opposite her, the table was covered with huge crystals, candles, incense and tarot cards.

Sam explained the process and then I was asked to “call to the higher realms” in order for Sam to “make contact with the spirits and get the insight she needs” for my reading. I was to make notes on a pad of A4 paper as she spoke, she spoke slowly and thoroughly so it was easy to write it all down.

I was given initials of certain people with connections to weddings and other life events she predicted. It's all on a notepad so I can refer to this going forward, a few specific trips away to Spain and America were predicted - all noted so I'll wait to see.

Readings are very personal, so I won't be divulging all, but one of the most interesting things Sam told me was right at the end of my reading. She detailed that sometimes the answers you're looking for may lie in the past - and not just your immediate past, but a past life you may have experienced.

Sam also provides past life readings, which I'm intrigued to try next, she also runs hypnotherapy sessions. Crystal healing is also offered along with spell and tarot reading sessions - where you can learn how to “open up psychically” yourself, Sam also provides readings to people across the globe over the phone.

Demolishing the spurious claim that Israel was behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

In recent years, social media has become a breeding ground for conspiracy theories, including the disturbing claim that Israel was behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

This theory has gained some traction online primarily through selective interpretations of recently declassified documents. Let's break down the theory, show why it doesn't hold up to scrutiny, and explain why it spread specifically now.

The theory claims that Israel wanted revenge for JFK's pushing for inspections of Israel's Dimona nuclear facility, as a part of his nuclear non-proliferation policy. Israel then used its connections with various people in the US to orchestrate his murder.

This so-called “motive” that antisemites claim Israel had is weak. JFK's nuclear policy was not unique to Israel. Kennedy advocated for nuclear inspections for nuclear-capable countries globally, including allies like France or India. Kennedy was also a staunch supporter of Israel. He was the first U.S. president to approve arms sales to the country in 1962, including Hawk anti-aircraft missiles. The idea that Israel would want to assassinate a friendly President simply because of policy disagreement is ridiculous.

Beyond the question of motivation, what are the pieces of evidence that the proponents of this theory claim point to Israel?

When the JFK files were finally released in March, 2025, many antisemities searched them for any mention of Jews or Israel being involved in Kennedy's assassination. One file noted a conversation between an Egyptian and a Saudi who guessed Israel was behind it. This was shared on social media as “proof,” but it was just rumors from a biased source in the Middle East.

This is a form of “information laundering,” where people will claim an unverified rumor has a source, but the earlier report was itself an unverified rumor.

Another couple files released in the 2025 batch were memos from 1954 about James Angleton, a CIA officer and head of the CIA's Israel desk. The file discusses the practices of giving over intelligence information. The text of the file shows Israel would clear with Angelton first, before revealing intelligence outside the CIA. There is nothing connecting this memo, written almost a decade before the assassination, to JFK.

Antisemites jumped on these pages since the CIA bracketed the words “Israel” and “Israeli Intelligence” as words they objected to releasing. However, these brackets also appear on many different names, codes, and information in the files. There's no information at all that shows Israel had a hand in JFKs death.

A JFK file released in 2018, sometimes implied to have been newly released in 2025, contains a quote from a Cuban anti-Castro arms dealer named Homer S. Echevarria speaking to government informant Thomas Mosley. Echevarria claimed to him, “We now have plenty of money—our new backers are Jews—as soon as ‘we' (or ‘they') take care of Kennedy,” the day before the Kennedy assassination, which caught the attention of the Secret Service and FBI. Upon their investigation, they found no connection between Echevarria or his words to the assassination. One Secret Service Agent, Joseph Noonan, even expressed doubts about Mosley's report, believing Echevarria was just being a braggart.

The same pattern occurs over and over again. There is no evidence, no list of names, no smoking gun. To the conspiracy theorist, there doesn't need to be; the culprit has already been found. They only need to find the evidence after the fact. And when the evidence isn't found, they create it instead with documents taken out of context.

The existence of this theory is strange in and of itself. Most JFK conspiracies have been out there for decades. The culprits in these conspiracy theories are the CIA or the mafia or anti-Castro Cubans or Lyndon Johnson. All of these theories were proposed in the 1960s, soon after he was murdered. The emergence of this new JFK theory in the social media age suggests it is rooted in the way social media works.

Social media's role in amplifying such lies echoes Hitler's “Big Lie” tactic. The Big Lie is the tactic of spreading falsehoods so outrageous that people believe no one would actually say it unless it was the truth. And modern social media rewards engagement: The amount of people who view your post or video is the barometer for success according to social media platforms circa 2025.

Combatting the rapid spread of lies and propaganda on social media remains a work in progress and education is our most powerful tool. Understanding JFK's documented support for Israel, alongside a careful review of the 2025 JFK files equips us to reject antisemitic conspiracies that falsely implicate Jews or Israel in his assassination.

May 3, 2025; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA; San Diego Padres right fielder Fernando Tatis Jr. (23) points to the fans after the Padres defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park. Mandatory Credit: David Dermer-Imagn Images

In a twist that has both shocked and enthralled fans, a dramatic development emerged from a heart-stopping incident at the PNC Park. A 20-year-old fan, once believed to be severely injured from a fall off the famous 21-foot Clemente Wall, has now regained consciousness, prompting both relief and a surge of unexpected mythology.

Incident Overview
A fateful day at PNC Park turned tragic when the young fan experienced a perilous fall off the towering Clemente Wall. The 21-foot height that has long symbolized admiration for a sporting legend became the setting for a life-altering accident. The incident, which evoked collective sympathy and numerous heartbeats around the stadium, set the stage for a story that has since morphed into a broader conversation with unexpected twists.

Emergency Response and Recovery
In the immediate aftermath of the fall, emergency responders worked swiftly under immense pressure to stabilize the injured fan. The dramatic scene unfolded against the backdrop of a bustling stadium, where every second felt monumental. Following essential treatments and critical care, hopes began to rise when news of the fan's awakening started to circulate. This milestone in the recovery journey has provided a sense of cautious optimism for all those who witnessed the event unfold.

Conspiracy Theories and Public Reaction
As details of the recovery emerged, the narrative quickly expanded beyond the factual. In the digital age, claims and counterclaims began to circulate, evolving into conspiracy theories that questioned the nature of the accident. These theories, though far removed from the stark realities of an unfortunate mishap, underscore how quickly public sentiment can pivot from concern to conjecture. The incident has ignited debates, revealing the fine line between genuine worry and the human penchant for crafting elaborate backstories around unexplained events.

Reflection on the Event and Its Impact
This incident transcends the immediate shock of the fall. It highlights the unpredictable interplay between fate and public perception, where a singular moment can give rise to diverse narratives, both heartfelt and speculative. The young fan's recovery now stands as a reminder of resilience amidst adversity, and it invites thoughtful reflection on how such events can resonate beyond the confines of a sports arena.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky have clashed over Kiev's prospects of joining the EU. Orban reminded the Ukrainian leader that Kiev has no chance of becoming part of the bloc without Budapest's approval.

The war of words started on Friday when Orban warned that Ukraine's EU membership “would bankrupt the Hungarian economy,” describing Kiev's potential accession as a “collective economic trap.”

The Hungarian leader also criticized the EU's goal of admitting Ukraine by 2030, a target recently reiterated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “We know when they want to bring them in. It's not some vague future; it's here, knocking at our door,” he said. “Forget the fairy tales about when and how. They want to do it now, as fast as possible.”

Zelensky responded by citing domestic polling in Hungary. “70% support Ukraine joining the EU. That means people in Hungary are with us,” Zelensky claimed.

However, the poll conducted by the opposition Tisza Party to which Zelensky referred showed only 58% support. An earlier poll by the Hungarian newspaper Nepszava showed even lower figures, with 47% in favor and 46% against.

Orban fired back at Zelensky on X, writing: “What the Hungarian people think is not decided by the president in Kiev or the bureaucrats in Brussels. There is no Ukrainian EU accession without Hungary. Every Hungarian will have their say on this. Whether you like it or not. That's how we do things here.”

All EU member states must unanimously approve any new country joining the bloc. Hungary has repeatedly cited widespread graft and minority rights issues as reasons to oppose Ukraine's fast-track membership, with Orban at one point describing the nation as “one of the most corrupt countries in the world.”

Ukraine, which has designated EU membership as a national priority, formally applied to join the bloc in February 2022, just days after the escalation of hostilities with Russia. Despite support from several EU members, the timeline for Ukraine's membership remains uncertain. Brussels has cited the need for Kiev to undertake significant legal, political, and economic reforms.

Exclusive: Proposals to introduce opt-out system of copyright rules no longer preferred option amid criticism from creative industries

Ministers are rethinking changes to copyright law before a vote in parliament next week, in a further concession to artists, the Guardian has learned.

A source close to Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, said proposals to introduce an opt-out system of copyright rules was no longer his preferred option but one of several being given consideration.

The proposed changes, which would allow AI companies to train their models using copyrighted work without permission unless the owner opts out, have been criticised by creators and publishers. High-profile artists including Paul McCartney and Tom Stoppard have backed a campaign against the changes.

Kyle said: “We're listening to the consultation and we are absolutely determined to get this right. We're not going back to square one. We are moving forward.”

“We can't pretend we can outlaw training in other countries who have their own copyright law, but we can build a system which works in the United Kingdom. Some elements of the consultation haven't even featured in the debate so far.”

“We will be working hard to come up with practicable solutions to the very complex issue of how we enable both the creative industries and UK AI companies to flourish. We will report to parliament on issues of transparency and licensing and try to find some common ground on which we can agree.”

Ministers have consulted on changing copyright law with the opt-out system as their “preferred option”, but government sources said Kyle was now looking more broadly at different proposals.

The government is particularly interested in encouraging licensing agreements between AI companies and creators as a way of ensuring creators are paid for their content.

But campaigners are concerned ministers could fall back on a free-for-all system instead of requiring AI companies to follow existing copyright law. Government officials said the law needed to change to attract AI investment to the UK and give creators control over how their content was used in the future.

Beeban Kidron, the cross-bench peer and prominent campaigner, said: “I am glad to hear that the government no longer sees an opt-out proposal as the preferred option but … for this change to be in any way meaningful it must include an unequivocal commitment from the government to protect copyright holders right now.”

Next week MPs will vote on the data bill, which has been used by critics including Lady Kidron as a vehicle to derail the proposed opt-out system. On Thursday, Kyle tabled amendments to the legislation intended to mollify critics by committing to an economic impact assessment of different potential changes, including the opt-out system and a licensing system.

Ministers are braced for a political row over opposition amendments to the data bill. Both the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives are considering a ban on under-16s from social media, a cause which has previously attracted support from Labour MPs.

The Tories are also drawing up an amendment seeking to record people's sex at birth as part of digital verification processes, sources said. A Labour source described it as a “naked attempt to reopen a running sore” over sex and gender after the supreme court ruled last month that the term “woman” was defined by biological sex.

The data bill faces further hurdles when it returns to the upper chamber. Kidron will move to reinstate her copyright amendments and Tim Clement-Jones, the Lib Dem tech spokesperson in the Lords, said it was possible the bill could be struck down entirely. He said concessions on transparency, or requiring AI firms to reveal what copyright-protected content has been used to create their products, would have to be made.

The government's offer to carry out an economic impact assessment of copyright changes within 12 months of the data bill passing has also led to concerns that this could push the process to the end of Labour's term in 2029.

“The world is moving exceptionally fast, and the government is moving very slow,” said Owen Meredith, the chief executive of the News Media Association, whose members include the Guardian. “Delay means change to the underlying copyright framework could not materialise until the very tail-end of this parliament.”

Kidron said a four-year delay to clarifying the AI copyright regime was a “completely inadequate timescale”. “The creative industries will be dead on their feet by then.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Sleep Whisperer is a new series of columns offering insights and advice about sleep health. It is not a substitute for seeking professional medical care.

A quick consult about sleep hygiene with “Dr. Google” yields an eclectic range of do's and don'ts dictating how people should get their zzz's. The advice ranges from drinking warm milk before bedtime to ensuring the bedroom temperature is 18.3°C. But can any of that really cure insomnia?

Sleep experts like myself are increasingly concerned. “Sleep hygiene has become a catch-all for everything, including advice for which there is no scientific evidence,” said Dr. Penny Corkum, a psychologist and professor at Dalhousie University.

The term sleep hygiene was popularized in the 1970s by psychologist Dr. Peter Hauri, who created a new sleep-disorders treatment that involved a set of rules such as eating a light snack before bedtime and keeping bedroom light levels low. Despite subsequent research, which showed such practices do not cure chronic insomnia, the concept of sleep hygiene stuck around in the popular consciousness.

Today, the consensus among sleep experts is that sleep hygiene on its own is insufficient to treat chronic insomnia in adults – defined as difficulty falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a period of at least three months. Although education about healthy sleep practices can be effective for children and teens, its effects in adults are so minimal that most research on insomnia uses “sleep-hygiene therapy” as a placebo comparator.

Nevertheless, many people with chronic insomnia get obsessed with sleep hygiene rules, clinging to them in an attempt to control their sleep. This often fuels the perception that slumber cannot happen unless all conditions are absolutely perfect (e.g. “I am running out of milk for my nightcap, for sure I won't be able to sleep”). “The sleep-hygiene mindset can get people to develop all-or-nothing approaches to sleep,” said Dr. Elizabeth Keys, a registered nurse and professor at the University of British Columbia.

Put simply, breaching sleep-hygiene rules is rarely the root cause of sleep disorders. Chronic insomnia does not develop because one fails to eat a light snack before bedtime or forgets to adjust the thermostat. Rather, it typically stems from how we react to a bad night (which everyone faces from time to time). If sleep difficulties take the centre stage of our worries, we gradually start to believe that our sleep system is broken. Some people then put in place strategies aimed at getting more sleep, such as going to bed earlier, staying in bed later and napping.

The problem is that these strategies can worsen sleep quality and expand the amount of time we spend frustrated and anxious about sleep while in bed. Our brain gradually associates the bedroom with these feelings and being awake; eventually, just entering the bedroom can trigger sleep anxiety, which makes it harder to doze off. Our fear of being unable to sleep becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that perpetuates insomnia over time and pushes us to “try harder” to sleep. These changes in sleep-related thoughts and behaviours are what converts the occasional bad night, a perfectly normal phenomenon, into chronic insomnia disorder.

So what does work? Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as the first-line treatment. It notably involves progressive personalized changes in sleep schedules to strengthen our sleep drive. This is combined with techniques to break down associations between the bedroom environment and the dread of a sleepless night it can provoke. Ultimately, CBT-I targets the specific factors leading to persisting sleep issues.

Although CBT-I has been shown to be effective in addressing the root causes of chronic insomnia, many people – including doctors – seem to focus on sleep hygiene instead.

“People can go for like 10 years without getting effective treatment for insomnia,” said Dr. Colleen Carney, a psychologist and professor at Toronto Metropolitan University. Rather than being offered CBT-I, Dr Carney said, people are often told to work on their sleep hygiene – such as avoiding sleeping in a noisy, brightly lit environment. “I do find it a little insulting. They're not sleeping under those conditions – their sleep hygiene is typically pristine.”

A recent study in the Canadian Journal of Medicine indicates that 98 per cent of primary care providers treating patients with insomnia review sleep hygiene with them first; only 58 per cent discuss CBT-I with their patients. Initiatives like Health Quality Ontario's new care standards for chronic insomnia, which stresses that CBT-I should come first, will hopefully better support health care practitioners and guide patients to seek appropriate care.

The bottom line: If you have been struggling to fall asleep or stay asleep for at least three nights per week over at least three months, you may have chronic insomnia – consider speaking to your health care provider and asking for a CBT-I referral. The Canadian Sleep Research Consortium has compiled a list of providers who offer this treatment.

If you do not have chronic insomnia and simply want to optimize your sleep, these healthy sleep practices (not to be confused with strict sleep hygiene rules) could help:

1. Avoid extreme sleep yo-yos

Keep a regular sleep schedule whenever possible. Regular bedtimes and wake-up times have been associated with better sleep, a stronger biological clock, and healthier mind and body.

2. Transition from active days to restful nights

Be active during the day to build a strong sleep drive and secure some time for winding down before bedtime. Doing pleasant calm activities will get you in a good headspace for sleep.

3. Don't sleep-shame …

When you have a bad night, don't dwell on it – let it go. People who move on after a poor night's rest do better than those who focus on it and try to lock in rigid sleep hygiene rules.

Dr. Rébecca Robillard, PhD, is a clinical neuropsychologist and Associate Professor at the School of Psychology at the University of Ottawa. She also leads clinical sleep research at The Royal. Dr. Robillard's main area of work focuses on interactions between mental health, the sleeping brain and the sleeping heart. She co-chairs the Canadian Sleep Research Consortium, a national hub of sleep scientists and clinicians.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett announced he was going to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway by the end of the year. He has tapped Berkshire Hathaway executive Greg Abel to replace him.

Warren Buffett announced Saturday during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting that he will step down as CEO of the $1.1 trillion (€973 billion) conglomerate at the end of the year.

The billionaire investor took over the reins of Berkshire Hathaway back in 1965, when it was a medium-sized textile manufacturer.

Buffett then acquired businesses across a range of industries and built the conglomerate into the economic powerhouse known to investors and market observers today.

In doing so, Buffett also became known for his investing acumen and, at 94 years old, is one of the world's most famous investors. He had previously said he did not intend to retire.

Buffett said he would convene the board of directors to have 62-year-old Greg Abel, currently the vice chairman for non-insurance operations at Berkshire Hathaway, take over as CEO of the conglomerate.

""The time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,"" Buffett said.

""I would still hang around and could conceivably be useful in a few cases, but the final word would be what Greg said in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be,"" he added.       

Buffett said that he had not given any prior notice to other board members, catching people by surprise as he made the announcement at the end of the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.

""I just want to say I couldn't be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,"" Abel said.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said an interim ceasefire with Russia was possible any moment, ""even starting today,"" if Moscow agreed to the US proposal. Ukraine's president rejected a Russian truce for three days from May 8 to 10.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a ceasefire with Russia was possible the moment Kremlin agreed to it.

Zelenskyy's comments come hours after he rejected the Russian president's declaration of a three-day truce over May 8-10, denouncing it as a ""theatrical show"" that hardly allows time to hold talks to end the war.

Zelenskyy also said earlier during those comments that Ukraine ""cannot bear responsibility for what happens"" to foreign leaders attending the World War II commemoration ceremony in Moscow on May 9.

Ukrainian officials said Russia had launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight, sparking fires at residential buildings in parts of the city.

Below, you can read a roundup of developments from Russia's war in Ukraine on Sunday, May 4.

Czech President Petr Pavel backed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's comments that called for increased pressure on Moscow to have it agree to an interim 30-day ceasefire.

""If someone has all the cards in their hand to end the war then it is President Putin, who can do it with a single decision,"" Pavel told reporters.

""But so far the will has not appeared.""

The Czech government has been a firm backer of Kyiv's efforts to defend itself against Russian forces, and has led an initiative to supply Ukraine with large-calibre ammunition.

Zelenskyy, who is accompanied on the trip by first lady Olena Zelenska, will meet Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala on Monday, with the Czech ammunition drive among the topics on the agenda.

The Ukrainian leader said on X on Saturday he was preparing for upcoming foreign policy meetings with a focus on helping push Russia toward a ceasefire.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a joint news conference with Czech President Petr Pavel that a ceasefire with Moscow would be possible ""at any moment.""

""We believe that without increased pressure, Russia will not take real practical steps to end the war. Today marks the 54th day that Russia has ignored even the American proposal to completely cease fire,"" Zelenskyy told reporters.

""We believe that a ceasefire is possible at any moment, even starting today, and should last at least 30 days to give diplomacy a real chance.""

Ukraine accepted a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States in March, following peace talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia.

Russia has yet to accept the offer, and the country's leader, Vladimir Putin, declared a three-day ceasefire over May 8-10 to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet Union and its allies over Nazi Germany in World War II.

Zelenskyy rejected the offer, denouncing it as a ""theatrical show"" since three days offered no time for talks to end the more than three-year-old war that began with Russia invading Ukraine in February 2022.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Prague on Sunday at the start of a two-day visit to the Czech Republic, a key Central European ally in Kyiv's battle against the ongoing Russian invasion.

Zelenskyy, accompanied by his wife, Olena, was met at the airport by Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky, who described him on social media as ""the leader of the free world.""

Zelenskyy, who was last received in Prague in 2023, is expected to meet with President Petr Pavel, a former NATO general, on Sunday before a meeting with Prime Minister Petr Fiala and other senior Czech politicians on Monday.

Likely to feature on the agenda is a Czech-led European initiative to jointly procure millions of artillery shells from stocks around the world and deliver them to Ukraine. According to Prague, 400,000 rounds were already provided in 2025.

The Czech Republic has also provided military support to Kyiv in the form of tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters, and welcomed more than half a million Ukrainian refugees.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday played down the prospect of deploying nuclear weapons in Ukraine and said he hoped the necessity would not arise.

""There has been no need to use those weapons,"" he said in fragmented comments broadcast as part of a preview of an interview on state television marking his 25 years in power. ""And I hope they will not be required,"" he added.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin and his generals and staff have made occasional references to Russia's nuclear arsenal, often in response to increased Western aid to Ukraine, such as the provision of long-range missiles which Kyiv has used to strike targets deep within Russia itself.

Three years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin believes the brutal war will not damage relations with his neighbor, predicting reconciliation with Ukraine one day.

""It seems to me that this is inevitable despite the tragedy we are currently experiencing,"" he said in excerpts from an upcoming interview by Russian state television marking the 25th anniversary of his first presidency.

Putin was referring to the biggest European conflict since World War II, launched by Moscow as a ""special military operation"" in February 2022. ""It's a matter of time,"" he added.

Putin said he believed Russia is still capable of attaining its war goals.

""We have enough strength and means to bring what was started in 2022 to a logical conclusion with the outcome Russia requires,"" he claimed.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Russia from May 7-10 to attend the celebrations of the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Kremlin said on Sunday.

Xi will discuss with Russian President Vladimir Putin the development of the two countries' strategic partnership, as well as signing a number of ""bilateral documents,"" the Kremlin said In a statement on Telegram.

Ukraine said Russia had launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight, causing damage to several buildings in the city.

Falling debris from destroyed drones sparked fires at residential buildings in Kyiv's Obolonskyi and Sviatoshynskyi districts, Timur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said on social media.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app that medics were called in to provide assistance in the Sviatoshynskyi district, west of the city center.

The full scale of the damage from the attack was not immediately clear.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow about the attack.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country cannot guarantee the safety of leaders and officials from other countries taking part in the World War II commemoration ceremony in Moscow on May 9.

Leaders of around 20 countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, have accepted invitations to join the May 9 celebration, according to the Kremlin.

""We cannot bear responsibility for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Zelenskyy told the Interfax-Ukraine news agency.

""They are ensuring your safety,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that Russia ""may take various steps on its part, such as arson, explosions, and so on and then blame us.""

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, in a post on Telegram, slammed Zelenskyy's remarks.

""He is threatening the physical safety of veterans who will come to parades and celebrations on the holy day,"" she said, adding: ""His statement... is, of course, a direct threat.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has dismissed a three-day truce declared by Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a ""theatrical performance.""

The ceasefire would be from May 8-10, to coincide with the annual Victory Parade on Moscow's Red Square to mark the end of World War II, which is celebrated in Russia on May 9.

""This is more of a theatrical performance on his part. Because in two or three days, it is impossible to develop a plan for the next steps to end the war,"" Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader said Kyiv, however, was ready for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.

Zelenskyy added that Ukraine would not be ""playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin's exit from isolation on May 9.""

WNBA star Sophie Cunningham spoke to Fox News Digital about her offseason trade to the Indiana Fever and her hopes for the upcoming season.  

The heat was turned up a notch as the Indiana Fever and the Washington Mystics squared off in the first preseason game of the year on Saturday.

At one point, Cunningham went up for a defensive rebound over Mystics rookie Kiki Iriafen. The veteran guard was tossed to the ground and got into the face of the former USC standout. Fever guard Lexie Hull had to step in between the two players.

Mystics guard Morgan Jones put her arm around Iriafen as the 6-foot-3 turned her back away from Cunningham and smiled. Iriafen was hit with a Flagrant 1 foul.

It wasn't the only incident during the game.

Cunningham was also getting held by Brittney Sykes as she tried to make herself available for a DeWanna Bonner pass. Sykes pushed Cunningham to the ground and was met with Bonner's intensity.

""Sophie's a dawg,"" Fever head coach Stephanie White said, via Indy Star. ""She's a competitor. She's versatile. She allows us to do different things. She plays with such toughness. She's huge, and she's going to be for us all season long.

""What she brings, from an energy standpoint, she raises the level of play of everybody around her as soon as she steps foot on the floor, hell, even on the sideline. I mean, her communication, everything, she's definitely an X factor.""

Indiana won the game 79-74 in overtime.

The Mystics made have had one of the worst records in the WNBA last season but made clear in the preseason that they weren't going to be pushed around by any team.

Emmanuel Acho, LeSean McCoy and James Jones discuss whether the Pittsburgh Steelers should draft a QB in the first round with Aaron Rodgers' NFL future unknown. 

Aaron Rodgers was spotted at the Kentucky Derby on Saturday evening as the NFL world awaited his decision on whether he will sign with a team for the 2025 season or retire.

The NBC broadcast spotted Rodgers in the stands at Churchill Downs. The Louisville Courier-Journal also spotted Rodgers at the Barnstable Brown Derby Eve Gala with former Green Bay Packers players Davante Adams, Randall Cobb, Jimmy Graham, A.J. Hawk, Corey Linsley and Daivd Bakhtiari.

NBC broadcaster Mike Tirico was asked on ""Up & Adams"" on Friday whether he believes he has had his last production meeting with Rodgers.

""I hope not,"" he said. ""I think his comments about his personal life and those other things, kind of encroaching on the space of full dedication to football or an indication that it might be the end. In my soul, I want to see Aaron Rodgers in Pittsburgh, because I always think [Mike Tomlin's] teams have a chance to win almost every game. 

""And, to be candid, since [Ben Roethlisberger] has not been there, that the one play a game that the quarterback makes, that's an unscripted play, that wasn't covered Monday through Saturday, he needs somebody to make that play, and Aaron showed, at the end of last year, he can still make that play.

Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital that he found gun shops in the U.S. to be ""fascinating.""

A Houthi missile struck Israeli soil near Tel Aviv's largest airport on Sunday, causing multiple international airlines to cancel flights to Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation for the attack Sunday and will participate in several defense meetings throughout the day. The missile reportedly evaded both Israeli and U.S. missile defenses, according to Israeli media.

""Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold,"" said Defense Minister Israel Katz.

Lufthansa, Swiss, and Air Europa were among the airlines to cancel flights to Israel, though they expect to resume service on Monday.

At least 8 people were injured in the missile strike, though none of the injuries were life-threatening. Israel has not yet confirmed any specific military retaliation.

Over the weekend, the Israeli Air Force says it struck over 100 terror targets in the Gaza Strip, including terrorist cells, tunnels, underground infrastructure sites, and other military structures.

IDF troops operating in southern Gaza also located weapons caches in the area, dismantled dozens of terrorist infrastructure sites, and eliminated a number of terrorists.

The missile strike comes days after Israel was forced to cancel its independence day celebrations due to wildfires raging throughout the country.

Massive wildfires broke out near Jerusalem on Wednesday, forcing road closures and mass evacuations that paralyzed the country. Israel traditionally celebrates its independence with a torch-lighting ceremony. It instead broadcast footage of the rehearsal ceremony.

Jerusalem District Fire Department Commander Shmulik Friedman told the press on Wednesday that the wildfires may be ""the largest fire ever in the country"" and warned that high winds could exacerbate the blaze later in the day. He also warned that Israel was ""far from control"" of the fires.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The ‘SNL' Sketch That Captured Millennial Anxiety","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/05/saturday-night-live-forever-31-millennial-fashion-quinta-brunson/682691/","Sun, 04 May 2025 16:44:36 GMT","

The guest host Quinta Brunson was the perfect fit to introduce “Forever 31.”

The best Saturday Night Live parody commercials have a hint of truth to them, even at their most absurd. But “Forever 31”—the fake ad that aired during this weekend's episode hosted by the Abbott Elementary creator and star, Quinta Brunson—felt even more realistic than usual. It was the type of sketch that almost seemed designed to be shared on Instagram by people in their early 30s with the caption “This is so me.”

In the sketch, Brunson and SNL's female cast members hawked products for a brand called Forever 31, a play on the infamous mall store Forever 21. But instead of the cute going-out tops and flimsy miniskirts you could find at the latter, Forever 31 catered its clothing to exhausted women in their 30s. “Introducing Forever 31, for the woman who's stylish but tired,” the voiceover explained as Chloe Fineman danced in an oversize sweater and loose pants. “Fun, but not like ‘fun' fun.”

The clothes at Forever 31 were baggy yet chic basics in “every color of the bummer rainbow,” including gray and beige. Brunson noted there was also navy blue “if you're feeling skanky.” The collection featured a lot of big suits that recalled the former Talking Heads frontman David Byrne's famously oversize garb in the concert documentary Stop Making Sense; there were also looks that, as Heidi Gardner said, would “make “Diane Keaton look like a prostitute.”

The aesthetic might have been familiar to those who've browsed the offerings of labels like Cos and, at a greater price point, the Row. But the ad also captured the anxiety that comes with leaving your 20s and thinking about what's ahead—whether that means the decision to freeze your eggs, the future of your relationship, or your parents getting older. Millennials, including several of SNL's current cast members, are the ones now experiencing that specific unease.

Crucially, SNL understood that these were not the fashions of women who had stopped trying. The clothes were all actually quite stylish, nicely tailored staples for women who have other things on their mind. The look was a marked difference from, say, the “Mom Jeans” parody from 2003, in which the Gen Xers Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hawked high-waisted pants “for even the least active of moms.” By comparison, “Forever 31” wasn't making fun of the clothing or the women wearing them; the slouchy designs might have been more appealing to the parody's imagined consumer than what the young and “sexy” Gen Z counterparts have on in the sketch: booty shorts and high heels that evoke the mid-2000s. Many Millennial women would likely recognize them from their own youth—and now cringe at the throwback.

Read: Forever 21's brief, hideous life

Instead, the humor came from the ad's relatability. Millennial women have now lived through multiple culture-shocking events: economic collapses, dramatically changing attitudes toward body positivity, the #MeToo movement. Plenty of preoccupations keep them from overanalyzing what they are going to wear every day; although they don't want to look bad, many women are uninterested in dressing for trendiness over comfort. I'm part of the demographic whose aesthetic the ad is affectionately skewering. I definitely have similar items in my closet—and can attest to their logic. Once I find something I like, I buy it multiple times. I still enjoy a pattern now and then, but I know black is always reliable.

There was also something fitting about having Brunson as the guest star featured in the ad. Brunson proved herself remarkably versatile throughout the episode, playing dissimilar roles such as a horny grandmother and a woman who challenged a gorilla to a fight. But she is best known for her role as the intensely chipper Janine Teagues on Abbott Elementary. Though Janine has a more colorful, school-teacher-appropriate wardrobe, she also embodies the phase of life that “Forever 31” was addressing: She's confident in her personal style but less confident in her future. The character is a quintessentially Millennial overachiever, just like the women the fake commercial satirized. Ultimately, perhaps the only true issue with “Forever 31” was that it wasn't advertising a real store. I could go for a Carmen San Diego–esque trench coat.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Letitia James is hunting for insider trading in Trump's inner circle. Ex-prosecutors call her tariff inquiry unprecedented.","https://www.businessinsider.com/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-trump-tariffs-insider-trading-investigation-2025-5","Sun, 04 May 2025 09:22:00 GMT","

New York's Letitia James is easily the most aggressive state attorney general in the country when it comes to suing President Donald Trump.

She's on the front lines of 15 legal actions brought by coalitions of Democratic AGs, all seeking to block executive orders and DOGE cuts, Her $454 million fraud verdict against Trump and his real estate company remains on appeal in Manhattan.

But James' most daring excursion into Trumpworld may be one she has yet to formally announce.

It's an ongoing inquiry into potential insider trading by the president's inner circle, centered on last month's markets-roiling tariff policies.

James' so-called inquiry — the formal name for a kind of probe that falls short of a full-blown investigation — has rounded its second month, an AG spokesman confirmed to Business Insider, declining to divulge details beyond saying the office is ""looking at"" possible insider trading.

What would an inquiry involve? And, more importantly, what are its odds?

Business Insider asked a half-dozen legal experts, including three former high-level financial-fraud prosecutors from the New York AG's office.

Opinions range wildly.

Some pointed to the perennial concerns over insider trading by members of Congress. They called James' inquiry a proper, even necessary, exercise of the power vested in an attorney general whose Manhattan office sits three blocks north of the Stock Exchange.

Others called her inquiry a politically motivated boondoggle that's doomed to fail. ""This is a story of politics, not a story of law,"" said Richard Epstein, a law professor at New York University.

But there was unanimity on two points. Proving insider trading is notoriously difficult. And whatever is happening behind the scenes is unprecedented.

""There's been nothing like this,"" said Manhattan attorney Armen Morian, a former financial crimes prosecutor for the New York AG's office who helped defend Trump during James' fraud case.

The inquiry is empowered by New York's Martin Act, a 104-year-old statute that gives state attorneys general extraordinary powers to police Wall Street.

Legal experts call the Martin Act the most powerful state securities-fraud law in the country. It allows the AG to issue subpoenas, grill suspects under oath, and file civil lawsuits or criminal charges.

In a 2018 essay, Epstein called the Martin Act ""an 800-pound gorilla,"" a term he said he still stands by.

It prosecutes securities and real estate frauds and is used only rarely for insider trading, which is the illegal profiting off of stock tips not available to the public.

Legal experts and three veterans of the AG's office who have brought prosecutions under the Martin Act say they've never heard of it being used to investigate insider tips involving government policy, in this case, Trump's on-and-off tariffs.

The novelty of James' inquiry does not, in itself, doom her effort, said a former financial crimes prosecutor who asked not to be named, citing work constraints against speaking to the press.

""There is a body of Martin Act insider trading law — just not on these exact facts — that has been developed over decades,"" the former prosecutor said. ""And remember, the facts of every case are always novel.""

An ""inquiry"" is what the New York AG's office calls the earliest stage of a probe — before subpoenas go out, explained former Executive Attorney General Manisha M. Sheth. Now a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Sheth oversaw the AG's Division of Economic Justice.

Securities inquiries can be sparked by whistleblower tips or by allegations that surface publicly in the press or a lawsuit, she told BI.

They are handled by the state investor protection bureau, one of the six divisions Sheth once supervised, she said. There, prosecutors working with the AGs' research analysts and data scientists would begin by reviewing raw trading data, she said. They'll look for suspicious patterns.

Were there spikes in trading, for instance, on April 9, in the hours before Trump posted on Truth Social, ""THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!"" triggering a market upswing?

At some point, the bureau would send out a flutter of ""inquiry letters,"" authorized by the bureau's chief or deputy chief and signed by the assistant attorney general handling the matter, Sheth said.

""Such letters can ask for documents, data, or information,"" she said. ""Sometimes the recipient of an inquiry letter may volunteer to meet with the office to provide the requested information.""

Cooperating at this early stage is completely voluntary. If a case advances to the point that subpoenas are issued, an inquiry will have graduated to an investigation, Sheth said.

""I do think it's going to start with using trading data to show that no reasonable person would have engaged in these trades without that non-public information,"" said Anthony Capozzolo, a former federal and state prosecutor.

""You're going to want to, at the least, build an initial case that shows it's very likely that the only motivating factor for these trades was this allegedly inside information.""

Compiling trading data will be tougher these days, predicted Capozzolo, a partner at Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss in Manhattan and a former federal and state-level prosecutor.

Pre-Trump, the AG would routinely and easily ask the Securities and Exchange Commission for trading data that's not already publicly available.

""Now, the SEC is controlled by the Trump administration, and he could potentially instruct the SEC not to cooperate,"" leading to a subpoena battle, Capozzolo predicted.

Identifying suspicious-seeming trading patterns is only the beginning, legal experts said.

Say, solely as a hypothetical, that a Trump insider reaped a small fortune by buying the dip in Apple stock right before Trump announced the tariff carve-out for electronics from China that sent the stock soaring.

That's not enough to prove insider trading, legal experts said. For that, James would need witnesses willing to testify that specific investments were prompted by improper insider tips.

""They try to force people to tell them who was present in rooms,"" Capozzolo said of prosecutors. ""But the difficulty is a lot of these things may have happened in the presence of very upper-level Trump and MAGA acolytes.""

And anyone in Trump's circle would certainly fight an inquiry letter or subpoena — and do so loudly.

""You'll see an immediate challenge,"" said Morian, who helped prosecute AIG CEO Hank Greenberg in the longest Martin Act case in the AG's history.

""It'll be lock and load. The minute any subpoena goes out, I would immediately intervene if I were in the Justice Department, and say 'Nope. Can't do it. Sorry.'""

Suing, charging, or subpoenaing Trump is a non-starter, given executive privilege and presidential immunity, which bars prosecution for official acts, Morian said. (He predicts presidential immunity would extend to civil cases as well someday, ""If that ever gets to the Supreme Court."")

State AG subpoenas issued to members of the executive branch — cabinet members and the like — could also be challenged on executive privilege grounds. And investigating the stock trades of members of Congress would result in challenges as well, Morian predicted.

""If you overreach too far, you could easily see a private litigant taking this up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court limiting the jurisdiction of state attorneys general in ways we've never seen before,"" he said.

James is being probed by the DOJ for alleged mortgage fraud, an allegation she has called baseless and which her attorney, Abbe Lowell, has called ""improper political retribution,"" according to CBS.

Should her insider-trading inquiry advance, James, a Democrat who campaigned for AG on a promise of investigating Trump, would herself would face accusations of political retribution and bias.

Over the years, Trump has decried James' investigations into his finances and business as baseless, ""racist,"" and part of a ""political witch hunt."" A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on James' tariff-trade inquiry on Friday.

Then there is the inherent difficulty of proving insider trading — of teasing out any illegality from the chaos of sudden, trillion-dollar market swings.

""There's a huge amount of market turmoil whenever there's a major tariff initiative,"" said Epstein.

How can anyone call it insider trading if thousands of investors are making similar trades for benign reasons, based on hunches, past experience, or dumb luck, he asked.

""When the markets are this volatile, people make and lose money second to second, for any number of reasons,"" agreed Morian.

""There are so many contingent variables,"" he added. ""How do you discern the signal from the noise, to prove your case?""

 Bitcoin's institutional adoption reshapes its development landscape, prioritizing security and compliance over grassroots innovation. Bitcoin's decentralized roots, however, face unprecedented challenges. 

Opinion by: Markus Bopp, CEO of TAP Protocol

Not long ago, the idea of Bitcoin as a government-backed reserve asset seemed like a stretch. The US Federal Reserve's move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value.

This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world's most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin (BTC) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term. 

If Bitcoin is to be treated like gold, it must be secured like gold. Very soon, we will see governments and institutions seek to secure Bitcoin in what will no doubt look like a digital Fort Knox. With more institutional and instrumental influence over the most valuable digital asset in the world, verifiable storage, hardened security protocols and structures built on resilience will become paramount. 

This shift could raise the stakes for developers. As institutional adoption rises, so does the demand for specialized developers capable of delivering institutional-grade security and long-term stability. 

What does this demand mean for the developer community that made Bitcoin what it is today? How will this affect the grassroots development built on Bitcoin's core principles of full decentralization and transparency? Will a more institutional Bitcoin leave room for innovation, or is this the end of Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi)?

Bitcoin, the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, was designed to operate outside of traditional systems. Yet the moment governments and traditional institutions stopped keeping their distance, the future of Bitcoin has begun to pivot. What was once met with skepticism now draws a new kind of curiosity. 

The same players who once warned against digital assets are now staking their claims. The International Monetary Fund's latest Balance of Payments Manual now classifies digital assets like Bitcoin as part of the international financial system, placing it firmly alongside traditional reserves and gold. 

As of January 2025, governments worldwide hold an estimated total of 471,000 BTC, worth over $16.3 billion. Strategy continued to lead and cross its Bitcoin holdings at a corporate level, doubling down on the cryptocurrency as a long-term strategic play. 

Recent: Bitcoin DeFi surge may boost BTC demand and adoption — Binance

This kind of institutional recognition validates Bitcoin's core principle but also throws it into flux. Holding it in sovereign reserves, governments are simultaneously affirming its legitimacy while also conforming it to the very system it was meant to disrupt. 

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, fresh talent is still entering the space. There's no guarantee all will stay. In 2024, the total number of developers in the industry declined by 7% year-on-year. Yet seasoned and established developers saw a 27% increase in activity, contributing to a record share of the industry's output. 

While opportunities for small-scale contributors may be fading, the ecosystem supports a core of experienced builders, a signal that the space is maturing. The influx of institutional investors to crypto like Bitcoin is likely to drive up Bitcoin's price, a consequence that might see them price out smaller developers and create an even higher barrier to entry. 

As the stakes around Bitcoin continue to rise, the demand is no longer just for innovation. It'll be for security, compliance and infrastructure that can meet enterprise-grade “Fort Knox” level expectations. 

We'll see a new wave of specialized developers stepping up to build intelligent, compliant and institutional-grade decentralized applications. From secure custody solutions to regulated exchanges and seamless bridges, institutional and government demands will shape the next phase of Bitcoin development.

As Bitcoin integrates more deeply into institutional finance, the development focus is maturing from experimentation to durability, compliance and security. Developers will likely focus on building not directly on Bitcoin but instead with Bitcoin. Bitcoin DeFi has so far been celebrated as a way to unlock open finance with the world's most popular cryptocurrency, and it still might. Still, its future will depend on incoming compliance and regulatory frameworks. 

If governments go down the path of shoehorning the asset into traditional financial models, we'll find developers seeking ways to bridge Bitcoin's liquidity and value to more operable, friendlier chains. If governments are open to preserving Bitcoin's core offering as a new, borderless and decentralized currency, that will signal the community to continue innovation. 

The question for the community then isn't whether Bitcoin can support innovation under institutional oversight. It's whether Bitcoin can thrive in a world that could now seek to contain it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","BTC News Today: Bitcoin Traders' Favorite Lottery Ticket for the First Half of the Year — The $300K BTC Call","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/04/bitcoin-traders-favorite-lottery-ticket-for-the-first-half-of-the-year-the-usd300k-btc-call","Sun, 04 May 2025 18:42:55 GMT","

In the crypto market, bold predictions aren't just talk - they're backed by real dollars, often through option plays that resemble lottery tickets offering outsized upside for relatively small costs.

The stand-out as of writing is the Deribit-listed $300,000 strike bitcoin call option expiring on June 26. Theoretically, this call is a bet that BTC's spot price will triple to over $300,000 by the end of the first half of the year.

Over 5,000 contracts were active in the June $300K call at press time, with a notional open interest of $484 million. That makes it the second-most popular option bet in the crucial June expiry, trailing only the $110K call.

Deribit is the world's leading crypto options exchange, accounting for over 75% of the global options activity. On Deribit, one options contract represents 1 BTC. Quarterly expiries, such as the one due on June 26, drive heightened market activity and volatility, with traders using these deadlines to hedge positions, lock in gains, or speculate on the next price moves.

""Perhaps, people like buying lottery tickets. As evidenced by the call skew, there are always folks that want the hyperinflation hedge,"" Spencer Hallarn, a derivatives trader at crypto market maker GSR, said, explaining the high open interest in the so-called out-of-the-money (OTM) call at the $300K strike.

Deep OTM calls, also called wings, require a large move in the underlying asset's price to become profitable and, hence, are significantly cheaper compared to those closer to or below the asset's going market rate. However, the payoff is huge if the market rallies, which makes them similar to buying lottery tickets with slim odds but potential for a big payout.

Deribit's BTC options market has experienced similar flows during previous bull cycles, but those bets rarely gained enough popularity to rank as the second-most preferred play in quarterly expiries.

The chart shows that the June 26 expiry is the largest among all settlements due this year, and the $300K call has the second-highest open interest buildup in the June expiry options. 

Explaining the chunky notional open interest in the $300K call, GSR's Trader Simranjeet Singh said, ""I suspect this is mostly an accumulation of relatively cheap wings betting on broader U.S. reg narrative being pro-crypto and the 'wingy possibility' (no pun intended) of a BTC strategic reserve that was punted around at the start of the administration.""

On Friday, Senator Cynthia Lummis said in a speech that she's ""particularly pleased with President Trump's support of her BITCOIN Act.

""The BITCOIN Act is the only solution to our nation's $36T debt. I'm grateful for a forward-thinking president who not only recognizes this, but acts on it,"" Lummis said on X.

According to Amberdata's Director of Derivatives, notable selling in the $300K call expiring on June 26 occurred in April as part of the covered call strategy, which traders use to generate additional yield on top of their spot market holdings.

""My thought is that the selling volume on April 23 came from traders generating income against a long position,"" Magadini told CoinDesk. ""Each option sold for about $60 at 100% implied volatility.""

Selling higher strike OTM call options and collecting premium while holding a long position in the spot market is a popular yield-generating strategy in both crypto and traditional markets.

Ethereum, the cryptocurrency with the second-largest market capitalization, is about to enter a state of unnerving quiet. The chart is starting to show the inertia caused by the broader price action even though the asset is still above important short-term moving averages. ETH is currently trading at about $1,825, and it is having difficulty convincingly breaking through local resistance levels.

Ethereum's volume profile is the most obvious cause for concern. Over the past few weeks, daily trading volume has drastically decreased, and it is currently close to historic lows. It appears from this volume collapse that market players are unsure of themselves and that neither bulls nor bears are in charge. A market that is waiting for a catalyst and has run out of momentum is indicated by this classic signal.

Volatility has also collapsed. There are no indications of overbought or oversold conditions and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently in neutral territory just below 60. That is consistent with the sideways price movement that ETH has shown since the middle of April. ETH is having difficulty sustaining any sort of long-term breakout momentum with the 50 EMA hovering just above the current price levels.

Ethereum in Big Trouble If It Doesn't Scale 100X, Researcher Warns

ByAlex Dovbnya





Nevertheless, this quiet could be misleading. Just below a crucial psychological level of $1,900 to $2,000, Ethereum is consolidating. Consolidation periods like these frequently precede abrupt directional movements. The absence of buying volume severely undermines the bullish case, but the current setup leaves open the possibility of an abrupt reversal.

Ethereum's upside potential is limited unless there are macroeconomic catalysts or a spike in on-chain activity. In the meantime, a decline below the 50 EMA (~$1,765) would probably trigger a new round of selling, pushing ETH back toward $1,600. The next significant spike could determine the course of the subsequent leg, so investors should closely monitor volume.

In a significant update to the protocol's long-term roadmap, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has called for the simplification of ETH's base protocol to make the network more efficient and resilient.

In a May 3rd blog post titled “Simplifying the L1,” Buterin shared his perspective on the need to simplify the Ethereum network, stating that simplicity is an important—but easy to undervalue—aspect of scalability and resilience. The crypto founder went on to applaud how beautifully simple the Bitcoin blockchain is.

Buterin said:

Even a smart high school student is capable of fully wrapping their head around and understanding the Bitcoin protocol. A programmer is capable of writing a client as a hobby project.



According to Buterin, protocol simplicity offers a variety of benefits that are crucial to ensuring that blockchain networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, remain a credibly neutral and globally trusted base layer. Meanwhile, it also reduces infrastructure costs, long-term maintenance expenses, and risks of bugs and malicious attacks.

In the blog post, Buterin also described how the Ethereum network can become close to as simple as Bitcoin in five years. According to the co-founder, one of the three ways of achieving this simplicity is through a more optimal consensus layer, with most notably a 3-slot finality redesign.

Furthermore, Buterin mentioned the simplification of the execution layer, complaining about how the complexity of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has unnecessarily increased. To fix this, the crypto co-founder proposed replacing the EVM with a new minimal virtual machine (like RISC-V).

The co-founder noted:

The biggest challenge with meaningfully simplifying (or even improving without complexifying) any part of the EVM is how to balance accomplishing the desired goals with preserving backwards compatibility for existing applications.

Finally, Buterin outlined that the third and “most easily underrated” way of enhancing protocol simplicity is to share one standard across different parts of the protocol. “There is typically very little or no benefit to using different protocols to do the same thing in different places,” the Ethereum co-founder said. 

Buterin concluded that simplicity is extremely similar to decentralization, which are both requisite in achieving resilience in blockchains. 

While Buterin will be looking to make adjustments to the Ethereum network, ETH investors will hope that these enhancements will translate to the value of the Ether token. ETH's performance has been quite underwhelming so far in 2025, registering four red months to start the year.

As of this writing, the price of Ether stands around $1,817, reflecting a 1.6% decline in the past 24 hours. It is worth mentioning that the Ethereum price has enjoyed some bullish momentum in the past two weeks, with its value increasing by nearly 15% in that period.

The Maldives, an archipelagic state in South Asia, is in the process of establishing a $8.8 billion blockchain hub that could potentially help it diversify away from tourism, according to a Sunday report by the Financial Times. 

The ambitious project will be financed with the help of MBS Global Investments, a $14 billion family office based in the United Arab Emirates. A joint venture agreement between the Dubai family office and the Maldives was signed earlier today. 

The blockchain initiative is expected to be a boon for the Maldives, fixing its overdependence on tourism. It potentially results in a 200% increase in the country's GDP within just four years, creating thousands of jobs. 

The Maldives' economy primarily relies on tourism, which accounts for roughly 30% of its entire GDP. The Maldives are famous for their luxurious resorts that attract tourists from around the globe.

The archipelagic state also has a prominent fishing industry, which is responsible for about 10% of the country's GDP. The Maldives is primarily known for yellowfin tuna and skipjack, with the EU, Japan, and Thailand being its key markets. 

However, the country is facing significant economic challenges, with its public debt surpassing its GDP, which currently stands at $7 billion. Moreover, it is facing fiscal deficits due to excessive spending.  

The recently announced blockchain pivot could potentially help it alleviate the strain. Finance Minister Moosa Zameer told the Financial Times that the $9 billion hub could be a way out of the current difficulties. Notably, the ambitious project could potentially help it avoid a possible default.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Elden Ring Creator Hidetaka Miyazaki Says This Game ""Awoke Me To The Possibilities Of The Medium,"" & It's A Hidden Gem Only Available On PS Plus","https://screenrant.com/elden-ring-creator-favorite-game-ico-ps-plus-factoid/","Sun, 04 May 2025 17:30:00 GMT","

In a ten-year-old interview with the Guardian, Elden Ring director and creator Hidetaka Miyazaki credited the early-2000s PlayStation 2 game Ico as having an incredible impact on his life, ultimately swaying him to pursue a career in video game development. Ico was a revolutionary concept that pushed the boundaries of what was possible with the available technology at the time. It's also the spiritual predecessor to The Guardian & Shadow of the Colossus, all of which are the brainchildren of legendary director Fumito Ueda of GenDesign studios.

If you're old enough to have played Ico back in 2001, you likely haven't forgotten its beautifully somber tone and minimalist approach to puzzle-platforming that felt completely authentic and original. If you never had the chance to play Ico, however, you're in luck — the game is actually available to stream on PS Plus Premium right now. Ico helped Miyazaki see what video games could be, and the best way to understand why it had such a profound impact on him is to go play Ico yourself.

In a decade-old interview with The Guardian, FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki claimed that Ico was one of the games that made him want to create video games of his own, largely due to Ico's innovative gameplay and simple yet powerful storytelling. These features were a core motivator behind Miyazaki's development of Dark Souls, ultimately spawning the entire Soulsborne genre that encompasses games like Bloodborne and Elden Ring, among others.

“That game awoke me to the possibilities of the medium. I wanted to make one myself.” - Hidetaka Miyazaki

In a 20th anniversary celebration of Ico by the Japanese publication Famitsu, Miyazaki elaborated on his affection for the game. As shared in translation by VGC, Miyazaki describes Ico as ""a beautiful, untold experience and story that I had never imagined [...] I was quietly moved and silent.""

After seeing the leaked image of the final Nightfarers in Elden Ring Nightreign, I'm convinced the Executor will be a Samurai archetype.

After reading through these old interviews, I felt an urge to replay Ico, and it turns out that it's available to stream on PS Plus with a Premium subscription. Despite its crude early-PlayStation graphics, Ico is still a mesmerizing and enjoyable experience. Aside from being a total nostalgia trip, I started paying more attention to the details of Ico that reminded me of Miyazaki's work.

The influence is glaringly obvious as soon as you get started. The world of Ico is a somber and mysterious one, and its gameplay feels like an early version of what the Soulsborne genre would eventually become. If you want to know what sparked Miyazaki's imagination, you can get a taste of that in the very early parts of Ico, from the very moment you take the princess's hand and venture into the castle depths.

Ico's premise is a simple yet incredibly successful one that hinges on an age-old story trope: a hero saves the princess from a castle. In Ico, a young horned boy named Ico helps free a princess named Yorda from her evil mother, the Queen, who plans to use Yorda to become immortal. What ensues is a 3D puzzle-platforming adventure through a mystical and labyrinthine castle full of all sorts of twists, turns, ominous ghost enemies, and even obnoxious flying enemies like those found throughout the Soulsborne universe.

You'll be able to unlock new cosmetics for each character in Elden Ring Nightreign, including some iconic outfits from previous FromSoftare games.

Gameplay in Ico is very reminiscent of what you experience in Dark Souls and its ilk, particularly when it comes to some of the platformer elements, like traversing narrow high-beams in the rafters, extra-long ladders between levels, and especially how the player's actions influence the environment and open up shortcuts or new pathways. There's even an epic final boss battle that likely inspired some of the most beloved boss fights from Miyazaki's work.

Ico's influence likely extends to many modern juggernauts in the industry.

Ico's influence can be seen in a ton of modern games outside the Soulsborne genre as well, and the game has supposedly influenced the likes of Neil Druckmann, director of The Last of Us Part 1 & 2, and was even beloved by the legend himself, Masahiro Sakurai, creator of Super Smash Bros. Ico's influence likely extends to many modern juggernauts in the industry as well, given its unique and innovative use of the limited hardware power and technology available at the time.

I'd highly recommend giving Ico a try if you haven't had the chance to play it. For those looking beyond PS Plus, its successors are also worth checking out. If you haven't had the chance to play either The Last Guardian or Shadow of the Colossus, you can get both of them for $20 on the PlayStation Store. The real question I have about Team Ico's games is whether they're planning any new remasters, and I think the answer to that might be coming very soon.

Shadow of the Colossus creator Fumito Ueda and his team at GenDesign issues yet another tease concerning their next big project.

When Shadow of the Colossus launched back in 2006, GenDESIGN also re-released Ico, and a PS3 remaster was eventually released in 2011. The Last Guardian released in late 2016, and a remake of Shadow of the Colossus by Bluepoint Games followed 14 months later. And as GenDESIGN's next project is fast-approaching, I'm very hopeful we will see an announcement about re-releases, remasters, or remakes in the coming months.

I'll be surprised if we don't see some sort of remake or remaster for one or even all three of these games as a bundled promo around the time of GenDESIGN's next major release, currently referred to as ""Project Robot."" This project has been rumored for some time and was officially teased during the 2024 Game Awards with no name or major information. The new project promises to carry on with the studio's aesthetic traditions, and it will likely be another cult classic hit for fans of Ico and the studio's other major projects.

The influence that Ico had on innovators such as Miyazaki is undeniable, and with so many different remasters and remakes in the works across all genres, it would be a major missed opportunity for Sony not to jump in and give fans updated versions of these classics. I'm setting my expectations low, but getting access to remasters of Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Last Guardian would make me even more excited to invest in the upcoming ""Project Robot.""

If you're a fan of Elden Ring and Miyazaki's other major hits, and you want some insight as to where his unique style originated, you should definitely check out the work of Fumito Ueda and GenDESIGN, including Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Guardian. These games are distinctly different from Soulsborne epics, but the ambiance, tone, settings, themes, and certain aspects of gameplay have some definite overlap that you'll find familiar, entertaining, and every bit as beautiful.

Borderlands 4 is doing a lot right, but it is carrying over one of the worst aspects of the series when it should have finally fixed it.

Grand Theft Auto 6's delay may seem like terrible news, especially for fans, but it is actually the best thing that could have happened in 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","BTC News Today: Bitcoin Traders' Favorite Lottery Ticket for the First Half of the Year — The $300K BTC Call","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/04/bitcoin-traders-favorite-lottery-ticket-for-the-first-half-of-the-year-the-usd300k-btc-call","Sun, 04 May 2025 18:42:55 GMT","

In the crypto market, bold predictions aren't just talk - they're backed by real dollars, often through option plays that resemble lottery tickets offering outsized upside for relatively small costs.

The stand-out as of writing is the Deribit-listed $300,000 strike bitcoin call option expiring on June 26. Theoretically, this call is a bet that BTC's spot price will triple to over $300,000 by the end of the first half of the year.

Over 5,000 contracts were active in the June $300K call at press time, with a notional open interest of $484 million. That makes it the second-most popular option bet in the crucial June expiry, trailing only the $110K call.

Deribit is the world's leading crypto options exchange, accounting for over 75% of the global options activity. On Deribit, one options contract represents 1 BTC. Quarterly expiries, such as the one due on June 26, drive heightened market activity and volatility, with traders using these deadlines to hedge positions, lock in gains, or speculate on the next price moves.

""Perhaps, people like buying lottery tickets. As evidenced by the call skew, there are always folks that want the hyperinflation hedge,"" Spencer Hallarn, a derivatives trader at crypto market maker GSR, said, explaining the high open interest in the so-called out-of-the-money (OTM) call at the $300K strike.

Deep OTM calls, also called wings, require a large move in the underlying asset's price to become profitable and, hence, are significantly cheaper compared to those closer to or below the asset's going market rate. However, the payoff is huge if the market rallies, which makes them similar to buying lottery tickets with slim odds but potential for a big payout.

Deribit's BTC options market has experienced similar flows during previous bull cycles, but those bets rarely gained enough popularity to rank as the second-most preferred play in quarterly expiries.

The chart shows that the June 26 expiry is the largest among all settlements due this year, and the $300K call has the second-highest open interest buildup in the June expiry options. 

Explaining the chunky notional open interest in the $300K call, GSR's Trader Simranjeet Singh said, ""I suspect this is mostly an accumulation of relatively cheap wings betting on broader U.S. reg narrative being pro-crypto and the 'wingy possibility' (no pun intended) of a BTC strategic reserve that was punted around at the start of the administration.""

On Friday, Senator Cynthia Lummis said in a speech that she's ""particularly pleased with President Trump's support of her BITCOIN Act.

""The BITCOIN Act is the only solution to our nation's $36T debt. I'm grateful for a forward-thinking president who not only recognizes this, but acts on it,"" Lummis said on X.

 Bitcoin's institutional adoption reshapes its development landscape, prioritizing security and compliance over grassroots innovation. Bitcoin's decentralized roots, however, face unprecedented challenges. 

Opinion by: Markus Bopp, CEO of TAP Protocol

Not long ago, the idea of Bitcoin as a government-backed reserve asset seemed like a stretch. The US Federal Reserve's move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value.

This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world's most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin (BTC) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term. 

If Bitcoin is to be treated like gold, it must be secured like gold. Very soon, we will see governments and institutions seek to secure Bitcoin in what will no doubt look like a digital Fort Knox. With more institutional and instrumental influence over the most valuable digital asset in the world, verifiable storage, hardened security protocols and structures built on resilience will become paramount. 

This shift could raise the stakes for developers. As institutional adoption rises, so does the demand for specialized developers capable of delivering institutional-grade security and long-term stability. 

What does this demand mean for the developer community that made Bitcoin what it is today? How will this affect the grassroots development built on Bitcoin's core principles of full decentralization and transparency? Will a more institutional Bitcoin leave room for innovation, or is this the end of Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi)?

Bitcoin, the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, was designed to operate outside of traditional systems. Yet the moment governments and traditional institutions stopped keeping their distance, the future of Bitcoin has begun to pivot. What was once met with skepticism now draws a new kind of curiosity. 

The same players who once warned against digital assets are now staking their claims. The International Monetary Fund's latest Balance of Payments Manual now classifies digital assets like Bitcoin as part of the international financial system, placing it firmly alongside traditional reserves and gold. 

As of January 2025, governments worldwide hold an estimated total of 471,000 BTC, worth over $16.3 billion. Strategy continued to lead and cross its Bitcoin holdings at a corporate level, doubling down on the cryptocurrency as a long-term strategic play. 

Recent: Bitcoin DeFi surge may boost BTC demand and adoption — Binance

This kind of institutional recognition validates Bitcoin's core principle but also throws it into flux. Holding it in sovereign reserves, governments are simultaneously affirming its legitimacy while also conforming it to the very system it was meant to disrupt. 

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, fresh talent is still entering the space. There's no guarantee all will stay. In 2024, the total number of developers in the industry declined by 7% year-on-year. Yet seasoned and established developers saw a 27% increase in activity, contributing to a record share of the industry's output. 

While opportunities for small-scale contributors may be fading, the ecosystem supports a core of experienced builders, a signal that the space is maturing. The influx of institutional investors to crypto like Bitcoin is likely to drive up Bitcoin's price, a consequence that might see them price out smaller developers and create an even higher barrier to entry. 

As the stakes around Bitcoin continue to rise, the demand is no longer just for innovation. It'll be for security, compliance and infrastructure that can meet enterprise-grade “Fort Knox” level expectations. 

We'll see a new wave of specialized developers stepping up to build intelligent, compliant and institutional-grade decentralized applications. From secure custody solutions to regulated exchanges and seamless bridges, institutional and government demands will shape the next phase of Bitcoin development.

As Bitcoin integrates more deeply into institutional finance, the development focus is maturing from experimentation to durability, compliance and security. Developers will likely focus on building not directly on Bitcoin but instead with Bitcoin. Bitcoin DeFi has so far been celebrated as a way to unlock open finance with the world's most popular cryptocurrency, and it still might. Still, its future will depend on incoming compliance and regulatory frameworks. 

If governments go down the path of shoehorning the asset into traditional financial models, we'll find developers seeking ways to bridge Bitcoin's liquidity and value to more operable, friendlier chains. If governments are open to preserving Bitcoin's core offering as a new, borderless and decentralized currency, that will signal the community to continue innovation. 

The question for the community then isn't whether Bitcoin can support innovation under institutional oversight. It's whether Bitcoin can thrive in a world that could now seek to contain it.

If you've ever attended a Formula 1 event, you'll know: The cars are loud. The revving of an F1 car's power unit can reach up to 140 decibels. That's like standing next to a firework as it's exploding. Now imagine there's twenty of them, twenty fireworks going off simultaneously as the cars roar past you at 200 mph. The shock waves rip through the air and rattle the bones in your chest. It's a full-body sensory experience. Most importantly, it rules hard.

It's exactly that visceral experience that Lego wanted to tap into when, last year, it partnered with Formula 1 to create ten full sets of teams and drivers for its Speed Champions line. This year, it's taking that a step further, and making them an awesome, full-sized reality. Today at the Miami Grand Prix, twenty drivers—including the celebrity drivers for McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari—introduced themselves to the crowd while driving lifelike Big Builds of their F1 cars in the driver's parade.

The project to get here has been as big as it sounds. Over the course of eight months, a team of 26 Lego engineers took about 22,000 hours total to build the brick-based fleet. This took the total cooperation of each Formula 1 team. Lego designer Marcel Stastny noted that each F1 team provided complete IP with approvals for faithful reproduction. “We had great cooperation,” Stastny said, which, beyond the engineering, was a coup given that Formula 1 teams guard the car's designs so closely.

Before their track debut, the cars were displayed in the Lego Garage at the west campus of Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida. I had the opportunity to get inside the McLaren car, which is made from the exact same standard Lego bricks that your kids can buy at home, made with Lego's famously tight tolerances. It feels … well, as solid as a brick, which makes sense given that the car weighs over 3,000 pounds. You can lean on it or slap it with your hand without worry, although I'm pretty sure someone would've stopped me if I'd tried to kick it. There are some surprisingly faithful features. It might not have a real V6 engine (in fact, each car can only go 12 mph), and the drag reduction system (DRS) might not work either, but those are real F1 Pirelli tires set in a Lego hub.

F1 superfan and Lego ambassador Nicole, who goes by the name GirlBricksALot, concurs. “Down to the spoons for the side view mirrors, the tiles that are used for the camera mount on top, even the cheese slope piece on the front wing—they're identical,” she says. “Every part of the car is satisfying.”

This isn't Lego's first Big Build in this space. In 2018, its designers brought that same commitment to authenticity with the drivable 1:1 Lego Bugatti made from Lego Technic elements (that's Lego's engineering line with rods, gears, and axles). Last year, McLaren driver Lando Norris took a Lego Technic P1 all the way around the course at Silverstone. But building ten authentic, driveable cars in eight months has been a feat on a different scale.

Each one of these is, of course, a masterful marketing operation, with Lego keen to promise this level of attention to detail has filtered down to the versions that you can build at home for $30—bringing racing fans closer to the cars they might never see in real life. A bit like Drive to Survive, it feels that Lego Speed Champions is serving as an entryway into a sport that has been opaque and inaccessible to so many for most of its history—something Nicole says she experienced as a young fan.

“[As a kid], I would follow F1 with articles or YouTube snippets,” she said. “You couldn't even watch it. It's impossibly hard to get into the sport as a driver, and it was impossibly expensive to go to.”

Today, the sport doesn't feel as inaccessible. I myself had a number of surprises. For a sport that has traditionally catered to such a wealthy clientele, it requires a surprising amount of physical endurance, whether that's walking 11,000 steps to get from the gate to your section, broiling in the sun in your seat, or surviving for 8 hours on ice cream with chocolate sauce because you (I) refuse to wait in any more lines.

The second surprise was just how much fun everyone was having (not alcohol-related, although there was plenty of that). There are way more people wearing funny hats shaped like cars or wings than I expected, way more kids shrieking at the vibrations in the turn bridges. When it started raining during the practice rounds, I hid under an umbrella until I noticed fans gathering around the turns cheering whenever a driver threw up a high sheet of water, like Shamu. Both Formula 1 and Lego have a rich history and a deeply loyal fan base. It was especially easy to notice during the driver's parade that both are just … fun.

My 7-year-old son might not be able to tolerate the heat and walking that a Grand Prix requires (I can barely tolerate it, and I'm in my 40s) but he's currently on his 6th Formula 1 set and counting. It's pretty awesome that teenage prodigy Kimi Antonelli rode in a car that looks just like his.

Elon Musk's SpaceX is getting its own official company town.

Residents of an area around SpaceX's Starbase launch site in southern Texas voted overwhelmingly on Saturday to incorporate as a city — also named Starbase. According to results posted online by the Cameron County Elections Department, there were 212 votes in favor and only six against.

In a post on his social media site X, Musk wrote that Starbase, Texas “Is now a real city!” 

The new city's residents are believed to mostly be SpaceX employees. On Saturday, they also voted to elect three current and former Starbase employees — Bobby Peden, Jordan Buss, and Jenna Petrzelka — who ran unopposed to serve, respectively, as Starbase's mayor and two commissioners.

The Associated Press reports that SpaceX hasn't shared many specifics about why it wanted to incorporate the area. The company said it already manages the area's roads, utilities, and “the provisions of schooling and medical care,” and it's also looking to shift authority from the county to the new city government to close the nearby Boca Chica beach and state park for launches.

Musk — who recently said he would be reducing his role with the Trump administration's controversial Department of Government Efficiency to a “day or two” per week — announced last year that he was moving SpaceX's headquarters from El Segundo, California to the Starbase facility in Texas. 

At the time, Musk said he'd “had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building” and that the “final straw” was a California bill that prohibits schools from disclosing students' sexuality or gender identity without consent.

After last night's election, a new X account representing the town posted, “Becoming a city will help us continue building the best community possible for the men and women building the future of humanity's place in space.”

It's not nice, I don't like running a kernel mode anti-cheat any more than you do, but I can see why it's necessary for preserving the competitive integrity of free-to-play shooter games like Valorant.

Only thing I can think of is Microsoft locking down Windows so hard that nothing outside of code written (well signed) by Microsoft can run with kernel level privileges but I think that is an even worse option.If you don't like it you can always just go and play any of the titles without kernel level anti-cheat and get a cheater in ~1/5th of your games (my experience in counter strike).

What even makes you think it's a solvable problem? Even with a totally end-to-end cryptographically controlled hardware chain that treats the player like an adversary/inmate (like in the consoles, maybe even more strict) there's always a possibility of ML-based cheats with a low-latency camera. Barely anyone does that now because there are easier methods, but trust me, it will get used if required, just like DMA is used now. People throw crazy money into cheating.It's a race to the bottom where everybody eventually loses except the corporations. Players never get rid of the cheaters completely, unrelated people who don't play games get their hardware+software locked down because of a bunch of whiny gamers, and corpos obtain the ultimate vendor lock.The optimal amount of bad behavior is not zero.

I'd rather just give Riot Games my driver's licence than full access to my computer. They already know my name and where I live from metadata.There should be a KYC solution for gaming where a company like Epic, Riot, or Valve verifies your identity and developers can gate competitive video games behind that. If you cheat, you're out for 5-10 years (so dumb teenagers aren't locked out forever). The big issue imo isn't banning cheaters, it's preventing them from creating a new account and cheating again.Such a system would be free money & low maintenance for whatever company develops it first.

As it goes with every Marvel movie, Thunderbolts ends twice: first before the end titles, and again after the credits have rolled. Both closers are pretty important for what's next for the team and their upcoming appearance in Avengers: Doomsday, and director Jake Schreier's discussed about how the post-credits came about.



After the credits, the film jumps ahead 14 months after the motley crew was publicly unveiled as the New Avengers. They're put out about Sam Wilson suing them over the Avengers trademark, but that matter falls to the wayside when they learn a rocket's coming to Earth, and it's bearing the logo of the Fantastic Four. Schreier told Variety that scene was shot about a month ago (prior to its mid-April premiere), and by Doomsday directors Joe and Anthony Russo in London. The team was already confirmed to be among that film's cast back in March, and for those keeping track, this post-credits makes the brothers' first scene they shot since they exited the MCU with Avengers: Endgame.

Schreier may not have directed his former Thunderbolts, but he looked at the scene's scripts and collborated on it “to make sure it was honest to where our characters were. [We're] giving them over to this whole new world and new scope, and [we] want them to function in that way.” Being there on set was “very fun to watch your buddies go on to this grander scale…and see them directed in another context and on a different level of scope than we had been treating it.”

Now that they're in the hands of the Russos, we'll have to wait until Avengers: Doomsday releases on May 1 to see what the New Avengers get up to when they meet the Fantastic Four, Sam's Avengers, and the X-Men.

We're nearing the limits of the PCIe 5.0 x4 standard.

Despite not being officially announced by Sandisk, the WD Black SN8100 is available for pre-order at Amazon (Germany), at the equivalent of $225 for the 1TB variant, via momomo_us . With listed reads of 14.9 GB/s, this should be the fastest consumer PCIe 5.0 SSD, at least if we're talking about on-paper specifications. Beyond what the Amazon listing offers, technical details, including the specific controller and NAND flash type, remain unknown.

Western Digital's flash-memory business has been handed over to the now-independent Sandisk, following its spin-off from the company. In theory, this should extend to Western Digital's acclaimed WD Black lineup, though end-users are unlikely to experience any significant changes. The bottom line is that Sandisk will probably be responsible for bringing the SN8100 to market, handling everything from launch to customer support, but it will be marketed with Western Digital's well-known WD label.

The SN8100 is the first PCIe 5.0 SSD under the WD Black product line, and is listed with impressive read speeds of 14.9 GB/s, beating the best from Samsung, Kingston, and Crucial, at least if we're going by first-party tests. The SN8100 is positioned as a successor to the WD Black SN850X, which was among the fastest PCIe 4.0 SSDs back in its day.

The listing's claim of an average operating power of 7W or less strongly suggests the SN8100 employs Silicon Motion's power-efficient SM2508 controller. That being said, Western Digital did show off a prototype 15 GB/s SSD last year at FMS 2024, which leveraged an in-house controller, with comparable power draw. We'll know for sure when Sandisk provides a complete technical datasheet. The NAND ICs employ a TLC (Triple Level Cell) design with CBA technology, likely sourced from 8th generation (218-layer) NAND jointly developed by Sandisk and Kioxia.

The WD Black SN8100 offers sequential reads and writes of up to 14.9 GB/s and 14.0 GB/s, while its random read and write performance is listed at 2,300K IOPS. According to the leaked numbers, it beats every SSD in sequential tests, but loses to the 9100 Pro in random writes, thanks to Samsung's proprietary Presto controller. The SN8100 is said to launch in 1TB to 4TB capacities, but as of writing, only the 1TB model is listed for pre-order.

In terms of pricing, the 1TB variant is listed at $225 (€199.99), or about 22.5 cents per Gigabyte. This is significantly more expensive than PCIe 4.0 options, which currently average around 6-7 cents per gigabyte; even less during sales. Bearing that in mind, German users can pre-order this SSD at Amazon, with deliveries scheduled to begin on May 30. Hopefully, we will see an official announcement by then.

With Wi-Fi 7 routers blanketing the market, is the upgrade over Wi-Fi 6E worth it?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


It can be somewhat confusing if you're in the market to replace an old wireless router or add a new one in your home or office. Currently, three wireless standards are prevalent in the marketplace: Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E, and Wi-Fi 7.

The first Wi-Fi 6 devices arrived in 2019, while the first Wi-Fi 6E devices didn't arrive until 2021. Wi-Fi 7, the most recent standard, started creeping into the market in late 2023 with a limited number of routers. You'll want to research the newest high-performance Wi-Fi 7 routers for the fastest possible wireless speeds in your home. However, older routers that use the Wi-Fi 6E standard aren't exactly slouches when it comes to transfer speeds, and in many instances, you could save some money by staying away from the bleeding edge of router technology.

While Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 both support the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands, Wi-Fi 7 implements some performance-boost improvements to the last band. Wi-Fi 7 doubles the channel bandwidth from 160 Hz to 320 Hz and boosts the maximum number of spatial streams from 8 to 16.

Coupling those advances with a maximum bandwidth of 2,400 Mbps per stream gives you a theoretical data rate ceiling of 46 Gbps in flagship Wi-Fi 7 routers. That is a massive increase in throughput compared to Wi-Fi 6E routers, which top out at 9.6 Gbps.

Wi-Fi 7 also supports Multi-Link Operation (MLO), giving wireless routers the ability to connect Wi-Fi 7 clients across multiple wireless bands simultaneously. For example, a Wi-Fi 7 client can connect to a Wi-Fi 7 router using a single aggregated link combining 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, or 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands. The Wi-Fi 7 spec even allows the bonding of all three bands together for a single client. MLO not only offers improved performance, but it bolsters network reliability through load balancing and can lower network latency.

When Wi-Fi 6 supplanted Wi-Fi 5, we knew to expect greater performance across the board, and that was equally true when Wi-Fi 6E added the faster 6 GHz band absent from Wi-Fi 6. When it comes to Wi-Fi 7, you'll need to be aware of two classes of routers before clicking the purchase button.

Generally speaking, all Wi-Fi 7 routers support 4K-QAM and MLO; however, the similarities end there. On the low end, dual-band Wi-Fi 7 routers only support the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless bands. They lack the 6 GHz band that gives Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers such good short-range performance. In that respect, their maximum performance potential aligns more closely with Wi-Fi 6 routers than Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7 routers. Dual-band Wi-Fi 7 routers also often lack the full 320 MHz channels afforded by the Wi-Fi 7 spec, with products like the MSI Roamii BE Lite and Amazon Eero 7 topping out at 240 MHz.

On the other hand, full-featured tri- and quad-band Wi-Fi 7 routers include the 6 GHz band, allowing them to leverage the spec fully. Of course, maximum throughput is largely dictated by the number of streams and channels a router supports. However, all else being equal, tri- or quad-band Wi-Fi 7 routers perform better than their lesser dual-band brethren.

So, if you're shopping for a new Wi-Fi 7 router, look for words like “Lite” or “Dual-Band,” because that clearly indicates that the product you purchase isn't a full-spec device. Sure, you'll pay less given the lower performance, but make no mistake, you won't realize the true performance potential of the full Wi-Fi 7 spec.

The performance difference between the best Wi-Fi 6E and best Wi-Fi 7 routers is quite dramatic. Thanks to the expansion of channels from 160 MHz to 320 MHz and the inclusion of MLO, which allows a router to combine available bandwidth from multiple bands, we've seen some incredible throughput from Wi-Fi 7 routers.

While Wi-Fi 6E routers that we've tested max out at around 1,600 to 1,700 Mbps on the 6 GHz band, the fastest Wi-Fi 7 routers are seeing speeds surpass 3,000 Mbps at close range. For example, the Asus ZenWiFi BQ16 Pro hit 3,500 Mbps in our iPerf3 testing at 6 feet. The Netgear Orbi 970 was no slouch, coming in at 3,340 Mbps. Other top performers include the TP-Link Archer GE800 (2,830 Mbps) and the ZenWiFi BT10 (2,667 Mbps).

On the 5 GHz band, Wi-Fi 6E routers typically flirt with 1,500 to 1,600 Mbps at the high end. In our experience, Wi-Fi 7 routers don't improve as much on that metric as on the 6 GHz band, but we've seen Wi-Fi 7 routers like the Archer GE800 surpass 1,800 Mbps at close range.

There's no question that (tri- and quad-band) Wi-Fi 7 routers can deliver greater sustained performance than their Wi-Fi 6E forebears, so the only real reason to purchase a Wi-Fi 6E router today would be if they are available at a steep discount. If you're looking for a reasonably-priced Wi-Fi 6E router, the TP-Link AXE5400 and Asus RT-AXE7800 are standalone tri-band solutions with street prices of $149.99 and $199.99, respectively. If you prefer a mesh setup, the TP-Link Deco XE75 Wi-Fi 6E mesh router 2-pack costs $169.99, while the Asus ZenWiFi AXE7800 3-pack is $349.99.

Looking at the Wi-Fi 7 side of the equation, you can obtain a tri-band TP-Link Archer BE550 Wi-Fi 7 router for $199.99, while a Netgear Nighthawk RS300 is $279.99. However, when you start looking at mesh setups, prices are significantly higher for Wi-Fi 7 solutions. For example, the TP-Link Deco BE63 is $449, while the Asus ZenWiFi BT8 will set you back $499.

In other words, if you don't need the expanded coverage that a mesh router would provide, going with a standalone Wi-Fi 7 router doesn't impart a significant price premium over Wi-Fi 6E counterparts. And given the performance, security, and capacity improvements of Wi-Fi 7 over Wi-Fi 6E, it doesn't make much sense to go with the older wireless standard today.

Things are murkier regarding Wi-Fi 7 mesh routers, as they still command a significant price premium over the Wi-Fi 6E competition. Sure, you can get the MSI Roamii BE Lite for $229, but you're getting performance more akin to a high-end Wi-Fi 6 mesh system than something that can compete with or surpass a Wi-Fi 6E mesh router.

Is it worth paying a nearly $300 premium for a TP-Link Deco BE63 over a Deco XE75? In my opinion, absolutely not. Wi-Fi 7 is far more futureproof than Wi-Fi 6E, but that premium is only worth it if you're willing to absorb the cost just to have the fastest wireless speeds possible.

The opportunities to upgrade to Wi-Fi 7 from older technologies continually increase. For better or worse, many manufacturers are devoting fewer resources to Wi-Fi 6E routers and are shifting the bulk of their attention to dual-, tri-, and quad-band Wi-Fi 7 solutions. As chipset prices drop and production volumes increase, we can expect pricing on Wi-Fi 7 products to fall in response.

These smaller Snapdragon X powered devices are expected to become official on Tuesday.

At its Surface event scheduled for May 6th next week, Microsoft is expected to unveil two new compact offerings under its Surface Pro and Surface Laptop families, according to WinFuture. It's important to note that these smaller variants are not a new generation, but rather expand the existing Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 product lines. Information about technical details, pricing, and availability remains in the dark, but Microsoft is expected to reveal more on Tuesday.

Microsoft offers a range of Surface devices, designed for various use cases. The Surface Pro family features 2-in-1 tablets that can function both as a tablet and a laptop with the detachable keyboard (purchased separately). The Surface Laptop series, on the other hand, sticks to the basics with a traditional clamshell laptop form factor.

Starting in June 2024, Microsoft revealed the Surface Laptop 7 (15-inch and 13.8-inch) and Surface Pro 11 (13-inch) families, initially equipped with Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X chips, for the mainstream. Variants with Intel's Lunar Lake followed, targeted towards business users.

Microsoft is reportedly extending these product lines with compact offerings, starting with a 12-inch version of the Surface Pro 11. In terms of display, we're looking at a PixelSense Flow LCD panel (likely IPS), though the refresh rate has not been specified. Under the hood, it reportedly features the Snapdragon X Plus X1P-42-100 SoC with 8 Oryon cores, along with a 45 TOPS capable Hexagon-based NPU.

The SoC is connected with 16GB of LPDDR5x memory (likely 8448 MT/s), which is non-expandable. The laptop is expected to be available in 256GB and 512GB storage capacities, supplied by a UFS-based solution, which, unlike SSDs, is not upgradable. Microsoft claims 16 hours of local video playback, but real-world usage will vary. The leaked press slides only mention two USB Type-C ports for data transfer, charging, and hooking up external displays.

Similarly, the Surface Laptop 7 lineup is reportedly expanding with a 13-inch variant, complementing the existing 13.8-inch and 15-inch options. Display-wise, Microsoft will continue to use a PixelSense Flow LCD panel, but the refresh rate has reportedly been lowered from 120 Hz to 60 Hz. Just like the new Surface Pro model, this device also, allegedly, uses the same 8-core Snapdragon X Plus X1P-42-100 SoC from Qualcomm, with 16GB of RAM and 256GB/512GB of UFS-based storage.

These laptops are said to use an Island-style keyboard with a glass trackpad. Windows Hello login is facilitated by a built-in fingerprint reader next to the keyboard. The port selection is quite limited, with two USB 3.2 Type-C ports, a single USB Type-A port, and a 3.5m jack, with no Surface Connect port.

According to the source, neither of the two new offerings will come with a charging brick included. Users will need to use their own PD-compliant chargers capable of supplying at least 27W of power. We can expect to learn more about pricing and availability from Microsoft at their Surface event on Tuesday.

Chelsea are eyeing up a double summer transfer swoop for Liam Delap and Dean Huijsen - and the Blues could get both deals done in order for them to feature at the Club World Cup. Enzo Maresca's side travel out to the United States for the inaugural FIFA tournament in June and the transfer window is set to open at the start of the month to give the Blues and Manchester City the chance to sign players to be involved. 

The window will be open between Sunday, June 1, and Tuesday, June 10, due to an exceptional registration period for the expanded Club World Cup. It will open again on Monday, June 16, until Deadline Day on Monday, September 1. All Premier League clubs will be free to do business during the earlier window, not just Chelsea and City. 

However, Chelsea could take advantage of the early window and get a couple of transfers over the line as they look to get prepared for the Club World Cup. According to The Mirror, the Blues are planning a fast start to their summer business, with Delap and Huijsen both identified as primary targets. 

Ipswich striker Delap, 22, who has a £30million relegation clause, and Bournemouth centre-back Huijsen, 20, who has a £50m buyout clause, are players Chelsea want to sign. 

Delap has been impressive in his debut Premier League season for Ipswich, scoring 12 goals in 34 matches. As for Huijsen, he has excelled for Bournemouth since his move from Juventus last summer and won the Player of the Match after netting against Arsenal on Saturday. 

However, any move for Delap and Huijsen to ensure the duo can feature for Chelsea in the Club World Cup could spark a club-versus-country row. Both players are in line to play at the Under 21s European Championship in Slovakia for England and Spain respectively. 

But if Chelsea push ahead with swoops for Delap and Huijsen, their nations would be powerless should the Blues then include either of them in their Club World Cup squad in June. 

Under FIFA rules, it's not mandatory for clubs in the 32-team tournament to release their players for international duty. But football's lead governing body are encouraging Club World Cup participants to name their strongest possible squad, especially as there is a record £775million in prize money up for grabs.

32 sides from across the globe will compete to become the best team in the world, with Manchester City, Real Madrid, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Borussia Dortmund, Atletico Madrid, Red Bull Salzburg, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Porto the European representatives.

The tournament is set to start on Friday, June 13 and run for four weeks, with the final taking place on Sunday, July 13. FIFA have picked 12 venues to host, with matches predominately on the East Coast of the US.

TEHRAN – Iran's beach soccer goalkeeper Mohammad Dastan has expressed confidence that the team will progress step by step in the 2025 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.

Iran opened their campaign with a 5-4 victory over Mauritania in Group B and also secured a 5-1 win against Paraguay.

The team are now set to face Portugal on Monday for the top spot in the group.

“So far, we have performed very well, especially with the victory against Paraguay, which are a strong team. We hope to win against Portugal as well and qualify as the top team. Of course, if we do, we will face Brazil in the next stage,” Dastan said.

Regarding the potential matchup with Brazil, Dastan added, “With respect to all beach soccer teams worldwide, I must say Brazil are the greatest team in this sport. I hope we succeed on this journey and defeat teams one by one. My belief is that we should progress step by step. Right now, we need to focus on the game against Portugal.”

He concluded, “We want to dedicate this championship to the people of Iran. That's why we are here. There is a difficult task ahead, but we will do our best to win the title for the first time ever,” Dastan finished.

Liverpool were beaten 3-1 at Chelsea on Sunday in their first match since being crowned as Premier League champions.

Enzo Fernandez finished off a smart move to give the Blues the lead after three minutes, before a calamitous Jarell Quansah own goal made it two in the second half.

Ruud beats Draper 7-5 3-6 6-4  

Ruud, a three-time Grand Slam finalist, wins ATP Masters event for first time

It is Norwegian Ruud's 12th title on clay

Draper, 23, was aiming for first clay-court title of his career

Jonathan Jurejko

Well, it wasn't to be for Jack Draper today - but what a tournament.

You feel a clay-court title won't be too far on the horizon.

Could it be as soon as Rome? The Italian Open starts later this week. 

Then it's the big one... Roland Garros.

Whatever happens over the course of the rest of the European clay-court swing, there are exciting times for Jack Draper and British tennis.

See you soon!

Madrid Open runner-up Jack Draper: ""Firstly, congratulations to Casper on this win, you really deserve it. You were braver than me in the key moments. Congratulations to you and your team for all the hard work.

""This loss hurts but I also want to thank my own team, my family for all of the support. And thank you for all the fans who come out here to support us, it means so much to all of us who love tennis and love playing in front of you.

""This sport is brutal but I will keep trying, I think this loss will make me better.""

Madrid Open champion Casper Ruud on his first Masters title: ""It feels great, of course. It's been a long time coming, this is a really big goal that I have dreamed about since I was so young. 

""It was a great match, I knew that Jack has been playing so well all year, so I knew I had to bring my A+ game. Jack is an incredible player. 

""I owe a lot of my success to my family, my coaches, my friends. I'm surrounded by amazing people, I'm a very lucky guy."" 

Draper 5-7 6-3 4-6 Ruud

Let's hear from the new Madrid champion...

Draper 5-7 6-3 4-6 Ruud

The pair show their mutual respect in a friendly hug at the net. 

Both men know what the other put into that absorbing final. It was a cracker.

Jack Draper will be disappointed, of course. 

But he will reflect positively on a clay-court tournament where few would have expected him to challenge for the title.

Draper has arrived on clay, people...

Draper 5-7 6-3 4-6 Ruud

He's done it! What a final game from Casper Ruud!

Nerves? Nah.

Jack Draper misses out on his first clay-court title.

Draper 5-7 6-3 4-5 Ruud*

Sensational! Another forehand winner and it's three championship points for Casper Ruud...

Draper 5-7 6-3 4-5 Ruud*

Almost a carbon copy... 30-0.

Draper 5-7 6-3 4-5 Ruud*

Perfect start. Ruud finds a first serve and sticks away a forehand winner. 15-0...

Draper 5-7 6-3 4-5 Ruud*

Here we go then.

Jack Draper must break here. 

Casper Ruud serving for the title...

Draper 5-7 6-3 4-5 Ruud*

Jack Draper has to take care of his own business - and then hope Casper Ruud feels the pressure.

Draper does exactly that. An impressive hold-to-love is finished with a flowing forehand winner.

All on Ruud's racquet now...

*Draper 5-7 6-3 3-5 Ruud

Back all square... in the game. 30-30. 

Draper's backhand swarms Ruud and forces a mistake from the baseline. 

But the Briton can't build on that as he pushes a return wide of the sideline. He can't believe it's wide.

Game point at 40-30 and Ruud completes the job.

Another very good hold. One more and he's getting his hands on the Madrid Open title...

Draper 5-7 6-3 3-4 Ruud*

Casper Ruud, I'd say, looks the slightly sprightlier out there as we hit the business end of the deciding set.

He has clarity of mind to play a delicate dropshot which Draper reaches but is stretching too much to return.

That's 30-0. Oh, then he produces another double fault...

Draper 5-7 6-3 3-4 Ruud*

So important that Jack Draper didn't fall a double break down there.

It's still a single break and you wouldn't think it will be easy for Casper Ruud to serve out victory.

Remember, he's never won a Masters title....

Draper 5-7 6-3 3-4 Ruud*

If Jack Draper is going to do this, it'll have been the hard way. 

Another break point goes the way of Ruud when the British number one puts another backhand into the tramlines, but he saves that and drags himself over the line.

*Draper 5-7 6-3 2-4 Ruud

Uh oh. A tired double fault by Draper isn't how he wants to start this vital game.

But he recovers with a wonderful bit of play, lunging across court for a backhand which he whips back the other way.

Quality. Draper's mood takes a turn again when he is docked a first serve for another time violation.

He's so exasperated at Mohamed Lahyani. But Draper recovers to level at 30-30...

*Draper 5-7 6-3 2-4 Ruud

Well, this is the perfect way for the Norwegian world number 15 to start.

An imperious hold to 15 - helped by landing more first serves - ensures he backs up the break.

Draper 5-7 6-3 2-3 Ruud*

Momentum firmly with Ruud now. Am I convinced he will serve this out with no further twists and turns? Absolutely not.

Draper 5-7 6-3 2-3 Ruud*

The pressure finally tells on Draper. 

On the second break point of the fifth game - and the fifth he has faced across the past two games - the Brit buckles.

The lefty drags a backhand wide and it puts Ruud ahead.

*Draper 5-7 6-3 2-2 Ruud

Saved! Draper is giving as good as he's getting from Ruud in terms of fight and resilience.

But can he save a second break point... Draper is forced out wide by Ruud and slips as he changes direction back into the centre of the court.

Ooh, looks like his knee jarred. Fingers crossed it's nothing too serious.

First he has another break point to defend...

Three-time Grand Slam finalist and former world No. 2 Casper Ruud won the biggest title of his career on Sunday, charging past Jack Draper 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in the Mutua Madrid Open final.The victory marks Ruud's first ATP Masters 1000 title—making him the first Norwegian player to ever win at this level—and his first since last year's Geneva victory.“It's been a long time coming, and it's one really big goal that I dreamed about since I was young,” Ruud said of his first 1000 trophy. “It's an incredible feeling to accomplish it, and also the way I did it today. It was a great match.“I knew Jack had been playing unbelievable all year and also at this tournament. I knew that if I don't bring my A, A, A+ game I'm going to be whipped around the court. But luckily I played really well…“This is a really good boost for me, I hope I can keep it going.”

“This is a really good boost for me, I hope I can keep it going.”

Coming into the match, Ruud was the ATP Tour's undisputed clay-court leader, with more wins (124), finals (17) and titles (11) than any other player since the start of the 2020 season. He's only extended his dominance on the surface with his win over Draper: 12 of his 13 career titles have now come on clay.As a result, the two-time Roland Garros finalist is set to return to the ATP's Top 10 rankings come Monday as world No. 7.

Jack Draper could not quite clear the final hurdle as he strove to land his first title on clay. It was a significant hurdle, because Casper Ruud is a clay-court animal who was born and bred for this surface.

An exhausting and entertaining three-setter found Draper fading at the last, and eventually going down by a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 margin. The crucial period was the four-game run which allowed Ruud to come back from a 3-5 deficit in the first set to burgle it by a 7-5 margin.

To Ruud's credit, he surged for the finish line in a superb final game, ripping forehand winners up the line with a freedom that belied the size of the prize: the biggest title of his career.

Ruud has won 125 matches and 12 titles on clay since the start of this decade: the best figures on the tour. His nearest competitors are Stefanos Tsitsipas with 95 wins, and Carlos Alcaraz with nine titles, which underlines what an expert Ruud is on the red dirt.

Draper, by contrast, has played fewer than 30 matches on the surface, so he is still learning how to deal with its characteristic movement patterns. Towards the end of this match, as the lactic acid burned its way into his muscles, he wasn't able to avoid Ruud's devastating forehand. As a result, he found himself shuttling left and right like a puppet on a string.

“I think you really deserve this,” Draper told Ruud at the presentation ceremony. “You were braver than me in the key moments. This sport is brutal, but I think this loss is gonna make me better.”

At the end of his winning speech, Casper Ruud turns his hand to a bit of Spanish, which was delivered with a good accent and accurate grammar. He thanked the fans for their support and said he was looking forward to seeing them next year.

Ruud is serving for the match and the championship. He starts it well by winning the first two points to go 30-0 up. He can smell victory now. A stunning forehand down the line takes him to 40-0 and three championship points.

The Norwegian sends a forehand down the line, which Draper cannot return, and Ruud wins the Madrid Open 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. We were treated to one hell of a final. Bravo to both players. Commiserations to Draper, congratulations to Ruud.

Draper simply has to win this game to stay alive in this final and he responds by winning the game without losing a point. Draper is still alive.

Ruud was 30-0 up but loses the next two points, including a double fault. Draper hits the ball just out and Ruud has the chance to seal the game at 40-30 up. Draper goes long and Ruud holds a crucial serve. He is just one game away from the title.

Not the time to be double faulting for Draper. He responds by winning the next two points, including a stunning end to a fantastic rally that Ruud must have thought he was going to win but Draper, on the stretch, wins it with a terrific shot across the court. Draper then falls victim to a second time penalty so loses his first serve. The Briton was not impressed by that decision from the umpire. He then loses the next two points and Ruud has a big break point. Draper saves it and we go to deuce.

Draper now has the advantage after yet another stunning rally. He then closes it out and boy did he need that.

WHAT A POINT THIS IS 🤯Watch with NOW: https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/JUpGGqUjI5

Despite Draper winning the first point of the game, Ruud responds by winning the next four points and is now 4-2 up in the set.

Draper moves to 30-0 up on serve but drops the next two points. The Briton then goes long again and Ruud has break point. Both players have had numerous break points in the last few games but no-one has been able to take it. Can Ruud do so this time? No he cannot as Draper takes us to deuce with a great forehand.

A stunning rally at the net results in Ruud taking the point and having another break point. At the end of that point, Draper did go down but he is back up. This time Ruud can take the break point and it is now advantage Ruud in this deciding set.

Definitely some weariness from Draper there as he dropped to one knee after being outwitted in the forecourt. He's been given the old sleeper hold by Ruud: lots of high, loopy balls that made it hard for Draper to hit winners. He has had to generate a lot of his own pace all match, and the effort is beginning to tell.

Ruud is under pressure at 15-30 down on his serve. But the Norwegian brings it level at 30-30 with a brilliant forehand down the line. But a double fault from Ruud gives Draper a break point. Could this be a huge moment in the match?

Draper cannot take it though as he hits the net. Ruud then goes long at deuce and Draper has a second break point in this game. A stunning serve though from Ruud takes us back to deuce.

Draper hits wide and now the advantage goes to Ruud, who takes it to hold serve with a sublime forehand.

Ruud plays one of the best shots of the day with a stunning forehand down the line that wins him the first point of the game. Ruud then goes 30-15 up but Draper brings it level at 30-30. Draper hits the net, giving Ruud a break point. This could be a hugely pivotal moment in the match. Draper saves himself though and we go to deuce.

Draper wins the next point to move to advantage but then goes long so we return to deuce. Draper gets back to advantage but again cannot convert as he registers a double fault. Not the time to be doing that.

Another advantage for Draper but, after a stunning rally, he wastes the chance once more.

Ruud then pulls out a stunning forehand and, for the first time in this game, he has advantage but Draper saves it. Back to deuce once more!

Draper goes just wide after a lengthy rally and the advantage is Ruud's. But Draper pulls out an ace when he needed it. Draper finally seals an enthralling game with back-to-back points and takes a 2-1 lead in this deciding set.

Amazing hold of serve for Draper. Normally you would say that a long game like that could tilt a match. But the dynamic here is beginning to favour Ruud, with so many long rallies. Sky's Colin Fleming is now pointing out how cold it is on court, maybe 14 degrees, which makes it harder to hit winners.

Ruud drops just the one shot as he cruises towards the game and we are all square in this deciding set at 1-1. The momentum was with Draper so Ruud really needed that to arrest that momentum.

Draper has serve at the start of this deciding set. It is tight at 30-30 and Draper manages to find an ace on second serve, which rather perplexed Ruud. Draper looks like he will see out the game but superb play from Ruud on the run sees him take it deuce.

Draper though wins the next two points to hold serve. It was sealed with a sublime backhand across the court.

A stunning backhand from Draper wins him the first point of this game. He hit that so hard! Ruud then suffers back-to-back double faults to give Draper three break and set points. Ruud saves the first and then the second with a cute drop shot. Can he save all three? No he cannot as he goes long and Draper takes the set 6-3.

We have had everything in this match, with so many momentum swings and now it feels like Draper has it.

The double-break – which he probably should have had in set one – came that time for Draper, and saved him from having to serve it out. Incredible stats for the Brit: 12 winners and one unforced error. What a way to come back from that angry reaction 40 minutes ago.

Jack Draper takes the second set and we are going to a deciding set! 💥Watch the action with NOW:https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/dsmu90v8FM

This has been an enthralling match so far, full of momentum swings and quality tennis, the latest example a terrific forehand across the court from Ruud.

The Norwegian then moves to 15-40 up and has two break points of his own now. A great serve from Draper allows him to save the first one and, after a lengthy rally, saves the second to take us to deuce. Two huge saves from Draper there.

The Briton then wins the next two points and holds serve. He is one game away from the second set but he was also 5-3 up in the first.

Could this be the moment Draper needed to get back in this match? He wins the first two points on Ruud's serve and then the fourth point to set up two break points.

He only needs one with a spectacular forehand and that is a crucial break that brings him right back into this match.

""OHHH HELLO!"" 🤩A huge forehand gets Jack Draper a massive break in the second set! 💪Watch the action with NOW:https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/zdZgKZr4s9

This feels like a pivotal moment in this match. If Ruud were to get a break, he would nearly be there to winning this final.

Draper though had no intention of being broken in that service game as he races through the game without conceding a point and once again we are all square in this second set.

Despite a double fault, Ruud sees out the game and holds serve.

One thing no one would have expected is Ruud outserving Draper today, especially when it comes to the aces: eight so far as against two. And five-one in this second set. The one time Ruud was broken was when his serve malfunctioned in game three and he hit double double-faults.

A neat drop shot from Draper takes the Briton to 30-0 up on serve. Ruud then hits the net on his next return and Draper is racing through his latest service game.

A stunning backhand across the court mid-air though from Ruud keeps the game alive.

But Draper sees it out and we are all square in this second set at 2-2.

This would be a great time for Draper to get a break of serve. Ruud has the chance to seal the game at 40-30 but he hits the net, taking us to deuce.

A terrific ace gives Ruud advantage and he looks like he will see out the game but Draper's backhand off a Ruud smash beats the Norwegian and we go back to deuce.

Ruud then earns himself another advantage and this time completes the job in this game.

Draper responds well in his latest service game, racing through the game by winning it to love. He stops the rot and boy did he need that.

Ruud serves at the start of this second set. The Norwegian races through the game, sealing it with back-to-back aces and the momentum is all with him. Draper needs a response and now; Ruud has won five straight games.

The pressure is really on Draper for the first time today and that is not the best of starts to this game as he loses the first point. The tension grows as we move to 30-30 and then Ruud wins the following point to earn himself not only a break point but also set point.

Draper misjudges a return from Ruud and ends up making a mess of it, allowing Ruud to take the first set. Ruud was on the verge of losing that set but comes back to win it. Draper is visibly very annoyed at himself.

Ruud burgled that set with some moonballs and all-sorts, and Draper is shouting at his player box about how flat he has been. I'd say that began as soon as he served for the set. Or actually, slightly earlier, when he handed over some cheap errors while Ruud was 3-5 down and serving. Draper could have won it there with a double break. But instead he tightened up and has been unable to loosen his arm again.

From 5-3 down, Casper Ruud takes the first set! 💪Jack Draper is not happy ❌Watch the action with NOW:https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/SlBTJ7mHG9

The momentum was with Draper earlier in the set but it is shifting towards Ruud, who could himself go within one game of the first set if he holds serve.

An unforced error from Draper allows Ruud to go 40-15 up. An excellent serve from the Norwegian wins him the game and he is now 6-5 up, a game away from taking the opening set.

Draper moves to 30-15 up but a double fault gives Ruud hope of staying alive in this set.

Draper then makes an unforced error and gives Ruud his first break point of the match. The Norwegian takes it and we go to 5-5, with Ruud on serve in the next game. This first set is well and truly back on.

Draper clearly tightened up as he served for the first set, losing a lot of racket-head speed, and Ruud capitalised expertly. His experience could be a big factor in this match. It also feels as if there are a few too many long rallies going on, from Draper's point of view. That's much more Ruud's style of play.

A big break for Casper Ruud! 😲Watch the action with NOW:https://t.co/IJEuV2jgro pic.twitter.com/a2Tw4fMPRA

This is a crucial service game from Ruud to stay in this set and a double fault will not help. That takes us to 30-30. Ruud though wins the next two points and holds serve to stay in the set.

Draper though will serve for the first set.

In between games, Draper takes a moment to take a breath and close his eyes. He is in a good position but Ruud has just started to find some form in the last few games so Draper needs to be careful.

Draper moves to 40-15 with a strong forehand and has the chance to move 5-3 up. He cannot take the first chance as his attempted drop shot goes wide. Not sure that was the right choice of shot.

He does not miss the second opportunity as a strong serve sets up the point. Draper is just one game away from the first set.

Saw a quiet smile there from Nicky Draper, Jack's mother, as he slammed another forehand winner down the line. It's tough for opponents to play into his forehand corner: they have to get plenty of juice on the ball otherwise he just changes direction on them. Alarming stat coming up for Ruud: he has won two of 11 points on his own second serve.

Ruud goes 15-0 up but a stunning shot across the court from Draper takes us to 15-15. He did brilliantly to reach that drop shot from Ruud and then it was a fantastic shot to win the point. Ruud though wins the next three points and easily holds serve.

Ruud finding his rhythm now and not giving away many easy points. The pressure is on Draper to find winning combinations, and he has kept it up in his service games to date, despite some heavy pressure.

Ruud puts some pressure back on Draper, winning the first two points on the Briton's serve in this game. Draper then wins the next two points to take it to 30-30, including a sliding volley as he ran to the net. He only just managed to reach that one.

Ruud then goes long, giving Draper the chance to see out the game. A stunning forehand from Draper seals the game for the Briton and he now leads 4-2 in this opening set.

Draper is certainly putting pressure on the Ruud serve. He gets it to 30-30 but a loose shot goes wide, presenting Ruud the chance to hold serve and get back on track in this match. He then sees out the game as Draper's return goes into the net.

It is a tight tussle in this latest service game, with the momentum swinging one way then another. A clinical forehand takes Draper to 40-30 and then he seals the game with a terrific backhand cross court.

Draper puts some pressure on the Ruud serve and a double fault from the Norwegian gives the Briton a break point at 30-40 up. Ruud makes it back-to-back double faults and Draper secures a crucial early break. Advantage Draper.

It's been a strong start from Draper, with several of those decisive forehand winners which have been such a feature of this campaign. Ruud, by contrast, has just handed over the cheapest of breaks with that double double-fault. He looks to be overplaying a little, which has been another theme of the whole fortnight. Players feel they have to do something special to get past Draper's defences.

Brazilian Ronaldo is in the house, sat alongside Atletico Madrid striker Alexander Sorloth, who will be cheering on his fellow Norwegian Ruud.

On Draper's first serve of the match, we have a decent-length rally, which Draper wins. Draper goes long and it is 15-15. The Briton has already gone long on a number of occasions so far today.

Draper though wins the next three points and takes his first game of the match. 1-1 as both men hold serve.

The first point of the match goes Ruud's way as Draper goes long. Draper then goes long again, giving Ruud a 30-0 lead. The Norwegian moves to 40-0 but Draper keeps his hopes in this game alive with a terrific forehand down the line. Ruud then hits into the net and he will be a little nervous now serving at 40-30 when he was 40-0 up at one stage.

But the Norwegian sees it out and holds serve to take the first game of the match.

We are under way, with Ruud serving first in the Madrid sunshine. Who will win the Madrid Open? Draper or Ruud?

It goes Draper's way and he opts to receive first.

Here come the players! First it is Ruud welcomed onto the court followed by Draper. Both players receive a warm reception, in particular Draper.

Time for some warm ups.

“It is his [Jack Draper's] biggest test yet. I just think [Casper] Ruud is a top-calibre clay-court player. He will be studying Jack's semi-final with [Lorenzo] Musetti and looking at the way he made that second set really hard for Jack.

“If Jack comes through against Ruud it will be an unbelievable win. He can do it but it is going to be tough.”

“It is going to be a wonderful final because you have got Casper Ruud, who has been in two French Open finals and a US Open final and starting to find his form again and playing some fabulous tennis on the way to the final.

“It has been breathtaking watching Jack [Draper] play. We feel like we have been watching this guy just rise through the ranks and we know he is going to be number five on Monday but it is just the manner in which he has played his tennis with this high-level of consistency and everything that backs up that big serve, big forehand and what he brings to the court.

“They have never met each other before and Ruud has never won a Masters title. Jack has won one already this year and he is going to try and go for a big title on clay that has been won by so many great champions. It has got all the ingredients for a wonderful final.”

Jack Draper is aiming to win his second ATP title of the year as he takes on Norway's Casper Ruud in the Madrid Open final. Draper, who is now into the world's top five ahead of Novak Djokovic, beat Italian Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in the semi-finals to reach his third ATP final of the year. This is the first time that he has reached the final of a clay-court event and is the first Englishman to reach the final of this event and the second Briton after Sir Andy Murray, who won this tournament twice. Back in March, Draper was triumphant at Indian Wells and he has yet to drop a set in Madrid. Speaking after his semi-final victory over Musetti, Draper acknowledged the challenge facing him in the final against a player like Ruud but is feeling confident.

“Casper is a two-time Roland Garros finalist and very accustomed to the clay,” Draper said. “He is always tough to beat so it will be a challenge for me but I am ready for it. I feel confident to give it my all and physically good. I came through some five-setters at the Australian Open earlier in the year when not at my best and that has stayed in my memory.”

Meanwhile Ruud booked his place in the final after beating Argentinian Francisco Cerundolo 6-4, 7-5. The world number 15 struggled with a rib injury throughout his semi-final but came through to reach his 18th final on clay. Speaking after beating Cerundolo, Ruud, who has won 11 titles on clay, admitted he was unsure he would finish the match.

“I was not sure I was going to be able to finish the match, honestly. I felt something in my rib during the warm-up, just towards the end before going out [on court],” Ruud said. “I felt it in nearly every shot, especially the serve. Luckily, I got some quick treatment on it. There is not too much you can do, you only have three minutes [with the physio]. So I will go and check it out more now.”

This is the first meeting between these two professionally so who will come out on top and win the Madrid Open? The final is set to get under way at 5.30pm BST.

Venus Williams, one of the biggest names in the history of tennis, will be part of TNT Sports' upcoming French Open coverage.

The 2025 French Open will be the first in a 10-year deal with TNT Sports. Naturally, who will cover the event has been a talking point. A list of stars have already been announced (Andre Agassi and John McEnroe) or discussed (Jim Courier, Linsdsay Davenport) as possible names. An add that ran on TNT after Game 7 of the NBA Playoffs series between the Denver Nuggets and Los Angeles Clippers included those names, and more.

In addition to Agassi, McEnroe, Courier and Davenport, TNT's French Open broadcast team will feature Chris Evert, Sloane Stephens, Caroline Wozniacki and Williams.

Novak Djokovic's Shocking Move Sparks Speculation About His Future

Serbian tennis superstar Novak Djokovic has sent shockwaves through the tennis world by opting to skip the Rome Masters 1000, fueling intense speculation about his upcoming plans, including his potential absence at Roland Garros. With disappointing performances in Monte Carlo and Madrid, coupled with his decision to forgo Rome, questions loom over Djokovic's current form and his chances at the French Open.

Known for his dominance on the court, Djokovic has faced challenges on the red clay, a surface known to test even the best players. His recent slump in form has raised concerns, especially considering his knee injury at last year's Paris tournament. As whispers circulate about the possibility of him skipping the French Open, rumors suggest he might be eyeing a strategic focus on the upcoming Wimbledon Championships.

At 37 years old, Djokovic is at a pivotal moment in his illustrious career, contemplating his next moves as he aims to secure more Grand Slam titles before retiring. Drawing parallels to tennis greats Ivan Lendl and Roger Federer, Djokovic could be considering a similar strategy to optimize his chances at Wimbledon, a tournament where he has previously excelled despite setbacks.

Lendl's decision to skip Roland Garros in 1990 in favor of Wimbledon ended in disappointment, while Federer's strategic choice in 2017 led to a triumphant victory at the prestigious event. As Djokovic weighs his options, the tennis world eagerly awaits his announcement regarding his participation in the upcoming tournaments.

With Djokovic's future plans shrouded in uncertainty, fans and analysts alike are on the edge of their seats, anticipating the next chapter in the career of one of tennis's most legendary players.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Former world No.1 Naomi Osaka wins first title since becoming a mother","https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/former-world-no-1-naomi-191057595.html","Sun, 04 May 2025 19:10:57 GMT","

Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka has won her first title since returning to action from a maternity break.

Having not lifted silverware since triumphing at the 2021 Australian Open, she beat Slovenia's Kaja Juvan 6-1, 7-5 in the final of the L'Open 35 de Saint-Malo to bring home her first WTA title in four years, and her first ever on clay.

A former world number one, the 27-year-old Japanese star became a mother in July 2023.

“Kinda ironic to win my first trophy back on the surface that I thought was my worst,” Osaka posted on X. That's one of my favourite things about life though, there's always room to grow and evolve.”

Her victory comes after she lashed out at fans on social media, posting a job application form for those who “constantly had sh** to say” after booking her spot in the Saint Malo final.

Osaka has struggled with her lack of power and accuracy as she failed to progress beyond the second round of any Grand Slam last year.

The former world number one, who reached the third round of the Australian Open in January before retiring due to injury, is set to feature in the main draw of the French Open later this month.

Three-time Grand Slam finalist and former world No. 2 Casper Ruud won the biggest title of his career on Sunday, charging past Jack Draper 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in the Mutua Madrid Open final.The victory marks Ruud's first ATP Masters 1000 title—making him the first Norwegian player to ever win at this level—and his first since last year's Geneva victory.“It's been a long time coming, and it's one really big goal that I dreamed about since I was young,” Ruud said of his first 1000 trophy. “It's an incredible feeling to accomplish it, and also the way I did it today. It was a great match.“I knew Jack had been playing unbelievable all year and also at this tournament. I knew that if I don't bring my A, A, A+ game I'm going to be whipped around the court. But luckily I played really well…“This is a really good boost for me, I hope I can keep it going.”

He's only extended his dominance on the surface with his win over Draper: 12 of his 13 career titles have now come on clay.As a result, the two-time Roland Garros finalist is set to return to the ATP's Top 10 rankings come Monday as world No. 7.

STRATEGY GUIDE: What are the tactical options for the Miami Grand Prix?

There was a fresh take on the Formula 1 drivers' parade ahead of the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday, with all 20 F1 drivers having the chance to get behind the wheel of fully drivable LEGO big build cars, rather than touring on the usual truck.

Each team had a bespoke car in their own colours and liveries, in which the drivers lapped the 5.4km track while waving to fans ahead of the race.

READ MORE: Formula 1 and the LEGO Group ramp up the fun with exciting at-race experiences for 2025

The incredible vehicles are based on the LEGO F1 Speed Champions range unveiled late last year and were designed to celebrate Formula 1 and the LEGO Group's ongoing, multi-year partnership.

The cars were created by a skilled team of 26 designers, engineers and LEGO builders, over 22,000 hours, in the LEGO Group's Kladno factory, located in the Czech Republic. This special event in Miami was the first of many memorable moments for families at races this year.

At a near 1:1 in scale with Formula 1 cars, each big build is made of nearly 400,000 LEGO bricks, weighing 1,000kg and is capable of reaching speeds of 20kph – all while capturing the intricate and unique details of an F1 car, including everything from sponsor logos to authentic Pirelli tyres.

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at Formula 1, said: “As a sport synonymous with innovation and pushing boundaries, it was amazing to see another first for our sport as the big builds made their way around the track in the hands of the best drivers in the world. Our partnership with the LEGO Group enables us to inject a lot of fun into the Grand Prix experience and engage new audiences, and we can't wait to see what else we can dream up together.”

Julia Goldin, Chief Product & Marketing Officer of the LEGO Group, added: ""At the LEGO Group, we are constantly striving to push the boundaries of what is possible. This latest challenge is a true testament to that, marking an extraordinary collaboration between the LEGO Group, Formula 1 and its 10 teams.

""We know that drivable big builds have an unparalleled ability to evoke excitement amongst fans and are delighted to see the reaction unveiling 10 at the same time has brought. We hope these unique creations reinforce that with imagination and a LEGO brick in-hand; creativity has limitless possibilities.”

Following the conclusion of the Miami event, all 10 LEGO big builds are now embarking on a global tour with appearances at future races. For more information, fans can visit LEGO.com/F1.

""Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,"" a spokesperson for the singer said.

Lady Gaga is speaking out after police arrested two people in connection with an alleged plot to bomb her free concert in Brazil on Saturday.


	“We learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning,” a spokesperson for the singer shared in a statement with The Hollywood Reporter. “Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks. Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.”

	Following Lady Gaga's biggest show of her career, drawing more than 2 million people to Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, police in Brazil said they worked with the Justice Ministry on an operation to stop an alleged attack planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community.


	According to authorities, the group sought to radicalize and recruit teens to carry out attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives. “The plan was treated as a ‘collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,” police said.


	After police raided the locations of 15 suspects across several states in Brazil and confiscated phones and other electronic devices, the alleged group's leader was arrested on illegal weapons possession charges, as well as a teen on child pornography charges.


	On Sunday, after the concert, Lady Gaga took to her Instagram to praise her fans, also known as “Little Monsters,” for the unforgettable night.


	“Nothing could prepare me for the feeling I had during last night's show — the absolute pride and joy I felt singing for the people of Brazil,” she wrote in part. “The sight of the crowd during my opening songs took my breath away. Your heart shines so bright, your culture is so vibrant and special, I hope you know how grateful I am to have shared this historical moment with you.”

The Oscars is held at the Dolby Theatre on Hollywood Blvd., which is right along the marathon route.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	The Oscars made the announcement on Monday, March 17: Comedian Conan O'Brien, who had earned top marks for hosting the 2025 Oscars, would be returning as host of the 2026 Oscars on Sunday, March 15, 2026.


	Most of us focused on the host announcement, which was made far earlier in the year than is typical, but Murphy Reinschreiber, COO of the McCourt Foundation, which operates the L.A. Marathon, immediately zeroed in the date, which was the same as the already-announced date of the 2026 L.A. Marathon, which is typically held on the third Sunday in March.

	











	The McCourt Foundation had announced its 2026 marathon date on March 15, one day before the 2025 marathon and two days before the Oscars made their announcement.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Reinschreiber was driving home after finishing work on this year's marathon when he learned of the double booking.


	“It was confusing and the other thought that went to my mind is there are just no days off in this business,” he told The Los Angeles Times. “It's one thing after the other.”


	It would be virtually impossible to have both megaevents on the same date. The Oscars is held at the Dolby Theatre on Hollywood Blvd., which is right along the marathon route. Both events require significant road closures and law enforcement deployment.


	After six weeks of uncertainty, a solution was finally reached on Thursday (May 1): The 98th Oscars will be held as originally scheduled. The McCourt Foundation will announce a new March date for the race in the coming days.


	Both parties also agreed that, to avoid future date conflicts, the L.A. Marathon will take place on the third Sunday in March (on which it has often but not always been held in recent years), and the Oscars will steer clear of that date. (Though the Oscars are often right around this date, this was the first time the Oscars landed on the third Sunday in March since 1999.)


	Moving a marathon is no easy feat. The event spans a large chunk of the city and involves more than 25,000 runners, thousands of volunteers, medical personnel, law enforcement and city workers.


	“The number of people, communities and businesses that are all impacted by a change of date is mind-boggling,” Reinschreiber told the L.A. Times. “We are going to have to undergo a significant community awareness program.”

	











	More than 5,000 people have registered for the 2026 Marathon, and they will need to be offered the option of a refund due to the change in date, he said.


	Who in city government wasn't on top of things and allowed two megaevents to be scheduled for the same date? No one is saying.


	With this conflict resolved, it's official: The 2026 Oscars will air live on ABC on Sunday, March 15 at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT. It's the third year in a row that the telecast will start at 4 p.m. on the West Coast — in an effort to make it so that East Coast viewers can find out who wins the biggest awards before they go to bed. (This year's show ended at 10:50 p.m. ET, making that goal a reality for all but the earliest risers.)


	The show will again be held at the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Theater in Hollywood, its home base for every year but one since 2002. (The best-forgotten 2021 pandemic show was held at the Union Station in downtown L.A.)


Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan will return as the show's executive producers for the third consecutive year. They first served in that capacity in 2024, when Kimmel hosted. They each won Primetime Emmys for outstanding variety special (live) for that show. Kapoor had previously won for outstanding variety special (pre-recorded) for his work on Adele: One Night Only.


	Jeff Ross and Mike Sweeney will return as producers for a second time. Sweeney will also serve as a writer. Sweeney has won three Primetime Emmys for previous productions with O'Brien. Ross has won one.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


SUNDAY UPDATE: Coming in a touch lower than where we saw it heading yesterday, Marvel Studios/Disney's Thunderbolts* has opened to $162.1M globally, including $86.1M from the international box office. The worldwide bow is within the pre-weekend projected opening range. 


	Overseas, the Florence Pugh-starrer launched at No. 1 or No. 1 non-local in nearly all major markets as well as most smaller markets. The international debut is estimated to be 45% ahead of Shang-Chi, 13% above Ant-Man and 7% over Guardians of the Galaxy in like-for-like markets at current rates (excluding China).

	The film played best in Latin America and smaller Asian markets, while Europe was a bit mixed. Although overall Saturday bumps didn't pan out as hoped, parts of Europe saw some of the biggest Friday-Saturday increases which reflects the impact of changing weather. Similar to the U.S., reviews and social sentiment internationally are generally strong, and Thunderbolts* has runway before the next major wide opener.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Before we dig into further detail, a note about the other top players: Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie currently stands at $873.4M global after an international weekend of $26.6M (-33%). The overseas total is $475.2M. Also from WB, Sinners had an impressive -27% hold in its third offshore frame. The international cume to date is $57M for $236.7M worldwide.


	Back to Thunderbolts*. It released day-and-date globally, and, as previously noted, was not expected to do mega business in China and Korea (see below). China nevertheless is the top opening market (it started on a non-traditional Wednesday) with $10.4M through Sunday.


	After that, the UK, which had super summer weather heading into the weekend, grossed $7.7M. 


	In Latin America, Thunderbolts* opened at No. 1 in every market and had the 2nd highest debut of 2025 across the region, Brazil (including previews) and Mexico (including previews) as well as Central America, Chile and Paraguay. The regional opening weekend was ahead of Ant-Man, Shang-Chi, Eternals and Captain America: Brave New World.


	Across Europe, Thunderbolts* opened at No. 1 in all markets except for Finland and Sweden which were behind the continued play of Minecraft.


Thunderbolts* had the 2nd highest opening of 2025 in the Middle East and 3rd highest opening of 2025 in France and Spain as well as Iceland, Portugal and South Africa.

	











	Across Asia-Pacific, Thunderbolts* was No. 1 non-local in all markets except for Japan where it was the No. 2 studio title. It scored the 2nd highest studio opening of 2025 in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand; and the best non-local opening of 2025 in Hong Kong, India, Malaysia and Singapore.


	The Top 10 starts were: China ($10.4M), UK ($7.7M), Mexico ($7.3M), Brazil ($4M), France ($3.8M), Germany ($3.6M), Korea ($3.5M), Australia ($3.4M), Japan ($3.2M) and Spain ($2.8M).


A Minecraft Movie, meanwhile, continues to climb, with an overseas drop of just 33%, propelled by increases in China (+38%), Chile (+8%), Brazil (+7%), Japan (+5%) and Argentina (+2%). Other notable holds include Norway (-15%), Spain (-16%), Denmark (-19%), Mexico (-21%), Peru (-23%), Colombia (-24%), Poland (-25%), Holland (-32%), Korea (-33%), and Germany (-45%).


	In the Nordics, the film has become the all-time biggest video game adaptation topping The Super Mario Bros. Movie by 14%. Note that the original game hails from Sweden. The $475.2M international running total has surpassed the lifetime offshore grosses of fellow WB titles The Dark Knight, Wonka, Wonder Woman, The Batman and Dune: Part Two.


	The Top 5 so far are the UK ($69M), Germany ($35.7M), Australia ($33.5M), Mexico ($31.2M) and China ($27.5M). 


	As for Ryan Coogler's Sinners, another $10.4M from 71 overseas markets included exceptional holds in Latin America (-9%) and Europe (-27%), with individual market highlights in Saudi Arabia (+29%), Brazil (+8%), Sweden (-3%), Holland (-5%), Belgium (-10%), Spain (-12%), Germany (-14%), Denmark (-15%), Mexico (-17%), Argentina (-22%), Australia (-23%), UAE (-28%), UK (-31%), and France (-34%). 


	In like-for-like markets and using today's exchange rates, the film is tracking 110% over Speak No Evil, 75% higher than Nope, 49% ahead of Get Out, 27% above Us and 20% over Creed.


	The Top 5 to date are the UK ($13.8M), France ($6.7M), Australia ($4.3M), Mexico ($3.4M) and Germany ($2.7M).


	Rounding out the WB triumverate, The Accountant 2 (an Amazon MGM Studios title that WB handles overseas), the Ben Affleck sequel tallied up another $7.2M in 72 international markets in the sophomore frame (-43%). The offshore running cume now stands at $24.6M and the worldwide total is $65.7M through Sunday.


MISC UPDATED CUMES/NOTABLEUntil Dawn (SNY): $6.4M intl weekend (60 markets); $20.4M intl cume/$34.7M globalThe Amateur (DIS): $2.3M intl weekend (52 markets); $50.8M intl cume/$87.7M globalBlack Bag (UNI): $754K intl weekend (63 markets); $17.8M intl cume/$39.2M globalDrop (UNI): $585K intl weekend (74 markets); $11.3M intl cume/$27.7M globalDog Man (UNI): $482K intl weekend (68 markets); $46.1M intl cume/$144.1M global


PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: Marvel Studios/Disney's Thunderbolts* kicked off international box office play on Wednesday, and through Friday has an estimated overseas cume of $47.2M from 52 material markets. The day-and-date global rollout is rolling up to a projected $165M+ through Sunday. This is in line with the pre-weekend estimated range.


	As Anthony has noted, the domestic bow now has as a shot at coming in at $73M-$77M.


	Overseas, the ragtag bunch of antiheroes is, as a whole, playing best in Latin America, and also scoring in the UK and Asia with projected No. 1s  everywhere (outside of Korea and China, which was expected – more on that below).

	











	Note that May 1st was a holiday in many markets – though the UK will take the day off on Monday — while weather in Europe is also a factor. 


	The well-reviewed Florence Pugh-starrer is hoping to see walk-up business on Saturday and Sunday and thus should finish the weekend within the range we wrote about earlier this week. 


	The Top 5 markets through Friday are China ($7.1M), Mexico ($4.2M), UK ($3.1M), Brazil ($2.2M) and France ($2.1M).


	As expected, we're not seeing big action in China with the Jake Schreier-directed first installment MCU movie having opened on a non-traditional Wednesday and playing into a competitive frame with lots of new local titles. Through Saturday, the estimated China cume is about $9M (note that today's numbers are not included in the running total above).


	We'll have a full update tomorrow.

	Following the Season 3 finale of The White Lotus, Natasha Rothwell is shutting down critics of Belinda's “good for her” moment.


	The 2x Emmy nominee defended the character's choice to leave Thailand after successfully blackmailing Greg (Jon Gries) to stay quiet about him likely killing his late wife Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge), reasoning that it doesn't mean Belinda has an evil streak. 


	“I don't think so,” she told People. “I think her heart is good, but I do think that she was flirting with being a baddie by taking this money. So I don't think she'll turn bad, but I do think there's maybe a consequence by all those decisions have, sort of that yin and yang.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Rothwell thinks Belinda could suffer consequences in a future season “as a result of the decision she made,” adding: “Who knows? I don't even know if she's coming back. But in my mind I'm like, yeah, that probably would be the thing.”


	Meanwhile, Rothwell also defended Belinda for leaving town without Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul), despite sparking a romance and discussing going into business together. Many likened the decision to Tanya changing her mind about investing in Belinda during a heartbreaking Season 1 finale scene.


	“People tell me to my face, they're just like, ‘Oh, you should have taken Pornchai with you,'” said Rothwell. “And I'm like, ‘No ma'am, no sir. She does not owe a man anything. She has de-centered men. She is centering herself.'”

“SNL 50” is nearing the end, with only two more episodes to go this season, but that doesn't mean it's time to turn things down quite yet. For her second round hosting at Studio 8H, Quinta Brunson pumped up the volume, kicking off the show with a musical monologue that featured both pop star Sabrina Carpenter and basketball phenom Dwayne Wade, then filling out each sketch with energy and dynamism. Not everything landed perfectly, with the writing of many of the live bits feeling like the staff are just going through the motions, but Brunson's ability to commit to each role and work seamlessly off the cast more than made up for it.

It's been a while since a “Saturday Night Live” monologue really stood out, particularly this season with so many return hosts effecting a been-there-done-that attitude, but between Jack Black's crowd work in his episode last month and Brunson's showstopping number topping this one, it's nice to see this section of the show milked for all it's worth. Brunson's singing may not be quite on par with Carpenter, but her enthusiasm and stage presence brought the whole piece together.

Having kicked off her career doing BuzzFeed videos and “A Black Lady Sketch Show,” it's clear that Brunson's comedy skills are best suited to the pre-taped format (though her talent for live work should not go unrecognized). One of the best pre-taped moments of last night (and all season) saw Brunson adopt an older look alongside the show's longest cast member, Kenan Thompson. Together they play an aging couple informing their children of their new side hustle, which is basically a version of OnlyFans, but just for senior citizens. Considering Brunson has mostly had to keep it clean on “Abbott Elementary,” seeing her go so blue with her comedy and have so much fun doing it was a delight.

Another pre-taped moment that garnered a good amount of chuckles was a faux-ad for a new clothing brand named “Forever 31” (as opposed to the real life Forever 21). With most of the cast shifting into their early 30s, it was the perfect opportunity to highlight the alterations that occur to ones presentation/styling when moving on from their raucous 20s. The looks on display were all too familiar, making the joke even that much funnier for its sense of radical honesty.

 










We love a pair of “SNL” besties and Sarah Sherman and Bowen Yang might just top the list. Though they don't always end up in a sketch together, they are more often than not seen embracing during the goodnights of every show. When they do get to play off one another, as they did last night during Weekend Update, it's typically always a sight to behold. Playing two skeezy suburbanites likely from New Jersey or Long Island, Sherman and Yang worked off one another like a finely tuned orchestra, heaping praise upon the chain restaurant Applebees and bemoaning its recent bankruptcy. Come for the shared filled fishbowl drink and questionable pigtails and stache, stay for unavoidable kissing the two end up getting into.

“Saturday Night Live” returns May 11 with host Walton Goggins and musical guest Arcade Fire.

Going into the fourth season of “The Righteous Gemstones,” costume designer Christina Flannery didn't know that this year was going to be the show's swan song  — or perhaps more accurately, after Episode 8, its gator song. Series creator and star Danny McBride kept that information close to the chest during the prep process, but Flannery told IndieWire that knowing whether or not there would be more “Gemstones” hardly mattered. 

By the time the show had gotten to the civil war prelude that opens Season 4, to say nothing of the troubled production process of “Teenjus” and Eli's (John Goodman) equally troubled retirement, there was no bucket list left for the costume design team. The challenge and the joy of designing for “The Righteous Gemstones” is that it has been maximalist from the very start. Finding new degrees of colorful suits, flowing capes, and animal print jumpsuits supported the show's tone from the beginning, but has increasingly become part of the HBO series's comedy in its own right.

Flannery, who picked up the costume designer baton from Sarah Trost in Season 3, credits a collaborative openness, as much as the continually varied and hilarious scenarios provided by the writers, with helping her and her team find “The Righteous Gemstones” fits that, well, fit. By focusing on the performers — what might be fun for them or give them comedy tools to play with — the costume department never gets lost in a sea of ruffled collars and furry suits. But they also know that absolutely everything, clothes-wise, is on the table to try. 

That balance has helped Flannery find a nuance in showing the ridiculous ego, say, of Kelvin's (Adam Devine) sequined suit, while also using those silver sparkles to set off his coming out speech at the Top Christ Following Man of the Year competition. Flannery sat with IndieWire to unpack, or perhaps to finally pack away, the best of “The Righteous Gemstones” Sunday Best. 

This interview has been edited for clarity and length. 

IndieWire: Was there anything left on your bucket list for the show, going into this last season? How do you think about capping the work on a comedy that's this vibrant and big? 
 










Flannery: I didn't know it was the last season because Danny didn't tell anybody. It's always been this mysterious thing that's going on with “Gemstones,” and we just never know anything. But because of Season 3 and how much Danny let me push it, I said, “Fuck it, let's push it even more,” you know? 

Danny is just always throwing shit at me and Richard [A. Webb, the production designer]. When I got the script for the Civil War episode, I was like, ‘I thought you said that it was going to be chiller this season?!'” But everything I want to do, I'm allowed to do, and I have the money and the support to do it, and the crew. So, [we] shoot for the stars. 

With that Civil War episode, for instance, as a costume designer, I really, really love filthy stuff. There's this film, “All Quiet on the Western Front,” and I feel like that was one of the references I used to make sure we went filthy. These people are wearing the same clothes forever. So we just had a station posted up and we were slathering all of us, everybody was filthy themselves from covering [all the actors] head to toe with dirt. 

And Bradley [Cooper], he's a badass. He very much wanted to push it and go super filthy as well.  

You do push it, whatever direction that means, and with the contemporary clothes, too. Knowing the characters as well as you do now, how does that help you accentuate what's going on with them through their clothing? 
 










You take whatever the storyline is. For example, with Baby Billy [Walton Goggins], he had an interesting storyline that was different from last season, and every season before, really. I feel like he's changed a little bit. So with him specifically becoming a director and all that, I wanted to lean into the gross porn star from the ‘70s for his vibe. And the work is just continuing to push that.

Like, especially with Judy [Edi Patterson], you're always checking in [to find] that stunted element in her. She has an outfit this season that looks like if “Pretty Pretty Princess” met that Versace J-Lo dress. She's trying to be sexy, but she can't pull it off.

All the Gemstones' senses of grandeur are stunning and don't quite match up to what's happening. That's a great way to think about their fashion. 

We're just trying to stay in that world, but then follow the storylines as they go. Like, with BJ [Tim Baltz], his storyline in Season 4 is so different, and how do we make that work? Everybody's stylized, but how do we strip him down because he's in a wheelchair now? That was one of the more complicated challenges of the season was this question of how do we come back a bit? How do we bring him down a little bit? That's kind of how we think about it. 

 










You know, spending so much time developing even more of these weird, special builds that kind of set us apart from most shows that I see — I haven't seen a lot of this stuff done. 

Certainly not on a comedy budget. 

Of course, there are going to be shows that are going to be, like, “Holy shit, this lady is way too far.” But my hope is that people will see my work and [be more open] to bring weird shit to the table that you normally wouldn't be able to. 

Just learning how to manage doing it all at the same time, and jumping from the Civil War, which is insane, to the telethon, which is also insane, and doing 500 million costumes on top of that, you know, jumping all over at the same time really sets you up for success. I'm coming into my next show, and I don't think I'm ever going to come across a show that was as challenging and over-the-top as “Gemstones.” So my hope is that it's given me a lot of growth as a designer, and I'm a little bit more confident with myself. 

Like, Danny allowing me to blow it up and go crazy this season, it all just depends on what we're doing. But something that was really important to me  — I am queer myself and just seeing, finally, Keefe (Tony Cavalero) and Kelvin actually doing something that's so amazing. I [thought about] Siegfried and Roy, leaning into that crazy shit, but also closing the chapter on them. When we started early on, it was really important to figure out what they were going to wear and how to make that story such a powerful, amazing thing. 

 










I think all of us in the show, and honestly, viewers as well, we're like, “Finally, man!” We have waited so long for these two to be out and to have this thing called Prism, where we got to do ridiculous costumes and so much stuff that you don't even see behind the scenes. You see bits and pieces, but there's so much that goes into this show, and we're just very lucky that you get one snippet of it. But it takes days and days of fittings and tons and tons of shopping and just a ton of effort to get those little pops [from the background]. 

But that's how it is working in film, you know? You never know what's going to actually make it on the screen, but you have to create a whole world. 

“The Righteous Gemstones” season finale airs May 4 on Max.

	The Trump White House shared a graphic image of Trump, veiny biceps and other inhuman muscles bulging, holding a red light saber in celebration of May the Fourth — an informal Star Wars holiday and pun on “May the Force be with you.” Meanwhile, the administration's chief Border Patrol agent posted a video depicting the agency as Darth Vader killing rebel soldiers. The administration, apparently, doesn't mind that these depictions seem to align them with the antagonists of the film franchise.

Happy May the 4th to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting so hard to to bring Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members, back into our Galaxy. You're not the Rebellion—you're the Empire.May the 4th be with you. pic.twitter.com/G883DhDRR5


	“Happy May the 4th to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting so hard to to bring Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members, back into our Galaxy,” the White House posted on social media alongside the likely AI-generated image. “You're not the Rebellion—you're the Empire. May the 4th be with you.”


	Trump, who has promised to deport millions of immigrants, has deported thousands since taking office (139,000 according to the White House), including sending hundreds of men he claims are gang members to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador without due process.

	











	Keen Star Wars fans quickly pointed out that Trump's red light saber suggests he is a member of the Empire led by the Sith, bad guys in the films who practice the dark side of the Force. The Jedis are the heroes in the Rebellion who use the Force, an energy source that permeates and connects everything in the universe, for good — including to fight against the evil Empire.

	“Embarrassing Stalinist level propaganda from Trump's White House,” Retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman posted on X (formerly Twitter). “This would work better if the AI represented Trump as Jaba the Hut.”


	A U.S. Border Patrol video, titled “Border Wars” and posted Sunday by Chief Patrol Agent Gregory K. Bovino, took a clip from Star Wars spinoff Rogue One where Darth Vader massacres rebel forces. Border Patrol labeled Vader as “Premier Sector,” referring to the agency's El Centro Sector, which covers much of the southern border with Mexico.

	The clip opens with Star Wars-style titles: “Episode one: Border Patrol strikes back. The Premier Sector, in pursuit of a ship occupied by threats to the United States, is intercepted on its way to the galaxy's most notorious sanctuary for lawlessness… Mos Eisley… AKA California…” (In the films, Mos Eisley is a spaceport on Tatooine where aliens of all kinds gather from around the galaxy.)

	











	The video then cuts to Border Patrol Vader wielding a red light saber to kill rebel forces that the video labeled as fentanyl, sanctuary cities, cocaine, human smugglers, invasion, and fake news.


	X users jumped on the post to inform Bovino that Border Patrol is identifying with the films' antagonists. One account responded to Bovino with a meme that asked “Are we the baddies?” 

I think ole Darth had the ultimate situational awareness against threats to the homeland.  So do we which is why our border is the most controlled now than ever before.


	Bovino replied, defending the artistic choices: “I think ole Darth had the ultimate situational awareness against threats to the homeland. So do we which is why our border is the most controlled now than ever before.”


	Another user asked, “Just for clarification, who were the bad guys in Star Wars?”


	“We've depicted who the bad guys were in this video,” Bovino replied. “Watch again as they are labeled as such. 😆 🤣. 🇺🇸 🇺🇲.”

Donald Trump tried to argue that prices on gas and groceries are falling even though the numbers disprove those claims. He also encouraged Americans to buy fewer dolls and pencils as a way to deal with rising costs due to his tariff policies.


	“Prices are down on groceries. Prices are down for oil. Prices are down for all energy. Prices are down at tremendous numbers for gasoline,” the president told moderator Kristen Welker during an interview that aired Sunday on Meet the Press.


	Trump then said that gas prices are “down to $1.98 in many states right now,” repeating a claim he made weeks ago and again at least three times in the past week, CNN found. But according to AAA, gas prices have increased since Trump was inaugurated in January.


	As of Sunday, the current average price for a gallon of regular gas is $3.17, and no state has an average gas price of $1.98. In fact, GasBuddy, a company that tracks gas prices at more than 150,000 gas stations nationwide, could find no gas station in the country selling gas at that price during the month of April, the company told CBS News. The lowest price they could locate last month was $2.19 per gallon at a Texas gas station.

	As for grocery prices, Trump claimed they are down when the Consumer Price Index shows the average cost of groceries rose 0.4 percent in March and 0.2 percent in February, the latest data available. While the White House has said that Trump is talking about prices of some goods, like fresh vegetables, that have recently decreased in price, the prices of other goods like eggs, meats, poultry, and fish all rose in March. 


	Prices are also likely to rise on all sorts of imported goods when Trump's broad tariffs go into effect, which has the president becoming an unlikely opponent of mass consumption as he struggles to defend the fallout of punishing tariffs. Trump last month announced a 90 day delay on tariffs except for tariffs on China, which are already in effect. He also claimed last week to have already finalized some 200 trade deals, but he has not released any details on which countries those deals are with. The number of alleged deals also exceeds the number of countries on earth recognized by the United Nations (193).

	Welker pointed out that because of the tariffs, “You said some dolls are going to cost more. Isn't that an acknowledgment that some prices will go up?”

	











	“I don't think that a beautiful baby girl needs — that's 11 years old — needs to have 30 dolls,” said Trump, whose children were raised in a gilded penthouse. “I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable. We had a trade deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars with China.”

Trump: ""I don't think a beautiful baby girl that's 11 years old needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls … they don't need to have 250 pencils. They can have five."" pic.twitter.com/H9nBN0Eh2q


	A trade deficit simply means that the U.S. imports more goods from China than it exports to China, which makes sense given the Asian nation's status as a manufacturing hub for many of the things we use every day — from toys and clothing to smartphones and other electronics. American labor is more costly, and American factories do not have the capacity to fill the gap. Still, Trump has slapped China with astronomical 145 percent tariffs, causing trade between them and the U.S. to effectively cease.


	“When you say, ‘They could have three dolls instead of 30 dolls,' are you saying… that Americans could see empty store shelves?” Welker asked.


	“No. No, I'm not saying that,” Trump replied. “I'm just saying they don't need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don't need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.”

	He added, “We don't have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don't need, for junk that we don't need.”


	Trump did, however, admit that keeping tariffs on China at current levels is untenable.


	“At some point, I'm going to lower them because otherwise, you could never do business with them,” he said. “And they want to do business very much. Look, their economy is really doing badly. Their economy is collapsing.”


	Even if Americans cut back on purchasing dolls and pencils, a bevy of other goods will see rising prices thanks to Trump's tariffs on China, including: iPhones, cars, clothing, shoes, wine and spirits, furniture, coffee, and chocolate. Product shortages are also likely, experts say. Already, import shipments to U.S. ports have declined.


	When Welker asked Trump about U.S. trade with Canada, Trump said, “We don't need their cars, we don't need their lumber, we don't need their energy. We don't need anything. We do very little business with Canada. They do all of their business practically with us. They need us. We don't need them.”


	But Canada is America's second largest trade partner and the top buyer of American exports, as Capitol hill correspondent Jamie Dupree pointed out. Trump additionally refused to back down on his idea to make Canada a U.S. state.

	One area where Trump is correct is that prices of oil are actually falling. But that is not a positive sign.


	“It's a measure of the expected use of energy in our economy,” Tucker Balch, an Emory University finance professor told ABC News. “It is because of Trump's policies but it's not an endorsement of his policies.”


	The economic outlook under Trump is, in fact, quite bleak, with a potential slowdown or recession on the horizon for the U.S. and likely the global economy as well. But Trump in the interview only took credit for the “good parts” of the economy and blamed former president Joe Biden for the “bad parts.”

Real-Time Hudson Valley News

Your chances of getting abducted by aliens are greater in New York than most of the nation.

According to the National UFO Reporting Center, there have been more reports of UFOs in New York State than in most of America.

According to the latest updated data, there have been 6,153 UFO sightings reported to the National UFO Reporting Center, that's fifth in the nation.

Only California, Florida, Washington and Texas have more reported sightings.

Years ago the Hudson Valley thought that aliens were attacking Dutchess Stadium. CLICK HERE or scroll through the photos below.

In related news, former New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers claims to have spotted a UFO while staying in the Hudson Valley. CLICK HERE for more.

According to the online gambling guide casino.ca, New York State is also one of the hotspots when it comes to alien abductions.

March 20 was National Alien Abduction Day (yes, this is a real day). In honor of that day, casino.ca looked into reports from the National UFO Reporting Center to determine the alien abduction hotspots.

Once again, New York State placed fifth. New Yorkers have a 1 in 1,301 chance of being abducted by aliens, making it the 5th best state for potential alien encounters.

California, Washington, Florida and Oregon topped the list.

If you want to live somewhere to avoid aliens, you should move to North Dakota.

""With just 282 reported sightings - about 0.0004 per capita - it has the fewest UFO encounters in the country,"" casino.ca states.

Follow:


            French police rescued the father of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur from his kidnappers Saturday night, but found he'd had one of his fingers severed – the latest in a spate of abductions tied to cryptocurrency.
    


            The victim, who has not been publicly identified, was forced into a van by four men wearing ski masks on a street of Paris Thursday morning. He was held hostage in an Airbnb 12 miles south of the French capital for two days before being rescued.
    


            The kidnappers contacted the victim's son, sending a video of the mutilated victim and demanding millions of euros in ransom money, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV.
    


            Five people between the ages of 23 and 27 were brought into police custody following the raid, according to the Paris Prosecutor's office.
    


            The kidnapping shares striking similarities with other recent kidnappings tied to crypto currency in France and surrounding countries.
    


            In January 2025, David Balland, cofounder of the crypto wallet company Ledger, was kidnapped with his wife from their home in central France.
    


            Before the couple was freed by police, the assailants cut off Balland's finger, sending a video of the severed appendage to his business partner Eric Larchevêque and demanding ransom money.
    


            In December 2024, the wife of crypto investor and influencer Stéphane Winkel was kidnapped from the couple's home in Belgium. She was rescued after her kidnapper crashed his car in a dramatic police chase, Winkel wrote in a post on X.
    


            It is unclear whether the recent spate of crypto kidnappings are connected or not.
    


            “Obviously there's at least a link in the modus operandi. Now, whether it's the same team or not is for the investigators to say.” said internal security expert Guillaume Farde speaking on French television Sunday.
    


            Police have opened an investigation into the latest kidnapping, including for extortion by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy, the Paris Prosecutor's office told CNN.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell during an Economic Club of Chicago event on April 16.

Fifteen minutes after the April employment report hit early Friday, President Donald Trump seized on the surprisingly strong job growth to ratchet up his pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying there was no reason to hold off on cutting interest rates. 

Bond traders came to the exact opposite conclusion.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Notably, in fusion 360 this would all be designed in ""plastics"" mode, and yet that mode is oblivious to whether the part is printed or moulded. I wonder if any CAD engine can do ""production-aware design"" that constrains design to the capabilities of standardized machines, e.g. keeping a metal part 3-d millable. I've seen strict design rule enforcement with PCBs, and I have seen sheet metal macros, but nothing for general mechanical CAD.

1. The majority of 3D modeling is not done parametrically, meaning there is not a lot of data. The little data there is is generally in OpenSCAD, which isn't very powerful or extensible for useful CAD.
2. Generally, when you want to do CAD, you need to come up with a way to define everything precisely. Like I want this hole 2 millimeters from the bottom, and this exact edge next to the hole to be beveled, etc. Saying all that to an LLM is slower than just making the whole.That said, these still can be useful for beginners, and there are things like Adam AI that are starting to catch on for simple stuff.

I've been playing with 3D printers for 7 years, and I even assembled mine at home during the pandemic. Some topics described here I already found out by practice and I think most people with experience in 3D printing also do that.But having everything studied, compiled and explained in that level is just, again, amazing! Not only that, but there are so many other topics covered here that I still have to learn.Great work, thank you!

Start with Tinkercad: https://www.tinkercad.com. It runs on the browser, it has some limitations, but it is really simple to use, just open and model whatever you want joining and extracting shapes and importing SVGs for extrusion.After that, if you know any programming language you'll find OpenSCAD easy to learn. I gave a course last year about it, the slides are available here: https://lucasoshiro.github.io/posts-en/2024-03-24-openscad/. They are in Portuguese, if someone shows interest I can translate them to English, but I think they are easy to follow even by non-speakers.

And I rather spend my limited free time creating stuff than to learn a new tool. Unless it is actually a more powerful one for the purpose that enables me to do things I can't now. But this doesn't seem to be the case.It's the same reason I use BambuLab printers. My hobby is making stuff, not tinkering with printers. They're just tools, a means to an end.Ps forgive me my defensive attitude but I often get people at the makerspace that take my choice of tools as a political statement. But I don't care. I just want to use what does the job for me.

The SNP's draconian anti-alcohol laws were blamed for Scots being unable to win tickets to a glamorous football tournament in the USA which is set to feature Lionel Messi. There is a ban on selling booze after 10pm and before 10am in Scotland, as well as minimum unit pricing setting costs at 65p a unit. 

World Cup sponsor Budweiser is currently running a contest in this country, offering best-in-the-house briefs to the Club World Cup 25 this summer. The tournament's teams include Real Madrid, Chelsea and Bayern Munich and sees games being played in California's iconic Pasadena Rose Bowl and the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida.

Superstar Lionel Messi of Inter Miami features on promotional material. But anyone from Scotland trying to enter the competition to win VIP tickets is now being told they are barred. A statement says: ”Unfortunately, owing to alcohol licensing and marketing laws in Scotland, you regrettably are not able to participate in this promotion.”

Under former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish Government have been waging a war on alcohol consumption and its promotion for more than a decade. The 50 milligrammes of alcohol in the blood laws makes Scotland's drink-drive limit the lowest in the UK.

The minimum unit of alcohol policy makes booze more expensive here than any part of Britain. And we are prevented from capitalising on ‘multi-buy' booze offers, available to other shoppers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

But last night, Holyrood officials insisted there is no legal obstacle to Budweiser running its football contest north of the border. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government said:”We are unable to comment on individual promotions. There are no restrictions in Scotland which directly restrict promotions involving competitions, although licence holders need to satisfy themselves that promotions do not breach any conditions of their licence.”

The ban could only be a foretaste of what's to come next year, when Bud becomes the official beer of the 2026 World Cup in America, Mexico and Canada. The firm will launch enticing promotions in the UK to win match tickets. Whether Scotland qualifies or not, it would seem members of the Tartan Army would be excluded once more.

Tartan Army veteran Andy Redmond has enjoyed watching Scotland in the United States, 13 years ago during a ‘friendly' with the USA in Jacksonville, Florida. The 77-year-old fan from Motherwell said:”It's a terrible way to discriminate against the Scots. Watching football in America is a brilliant experience, so it's a shame we cannot take part in this contest. I doubt many fans will choose to buy Budweiser if they're going to treat us in this way.”

Shadow business secretary Murdo Fraser said:“Football-loving Scots fans shouldn't be losing out due to the SNP's misguided policies. Perhaps this strong response from such a well-known brand will finally make SNP ministers think again about their lack of support for businesses, and their failed approach to tackling our relationship with alcohol.”

A spokesperson for the Budweiser Brewing Group said: ”Unfortunately, due to specific alcohol licensing laws that are unique to Scotland, we are not able to include Scottish residents in this type of promotion. This is different from other parts of the UK, where different legislation applies.”

Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United are on the verge of meeting in the Europa League final after both sides claimed a comfortable first-leg victory in their respective semi-finals.

Spurs defeated Norwegian outfit FK Bodø/Glimt 3-1 in London last week while the Red Devils escaped Spain with a 3-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao, making an all-Premier League final a real possibility.

It would be a high point for either club to win the competition, as they are both languishing near the bottom of the Premier League standings and have no hope of finishing in the top half.

Additionally, the winner of the Europa League crown earns a spot into next season's Champions League, a possibility that does not sit right with Emmanuel Petit.

The former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder slammed both Spurs and United for their mediocre domestic campaigns when speaking to FastSlots, stating that neither would be a worthy Champions League participant next season.

""Tottenham and Manchester United both have the chance to save terrible seasons in the Europa League, but does either side deserve to play in the Champions League next season? Absolutely not,"" Petit said.

""Both teams don't deserve to be among the Champions League teams for the next season. I wish the best of luck for Manchester United against Bilbao, but looking at the game against Lyon [in Leg 2 of the quarter-finals], Lyon should've finished United off.

""Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,"" the singer's rep said.


													By
												

	Associated Press



	Police in Brazil said on Sunday (May 4) that two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate explosives at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro.


	The Rio event on Saturday (May 3) was the biggest show of the pop star's career that attracted more than 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach and had crowds screaming and dancing along.


	Even as Brazilian authorities said they arrested suspects in the hours before Gaga's show, the event went ahead without disruption — leading some to question the seriousness of the threat. Serious security concerns typically lead organizers to cancel such massive events — as happened with Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna last year.

	











	Police said said nothing about the alleged plot at the time to in an effort to “avoid panic” and “the distortion of information.”


	On Sunday, a spokesperson for Gaga said the pop star and her team “learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning. Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks.”


	The statement added: “Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.”


	Security was tight at Saturday's concert, with 5,200 military and police officers deployed to the beach where fans were reveling in the pop singer's classic hits like “Born This Way,” which became something of an LGBTQ anthem after its 2011 release.


	Rio de Janeiro's state police and Brazil's Justice Ministry presented the bare outlines of a plot that they said involved a group that promoted hate speech against the LGBTQ+ community, among others, and had planned to detonate homemade explosive devices at the event.


	“The plan was treated as a ‘collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,” the police said. The group, it added, disseminated violent content to teenagers online as “a form of belonging.”


	Authorities arrested two people in connection with the alleged plot — a man described as the group's leader in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul on illegal weapons possession charges, and a teenager in Rio on child pornography charges. Police did not elaborate on their exact roles in the plot or on how the group came to target Gaga's free concert.

	











	“Those involved were recruiting participants, including teenagers, to carry out integrated attacks using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails,” police said.


	The Justice Ministry said that it determined the group posed a “risk to public order.” It said the group falsely presented themselves online as “Little Monsters” — Gaga's nickname for her fans — in order to reach teenagers and lure them into “networks with violent and self-destructive content.”


	The ministry said there was no impact on those attending the open-air concert.


	During a series of raids on the homes of 15 suspects across several Brazilian states, authorities confiscated phones and other electronic devices. Although police said they believed homemade bombs were intended for use in the planned attack, there was no mention of the raids turning up any weapons or explosive material.


	Gaga has expressed gratitude for the enormous crowd in an Instagram post that said nothing of the alleged plot.


	“Nothing could prepare me for the feeling I had during last night's show—the absolute pride and joy I felt singing for the people of Brazil,” she wrote. “The sight of the crowd during my opening songs took my breath away. Your heart shines so bright, your culture is so vibrant and special, I hope you know how grateful I am to have shared this historical moment with you.”


	Her free beach concert stood out at a time of surging ticket prices for live music around the world as concert-goers pay budget-busting costs to see their favorite artists.


	Rio has done this before — last May, superstar Madonna performed the finale to her latest world tower for some 1.6 million fans on the sprawling sands of Copacabana Beach.

					By Caroline Frost 

pmc-media-editor-2024


	The forthcoming conclave to select the new Pope has gained a whole new group of interested observers, following the success of Oscar-nominated film Conclave starring Ralph Fiennes.


	Based on the bestselling 2016 novel by Robert Harris, it details the process where cardinals (male, under the age of 80) from across the world gather in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel for a process to choose the next Pontiff, while the public wait outside for a decision. The news is then announced with a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney on the roof of the Chapel. The conclave to elect Pope Francis's successor will begin on Wednesday May 7.

	However, with all the secrecy, private discussions that occur in corridors outside the Chapel and reports of deal-making, Harris says the process is more akin to another screen hit – TV show The Traitors.




			Watch on Deadline		







The Traitors has been a huge hit for the BBC since debuting in the UK in 2022, with international versions now screening across the world. It sees “faithful” contestants tasked with trying to work out the “traitors” among them, before being “murdered” and eliminated from the game and a chance to share in the cash prize.


Harris told the BBC:


	“[It's] the nearest analogy I can come to. Suddenly everyone swings to one person – you can't see why, particularly, but it happens,”


	“And in a funny way, a similar dynamic does operate in a conclave, which is why often it produces a surprise.”


	Harris suggested that political parties electing a new leader could learn from the process:


	“To lock the door and say you're not going to come out until you've come up with a result concentrates the mind – and if you look back, the popes have been pretty good.


	“I didn't come away from researching the novel thinking this is a terrible idea [and that] I must write a novel to expose how awful it is. In a way, the novel shows a conclave working.”

“Summer House” star, Lexi Wood, cleared the air about her relationship with castmate West Wilson, after she was accused by Jesse Solomon of getting too close with him during a night out.

“West and I have never flirted — and we never will. We just have a strictly platonic relationship, and obviously he is friends with Jesse and they're so close. They were newbies together,” she told People on May 3.

The newest addition to season 9 continued, “So yeah, that would just never be a thing. So I was definitely like, ‘Wait, wait, what is going on right now?'”

Wood and Solomon hit it off right away upon seeing each other for the first time at the Hamptons house.

However, things took a turn when Wood learned that Solomon got his toes sucked by a girl while she was away from the house for a weekend.

Despite her disappointment, Wood told People, “I think I'm really lucky that my cast told me everything and that my friends were kind of there to give me a heads-up, whether it was a little late or not.”

She added, “So yeah, I think I'm really lucky in that case because if we were in the normal world, I probably wouldn't know certain things, like the toe [incident]. I wouldn't have known any of this.”

Although Solomon's brief romance with Wood didn't end well, he told Glamour in April, “Our relationship meant a lot to me, and I'm grateful for everything it taught me.”

He continued, “Sometimes connections shift, especially in a setting like this where everything is under a microscope and conversations are happening through a game of telephone.”

“As far as being called dishonest, I really do try to be transparent. I think there were just some miscommunications and heightened emotions, which is understandable given the environment,” Solomon said.

As for Wood, she told the publication, “Watching back, I wish there was more honesty because I would have made different decisions and choices.”

The model shared, “I wish that I was able to have more knowledge so I could have the autonomy to make those decisions, whereas having a lack of knowledge, I'm just going by what I'm seeing.”

Wood recalled, “On our first date, I was like, ‘I'm a relationship girl. I am not hooking up with anyone that I'm not in that exclusivity with. Again, to protect my physical health, mental health, emotional health. That's number one for me. If you're not there, that's totally fine.'”
