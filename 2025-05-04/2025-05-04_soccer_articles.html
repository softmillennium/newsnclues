Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United are on the verge of meeting in the Europa League final after both sides claimed a comfortable first-leg victory in their respective semi-finals.

Spurs defeated Norwegian outfit FK Bodø/Glimt 3-1 in London last week while the Red Devils escaped Spain with a 3-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao, making an all-Premier League final a real possibility.

It would be a high point for either club to win the competition, as they are both languishing near the bottom of the Premier League standings and have no hope of finishing in the top half.

Additionally, the winner of the Europa League crown earns a spot into next season's Champions League, a possibility that does not sit right with Emmanuel Petit.

The former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder slammed both Spurs and United for their mediocre domestic campaigns when speaking to FastSlots, stating that neither would be a worthy Champions League participant next season.

"Tottenham and Manchester United both have the chance to save terrible seasons in the Europa League, but does either side deserve to play in the Champions League next season? Absolutely not," Petit said.

"Both teams don't deserve to be among the Champions League teams for the next season. I wish the best of luck for Manchester United against Bilbao, but looking at the game against Lyon [in Leg 2 of the quarter-finals], Lyon should've finished United off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea are eyeing up a double summer transfer swoop for Liam Delap and Dean Huijsen - and the Blues could get both deals done in order for them to feature at the Club World Cup. The window will be open between Sunday, June 1, and Tuesday, June 10, due to an exceptional registration period for the expanded Club World Cup. All Premier League clubs will be free to do business during the earlier window, not just Chelsea and City. However, Chelsea could take advantage of the early window and get a couple of transfers over the line as they look to get prepared for the Club World Cup. According to The Mirror, the Blues are planning a fast start to their summer business, with Delap and Huijsen both identified as primary targets. Ipswich striker Delap, 22, who has a £30million relegation clause, and Bournemouth centre-back Huijsen, 20, who has a £50m buyout clause, are players Chelsea want to sign. As for Huijsen, he has excelled for Bournemouth since his move from Juventus last summer and won the Player of the Match after netting against Arsenal on Saturday. However, any move for Delap and Huijsen to ensure the duo can feature for Chelsea in the Club World Cup could spark a club-versus-country row. Both players are in line to play at the Under 21s European Championship in Slovakia for England and Spain respectively. But if Chelsea push ahead with swoops for Delap and Huijsen, their nations would be powerless should the Blues then include either of them in their Club World Cup squad in June. But football's lead governing body are encouraging Club World Cup participants to name their strongest possible squad, especially as there is a record £775million in prize money up for grabs. The tournament is set to start on Friday, June 13 and run for four weeks, with the final taking place on Sunday, July 13.

Arne Slot's side fell to just their third defeat of a glorious campaign as a much-changed line up looked well short of their best at Stamford Bridge

Liverpool were beaten 3-1 at Chelsea on Sunday in their first match since being crowned as Premier League champions.

Enzo Fernandez finished off a smart move to give the Blues the lead after three minutes, before a calamitous Jarell Quansah own goal made it two in the second half.

Virgil van Dijk's header gave the title-winners something to cling onto, but Cole Palmer's injury-time penalty sealed the deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In her speech, the two-time World Cup winner and Olympic gold medalist acknowledged the cost of success and apologized to her former teammates for being distant. “I wasn't there to make friends or follow the crowd. That drive often meant keeping people at a distance,” Lloyd said, donning her new red Hall of Fame blazer. I was intense and I truly believed that the only way for me to survive in such a cutthroat environment was to be that way. The 42-year-old, who was inducted in her first year of eligibility as part of the 2025 class, gave a 20-minute speech reflecting on her expansive career, sharing a vulnerable side rarely seen throughout her 17 years on the pitch. A post shared by National Soccer Hall Of Fame (@soccerhof) Most of you already know that about me. What I wanted to share wasn't from a perspective of a competitor, but as a person, a human being, and what I kept coming back to again and again was one simple question, was it all worth it?” Lloyd retired in 2021, ending her playing career with her hometown club, NJ/NY Gotham FC, in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She is considered one of the most impactful players in USWNT history. Soccer provided me with the tools to conquer anything that life throws my way.” She alluded to the controversial moments, both professional and personal: from the snubs that fueled her, to the trainer who drove a wedge between her family and her — a relationship that was later repaired. “Unlike during my playing career, I have been present. I have allowed myself to be vulnerable, emotional and fully engaged in every moment I get to spend with her. “Being her mom is my greatest joy, and thanks to everything I experienced in my career, I now have the tools to help her navigate this world.

Harvey is credited with inspiring the U.S. culture of giving back through sport. “Sport is one of society's great social inventions, and has so much to offer us all, and clearly, it has left an indelible positive imprint on my life and led me to a career path dedicated to the impact and purpose that I never expected,” Harvey said. “Part of that journey has been to be, and continue to be, an agent of change, make it better for those who come after you, which is what we said way back then.” Melanie Anzidei  is a Staff Writer for The Athletic covering soccer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada booked its ticket to the inaugural FIFA Futsal Women's World Cup in dramatic fashion by defeating Mexico in a penalty shootout Saturday to reach the final of CONCACAF W Futsal Championship. Futsal is a five-a-side indoor game played in two 20-minute halves. Like hockey, teams can make changes on the fly. The semifinal at the Domo Polideportivo in Guatemala City, Guatemala went to a shootout after finishing tied 4-4 following two five-minute periods of extra time. Trailing 4-3, Mexico tied the game with 1.8 seconds remaining on a goal by Rubi Gomez with its net empty. Joelle Gosselin, Esther Brossard, Jade Houmphanh and Cynthia Gaspar-Freire scored for Canada in the shootout. Goalkeeper Lea Palacio-Tellier stopped shots by Evelyn Gonzalez and Gomez before Gaspar-Freire roofed her penalty for a 4-3 Canada win. Sunday's final will see Canada face Panama, which downed Costa Rica 3-1 in the other semifinal. Canada, meanwhile, tied for the tournament's stingiest defence with just four goals allowed in pool play. Female futsal players have long campaigned for a FIFA championship. Defending champion Brazil has won six of the 10 tournaments to date, finishing runner-up once and third twice. Canada has not participated since being one of the 16 invited countries for the inaugural men's tournament, failing to advance out of the first round after losing to Argentina and Belgium before downing Japan. That 1989 futsal team included Paul Dolan, Pat Harrington, Nick De Santis, Eddy Berdusco, Lyndon Hooper and Alex Bunbury. Dolan was also a member of Canada's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad in Mexico.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The final, originally scheduled for May 20, will now be played on June 5, 2025. The decision comes in light of Pyramids FC's involvement in the CAF Champions League final, where they are going to face South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns in the first leg on May 24 in South Africa. The EFA opted to grant Pyramids more time to prepare, especially with their congested schedule in both domestic and continental competitions. Pyramids are also scheduled to play Petrojet on May 17 in the seventh round of the Nile Egyptian League title phase, which means it would be congesting to play the Egypt Cup final three days later then travel to South Africa and play on May 24. In contrast, Zamalek's schedule is not significantly affected by the original Cup final date. The White Knights are going to face Pyramids on May 13 in the sixth round of the title phase, followed by a match against Petrojet on May 24. One additional storyline impacted by the Cup final's new date involves Ahmed Mostafa “Zizo”, Zamalek's star player. Al Ahly must officially announce Zizo's signing after the end of the current season—following the Egypt Cup final on June 5. However, Al Ahly will depart for the United States on June 4 to participate in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. As a result, Zizo will not be able to travel with the squad and will instead have to join the team later, after the Cup final and the official join to Al Ahly.</p>

However, the coach denied accusations that the season is already over for Atlético Madrid, as he responded, “not for me, there are still four games left and something we've earned on our own merits competing with Barça and Madrid, which is the Club World Cup, no small feat for all this work over four years”. Speaking further on the tournament, which will be held in the United States starting in June, he added that, “it will be new and will generate real enthusiasm in all the teams who participate”. In the second half we went from less to more, around the 20th minute we had a better pace, more bravery in the duels, putting in more crosses, with people in the box, combining at more speed.... They had a chance from Kike, but Jan saved it. We were left with a draw in which neither of us were able to score.” “When we won the league it also happened to us in Almeria, with Levante... It doesn't mean that if you go to play with the bottom team you have to win. Just because they're at the bottom doesn't mean you're going to win. In Leganés, in the first half, there were three or four important situations, but the goalkeeper was very good and we even had a penalty. In Getafe we were 1-0 up with 10 minutes to go and we got ourselves into trouble. In Las Palmas, the goalkeeper made two incredible saves and in the second half they scored. Today, Alavés almost won it with that close call from Kike.” In Las Palmas the first half was very good and the second half was very bad. At the start there is a different tension, a different rhythm of intensity, everyone thinking about not making mistakes... In the second half, there are some imbalances, and that's why they tend to be more fun.” “Playing with one less would have been difficult.</p>

Perhaps this strong response from such a well-known brand will finally make SNP ministers think again about their lack of support for businesses, and their failed approach to tackling our relationship with alcohol.” A spokesperson for the Budweiser Brewing Group said: ”Unfortunately, due to specific alcohol licensing laws that are unique to Scotland, we are not able to include Scottish residents in this type of promotion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a professional soccer career that spanned 17 years for the U.S. Women's National Team, legendary forward Carli Lloyd was officially inducted into the national Soccer Hall of Fame at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas. “There was no greater honor than wearing the red, white and blue,” Lloyd said. The National Soccer Hall of Fame inducted a total of five members for the 2025 class: Mark Abbott, Chris Armas, Mary Harvey, Nick Rimando, and Lloyd. Although Lloyd contributed a wealth of time into her career with 316 caps and 134 international goals, the two-time FIFA Player of the Year (2016, 2017) set the tone with the all-time fastest hat trick in FIFA World Cup history. She's also the only player to score a hat trick in a FIFA World Cup Final. At the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Final against Japan, Lloyd scored her first goal in the third minute and went on to score a total of three in 17 minutes. Her third goal was most iconic as her long shot stemmed from 54 yards out and gave the USA a 3-0 lead. The USWNT went on to defeat their long-time opponents 5-2. Along with Lloyd's successful international career, she also played in two professional soccer leagues. Lloyd began her career in the Women's Professional Soccer league with the Chicago Red Stars, Sky Blue, and Atlanta Beat and she went on to play in the National Women's Soccer League with Western New York Flash, Houston Dash, and ended her career in her home state with Gotham FC. Following her retirement, Lloyd became a mom in October 2024 as she and her husband welcomed their daughter Harper Anne Hollins into the world.</p>
