                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A popular Plymouth clairvoyant who's been “guiding” locals for years has left some "absolutely gobsmacked”. I decided to give her a visit after speaking with her on the phone in December 2024 - as she spookily seemed to pick up on a few things about me then, even though we'd never met in person. Sam Hatch set up The Psychic Shop in Devonport about 30 years ago, but she told me she's been “reading people” for 40 years - and generations of Plymothians have visited her in that timeframe. I'd spoken to other people who were familiar with the clairvoyant - and even some sceptics said this woman's predictions were spot on. I've always found fortune telling possibilities intriguing - of course, I realise there is no actual scientific proof in this spiritual practice of prediction. However, the age-old profession of clairvoyance goes back hundreds of years and many people still flock to a fortune teller with a good reputation even in this day and age. Google reviews of Sam's predictions show that many customers are impressed. One recent reviewer said she was “absolutely gobsmacked”. Sam was “so accurate” the reviewer wrote, adding that she “cannot recommend her enough”. Another reviewer wrote: "I have met Sam twice, both times everything she predicted happened. I sat beside a wishing well while waiting for my reading, all coins put into the wishing well are collected for animal charities. A notice by the well reads: “Be careful what you wish for. Then I went into a separate room and met Sam for my reading. I sat opposite her, the table was covered with huge crystals, candles, incense and tarot cards. I was to make notes on a pad of A4 paper as she spoke, she spoke slowly and thoroughly so it was easy to write it all down. I was given initials of certain people with connections to weddings and other life events she predicted. It's all on a notepad so I can refer to this going forward, a few specific trips away to Spain and America were predicted - all noted so I'll wait to see. Readings are very personal, so I won't be divulging all, but one of the most interesting things Sam told me was right at the end of my reading. Crystal healing is also offered along with spell and tarot reading sessions - where you can learn how to “open up psychically” yourself, Sam also provides readings to people across the globe over the phone.</p>

Many residents say they have seen flying saucers or strange lights in the sky, with some asserting these sightings are a nearly daily occurrence. A mysterious hill in Thailand is drawing global attention after villagers claimed to have frequent encounters with unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Khao Kala, located just three hours north of Bangkok, has earned its reputation as a UFO hotspot due to persistent claims from locals. Many residents say they have seen flying saucers or strange lights in the sky, with some asserting these sightings are a nearly daily occurrence. According to a report by CNN, villagers believe that telepathic communication with aliens is possible, especially during meditation sessions in front of Buddha statues found on the hill. During his exploration, Price was guided by a local who passionately described frequent alien encounters. The area even features a UFO club, where like-minded believers gather to exchange stories and engage in group meditation. His footage captured twinkling lights moving oddly in the sky, something many believe to be evidence of alien activity. While sceptics may argue otherwise, Price left viewers to draw their own conclusions. ALSO READ: Eyeing Saturn's Moons While Other Kids Watch Tom and Jerry: Who Is Vandan Patel?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>May 3, 2025; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA; San Diego Padres right fielder Fernando Tatis Jr. (23) points to the fans after the Padres defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park.

The shelved for nearly two years drama airdropped in early April once the ban on female lead Song Zu Er was lifted and the result was better than expected. The drama got stronger than expected reviews especially for male lead Allen Ren who many felt was back to his strong suit in playing the stoic yet still emotionally aware male lead. It helps that the directing was sharp and the vignette stories interesting, and the drama recently wrapped its run and opened with a solid 7.3 Douban ratings. This drama is definitely joining my list of rewatchable dramas. I watched to support Song Zu'er and it exceed my expectations. It's making me look forward to Xu Kai and Tian Xiwei's Moonlit Reunion as well, where the male lead is also a demon hunter. I hope this drama will be good for Xu Kai… He is not a bad actor, he looks good but there something lacking in his dramas… I wish him well this time. Director did a great job, and usually lifeless  Allen Ren is very suited for role. I think if iQIYI didn't mess up with AI open ending the rating Douban would be higher. The open ending was absolutely not necessary though. Your email address will not be published. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.
