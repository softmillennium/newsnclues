However, according to two people familiar with the administration's communications with the outlets, they “held off publishing what they knew to avoid endangering U.S. troops.” Most recently, The Atlantic withheld a potential report on a planned U.S. attack on Yemen that was the central focus of Signalgate. That attack, which the magazine's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was notified about two hours in advance, killed 15 people, including six children, one of them a newborn baby. In reality, major outlets often protect government operations because those in charge at the outlets support them, a phenomenon those on the left have noted is observable in the practice of manufactured consent. Meanwhile, U.K. writer Owen Jones reported on Monday that BBC has directed its reporters to avoid using the word “kidnapped” when referring to the U.S.'s abduction of Maduro.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Oz made the comments in an appearance on Newsmax last week. “Every year, there is a flu vaccine, it doesn't always work very well,” Oz claimed. He also called on Americans to “eat the right food” and engage in physical activity. While eating healthy and exercising are good advice in general, Oz's downplaying of vaccines has concerned many health experts. Notably, his recommendation of zinc — which has been shown in some studies to help boost the immune system — came without dosage recommendations, which could potentially lead to overdoses by viewers unaware of the proper dosage. Oz has a history of providing faulty or dubious medical advice. His recommendation to take supplements echoes President Donald Trump's promotion of untested strategies during the coronavirus pandemic, such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, two “remedies” that turned out to have no effect on treating the virus and led to overdoses, including thousands of deaths, throughout the world. Oz's comments are also similar to those made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this year, in which he touted Vitamin A and cod liver oil as possible treatments for measles, leading to overdoses from those remedies in children throughout the country. Several medical experts, including Trump's first surgeon general Jerome Adams, spoke out against Oz's claims, reiterating that it's still important for Americans to get a flu vaccine this year, even with the new strain. “Even in mismatched years, flu vaccines provide cross-protection because the strains are related,” Adams said on social media, adding that “mismatched vaccines can still reduce lab-confirmed flu risk by around 50-60 percent overall and are particularly good at preventing severe outcomes like hospitalization and death.” A fact-check from Indian news site The Week notes that research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as multiple studies elsewhere, shows that “seasonal flu vaccines consistently reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, intensive care admission, organ failure, and death, even in seasons when the vaccine is not a perfect match for circulating strains.” New CDC estimates about this year's flu season were released on Monday, showcasing numbers up to the final week of 2025. It's possible the hospitalization and death rates are higher this year due to fewer people getting vaccinated, as around 13 million fewer flu vaccine doses were administered this year compared to last.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to make money off Venezuelan oil faces moral, political and logistical problems, Chris Arsenault writes.Matias Delacroix/The Associated Press Chris Arsenault is chair of the journalism program at Western University and a former reporter covering Venezuela. When it comes to the country with the world's largest oil reserves, U.S. President Donald Trump didn't mince words on why U.S. commandos seized Venezuela's president. Put aside for a moment clear violations of international law from U.S. actions and the fact “our” oil somehow ended up under Venezuela's soil. A picture Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social of deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro handcuffed and blindfolded in a tracksuit aboard a U.S. navy ship conjures images of other oil-rich autocrats deposed by Washington and its proxies: Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Muammar Gaddafi. In short, don't expect a big influx of Venezuela's estimated 303 billion barrels of oil to end up on tankers heading north any time soon. He blatantly stole the last election and his disastrous mismanagement forced nearly eight million Venezuelans to flee. But like past U.S. interventions in major oil producers, power vacuums can create chaos. War games simulations run previously by Washington on what could happen following Mr. Maduro's ouster indicate the chances for low-intensity civil conflict are substantial. Leftist rebels from Colombia operate in jungle areas around Venezuela's borders. Attempts by Exxon or other U.S. oil majors – who had their assets nationalized by Maduro predecessor Hugo Chavez – to bring in technicians and repair infrastructure to expand production are likely to be met by resistance, just as U.S. forces and oil companies faced in Iraq. What the U.S. attack on Venezuela could mean for oil and Canadian crude exports Opinion: Donald Trump's plans for Venezuela, or rather the lack of them America can deploy gunboat diplomacy around the globe, but Mr. Trump shouldn't hold his breath waiting for a cheque. Big increases in production, the kind of return on investment required for toppling a government and rebuilding an industry, will not be cheap or easy. Beyond refitting old wells or other repairs, expanding productive capacity is a longer-term and more expensive project. Venezuela's largest reserves sit in the Orinoco Belt, a region with heavy crude not so different from Canada's oil sands. Boosting production to three-to-four million barrels per day means creating new infrastructure to access Orinoco crude which could take a decade and cost more than US$100-billion. As explosions rang out in Caracas, one subset of Canada's political class fretted about domestic oil exports to the U.S. being replaced by production from Venezuela. In the midst of a blatant resource grab, his concerns are misplaced. Moreover, his worries aren't grounded in medium-term oil market realities. The real problem for the hemisphere, and Canada specifically, given recent U.S. annexation threats, is an unabashed return to powerful states taking natural wealth by force.

UNITED NATIONS, January 5. /TASS/. The US operation may intensify instability in Venezuela, affect the broader Latin American region and set a dangerous precedent in the sphere of international relations, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned.

"I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability in the country, the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted," Guterres said in a written statement read out by Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo at a UN Security Council meeting on Venezuela.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US defense secretary also started proceedings that could strip Kelly from retired military rank and cut pension Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on Monday that he had issued a formal censure to Democratic senator Mark Kelly and initiated proceedings that could strip the Arizona lawmaker of his retired military rank and cut his pension, escalating a dispute that began when Kelly urged service members to resist unlawful orders. Just days after a covert mission to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and strike the capital city, Hegseth announced that Kelly faces retirement grade determination proceedings, a rare administrative action that could see the former astronaut and navy captain demoted in his retired rank. Hegseth accused Kelly of making “seditious statements” that undermined military discipline. “Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,” Hegseth said in a statement posted on X, adding that Kelly “is still accountable to military justice” as a retired officer receiving military pay. After learning of the censure, Kelly called Hegseth “the most unqualified secretary of defense in our country's history” and vowed to “fight this with everything I've got”. “Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way,” Kelly said in a statement. Hegseth's statement claims Kelly's conduct between June and December 2025 violated articles 133 and 134 of the uniform code of military justice, which the senator remains subject to as a retired officer drawing pension payments. But the accusation on its face has been contested for months. Military law already requires that troops refuse unlawful orders, which is what Kelly and other members of Congress were echoing. And federal judges have ruled Donald Trump's military deployments in Los Angeles and other cities violated the Posse Comitatus Act, suggesting the orders Kelly warned about may have actually been illegal. “Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action,” Hegseth wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota who ran for vice-president in 2024, announced on Monday that he is abandoning his quest for a third term in office. “Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,” Walz said. According to reports in several media outlets, Walz spoke with Amy Klobuchar, a US senator, over the weekend about the possibility of her running for governor instead. She has served as a US senator for Minnesota since 2007 and regularly wins her statewide re-election bids handily. Walz had announced in September that he would seek a third term as governor – an unprecedented move for the Minnesota governorship, which he has held since 2018. Before that, he served in Congress representing southern Minnesota for six terms after flipping a Republican seat. A poll last summer conducted by the Minnesota Star Tribune and Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication ahead of Walz announcing his bid for a third term found that about half of Minnesotans didn't think he should run again. Along with legislative leaders, he used a government trifecta in 2023 to deliver a host of progressive reforms that caught the attention of the left. This increased profile has also made him a target on the right. In recent weeks, Trump has gone after Minnesota and Walz, directing a surge of immigration enforcement agents to the state, where they have pulled over US citizens and apprehended hundreds, despite consistent pushback from local residents. Last month, a rightwing YouTuber attempted to enter multiple daycare centers and alleged they weren't taking care of kids, which prompted the US government to freeze federal funding for childcare for the state. In his announcement on Monday, Walz said the state had made progress in fighting the fraud and that people are right to be concerned about fraud in government, but there was now “an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis”. “Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family. They've already begun by taking our tax dollars that were meant to help families afford child care. He said that the “buck stops with me” with fighting and preventing fraud and that Republicans' “political gamesmanship” makes it harder to fight fraud. “I cannot abide the actions of the political leadership in Washington – these opportunists who are willing to hurt our people to score a few cheap points,” he said. He said he made the decision with “zero sadness and zero regret” and was confident that a Democrat would continue to hold the governorship in November. “Most of all, I want Minnesotans to know that I'm on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America's best place to live and raise kids.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An oil extraction plant in Dnipro was damaged in a Russian drone strike on Jan. 5, spilling about 300 tons of sunflower oil onto city streets, Mayor Borys Filatov said. The facility reportedly belongs to Bunge, a U.S. agribusiness company based in St. Louis, Missouri, according to Filatov. "(Vladimir) Putin is targeting American business — striking U.S. investments in Ukraine and humiliating American interests," Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent following the attack. Washington must act to defend American business." The damaged facility is reportedly an oil plant related to Oleina, one of Ukraine's largest brands of bottled sunflower oil. The plant specializes in processing, refining, and bottling sunflower oil, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Liga.net. Local authorities reported no civilian casualties at the time of publication. Ukrainian troops have been repelling repeated Russian assaults near the village of Hryshyne over the past two days, while the situation in the town of Myrnohrad remains difficult in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Jan. 5. Russian forces are attempting to bypass the area primarily at night to minimize their losses, advancing via the settlements of Hryshyne and Rodynske, according to the 7th Rapid Response Corps. Hryshyne lies northwest of Pokrovsk, while Rodynske is to the north. Both settlements are less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the embattled city. Ukrainian forces are also observing small Russian groups of six to eight soldiers attempting to operate north of Pokrovsk. Russian troops are attempting to gain a foothold on Myrnohrad's eastern outskirts, but Ukrainian forces "remain in control of the situation," the corps said. Russia launched five missile strikes on Kharkiv on Jan. 5, injuring a 58-year-old man and causing "very significant damage" to the city's energy infrastructure, local authorities said. The first strike occurred at 12:45 p.m. local time, followed by four more at intervals of several minutes. The first two strikes hit an industrial area in the Slobidskyi district, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram. "The enemy deliberately launched five missile strikes on Kharkiv's energy infrastructure. The damage is very significant," Terekhov said. The mayor added that while it is possible to strengthen the protection of facilities, "no concrete structures can withstand five ballistic missiles." Russia attacked a facility where local residents were receiving humanitarian aid with three drones, killing a 64-year-old man, and injuring a 79-year-old woman and a 71-year-old man in the Dariivka community in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Jan. 5. Those injured suffered blast injuries and shrapnel wounds. Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Jan. 5 that it had thwarted Russia's latest attempt to launch an attack on the Kupiansk sector in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast by using the Soyuz ("union" in English) gas pipeline. Russia attempted to use the pipeline for "a covert exit and further accumulation of forces" in the Kupiansk area, in an operation that involved around 50 people, according to the 7th Corps. Russian troops are trying to expand the combat zone near the state border area in Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts, Border Guard Service spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on Jan. 5 on national television. Russian forces are also attempting to widen the combat zone near the Krasnopillia community and the border village of Hrabovske, Sumy Oblast, where fighting has continued for several weeks, Demchenko said. In these areas, Russian forces are using small assault groups without heavy equipment, he said, adding: "But the enemy cannot achieve results or advance deeper into our country's territory. And at the same time, it is suffering heavy losses." President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 5 that Vasyl Maliuk will step down as head of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) but remain in the agency to focus on asymmetric operations against Russia. "(Maliuk) knows how to do this best and will continue within the SBU system," Zelensky said. In a statement, Maliuk said he would stay in the service to carry out what he described as world‑class asymmetric operations aimed at inflicting "maximum damage" on Moscow. Despite leading several of Ukraine's most consequential operations against Russia, Maliuk's tenure has been marked by controversy, particularly over his involvement in actions targeting anti-corruption bodies. His departure follows days of speculation that Zelensky was preparing to dismiss him. Most of the officials who were dismissed from their posts were soon reappointed to positions of similar rank. At least four people have been killed and 15 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Jan. 5.Russia launched nine Iskander-M ballistic missiles and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, as well as 165 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. At least 26 drones made it through, striking 10 locations. The fall of debris was recorded at nine locations. Russian forces attacked Ukrainian energy infrastructure overnight on Jan. 5, causing power outages in Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv oblasts in the morning. The strike also left the city of Slavutych in Kyiv Oblast completely without electricity, Ukraine's state grid operator Ukrenergo said. In Kyiv, Russian forces targeted a private hospital in the Obolonskyi district, killing a patient and injuring four others, Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said. Two victims are in serious condition, Klitschko added.The Russian attack sparked a fire, forcing the transfer of 16 of the private hospital's 26 patients to public facilities. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 33 settlements, injuring three people over the past day, the local military administration said in its daily report at around 8 a.m. local time. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was killed and two others were injured in Russian strikes against the city of Kramatorsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a Russian drone attacked the regional center of Zaporizhzhia, killing a driver, according to the local military administration. Russian forces also targeted the Polohy district, injuring a 69-year-old woman. In Sumy Oblast, a 54-year-old man suffered injuries in the Putyvl community due to a Russian drone strike, the local military administration said. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian forces attacked the village of Kupiansk-Vuzlovyi, injuring a 67-year-old woman, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russia has lost around 1,212,520 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Jan. 5. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,507 tanks, 23,857 armored fighting vehicles, 72,945 vehicles and fuel tanks, 35,785 artillery systems, 1,592 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,268 air defense systems, 434 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 100,564 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump has threatened Colombia with military action similar to last week's raid on Venezuela. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said Colombia is “run by a sick man,” referring to President Gustavo Petro, whom he labeled a “drug leader.” The US president suggested that Petro, whom he sanctioned last year, could be removed from power too. “Colombia is very sick… run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States. And he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,” Trump stated. Petro responded sharply in a series of posts on X, urging Trump to “stop slandering” and calling on Latin American nations to unite or risk being “treated as servants and slaves.” Media reports say at least 80 people, both military and civilian, were killed in the raid. Maduro, who has denied all allegations, was abducted and forcibly flown to the US along with his wife. Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, and Spain have issued a joint statement warning that America's action has set “an extremely dangerous precedent” for regional security. He told reporters that Saturday's military intervention was not about regime change or resources but securing “peace on Earth,” particularly in the Western Hemisphere. He went on to warn that the US could strike again if Caracas “doesn't behave.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 5 that Vasyl Maliuk will step down as head of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) but remain in the agency to focus on asymmetric operations against Russia. "(Maliuk) knows how to do this best and will continue within the SBU system," Zelensky said. In a statement, Maliuk said he would stay in the service to carry out what he described as world‑class asymmetric operations aimed at inflicting "maximum damage" on Moscow. Despite leading several of Ukraine's most consequential operations against Russia, Maliuk's tenure has been marked by controversy, particularly over his involvement in actions targeting anti-corruption bodies. His departure follows days of speculation that Zelensky was preparing to dismiss him. According to Ukrainian Pravda, Maliuk's resignation followed direct pressure from Zelensky. Under Maliuk's leadership, the SBU — widely seen as loyal to the President's Office — arrested several NABU employees, accusing them of having ties to Russia. Anti-corruption activists and civil society groups rejected that explanation, arguing the arrests targeted detectives investigating figures close to Zelensky. Maliuk was appointed SBU head by parliament on Feb. 7, 2023, after serving as acting chief since July 2022. Zelensky dismissed his predecessor, Ivan Bakanov, citing endemic treason within the agency following Russia's full-scale invasion. During Maliuk's tenure, the SBU carried out several high-profile operations deep inside Russia and in occupied territories. On June 1, the agency executed Operation Spiderweb, deploying drones concealed in trucks across Russia to strike air bases thousands of kilometers from Ukraine's border. Under Maliuk, the service was also involved in multiple attacks on the Russian illegally constructed Crimean Bridge, a critical logistical artery for Russian forces. Ukrainian Pravda reported that Maliuk initially resisted Zelensky's decision to remove him, warning that several large-scale operations comparable to Spiderweb were in their final stages and that halting them would be reckless. As pressure mounted over Maliuk's future, senior Ukrainian military commanders publicly warned against his dismissal, cautioning that removing him during active combat could weaken one of Ukraine's most effective security institutions. Commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces Robert "Madyar" Brovdi and Joint Forces Commander Mykhailo Drapatyi urged restraint, pointing to SBU's performance. Their public intervention was unusual and highlighted the seriousness with which they view the decision, given their general avoidance of political commentary. Parliament, where Zelensky's party holds a majority of seats, must vote on his dismissal. Ukrainian media report that Yevhenii Khmara, head of the SBU's Alpha special operations unit, is a leading candidate to replace him. The unit is consistently among the most effective in Ukraine's defense forces, credited with destroying significant Russian equipment and personnel, often with drone support. Shortly after announcing Maliuk's resignation, Zelensky signed a decree appointing Khmara as acting head of Ukraine's Security Service. Maliuk's resignation follows closely after Zelensky appointed military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov to head the President's Office, making Maliuk the second senior security figure to leave his post in a short span.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A decade later, the US secretary of state finally got his revenge when the US military captured Mr Maduro in a daring pre-dawn raid. Dubbed the “viceroy of Venezuela” by the US media, Mr Rubio, who has taken on an ever-growing list of titles in the Trump administration – serving as national security adviser, acting national security adviser and US archivist – may just have added another one to his ledger. For Mr Rubio, a politician who frequently describes himself as the son of Cuban exiles, building his political identity on his family story, it marks the climax of a lifelong ambition to restore democracy to Central America. He fundamentally believes in freedom and democracy because that was taken away from his family.” “The transition process will not be easy, but there is no one more capable in the US government than secretary Marco Rubio for this moment,” said one former adviser. Described by sources as a “Latin America whisperer”, Mr Rubio allegedly had a direct line to the president during his first term when it came to the socialist governments of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, former officials told Politico. His sharp criticism had long been a source of frustration for Mr Maduro, who had branded him the “craziest of the crazies” and whose head of security forces, Diosdado Cabello Rondon, was said to be behind a plot to assassinate the outspoken senator, according to a US intelligence memo. Although it was never proven, the threat prompted federal officials to provide Mr Rubio and his family with round-the-clock protection. “I think the president really respects him,” a former Rubio adviser said. The pair see each other nearly every day, have offices next to each other in the White House and have a warm public relationship, which has resulted in the president bestowing titles on his adviser like a medieval king. Speaking to reporters after Mr Maduro's arrest, Mr Trump was vague about who would run the Latin American country, saying “the people that are standing right behind me” will do so for a “period of time”, as he gestured to his secretary of state and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary. The president also hailed Mr Rubio's initial talks with Mr Maduro's vice president, Delcey Rodríguez, who was formally made interim leader on Sunday, saying “she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again”. Deftly dealing with Ms Rodríguez's response that Venezuela “will never return to being the colony of another empire”, Mr Rubio clarified on Sunday that the US would not govern Venezuela day-to-day other than enforcing an existing “oil quarantine” on the country. Pushing back on suggestions that Mr Trump is averse to foreign intervention, Ms Filipetti said the president has “always had a penchant for these displays of American might”, pointing to his strikes on Iran and plans to send naval assets to the coast of Venezuela in his first term, which she said were stymied by bureaucratic hurdles. During the president's first term, Mr Rubio was instrumental in pushing for sanctions against Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, the so-called “troika of tyranny”. On Sunday evening, Mr Trump set pulses racing in Colombia too, calling the country's Left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, a “sick man” who “likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”. Dismissing comparisons to the US invasion of Iraq, which led to nearly nine years of conflict and the death of around 5,000 servicemen, a former Rubio adviser pointed out that the Venezuelan people had voted against Mr Maduro's government for a decade and argued that they were “excited for what's ahead”. Meanwhile, they said: “Cuban Americans see the fall of the regime in Venezuela as having a domino effect that will directly impact Cuba.” Mr Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, 69, are expected to appear in court on Monday, facing charges of narco-terrorism. As the fallen leader contemplates a future locked up in a US prison, Mr Rubio may well be setting his eyes on his next prize – this one much closer to home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump said that he does not believe Ukraine launched an attack on Russian President Vladimir Putin's official residence. "We don't believe that happened," he told reporters aboard his presidential plane on the way to Washington from West Palm Beach, Florida, where he spent the Christmas and New Year holidays at his Mar-a-Lago estate. "There is something that happened fairly nearby [to the Russian president's official residence]," Trump said in this context. When asked why he had previously condemned Kiev, Trump said: "Nobody knew at that moment. He (Putin - TASS) said that his house was attacked." "We do not believe that (Ukraine's attack on Putin's official residence - TASS) happened. As you know now that we have been able to check," the US leader said. "We just hope that Russia and Ukraine get it [the conflict] settled," Trump added. In the early morning hours of December 29, Kiev launched an attack on Putin's state residence in the Novgorod Region using 91 drones, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reported earlier. In turn, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said that, during a telephone conversation, Putin pointed Trump's attention to Kiev's attack, which occurred "almost immediately" after the US-Ukraine talks in Mar-a-Lago. The Russian leader warned that Kiev's attack would not go unanswered.</p>
