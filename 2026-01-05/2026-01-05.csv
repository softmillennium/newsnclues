Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodriguez has called on Washington to work with Caracas following a US raid in which President Nicolas Maduro was seized and taken out of the country.

Rodriguez, who had served as vice president since 2018, assumed the role of interim president after Maduro was abducted by US forces in Caracas and flown to New York to face charges of orchestrating a “narco-terrorism conspiracy.”

“President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war,” Rodriguez wrote on Telegram on Monday. “This has always been President Nicolas Maduro's message, and it is the message of all of Venezuela right now.”

She also called for a “balanced and respectful” relationship with the US, urging the White House to work with Caracas on “an agenda for cooperation aimed at shared development.” Rodriguez affirmed the Bolivarian Republic's right “to peace, to development, to sovereignty and to a future.”

The interim president had earlier demanded that Washington immediately release Maduro, while saying Venezuela would “never return to being the colony of another empire” or “return to being slaves.”

On Sunday, Trump warned Rodriguez she would pay a “bigger price” than her recently captured predecessor “if she doesn't do what's right.”

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured on Saturday during a US operation that included a series of air strikes in the capital city and several other states. Washington said on Sunday that the pair had been indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and weapons offences.

Maduro has repeatedly rejected claims that he has any links to drug trafficking, saying Washington is using the allegations as a pretext for regime change in Venezuela.

The latest US operation in the Latin American state followed decades of strained relations marked by deepening diplomatic rifts, sweeping unilateral sanctions, political confrontation and mutual accusations. Washington had refused to recognize Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate president.

US President Donald Trump has threatened Colombia with military action similar to last week's raid on Venezuela.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said Colombia is “run by a sick man,” referring to President Gustavo Petro, whom he labeled a “drug leader.” The US president suggested that Petro, whom he sanctioned last year, could be removed from power too.

“Colombia is very sick… run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States. And he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,” Trump stated. Asked directly whether the US would launch a military operation against the country, he replied: “It sounds good to me.”

Petro responded sharply in a series of posts on X, urging Trump to “stop slandering” and calling on Latin American nations to unite or risk being “treated as servants and slaves.”

The exchange follows growing outrage over Washington's unprecedented military operation to seize Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, which the Trump administration says was needed to bring the Venezuelan president to trial on drug trafficking charges. Caracas rejects this explanation as a pretext for regime change. Media reports say at least 80 people, both military and civilian, were killed in the raid. Maduro, who has denied all allegations, was abducted and forcibly flown to the US along with his wife.

The raid has drawn condemnation from the Global South, while China slammed the abduction as a violation of international law. Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, and Spain have issued a joint statement warning that America's action has set “an extremely dangerous precedent” for regional security.

Trump justified the raid by invoking the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, which designates Latin America as Washington's sphere of influence, while asserting that the US is now “in charge” of Venezuela. He told reporters that Saturday's military intervention was not about regime change or resources but securing “peace on Earth,” particularly in the Western Hemisphere. He went on to warn that the US could strike again if Caracas “doesn't behave.”

Besides Colombia and Venezuela, Trump has also ramped up rhetoric against other countries in the region, claiming Cuba “is ready to fall” due to the loss of Venezuelan oil revenue and threatening Mexico with possible military intervention, saying the country “has to get their act together because [drugs] are pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something.”

WASHINGTON, January 5. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump said that he does not believe Ukraine launched an attack on Russian President Vladimir Putin's official residence.

""We don't believe that happened,"" he told reporters aboard his presidential plane on the way to Washington from West Palm Beach, Florida, where he spent the Christmas and New Year holidays at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump was responding to questions about Kiev's shelling of the Russian president's official residence in the Novgorod Region. ""There is something that happened fairly nearby [to the Russian president's official residence],"" Trump said in this context. ""But [it] had nothing to do [with the attack on the Russian leader's official residence],"" the US leader said, without providing any details.

When asked why he had previously condemned Kiev, Trump said: ""Nobody knew at that moment. I mean, that was the first I heard about it. He (Putin - TASS) said that his house was attacked."" ""We do not believe that (Ukraine's attack on Putin's official residence - TASS) happened. As you know now that we have been able to check,"" the US leader said. ""We just hope that Russia and Ukraine get it [the conflict] settled,"" Trump added.

In the early morning hours of December 29, Kiev launched an attack on Putin's state residence in the Novgorod Region using 91 drones, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reported earlier. All drones were destroyed. According to the top diplomat, there was no information about casualties or damage from the UAV debris.

In turn, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said that, during a telephone conversation, Putin pointed Trump's attention to Kiev's attack, which occurred ""almost immediately"" after the US-Ukraine talks in Mar-a-Lago. The Russian leader warned that Kiev's attack would not go unanswered. The head of state also informed his US counterpart that Russia would review its position in the negotiations to settle the conflict in Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

PYONGYANG, January 5. /TASS/. Recent events on the international stage require North Korea to strengthen its nuclear deterrent forces, leader Kim Jong Un said while observing the Korean People's Army's fire strike group drills on the launch of hypersonic missiles on January 4.

The Korean Central News Agency quoted the supreme commander-in-chief as saying that strengthening nuclear deterrence forces is required due to ""the latest geopolitical crisis and complex international events."" Kim Jong Un added that the purpose of the drills was to assess the combat readiness of the hypersonic weapons system and the effectiveness and mobility of North Korea's deterrence forces.

He called testing and improving the characteristics of the main components of the nuclear deterrent forces and practicing the use of such forces an ""important strategic task."" The leader emphasized that North Korea must ""constantly bolster its military capabilities, particularly its offensive weapons systems,"" as this is necessary for effective self-defense.

""It is also necessary to constantly demonstrate to opponents the constant combat readiness and lethality of strategic offensive weapons,"" Kim Jong Un stressed. In his opinion, this is one of the most effective ways to deter war.

Hypersonic missiles launched from Pyongyang's Ryongsong district in a northeastern direction struck targets 1,000 kilometers away in the Sea of Japan, which North Korea calls the East Sea.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

US defense secretary also started proceedings that could strip Kelly from retired military rank and cut pension

Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on Monday that he had issued a formal censure to Democratic senator Mark Kelly and initiated proceedings that could strip the Arizona lawmaker of his retired military rank and cut his pension, escalating a dispute that began when Kelly urged service members to resist unlawful orders.

Just days after a covert mission to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and strike the capital city, Hegseth announced that Kelly faces retirement grade determination proceedings, a rare administrative action that could see the former astronaut and navy captain demoted in his retired rank. Hegseth accused Kelly of making “seditious statements” that undermined military discipline.

In November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers, all military or intelligence veterans, released a 90-second video speaking directly to service members about the consideration of the national guard being deployed across the country, calling on troops to uphold the constitution and defy what they characterized as illegal commands

“Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,” Hegseth said in a statement posted on X, adding that Kelly “is still accountable to military justice” as a retired officer receiving military pay.

The Pentagon declined to comment further beyond the post on social media.

After learning of the censure, Kelly called Hegseth “the most unqualified secretary of defense in our country's history” and vowed to “fight this with everything I've got”.

“Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way,” Kelly said in a statement. “It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.”

“If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified secretary of defense in our country's history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn't get it.

Hegseth's statement claims Kelly's conduct between June and December 2025 violated articles 133 and 134 of the uniform code of military justice, which the senator remains subject to as a retired officer drawing pension payments. The defense secretary argues Kelly “characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders”.

But the accusation on its face has been contested for months. Military law already requires that troops refuse unlawful orders, which is what Kelly and other members of Congress were echoing. And federal judges have ruled Donald Trump's military deployments in Los Angeles and other cities violated the Posse Comitatus Act, suggesting the orders Kelly warned about may have actually been illegal.

In the video lawmakers released in November by Kelly and his colleagues – senator Elissa Slotkin and representatives Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan, Slotkin acknowledged that military personnel were “under enormous stress and pressure right now” under the Trump administration's policies.

Days after the video's release, Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post.

Kelly has 30 days to respond to the censure, which will be placed in his permanent military personnel file. The Pentagon chief has directed the navy secretary to complete the rank review within 45 days.

The move marks an extraordinary step by the defense department against a sitting US senator and threatened that more action could be coming.

“Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action,” Hegseth wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Announcement comes after ongoing fraud of social services cases became focus of ire for Republicans and Trump

US politics live – latest updates

Tim Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota who ran for vice-president in 2024, announced on Monday that he is abandoning his quest for a third term in office.
  The move comes after ongoing fraud of social services cases caught the attention of US Republicans, including Donald Trump, who then used the cases as a pretext to go after Somali residents.

Walz said in a statement that he wasn't able to “give a political campaign my all”.

“Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,” Walz said. “So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.”

According to reports in several media outlets, Walz spoke with Amy Klobuchar, a US senator, over the weekend about the possibility of her running for governor instead. She has served as a US senator for Minnesota since 2007 and regularly wins her statewide re-election bids handily.

Walz had announced in September that he would seek a third term as governor – an unprecedented move for the Minnesota governorship, which he has held since 2018. Before that, he served in Congress representing southern Minnesota for six terms after flipping a Republican seat.

A poll last summer conducted by the Minnesota Star Tribune and Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication ahead of Walz announcing his bid for a third term found that about half of Minnesotans didn't think he should run again.

His campaign for vice-president on the ticket with Kamala Harris raised his profile significantly across the country. Along with legislative leaders, he used a government trifecta in 2023 to deliver a host of progressive reforms that caught the attention of the left.

This increased profile has also made him a target on the right. In recent weeks, Trump has gone after Minnesota and Walz, directing a surge of immigration enforcement agents to the state, where they have pulled over US citizens and apprehended hundreds, despite consistent pushback from local residents. Over the weekend, Trump shared a conspiracy theory about the killings of Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark – close friends of Walz – attempting to tie Walz to the killings.

The fraud cases – which included organized theft of meals for children, services for kids with autism and housing programs – have served as a major liability for Walz during his re-election and more fodder for the right to attack him and the state. Last month, a rightwing YouTuber attempted to enter multiple daycare centers and alleged they weren't taking care of kids, which prompted the US government to freeze federal funding for childcare for the state.

In his announcement on Monday, Walz said the state had made progress in fighting the fraud and that people are right to be concerned about fraud in government, but there was now “an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis”.

“I won't mince words here,” Walz said. “Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family. They've already begun by taking our tax dollars that were meant to help families afford child care. And they have no intention of stopping there.”

He said that the “buck stops with me” with fighting and preventing fraud and that Republicans' “political gamesmanship” makes it harder to fight fraud.

“I cannot abide the actions of the political leadership in Washington – these opportunists who are willing to hurt our people to score a few cheap points,” he said. “They and their allies have no intention of helping us solve the problem – and every intention of profiting off of it.”

He said he believes if he gave his re-election bid his all, he would succeed in winning a third term. But he concluded he couldn't give it his all, and he would instead focus on the work of his office instead of a run for re-election. He said he made the decision with “zero sadness and zero regret” and was confident that a Democrat would continue to hold the governorship in November.

“Most of all, I want Minnesotans to know that I'm on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America's best place to live and raise kids. No one will take that away from us. Not the fraudsters. And not the president. Not on my watch.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US vice-president was not at his Cincinnati home when attacker smashed windows trying to get into the house

JD Vance on Monday thanked law enforcement in Ohio for arresting someone he referred to as a “crazy person”, whom the US vice president said tried to break into his Cincinnati home with a hammer overnight.

The Secret Service said in a statement that one person was in custody after the incident, which took place in the early hours of Monday. Vance had returned to Washington DC the day before.

“I appreciate everyone's well wishes about the attack at our home. As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows. I'm grateful to the secret service and the Cincinnati police for responding quickly,” Vance wrote in a post to X.

He then assailed the media for covering the incident.

“One request to the media: we try to protect our kids as much as possible from the realities of this life of public service. In that light, I am skeptical of the news value of plastering images of our home with holes in the windows.”

Vance spent last week at the house overlooking the Ohio River, but left on Sunday afternoon, Cincinnati news channel WLWT reported. The channel published to its website a photograph purporting to show damage to at least four panes of glass in what looked to be a ground floor window.

The Secret Service said an adult male was arrested shortly after midnight “for causing property damage, including breaking windows on the exterior of a personal residence associated with the vice-president”.

“The US Secret Service is coordinating with the Cincinnati Police Department and the US Attorney's Office as charging decisions are reviewed,” a spokesperson, Anthony Guglielmi, said in a statement sent to the Guardian.

WLWT said Secret Service agents and Cincinnati police spent several hours at the house in the East Walnut Hills neighborhood after responding to reports of damage to windows.

Two unnamed law enforcement sources told the Associated Press that Secret Service agents heard a loud noise at the home around midnight and found a person who had broken a window with a hammer and was trying to get into the house. The man had also vandalized a Secret Service vehicle on his way up the home's driveway, one of the officials said.

While Vance enjoys round-the-clock personal protection by the Secret Service as vice-president, the level of security maintained at his private residence varies according to his travel plans.

Many politicians have taken steps to enhance security after the June 2025 killing of Minnesota state legislator Melissa Hortman and her husband at their Minneapolis home, and an attack on another Democratic lawmaker and his wife in the city on the same night.

In October 2024, a man was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attacking Paul Pelosi, husband of the Democratic former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, with a hammer at their California home.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Bangladesh will not play their Twenty20 World Cup matches in India after Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League team amid growing tensions between the countries, Bangladesh's sports adviser Asif Nazrul said on Sunday. 

Kolkata Knight Riders said on Saturday they had released the Bangladeshi bowler after being told to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 

Bangladesh are scheduled to play three Twenty20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the Feb. 7-March 8 tournament being cohosted by India and Sri Lanka.

“Bangladesh will not go to India to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh Cricket Board [BCB] has taken this decision today,” Nazrul, who is an adviser to the Bangladeshi Ministry of Youth and Sports, said in a statement. 

“We welcome this decision taken in the context of the extreme communal policy of India's cricket board,” he said. 

Last month, hundreds protested near Bangladeshi High Commission in New Delhi after Hindu factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was beaten and set on fire in Mymensingh, Bangladesh, by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks about Prophet Mohammed. 

A total of 12 people were arrested in connection with his death. 

The incident worsened relations between India and its neighbor, with ties already strained after former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to New Delhi following protests against her. 

After Mustafizur's release on Saturday, the BCB had held an emergency meeting and were planning to write to the International Cricket Council (ICC) to relocate their matches and raise concerns about player safety. 

“The board said that where a Bangladesh cricketer can't play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladesh cricket team can't feel safe to go to the World Cup,” Nazrul had said. “I have also instructed the board to request Bangladesh World Cup games to be held in Sri Lanka.” 

Last year, the ICC allowed India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to soured relations with hosts Pakistan. 

On Sunday, cricket news site Cricbuzz reported that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur's release. 

The ICC and BCB did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 

Bangladesh are due to play West Indies, England and Italy in Kolkata before ending the group stage against Nepal in Mumbai.

Three-time Grand Slam singles champion Wawrinka beat Arthur Rinderknech of France, who is ranked 29th to Wawrinka's 157th, 5-7, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (5). The match went 3 hours, 16 minutes.
Wawrinka last month announced that this year would be his last on the ATP tour.
“Today was a tough battle ... it's amazing to come here for the first time, to have so much support,” Wawrinka said yesterday. “Twenty years on tour, you kind of always play in the same place

In an international system increasingly shaped by coercion, power politics and transactional diplomacy, multilateralism is often dismissed as naive or obsolete — especially for smaller countries living next to much larger neighbors. Taiwan's experience suggests the opposite. For Taipei, multilateralism has not been an act of idealism, but a carefully cultivated source of strategic strength.

Denied formal diplomatic recognition by much of the world and excluded from the UN system, Taiwan has nevertheless embedded itself deeply into the functioning of the global economy. It has done so not through confrontation or rhetoric, but through rules, institutions and credibility. That quiet, patient strategy offers lessons not only for Taiwan's supporters, but for smaller and middle powers everywhere.

Taiwan's engagement with multilateral institutions — most notably the WTO — demonstrates how influence could be exercised even in the absence of recognition. The WTO is one of the few international organizations where Taiwan participates as a full member, albeit under the name “Chinese Taipei.” Yet within negotiating rooms and committee meetings, labels matter far less than preparation, competence and institutional fluency.

I observed this first-hand during my years in Geneva. Taiwanese delegates were consistently among the most technically rigorous participants in the room. They intervened selectively, grounded their positions in legal text and data, and avoided political theater. Over time, their approach earned respect and trust, even from countries with no diplomatic ties with Taiwan. In a rules-based system, credibility itself becomes a form of power — and Taiwan has invested in it carefully.

Such institutional engagement has had repercussions far beyond trade diplomacy. By anchoring itself firmly within global trade rules, supply chains and standards-setting processes, Taipei has made its stability internationally relevant. Any serious disruption in Taiwan would no longer be a purely bilateral issue; it would reverberate across industries, markets and economies worldwide. Multilateralism, in this sense, has acted as a force multiplier for Taiwan's security.

Economic strategy reinforces that logic. Taiwan trades extensively with China, yet it has avoided becoming strategically dependent. Critical sectors — particularly advanced semiconductor manufacturing and design — are protected through a combination of domestic policy and alignment with global trade and technology regimes. Rather than rejecting interdependence, 

Taiwan has structured it carefully, ensuring that economic integration does not translate into political vulnerability.

Therefore, deterrence is not only a military matter. It is institutional and economic. Coercion becomes more difficult when it risks contravening rules, disrupting supply chains and alienating multiple stakeholders simultaneously. For smaller states, it is a crucial insight: Multilateral integration, pursued intelligently, could raise the costs of coercion in ways that military spending alone cannot.

Taiwan's multilateral posture also shapes its diplomacy. Taipei has avoided absolutist positions or dramatic declarations that would narrow its room for maneuver. Strategic ambiguity — often misunderstood as weakness — has complemented its institutional strategy. By acting as a predictable, rules-abiding participant in international systems, Taiwan denies adversaries easy pretexts for escalation while reinforcing its image as a responsible stakeholder.

That external restraint rests on strong internal foundations. Taiwan's democratic legitimacy, institutional competence and social cohesion enhance its credibility in multilateral settings. Rules-based systems reward reliability, transparency and governance quality — areas in which Taiwan performs well. Internal resilience is inseparable from external strategy.

However, any honest assessment must acknowledge a central caveat. Taiwan's ability to leverage multilateralism operates under the shadow of the US. Washington's security guarantees, extended deterrence and strategic ambiguity create the space within which Taiwan's institutional strategy can function. A significant shift in US priorities would inevitably narrow that space.

Yet this does not diminish the value of Taiwan's approach. External partnerships matter, but they are most effective when combined with domestic capacity and diversified international engagement. Multilateralism cannot replace hard power, but it could amplify it — and, in Taiwan's case, compensate intelligently for its absence.

The quiet strength of Taiwan's multilateralism lies precisely in its restraint. It does not seek confrontation, nor does it rely on recognition. Instead, it builds relevance, credibility and resilience over time. In an era when power politics is resurgent and rules are under strain, Taiwan offers a timely reminder: For smaller countries, survival is not about being loud — it is about being indispensable.

                                                                                In 2009, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) made a welcome move to offer in-house contracts to all outsourced employees. It was a step forward for labor relations and the enterprise facing long-standing issues around outsourcing. 
TSMC founder Morris Chang (張忠謀) once said: “Anything that goes against basic values and principles must be reformed regardless of the cost — on this, there can be no compromise.” 
The quote is a testament to a core belief of the company's culture: Injustices must be faced head-on and set right. If TSMC can be clear on its convictions, then should the Ministry of Education                                    



                                                                                This should be the year in which the democracies, especially those in East Asia, lose their fear of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) “one China principle” plus its nuclear “Cognitive Warfare” coercion strategies, all designed to achieve hegemony without fighting.
For 2025, stoking regional and global fear was a major goal for the CCP and its People's Liberation Army (PLA), following on Mao Zedong's (毛澤東) Little Red Book admonition, “We must be ruthless to our enemies; we must overpower and annihilate them.”
But on Dec. 17, 2025, the Trump Administration demonstrated direct defiance of CCP terror with its record US$11.1 billion arms                                    



                                                                                The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) provided several reasons for military drills it conducted in five zones around Taiwan on Monday and yesterday.
The first was as a warning to “Taiwanese independence forces” to cease and desist. This is a consistent line from the Chinese authorities. The second was that the drills were aimed at “deterrence” of outside military intervention.
Monday's announcement of the drills was the first time that Beijing has publicly used the second reason for conducting such drills. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is clearly rattled by “external forces” apparently consolidating around an intention to intervene.
The targets of                                    



                                                                                China's recent aggressive military posture around Taiwan simply reflects the truth that China is a millennium behind, as Kobe City Councilor Norihiro Uehata has commented.
While democratic countries work for peace, prosperity and progress, authoritarian countries such as Russia and China only care about territorial expansion, superpower status and world dominance, while their people suffer.
Two millennia ago, the ancient Chinese philosopher Mencius (孟子) would have advised Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) that “people are the most important, state is lesser, and the ruler is the least important.” In fact, the reverse order is causing the great depression in China right now,                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

Habibullah set off from his home in western Afghanistan determined to find work in Iran, only for the 15-year-old to freeze to death while walking across the mountainous frontier.

“He was forced to go, to bring food for the family,” his mother, Mah Jan, said at her mud home in Ghunjan village.

“We have no food to eat, we have no clothes to wear. The house in which I live has no electricity, no water. I have no proper window, nothing to burn for heating,” she added, clutching a photograph of her son.

Habibullah was one of at least 18 migrants who died last month while trying to cross illegally into Iran from Afghanistan's Herat Province, according to officials, when temperatures were about minus-3°C.

With earthquakes and drought compounding a daily struggle to survive in Afghanistan, about half the population would need humanitarian assistance this year, the UN says.

“There was no other way left for me. I thought, let him go to make our life better,” said Mah Jan, 50, who requested the family's surname not be published for privacy reasons.

Habibullah's stepbrother, Gul Ahmad, said the teenager had tried shoe polishing, but only earned up to 15 afghanis (US$0.23) per day.

“He was ready to be a shepherd for 2,000 afghanis, to work in a shop, but he found nothing. So he was forced to leave. He told his mother: ‘Let's trust in God, I'm going to Iran,'” said Gul Ahmad, 56.

Habibullah was among 15 bodies returned from Iran, an Afghan border source said on condition of anonymity.

A further three migrants who died were recovered on the Afghan side of the frontier, an army official said.

Over just a matter of days last month, about 1,600 Afghan migrants “who were at risk of perishing due to the weather” were rescued in the mountains, Iranian Border Guard Commander Majid Shoja was quoted as saying by the ILNA news agency.

They are drawn to Iran due to greater job opportunities and a common language, but legal routes are limited.

Afghan Deputy Minister for Labor and Social Affairs Abdul Manan Omari on Sunday said that it was “necessary to do more” to facilitate work permits for migrants.

Iran and Pakistan have combined sent back 5 million Afghans since September 2023, increasing the nation's population by 10 percent, the International Organization for Migration said.

The agency's deputy head in Afghanistan, Mutya Izora Maskun, said that many in the nation say that “the economy, job insecurity, food insecurity, constrained access to services” force them to leave.

They do so even if that means going through “illegal crossing points that are very dangerous due to the cold and the risks of human trafficking,” she said.

The Taliban government has taken “serious steps to fight the smugglers,” Afghan Ministry of Interior Affairs spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani said.

However, the attempts to reach Iran have not stopped.

In the last week of last month, “347 people who were trying to illegally cross the border into Iran were identified and arrested,” a military unit in western Afghanistan said in a statement on Saturday.

Abdul Majeed Haidari, whose one-year-old son suffers from a heart problem, tried his luck in the middle of last month.

Working at a brick oven, the 25-year-old could no longer afford to pay for his son's medication and family expenses.

“We left because we were so destitute,” said his stepbrother, Yunus, who accompanied him.

“We set out in the rain. In such weather, the radars and cameras of the border guards do not work properly, but the smuggler got lost,” he said.

They failed to light a fire for warmth and, as snow fell, Yunus recounted his stepbrother's words: “I can't walk anymore.”

“Some told us to leave him so as not to endanger the other 19 people in the group,” said Yunus, who requested his full name not be used.

After carrying him for two more hours, “his eyes stopped closing, his body grew heavier,” Yunus said, before an Iranian family drove past and took them to hospital.

“They gave him electric shocks, but they said he was already dead,” said Yunus, who has since returned to his village.

“The United States should prepare itself because Donald Trump will fall seriously ill,” Juan de Dios Garcia proclaimed as he gathered with other shamans on a beach in southern Lima, dressed in traditional Andean ponchos and headdresses, and sprinkling flowers on the sand.

President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 5 that Vasyl Maliuk will step down as head of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) but remain in the agency to focus on asymmetric operations against Russia.

""(Maliuk) knows how to do this best and will continue within the SBU system,"" Zelensky said. ""Together, we discussed candidates for the new head of the SBU.""

In a statement, Maliuk said he would stay in the service to carry out what he described as world‑class asymmetric operations aimed at inflicting ""maximum damage"" on Moscow.

Despite leading several of Ukraine's most consequential operations against Russia, Maliuk's tenure has been marked by controversy, particularly over his involvement in actions targeting anti-corruption bodies.

His departure follows days of speculation that Zelensky was preparing to dismiss him. 

The move is one of several key dismissals and appointments Zelensky has announced in 2026, in a government reshuffle driven in part by Ukraine's recent corruption scandal.

Most of the officials who were dismissed from their posts were soon reappointed to positions of similar rank.

According to Ukrainian Pravda, Maliuk's resignation followed direct pressure from Zelensky.

The president's team reportedly views Maliuk as one of the key figures associated with a coordinated move against Ukraine's anti-corruption institutions and effectively trying to contain the fallout and deflect responsibility for the attack.

The controversy traces back to July, when parliament passed legislation that effectively stripped independence from the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO).

Under Maliuk's leadership, the SBU — widely seen as loyal to the President's Office — arrested several NABU employees, accusing them of having ties to Russia. 

The service framed the crackdown as a counterintelligence effort aimed at neutralizing Moscow's alleged influence within the bureau.

Anti-corruption activists and civil society groups rejected that explanation, arguing the arrests targeted detectives investigating figures close to Zelensky.

The detectives were later released.

The political backlash stands in contrast to Maliuk's operational record during the war.

Maliuk was appointed SBU head by parliament on Feb. 7, 2023, after serving as acting chief since July 2022. Zelensky dismissed his predecessor, Ivan Bakanov, citing endemic treason within the agency following Russia's full-scale invasion.

During Maliuk's tenure, the SBU carried out several high-profile operations deep inside Russia and in occupied territories. 

On June 1, the agency executed Operation Spiderweb, deploying drones concealed in trucks across Russia to strike air bases thousands of kilometers from Ukraine's border.

On Dec. 15, the SBU reported that its Sea Baby naval drones struck a Russian Varshavyanka-class submarine in the port of Novorossiysk, marking the first publicly acknowledged underwater drone attack of its kind. 

Under Maliuk, the service was also involved in multiple attacks on the Russian illegally constructed Crimean Bridge, a critical logistical artery for Russian forces.

Ukrainian Pravda reported that Maliuk initially resisted Zelensky's decision to remove him, warning that several large-scale operations comparable to Spiderweb were in their final stages and that halting them would be reckless.

As pressure mounted over Maliuk's future, senior Ukrainian military commanders publicly warned against his dismissal, cautioning that removing him during active combat could weaken one of Ukraine's most effective security institutions.

Commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi and Joint Forces Commander Mykhailo Drapatyi urged restraint, pointing to SBU's performance.


""No matter which of the proposed security structures Maliuk could potentially be effective in the near future, replacing the head of the Security Service at this moment would be a risk.""
    

Their public intervention was unusual and highlighted the seriousness with which they view the decision, given their general avoidance of political commentary.

Maliuk's resignation now moves to the political arena. Parliament, where Zelensky's party holds a majority of seats, must vote on his dismissal. 

Ukrainian media report that Yevhenii Khmara, head of the SBU's Alpha special operations unit, is a leading candidate to replace him.

Khmara is a seasoned special forces officer who has served in Alpha since 2011 and was appointed its commander in 2023. 

The unit is consistently among the most effective in Ukraine's defense forces, credited with destroying significant Russian equipment and personnel, often with drone support.

Shortly after announcing Maliuk's resignation, Zelensky signed a decree appointing Khmara as acting head of Ukraine's Security Service.

Maliuk's resignation follows closely after Zelensky appointed military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov to head the President's Office, making Maliuk the second senior security figure to leave his post in a short span.

Hello, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,412 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far:

An oil extraction plant in Dnipro was damaged in a Russian drone strike on Jan. 5, spilling about 300 tons of sunflower oil onto city streets, Mayor Borys Filatov said.

The spill forced the closure of the city's embankment to traffic for two to three days, Filatov said.

The facility reportedly belongs to Bunge, a U.S. agribusiness company based in St. Louis, Missouri, according to Filatov.

The mayor did not specify what the enterprise produced, but said it was a ""civilian site.""

""(Vladimir) Putin is targeting American business — striking U.S. investments in Ukraine and humiliating American interests,"" Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent following the attack. 

""This must stop. Washington must act to defend American business.""

Bunge told the Kyiv Independent that the damage to part of its facility in Dnipro is still being assessed and that the company is working with local authorities to mitigate the impact.

""We can confirm that there were no injuries at the facility, and our immediate focus is on the safety of the people at the site and restoring operations,"" the spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent, adding that the company currently has no additional details on the consequences of the attack.

The damaged facility is reportedly an oil plant related to Oleina, one of Ukraine's largest brands of bottled sunflower oil. The plant specializes in processing, refining, and bottling sunflower oil, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Liga.net.

The attack also damaged a car and a power line, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko said.

Local authorities reported no civilian casualties at the time of publication.

Ukrainian troops have been repelling repeated Russian assaults near the village of Hryshyne over the past two days, while the situation in the town of Myrnohrad remains difficult in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Jan. 5.

The Russian army ""has increased pressure"" in the Pokrovsk area, which includes the cities of Pokrovsk, Dobropillia, Myrnohrad, Novohrodivka, and Selydove, since the beginning of 2026, the statement read.

Russian forces are attempting to bypass the area primarily at night to minimize their losses, advancing via the settlements of Hryshyne and Rodynske, according to the 7th Rapid Response Corps.

Hryshyne lies northwest of Pokrovsk, while Rodynske is to the north. Both settlements are less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the embattled city.

Ukrainian forces killed over 30 Russian soldiers and destroyed up to 10 pieces of equipment in the area over the past two days, the corps said.

Ukrainian forces are also observing small Russian groups of six to eight soldiers attempting to operate north of Pokrovsk.

The situation in Myrnohrad, a satellite town of Pokrovsk, remains difficult, according to the statement.

The 7th Rapid Response Corps, in conjunction with the 14th Operational Brigade of Ukraine's National Guard, is concentrating on securing the northern part of the city, containing Russian forces in central areas, and preventing them from bringing in equipment from the south.

Russian troops are attempting to gain a foothold on Myrnohrad's eastern outskirts, but Ukrainian forces ""remain in control of the situation,"" the corps said.

Russia launched five missile strikes on Kharkiv on Jan. 5, injuring a 58-year-old man and causing ""very significant damage"" to the city's energy infrastructure, local authorities said.

The injured man, an employee of a company near the strike site, was hospitalized, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov and the Kharkiv Oblast Prosecutor's Office.

The first strike occurred at 12:45 p.m. local time, followed by four more at intervals of several minutes. 

The first two strikes hit an industrial area in the Slobidskyi district, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram. The mayor did not specify where the remaining strikes landed.

""The enemy deliberately launched five missile strikes on Kharkiv's energy infrastructure. The damage is very significant,"" Terekhov said.

The mayor added that while it is possible to strengthen the protection of facilities, ""no concrete structures can withstand five ballistic missiles.""

Russia attacked a facility where local residents were receiving humanitarian aid with three drones, killing a 64-year-old man, and injuring a 79-year-old woman and a 71-year-old man in the Dariivka community in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Jan. 5.

Those injured suffered blast injuries and shrapnel wounds. The victims were taken to the hospital in moderate condition, Prokudin said.

Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Jan. 5 that it had thwarted Russia's latest attempt to launch an attack on the Kupiansk sector in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast by using the Soyuz (""union"" in English) gas pipeline.

Russia attempted to use the pipeline for ""a covert exit and further accumulation of forces"" in the Kupiansk area, in an operation that involved around 50 people, according to the 7th Corps. It claimed it ""eliminated"" at least 40 of them.

Russia's recent pipeline operation had occurred north of Novoplatonivka, a village just five kilometers above the town of Borova, trying to move upward along the Oskil River in the direction of Kupiansk, the 7th Corps said.

While its latest pipeline operation failed to achieve its objectives, Russia continues to deploy its troops in small groups to infiltrate between positions, according to the 7th Corps.

The report comes as Russia tries to push across the front by launching heavy offensive operations on multiple axes, including in the Kupiansk sector, to recapture the city it lost to a 2022 Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Russian troops are trying to expand the combat zone near the state border area in Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts, Border Guard Service spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on Jan. 5 on national television.

The most active fighting is in the Khotyn and Yunakivka communities in Sumy Oblast, as well as the Vovchansk sector of the front line and near the settlements of Dvorichanske and Sotnytskyi Kozachok in Kharkiv Oblast, Demchenko said. 

Russian forces are also attempting to widen the combat zone near the Krasnopillia community and the border village of Hrabovske, Sumy Oblast, where fighting has continued for several weeks, Demchenko said.

In these areas, Russian forces are using small assault groups without heavy equipment, he said, adding: ""But the enemy cannot achieve results or advance deeper into our country's territory. And at the same time, it is suffering heavy losses.""

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 4 that he does not believe Ukraine attacked a residence used by Russian President Vladimir Putin, casting doubt on Moscow's claims following a recent phone call with Putin.

""We don't believe that happened now that we've been able to check,"" Trump told the reporters while aboard Air Force One.

""There is something that happened fairly nearby but had nothing to do with this. .... nobody knew at that moment. I mean, that was the first I heard about it. He said that his house was attacked,"" Trump added.

The allegation emerged as Ukraine and the United States were coordinating an updated peace framework, a timing Ukrainian officials described as deliberate.

On Dec. 29, Russia publicly accused Ukraine of launching 91 drones toward a residence used by Putin — a claim Putin personally conveyed to Trump during the phone call. Trump initially reacted to the allegation, saying he was ""very angry,"" before later expressing skepticism after reviewing additional information.

On Dec. 31, Trump shared a New York Post editorial titled ""Putin 'attack' bluster shows Russia is the one standing in the way of peace,"" which questioned the credibility of Moscow's account.

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has assessed that Ukraine did not target a residence used by Russian President Vladimir Putin, confirming Kyiv's immediate denial and undercutting Moscow's claims, U.S. officials told CNN on Jan. 1.

Answering a question about his New Year's resolution of ""peace on Earth"", Trump reiterated his goal of ending the Russia-Ukraine war. ""We just hope that Russia and Ukraine get it settled,"" he said.

""25,000 to 30,000 soldiers are being killed every single month. And they're not from America. They're from Russia and they're from Ukraine,"" Trump added. ""And if I could get it stopped, I'd like to get it stopped. And I think we will.""

The Jan. 6 leaders' meeting will focus on long-term security arrangements for Ukraine.





""(Indian Prime Minister Narendra) Modi is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said.

Despite leading several of Ukraine's most consequential operations against Russia, Maliuk's tenure has been marked by controversy, particularly over his involvement in actions targeting anti-corruption bodies.

Russian troops are attempting to close in on Kupiansk from the north and east, aiming to solidify their presence on the western side of the Oskil River. 

The move comes as Zelensky lays the groundwork for either a peace deal and Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, or the continuation of the war, with recent appointments aimed at preparing the country for both.

Russian forces launched 165 strike drones overnight, of which roughly 100 were Shahed-type drones, according to Zelensky. Two of the four wounded victims are in serious condition. 

Russia had publicly accused Ukraine of launching 91 drones toward a residence used by Putin — a claim Putin personally conveyed to Trump during the phone call.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 4, Trump said: ""We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security."" 

The Energia factory in Lipetsk Oblast produces components for Russian missiles and drones, including batteries for the Iskander ballistic missile system and cruise missiles.

Kyiv is ready for ""both options,"" Zelensky said: the diplomatic track, or ongoing active defense against Russia. ""Ukraine will never surrender,"" he said.



The death toll has risen as rescue workers uncover the remains of more victims buried beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment building. 

Deineko has been appointed as an adviser to Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko. A permanent replacement to lead the State Border Guard Service will be named shortly, Zelensky said. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Thousands of households in Berlin might have to wait several days for power, amid freezing temperatures after an outage caused by possible arson. Mayor Kai Wegner called the attack ""terrorism.""

Electricity has been restored to thousands of households in the southwest of the German capital, Berlin, after a power outage hit some 45,000 homes and 2,220 businesses on Saturday, the grid operator said on Sunday.

The local electricity operator Stromnetz Berlin reported that power has been restored to about 14,000 households and nearly 500 commercial customers.

Several large hospitals were also back online.

Earlier, Stromnetz Berlin said it could take until Thursday afternoon to remedy the problem completely with thousands remaining without electricity in the district of Steglitz-Zehlendorf.

The outage, which leaves many of those homes without heating, comes as the city is experiencing a bout of very cold winter weather.


Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner on Sunday classified the attack on the city's power infrastructure as terrorism, saying it went beyond arson or sabotage.

""This is already terrorism,"" the conservative politician of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats (CDU) told regional broadcaster RBB.

He said a left-wing extremist group targeted critical infrastructure and endangered lives, including elderly people relying on medical equipment, and families with young children.

""We must catch these perpetrators now,"" Wegner said

The loss of power was caused by a fire at a cable link over the Teltow Canal that police are investigating as a possible arson attack after a letter sent to authorities claimed responsibility.

""We are also in contact with the Federal Criminal Police Office, with the federal level, because this is no joke but a terrorist attack,"" Wegner said.

The affected district contains several care homes and medical facilities. Emergency services have transferred residents from at least two homes for the elderly.

A spokeswoman for Berlin's Senator for Economic Affairs Franziska Giffey said authorities believed that a malicious act was behind the fire.

A Berlin police spokesman also said that it was ""credible"" that the letter was written by a left-wing extremist group calling itself the ""Vulkangruppe"" (Volcano Group), as the letter claimed.

He said, however, that the investigation was still ongoing.

A document titled ""Cutting off the Power to the Rulers"" was received from the alleged perpetrators claiming responsibility for Saturday's attack saying the gas power plant in Berlin-Lichterfelde was ""successfully sabotaged.""

""Power outages were not the target of the action, but rather the fossil energy industry,"" the group claims in the letter.

The head of the Berlin branch of the GdP police union, Stephan Weh, called the attack ""senseless"" and without any legitimation, ""even if the suspected arsonists again throw together all sorts of hypocritical reasons in a pamphlet on the end of the world.""

He called for an ""unideological"" debate on video surveillance in view of the fact that so many thousands of people were affected.

""Cameras mounted on electricity poles could help investigations but also have a preventive effect. We do without protective technology in the public space just because some people cry out loudly and cite Orwell's '1984,'"" he said. 

His words were echoed by Alexander Schirp, the director of the regional business associations in Berlin and Brandenburg (UVB).

""We are expecting damage costing millions to plants and machines and owing to high losses in revenue,"" he said, calling for better protection of infrastructure against attacks and accidents.

""This is a serious problem and stokes a feeling of insecurity in the business world,"" he said.

Stromnetz Berlin said there had been a similar attack on two power pylons in the city's southeast in September that was politically motivated.

			Analysts suggest lightning offensive made possible by cracks in Moscow's much-vaunted weapons systems

Russian-made air shields that Venezuela spent billions of dollars on failed to protect Nicolas Maduro from US forces.

Footage taken early on Saturday in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, showed no air defence active as US aircraft circled triumphantly in smoke-filled skies following sweeping strikes.

Some analysts have suggested that the lightning raid, which saw elite US forces descend on a highly fortified compound in Caracas to snatch its president from his bed, was made possible by cracks in Moscow's much-vaunted air defence systems.

“Ground defence systems, especially Russian ones, suffer from a built-in disadvantage against modern air power that cannot be bridged,” Daniel Bachmat, a military analyst, said.

“They cannot withstand the combination of real-time intelligence, electronic warfare and precision weapons. In 2022, this was a minority opinion, but recent confirmations from Iran, Venezuela, and to some extent Ukraine… make this opinion more mainstream.”

Geography is also thought to have posed a challenge. Russian air defence is designed for flat terrain while Venezuela's mountainous coastal geography can mask low-flying aircraft.

Dan Caine, the US joint chiefs of staff, told reporters on Saturday that the US had dismantled and disabled Venezuela's air defence systems as helicopters neared Caracas in order to guarantee their safe passage to the compound.

“Those who rely on Russian weapons, air defence in particular, need to rethink in light of the past year,” Mr Bachmat said.

It was another sign of vulnerability after Israel destroyed four Russian-made S-300 air defence systems in Iran in 2024, one in April and three in a single weekend in October.

Mr Maduro had previously bragged about his Russian-designed air defence systems, which included 12 batteries of S-300VM systems, nine Buk-M2E systems, Igla-S anti-aircraft missiles and S-125 Pechora-2M units.

“Any military force in the world knows the power of the Igla-S and Venezuela has no less than 5,000,” he said in October 2025 of the Russian-made short-range low-altitude anti-aircraft missiles at his disposal.

Analysts have claimed that US forces destroyed the Buk-M2E surface-to-air missile system stationed at the La Carlota airbase in Caracas, while the S-300VM batteries never activated.

“The speed with which these systems were neutralised… signals a catastrophic failure of Russian export air defence technology against fifth-generation Western air power,” said Shanaka Anslem Perera, a geopolitical analyst.

“Every S-300 and S-400 customer, including China, India, Turkey, Iran, Algeria and Egypt, now confronts empirical evidence that Russian systems cannot defeat American fifth-generation capabilities in operational conditions,” he said, describing it as a “strategic crisis” for Moscow.

With a range of up to 200 kilometres (125 miles), the S-300 is designed to intercept both aircraft and missiles and is thought to be among the world's most formidable systems.

“Air defence systems are Russia's primary export for deterring American intervention,” he added.

Decades of sustained acquisition of Russian military equipment saw Venezuela's conventional military emerge as a notch above its peers in Latin America.

This shift was spearheaded by Mr Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez, a former professional soldier who after coming to power in 1999 channelled` oil wealth into the military and relied on Russian military hardware because of an informal US embargo.

Venezuela's military has as a result been defined by its Soviet-era weapons systems such as Su-30 fighter jets, T-72 battle tanks and S-300, Pechora and Buk anti-aircraft missiles.

Recommended

In the years before 2009, Venezuela spent more than $4 (£2.9bn) billion on weapons from Russia, including 24 Sukhoi fighter jets, and received a loan that year for $2 billion (£1.48bn) to purchase 92 tanks and a S-300 missile system for taking down fighter jets.

Russia and Venezuela have been close allies for two decades, signing a strategic partnership treaty in Moscow in 2024.

On Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry called for the release of Mr Maduro and his wife from US custody and expressed “solidarity with the Venezuelan people in the face of armed aggression”.

It is understood that Mr Maduro reached out to Vladimir Putin to plead for assistance in October as the US increased military pressure, asking Moscow for help overhauling eight engines and five radars in Russia and acquiring 14 sets of what were thought to be Russian missiles.

He also asked for help restoring several Russian Sukhoi Su-30MK2 aircraft already in Venezuela's possession, The Washington Post reported.

Alexei Zhuravlyov, the deputy chairman of Russia's parliamentary defence committee, later said that Russia would consider providing its most advanced hypersonic missiles to Venezuela, warning: “The Americans may be in for some surprises.”

Instead, the US may consider the episode confirmation that Russia is little more than a “paper tiger”.

			Maduro's extradition marks the climax of US secretary of state's ambition to restore democracy to Central America

In 2017, Marco Rubio was placed under police protection when Venezuela's security chief was accused of plotting to assassinate him.

The former Florida senator had long been a thorn in the side of Nicolas Maduro's regime, taking to the Senate floor in 2014 to scold the Obama administration for its “shameful” failure to sanction the strongman leader.

A decade later, the US secretary of state finally got his revenge when the US military captured Mr Maduro in a daring pre-dawn raid.

Dubbed the “viceroy of Venezuela” by the US media, Mr Rubio, who has taken on an ever-growing list of titles in the Trump administration – serving as national security adviser, acting national security adviser and US archivist – may just have added another one to his ledger.

For the US, the extradition of Mr Maduro marks the culmination of an extraordinary pressure campaign that began in September, when the Pentagon started to build up military forces in the region and blow up boats accused of “narco-trafficking”.

For Mr Rubio, a politician who frequently describes himself as the son of Cuban exiles, building his political identity on his family story, it marks the climax of a lifelong ambition to restore democracy to Central America.

“This is part of his DNA, it's something he has worked on his whole life,” a former aide told The Telegraph.

“His parents passed away without ever seeing freedom. He fundamentally believes in freedom and democracy because that was taken away from his family.”

The secretary of state is said to have played a vital role in steering the Trump administration towards ousting Venezuela's leader.

Now, with no long-term successor to govern the country of 29 million people, the president has tasked Mr Rubio with helping to “run” Venezuela, fix its oil infrastructure and usher in a stable government, to add to his long list of responsibilities.

“The transition process will not be easy, but there is no one more capable in the US government than secretary Marco Rubio for this moment,” said one former adviser.

Known as the “virtual secretary of state for Latin America” during Donald Trump's first term, Mr Rubio's proficiency in Spanish and close ties to Latin American leaders and the Venezuelan opposition make him a natural pointman for the president, a senior official told The Washington Post.

Described by sources as a “Latin America whisperer”, Mr Rubio allegedly had a direct line to the president during his first term when it came to the socialist governments of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, former officials told Politico.

He organised a meeting between Mr Trump and the wife of a jailed Venezuelan opposition leader in 2017, and received weekly briefings about the administration's crackdown on Latin American governments, the outlet reported.

His sharp criticism had long been a source of frustration for Mr Maduro, who had branded him the “craziest of the crazies” and whose head of security forces, Diosdado Cabello Rondon, was said to be behind a plot to assassinate the outspoken senator, according to a US intelligence memo.

“It sent shockwaves throughout the senator's orbit,” one former aide recalled, adding that Mr Rubio was unperturbed by the threats.

Although it was never proven, the threat prompted federal officials to provide Mr Rubio and his family with round-the-clock protection.

Central to the success of Saturday's high-stakes operation, insiders say, is the close relationship between Mr Trump and his secretary of state, who has grown into one of the most powerful advisers of his second term.

“I think the president really respects him,” a former Rubio adviser said.

The pair see each other nearly every day, have offices next to each other in the White House and have a warm public relationship, which has resulted in the president bestowing titles on his adviser like a medieval king.

Speaking to reporters after Mr Maduro's arrest, Mr Trump was vague about who would run the Latin American country, saying “the people that are standing right behind me” will do so for a “period of time”, as he gestured to his secretary of state and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary.

The president also hailed Mr Rubio's initial talks with Mr Maduro's vice president, Delcey Rodríguez, who was formally made interim leader on Sunday, saying “she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again”.

Deftly dealing with Ms Rodríguez's response that Venezuela “will never return to being the colony of another empire”, Mr Rubio clarified on Sunday that the US would not govern Venezuela day-to-day other than enforcing an existing “oil quarantine” on the country.

The military operation – the fastest toppling of a regime in the modern era – also represents a political victory for him within an administration that includes staunch opponents of regime change, notably JD Vance.

“I see [the military operation] really as the merging of minds between secretary Rubio and president Trump,” said Carrie Filipetti, a former Venezuela and Cuba adviser at the state department.

Pushing back on suggestions that Mr Trump is averse to foreign intervention, Ms Filipetti said the president has “always had a penchant for these displays of American might”, pointing to his strikes on Iran and plans to send naval assets to the coast of Venezuela in his first term, which she said were stymied by bureaucratic hurdles.

“It very much has Trump's mentality to it of reinforcing American strength and power,” she said. “But I think the specificity and the precision screams Marco Rubio.”

During the president's first term, Mr Rubio was instrumental in pushing for sanctions against Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, the so-called “troika of tyranny”.

With the fall of Venezuela's regime, former aides have suggested the secretary of state and the president may view ridding the Western hemisphere of communist dictatorships as “part of their legacy”.

On Sunday evening, Mr Trump set pulses racing in Colombia too, calling the country's Left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, a “sick man” who “likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”.

Asked if the US would pursue military action against the country, he said: “It sounds good to me.”

Dismissing comparisons to the US invasion of Iraq, which led to nearly nine years of conflict and the death of around 5,000 servicemen, a former Rubio adviser pointed out that the Venezuelan people had voted against Mr Maduro's government for a decade and argued that they were “excited for what's ahead”.

Meanwhile, they said: “Cuban Americans see the fall of the regime in Venezuela as having a domino effect that will directly impact Cuba.”

Mr Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, 69, are expected to appear in court on Monday, facing charges of narco-terrorism.

As the fallen leader contemplates a future locked up in a US prison, Mr Rubio may well be setting his eyes on his next prize – this one much closer to home.

Commentary

Recently, President Donald Trump unveiled his National Security Strategy, marking a departure from the approaches of his predecessors. To varying degrees, aspects of the strategy resemble a modern iteration of the Monroe Doctrine, as outlined by America's fifth president, James Monroe.

Of course, the new version goes far beyond what Monroe envisioned two centuries ago. In short, Monroe wanted America to avoid entanglements in European affairs. His goal was to protect the Americas and keep foreign nations from interfering in the Western Hemisphere—a vision known as Manifest Destiny. Trump has a similar objective, but his “America First” policy encompasses a broader scope.

Certainly, Trump is focused on preventing distant foreign adversaries from subverting democracy and national security in our hemisphere. But he is also intent on preventing neighboring nations in Central and South America from undermining stability in the United States. How is the Trump team managing all these priorities simultaneously?

Trump is utilizing diplomacy (business and peace deals), economic pressure (tariffs), and kinetic action (decisive rapid strikes) to keep threats at bay. First, he is securing the southern border and expediting the deportation process for a broad range of foreign nationals who disregard the rule of law.

Next, Trump is working with global partners to dismantle the arms, drug, and human trafficking cartels that wreak havoc in the region. Notably, China, Iran, and Russia are reportedly involved in these activities, as their influence extends into Latin America and into North America.

In a positive development, the Trump administration is receiving valuable cooperation from Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum and her top law enforcement official, Omar Garcia Harfuch, a courageous officer who survived an assassination attempt and continues to combat organized crime at all levels. He is also gaining the support of most of Mexico's governors and legal institutions. Although dismantling the cartels will be a long-term endeavor, progress is being made through intelligence sharing, growing public opposition, and revulsion toward the cartels' brutal tactics.

Third, in tandem with these efforts, the administration is leveraging trade policy to persuade China to halt its export of fentanyl precursors to Mexico. A “trust but verify” approach is being taken to ensure compliance. Meanwhile, dozens of drug boats carrying narcotics from Bolivia, Colombia, and Venezuela (prior to Maduro's capture) are being intercepted at sea.

In very recent developments, a lightning-fast operation—planned over several months—resulted in the capture of Venezuelan socialist leader Nicolás Maduro by American law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and armed forces. Naval and Coast Guard pressure had been mounting on the Maduro regime, deterring his attempts to flee to an authoritarian ally. It's possible that someone within Maduro's inner circle provided critical intelligence that led to his capture. The seizure of drug vessels and crude oil tankers added further pressure. The fall of Maduro sends a clear message to other regional autocracies, as well as to China, Iran, and Russia.

Fourth, Trump is seeking to curtail the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) activities through its Belt and Road Initiative in Latin America, including in port and infrastructure development. He is also pursuing greater control over the Panama Canal and working to eliminate CCP-linked surveillance at transportation and communication hubs. Preventing the CCP from buying land near U.S. military bases and blocking propaganda efforts in American schools are also key objectives.

Fortunately, recent elections in several Latin American countries—including Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Peru, and Paraguay—have ushered in more conservative-leaning leaders. These governments can play a role in reducing crime and supporting democratic values to counter the influence of socialist and communist regimes in the region.

Fifth, strengthening the U.S. armed forces—based on the “peace through strength” principle—is another pillar of the Trump Doctrine. Both defensive and offensive capabilities are being enhanced to project power and deter adversaries. Precision strikes in 2025 on targets in Nigeria, Syria, and Yemen, as well as Operation Midnight Hammer on Iran's nuclear facilities, illustrate Trump's willingness to act decisively against threats.

Sixth, the prudent use of both hard and soft power defines the modern Trump Doctrine, which expands upon the Monroe Doctrine in nuanced ways. Reaffirming traditional alliances and cultivating new partnerships in Africa, Asia, and Latin America supports the defense of free trade, liberty, and the rule of law in the Western Hemisphere.

The United States can assist developing nations without engaging in nation-building—provided those nations take responsibility for their own stability and avoid drawing the United States into conflicts that don't serve its vital national interests. Ideally, this principle will guide post-Maduro efforts in Venezuela to prevent a power vacuum and help restore freedom and opportunity for the Venezuelan people. Still, the outcome remains uncertain.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

MICHAEL E. O'HANLON is Philip H. Knight Chair in Defense and Strategy and Director of Research in the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. He is the author of the forthcoming book To Dare Mighty Things: U.S. Defense Strategy Since the Revolution.

 Why No One Should Have Expected Trump to Retreat

 Michael E. O'Hanlon

Citing his contempt for allies and his hostile attitude toward immigration, analysts and commentators often paint U.S. President Donald Trump's leadership style as a throwback to the isolationist ways of the nineteenth-century United States. This argument is half right. The essence and emphasis of Trump's national security policy does hark back to a number of early U.S. presidents, including James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, James Polk, William McKinley, and, at the turn of the twentieth century, Theodore Roosevelt. But none of those presidents were isolationist, and neither is Trump. The similarities, to the extent they exist, are of a different type, and they have more to do with maximizing American power than minimizing the U.S. role in the world.

Understanding Trump in historical perspective may at least provide modest solace for those who see his foreign policy as radical and unprecedented. Doing so should also remind Americans that they have always been highly audacious on the global stage. That can be a good thing, when the United States is resolute in defense of interests and allies. It can also, however, get the country into trouble—as it has in the past—if Americans forget their proclivity for muscular action and delude themselves into thinking they are somehow an inherently peaceful people.

The United States has poked its nose into international affairs since its earliest days, waging a quasi war with France and its sponsored pirates in the Caribbean from 1798 to 1800 and facing Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean from 1801 to 1815. It spent the nineteenth century expanding its territorial borders while also becoming increasingly active in the Pacific Ocean and Asia. After a few land wars and a more serious buildup of its navy, by the turn of the twentieth century the United States was consciously entering the club of great powers, sizing its naval buildups by reference to other powers' capabilities. Washington did try to stay out of European wars, but it was still dragged into World War I in 1917. The only time the United States can be said to have truly attempted a form of isolationism was in the 1920s and 1930s, when it dismantled most of its military capabilities and disengaged from global affairs. But even though U.S. grand strategy may have tended toward isolationism in that period, U.S. defense strategy still progressed, with new concepts and technologies developed for carrier warfare, aerial combat, and amphibious assaults. As the United States got wrapped up in World War II, those advances proved crucial. Once the war ended and the Iron Curtain began to descend, proponents of American isolationism became and remained rare.

Like almost all of his predecessors, Trump has revealed himself to be a highly assertive internationalist rather than an isolationist. Since taking office in January 2025, he has claimed to have resolved eight global conflicts; engaged in persistent efforts to end the war in Ukraine; recommitted to NATO at the alliance's 2025 summit; conducted a brief but significant bombing of Iranian nuclear sites; advanced a modest but real buildup of the U.S. military; and, most recently, captured Venezuela's president and taken a regrettably lethal approach toward suspected drug smugglers in and around Venezuelan waters. Increasing American power is thus the centerpiece of his national security policy, paralleling nineteenth-century expansionist ideals and early-twentieth-century naval and industrial ambitions.

Fortifying American power is not in itself a bad thing. But it is not enough to succeed in building a peaceful world or to protect the United States in today's world. And the mere fact that Trump's national security policies have various historical precedents hardly guarantees their success. What worked in the nineteenth century may not be effective in the twenty-first. Moreover, despite a generally strong track record, U.S. policymakers have made plenty of mistakes when devising strategies for national security throughout the history of the republic. Despite what many early presidents did to build up the United States, they failed to establish a sustainable national security policy that would prevent the two world wars. And even though Trump has thankfully not dismantled any American alliances to date, his nationalist policies, including tariffs, have undermined the sense of common purpose that has bound the Western world for 80 years and prevented World War III—at least so far.

The history of U.S. foreign policy and defense strategy has been almost exclusively one of assertion. For 101 years after George Washington was inaugurated as the first U.S. president, in 1789, until the Battle of Wounded Knee effectively ended armed battles with Native Americans in 1890, the United States pursued a grand strategy of expansionism, taking what had been a sliver of a country along the Atlantic coast and turning it into a continental power. The military forces and operations that supported this grand strategy—a mix of federal forces and militias—were usually quite small in scale, numbering at most in the low tens of thousands, except during the Civil War. But this was not because the United States was pacifist or isolationist; it simply did not need anything larger. These small forces were ruthlessly efficient in how they operated, winning hundreds of battles against Native American tribes, often through divide-and-conquer techniques, and a war against Mexico from 1846 to 1848.

As the nation grew, so did the United States' confidence. In 1803, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson bought, in a peaceful exchange, what would become roughly a third of the continental United States from France in the Louisiana Purchase. Consolidating control over those lands took several decades, but by 1812, the United States was already bold enough to declare war against Great Britain. Washington had legitimate grievances against the British, most notably over the impressment of American sailors onto British ships, but the fact that a young United States was prepared to fight the world's reigning naval hegemon over the issue spoke volumes about its strategic character and assertiveness. So did the U.S. posture toward the British colony of Canada, which Washington tried to bring into the fight on its side, toying with the idea of farther northward expansionism, although in the end the attempt proved too militarily ambitious.

Then came the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which warned Europe against intervening in the Western Hemisphere. That a still mostly pre-industrial and militarily weak United States would claim the exclusive right to supervise geopolitics in all of the Americas was a breathtaking display of chutzpah. Although its practical implications were modest, it revealed an American spirit and ambition that are hard to square with the concepts of isolationism or strategic minimalism.

Over the next few decades, the United States continued to consolidate and extend its control of western lands, including through the infamous Trail of Tears, which forcibly relocated the many Native Americans remaining in the eastern third of the country to its center, during the administrations of President Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren. Then, from 1846 to 1848, there was the U.S.-Mexican War—probably the biggest and most audacious land grab in American history, even if it was nicely dressed up in the concept of “manifest destiny.” What began as a modest territorial dispute led Congress to declare war on Mexico and, after the United States captured Mexico City, demand the vast swaths of land that now make up the present-day American southwest, including California, in the ensuing peace deal. There was certainly nothing isolationist or defensive about the war or the peace agreement that ended it.

By 1890, the United States had become a continental power. Next it was to become a great power. To be sure, Washington still tried to avoid land wars in Europe. It kept its army small, although big enough to defeat Spain in the Spanish-American War of 1898—gaining control over Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines in the process.

Despite its acquisition of the Philippines, Washington did not wind up pursuing territorial imperialism on a large scale. But its navy was developing the capability to compete on the world stage. Waves of construction starting in the 1880s meant that by the time World War I began, the U.S. Navy had the third-highest tonnage of warships in the world. The key figures of the late nineteenth century who drove this process—the naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Roosevelt, McKinley, and others—saw naval power as crucial for the United States' standing in the world. The United States had found a taste for a much more expansive foreign and defense policy.



At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Root reforms and Dick Act—named for U.S. Secretary of War Elihu Root and Senator Charles Dick, respectively—restructured and strengthened the U.S. Department of War, including the National Guard. In 1904, the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine stipulated that not only was the Western Hemisphere closed off to outside colonial intervention, but Washington would also have an active say over any key political and strategic matters that it chose in the neighborhood. The corollary was used to justify numerous U.S. interventions in Latin America in the following decades, including in Mexico and the Caribbean, as well as U.S. support for secessionists in Colombia, which led to the establishment of Panama and ultimately paved the way for the U.S. construction of and sovereignty over the Panama Canal. (Trump, for his part, has just echoed the Roosevelt Corollary with his own Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, as declared in the December 2025 National Security Strategy.)

The quarter century that began with the Wilson administration, during World War I, and ended with the U.S. entry into World War II demonstrated how impractical American attempts at isolationism, even if rare, really are. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson campaigned for reelection on staying out of World War I—even after German U-boat torpedoes killed many hundreds of Americans crossing the Atlantic, including on the Lusitania, a British ocean liner sunk in 1915. But despite wanting no part of the war and viewing French and British imperialism as one of its underlying causes, in 1916 Wilson signed the Big Navy Act, which led to another substantial round of American naval shipbuilding that allowed the United States to wade more deeply into the realm of great-power competition. By the spring of 1917, driven by the resumption of unrestricted German submarine warfare as well as the interception of the Zimmermann Telegram, in which Germany tried to persuade Mexico to attack the United States, Wilson had changed his mind about staying out of the conflict and persuaded Congress to declare war. By the latter part of 1918, the United States had built up a military of four million men, two million of whom were in Europe when the war ended in November. The United States was not yet the arsenal of democracy; in fact, most of the weapons its troops used in the war were manufactured in France. But it was rapidly becoming the most powerful country on earth.

After World War I, U.S. policymakers did engage in true isolationism, in the 1920s and 1930s. As the U.S. Senate rejected Wilson's case for ratifying the League of Nations treaty, which was aimed at preventing future war, it passed the Washington Naval Treaty, which gave cover to a naval drawdown during the 1920s as the United States pulled back from the world for the first time in its history. The isolationism of that day gave rise to, among other things, the dismantling of most of the U.S. Army, as well as the Neutrality Acts in the mid-1930s, which prevented Washington from even selling arms to the world's major democracies. The advent of World War II, however, brought this short period of American isolationism—less than ten percent of the country's history—to an end.

During Trump's first term and campaign for reelection, it did seem as if he might change the essence of U.S. grand strategy and defense to a form of minimalism. He complained about the excessive size of the defense budget, questioned what the NATO and U.S.-Korean alliances were for, doubted whether Ukraine mattered to American interests, and advocated greater prioritization of matters close to home, notably along the U.S.-Mexican border.

Perhaps some of these ideas will resurface, and indeed, border issues and immigration have been a central focus of Trump's domestic and foreign policy. But Trump's second term has been characterized much more by maximalism than any form of minimalism. His administration has brokered peace negotiations around the world, if not as successfully as he claims; championed NATO, if offending European partners in the process; authorized the use of force against Iranian nuclear facilities and Venezuela's sitting president; and advocated for greater U.S. defense spending. He has dismantled zero American alliances. The most dramatic pullback of forces that the Trump administration has proposed to date concerns a single U.S. Army brigade in Romania—several thousand troops out of a total of around 100,000 in Europe.

Trump's actions have thus dispelled any illusion that he is an isolationist, and given the history of the United States, no one should have expected him to be. Apart from a few U.S. presidents in the interwar period—Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover—isolationism really does not reside in the DNA of American grand strategists. Indeed, Wilson's about-face on World War I serves as a good reminder that U.S. involvement in Eurasian conflict is not a matter of simple preference. Wilson wanted to avoid war just as Trump now does. It is indeed commendable to abhor violence and to want to avoid traps like the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Vietnam, as Trump asserts he does. But preventing great-power war over the past 80 years has required a system of American alliances and forward military deployments that the country would be remiss to discard now. Perhaps Trump will eventually reach this conclusion, but it is too soon to really be sure.

Trump's internationalism—and the similarity in his thinking to that of former presidents such as Jackson, Polk, McKinley, and Roosevelt—does not mean that his often impulsive and idiosyncratic decision-making style is a positive thing for U.S. foreign policy. But in his approach to national security, Trump is not nearly as unprecedented a figure in American history as is sometimes alleged. His philosophy centers on the pursuit of national power, not simply as the main priority but as the overwhelming fixation. Yet if not leavened with a more inclusive vision that takes the legitimate interests of other countries into account, such a simplistic pursuit of national interest can fail catastrophically. What may have worked for the first half of the country's history—ethics aside—did not work thereafter, and it is unlikely to begin working now.

Mark Kelly's military retirement pay as punishment over ‘illegal orders' video","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/politics/pentagon-cuts-mark-kellys-retirement-pay-punishment","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:26:15 GMT","


            Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced Monday that the Pentagon is taking administrative action to punish Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain, by moving to cut his retirement pay for participating in a video where he and other Democratic lawmakers reminded US service members of their duty to refuse illegal orders.
    


            Hegseth said in a post on X that the US military has initiated proceedings to reduce the amount of retirement pay Kelly receives and has issued a secretarial letter of censure, which would stand as a written reprimand but have no practical consequences for the Arizona Democrat.
    


            “In response to Senator Mark Kelly's seditious statements — and his pattern of reckless misconduct — the Department of War is taking administrative action against Captain Mark E. Kelly, USN (Ret),” Hegseth posted on X. “The department has initiated retirement grade determination proceedings under 10 U.S.C. § 1370(f), with reduction in his retired grade resulting in a corresponding reduction in retired pay.”
    


            Kelly responded later Monday morning, saying he wouldn't be intimidated and intended to fight the action.
    


            “If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn't get it. I will fight this with everything I've got — not for myself, but to send a message back that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don't get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government,” he said in a post on X.
    


            Hegseth's letter of censure for Kelly, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, includes an apparent threat of criminal prosecution if he engages in similar conduct going forward.
    


            “If you continue to engage in conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline, you may subject yourself to criminal prosecution or further administrative action,” the letter from Hegseth says.
    


            It also describes Kelly's “pattern” of alleged misconduct that represents a serious “breach” of standards for a retired military officer.
    


            “When viewed in totality, your pattern of conduct demonstrates specific intent to counsel servicemembers to refuse lawful orders. This pattern demonstrates that you were not providing abstract legal education about the duty to refuse patently illegal orders. You were specifically counseling servicemembers to refuse particular operations that you have characterized as illegal,” Hegseth wrote.
    


            “Your conduct has had, and continues to have, a detrimental impact on military discipline and good order,” Hegseth added. “For the reasons stated above, I hereby formally CENSURE you for conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline in the armed forces and conduct unbecoming an officer.”
    


            Behind closed doors, Hegseth has been weighing his options to punish Kelly for participating in the video, ranging from reducing the retired US Navy captain's rank and pension to prosecuting him under military law, CNN has reported.
    


            In the video that triggered the Trump administration's calls for consequences, six Democratic lawmakers said that “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”
    


            Although the video didn't reference what orders service members might be receiving that would potentially be illegal, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns repeatedly about the legality of US military strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and the US military's deployment to cities over the protest of governors.
    


            Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, a Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said last month it's not appropriate for the military to try to punish Kelly.
    


            Asked by CNN if it's appropriate to do so, Wicker shook his head. And after a follow up question, he replied, “You asked me that question, and my answer is no.”
    


            In November, Hegseth requested advice from the Navy secretary, who oversees the military branch Kelly served in for more than two decades, on how to proceed to potentially punish him for participating in the video, which Hegseth has claimed amounted to serious violations of the military's code of justice.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Americans among foreign tourists stranded on a desert island in Yemen","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/travel/socotra-island-yemen-foreign-tourists-stranded-intl","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:30:44 GMT","


            Scores of foreign nationals who traveled to a remote Indian Ocean island seeking adventure have become stranded there as simmering tensions between warring Yemeni parties and their backers disrupt travel.
    


            European and American tourists who spoke to CNN said that up to “hundreds” are stuck on the Yemeni island of Socotra, which sits between the Gulf of Aden, the Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Sea, following a state of emergency that led to the closure of all ports of entry.
    


            While CNN cannot independently verify how many tourists are stranded on Socotra Island, it understands them to number scores at least.
    


            Known for its unique biodiversity, the island is a classified UNESCO World Heritage Site and has become a regional hub for adventure tourism, especially among expats flying from the nearby United Arab Emirates. Visitors can expect to see dramatic cliffs, pristine white sand beaches and exotic flora like the dragon's blood tree.
    


These dragon's blood trees exist in only one place on Earth. Now their survival is under threat



            Its distance from the mainland has shielded Socotra from the worst of Yemen's long-running conflict. But regional tensions that last week culminated in Saudi strikes on a UAE-linked shipment in Yemen have now had an impact.
    


            Last week, the United States Department of State said it had received reports of “closures, cancelations and redirected flights on commercial airline travel to and from the island of Socotra” to nearby airports.
    


            The State Department advised against all travel to Yemen, adding that “the US government is unable to provide emergency or routine consular services to US citizens in Yemen, including Socotra.”
    


            One American citizen in Socotra, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, said that while tourists are physically safe, they are unsure when they might be able to return home.
    


            “There's a lot (of tourists),” the American tourist said, adding that his group had started making contact with others in neighboring camp sites.
    


            “There's all sorts of Westerners here. There's hundreds of them.”
    


            Rocky Road Travel, a Berlin-based tourism agency with at least 14 people stuck in Socotra, said it had contacted US embassies in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, as well as multiple European missions in both the UAE and Saudi Arabia, for assistance.
    


            Tourists on the island told CNN that embassies have been able to provide little help so far. The ongoing conflict means few Western nations have a diplomatic presence in Yemen, with most handling its concerns from nearby capitals.
    


Saudi Arabia's dispute with the UAE exposes a deeper regional power struggle



            CNN has reached out to the UAE and Saudi Arabian foreign ministries, as well as the US embassy in Riyadh, under which Yemen falls, for comment.
    


            Gerrit van Wijngaarden, a Dutch-Polish national who is in Socotra with his wife, their three children and a grandchild, had planned to stay on the island for a week, but has been there for 11 days, he said.
    


            “A lot of planes came, but no planes are leaving anymore. There are a lot of people on this island at the moment,” he told CNN, adding that embassies “unfortunately they cannot do anything because they don't have any offices in Yemen.”
    


            Van Wijngaarden said there are up to 100 Polish tourists on the island. The Polish embassy in Saudi Arabia, which handles the concerns of Polish citizens in Yemen, has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Amid flight cancellations, some tourists have been advised to take commercial ships from the island to Oman, and then fly back to Europe or the US, Van Wijngaarden said, adding that he himself has not made any arrangements to travel by boat.
    


            Socotra island has been controlled by Yemen's UAE-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) since 2020. The UAE maintains significant economic influence over the island, however, which some analysts say amounts to de facto control over the area.
    


            Tensions have flared over recent weeks in Yemen, after the STC overran the south of the country in early December, taking swathes of territory and expelling Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces from those areas.
    


            A regional feud then erupted into public view, as Saudi Arabia bombed the war-torn country's port city of Mukalla following accusations that two ships from the UAE had delivered weapons and combat vehicles to the separatist forces.
    


Two of the Middle East's most powerful countries are facing off in Yemen. Here's what to know



            The UAE has since announced a withdrawal of its forces from Yemen, but the situation remains volatile, especially after the STC announced it would hold an independence referendum in two years to help “exercise the right of self-determination for the Southern people.” That would include the island of Socotra.
    


            Flights are expected to resume this week, but it remains unclear when. For now, scores of visitors are waiting to return home.
    


            There's no shortage of food or other supplies, they say, but the situation is still frustrating. “We hope that somebody is doing something,” van Wijngaarden said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Greenland, Cuba, Iran and more: Here are the countries Trump has warned since his Venezuela strike","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/world/greenland-cuba-iran-trump-warning-intl","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:20:03 GMT","


            Since the seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by US forces at the weekend, US President Donald Trump and members of his administration have issued warnings to several other countries and territories – including Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Iran and Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark.
    


            Trump said Sunday: “We are in the business of having countries around us that are viable and successful and where the oil is allowed to freely come out.”
    


            “American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” Trump said.
    


            Here's what to know about what Trump has said in the last two days, and how some of those governments have responded.
    


            Trump repeated on Sunday that the US needs the huge north Atlantic island of Greenland “from the standpoint of national security.”
    


            “We need Greenland. … It's so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”
    


            Responding to Trump's latest comments, Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen said Monday that “the current and repeated rhetoric coming from the United States is entirely unacceptable. When the President of the United States speaks of ‘needing Greenland' and links us to Venezuela and military intervention, it is not only wrong. It is disrespectful.”
    


            “Our country is not an object in great-power rhetoric. We are a people. A country. A democracy,” Nielsen added.
    


            Trump has repeatedly stated that he wants to annex Greenland — a huge, resource-rich 836,000 square miles (2,166,000 square kilometer) island in the Atlantic and self-governing territory of Denmark — claiming that this is needed for American security purposes.
    


            Both Greenland and Denmark, a NATO ally of the US, are staunchly opposed to the idea.
    


            Trump had harsh words for Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Sunday, describing him as “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long.”
    


            When pressed by a reporter if those comments meant there could be an “operation” in Colombia in the future, Trump responded, “sounds good to me.”
    


            Petro defended his government's track record on combatting drug trafficking in a near 700-word post on X, including what he described as “the largest cocaine seizure in the world's history.”
    


            He added: “I am not illegitimate, nor am I a narco, I only have as assets my family home that I still pay for with my salary.”
    


            Petro said he has ordered targeted bombings against drug-linked armed groups while adhering to humanitarian law.
    


            However, cocaine production in Colombia has reach record highs, according to the the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.



            Petro, a former member of the M19 guerilla group, said later Monday that he would himself fight to defend Colombia.
    


            “I swore not to touch a weapon again … but for the homeland I will take up arms again,” he said.
    


            Petro angered the Trump administration and had his US visa canceled in September after calling on US soldiers to disobey orders.
    


            Trump said Sunday that military intervention was unnecessary in Cuba, a key ally of Venezuela, because it was “ready to fall.”
    


            “I don't think we need any action,” Trump said. “It looks like it's going down.”
    


            “I don't know if they're going to hold out, but Cuba now has no income,” he added. “They got all their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil.”
    


            But his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, called the Cuban government “a huge problem.”
    


            “I think they're in a lot of trouble, yes,” Rubio told NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday.
    


            “I'm not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now, in this regard, but I don't think it's any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.”
    


            “If I lived in Havana and I worked in the government, I'd be concerned,” Rubio said.
    


            At a rally Saturday in front of the US Embassy in Havana, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel promised not to let the Cuba-Venezuela alliance go down without a fight.
    


            “For Venezuela, of course for Cuba, we are willing to give even our own life, but at a heavy cost,” Díaz-Canel proclaimed.
    


            Trump has frequently accused Mexico of not doing enough to clamp down on drug cartels.
    


            On Sunday, he said drugs were “pouring” through Mexico and that “we're going to have to do something.”
    


            Trump added that the cartels in Mexico were “very strong” and “Mexico has to get their act together.”
    


            In a phone interview with Fox News, Trump said he had asked Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum if she wanted the US military's help in rooting out drug cartels.
    


            Sheinbaum again rejected the US intervention in Venezuela and the seizure of Maduro on Monday.
    


            “Mexico reaffirms a principle that is neither new nor open to ambiguity: We categorically reject intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.”
    


            Responding to Trump's accusations that Mexico has not done enough to combat drug trafficking cartels, Sheinbaum asserted: “Mexico cooperates with the United States, including for humanitarian reasons, to prevent fentanyl and other drugs from reaching its population, especially young people.”
    


            “We do not want fentanyl or any drug to get near any young person — whether in the United States, in Mexico, or anywhere else in the world.”
    


            Again rejecting the notion of US military action on Mexican soil, Sheinbaum said she did not think an invasion of Mexico was something the US was taking seriously.
    


            Trump also repeated his warning to Iran, where anti-government protests are into their second week.
    


            “If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump told reporters Sunday.
    


            Last week, Trump said that if Iran “kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.”
    


            One Iranian human rights group estimated Sunday that 16 people had been killed in the protests so far. CNN cannot verify that tally.
    


            At the end of last month, Trump warned Iran against any attempt to rebuild its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said he had heard Iran is “behaving badly … I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we're going to have to knock them down.”
    


            Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Sunday the ‌Islamic Republic “will not yield to the enemy” and rioters should be “put in their place.”
    


            The US bombed several of Iran's key nuclear facilities in June, amid Israel's 12-day war against the country. The attack ended what had been a stuttering process of bilateral US-Iran talks designed to rein in its nuclear program.

Trump previously said he's counting on American companies to rebuild Venezuela's battered oil industry. Meanwhile, Venezuelans are hunkering down amid apprehension of what may come next.



            • Trump's threats: Trump implied he could take military action in Colombia, told Mexico to get its “act together” on drugs, and said the US “needs Greenland.”



            Before even getting to the evidence of the charges against Nicolás Maduro, his lawyers are likely to argue that he is not legally in custody in the first place, CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller said.
    


            The first thing Maduro's legal team will do will be to “attack the arrest and the legitimacy of his custody,” Miller said. In court today, Maduro's lawyer, Barry Pollack, told the judge that there are issues with the legalities of his client's military abduction.
    


            Maduro himself also said in court that he was captured at his home and insisted that he is the president of Venezuela — another point his legal team will likely argue early on in the process, Miller said.
    


            Pollack told the judge that Maduro is the head of a sovereign state and is entitled to the privilege and immunity of that office. However, that is disputed, with the United States not recognizing Maduro or his regime as the legitimate government after several disputed elections.
    


            Nicolás Maduro's first court appearance in New York today has had a “show aspect” to it, CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez said on air.
    


            “They paraded him in front of cameras,” Perez said while outside the court on Monday. “This is very unusual in federal court here in the federal system.”
    


            “Usually, you don't have mugshots of people released because of the danger that (it) poses for their ability to present their defense, innocent until proven guilty,” he added.
    


            Perez noted that as the president of another country, Maduro is used to calling the shots himself.
    


            “He's used to running things himself, he's used to being able to issue orders and decide how things (are) going,” Perez said.
    


            Within minutes of his first federal court appearance, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro stood before a judge and said, “I was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela.”
    


            The statement previews what is likely to be one of the main defenses: that his dead of night arrest in a foreign country by US law enforcement – a “military abduction,” in his attorney's words – violated the law.
    


            It's not the first time that a defendant has made this argument. Over three decades ago, Panama's Manuel Noriega accused the US of violating both international law and due process protections by invading Panama and arresting him abroad.
    


            But that argument was unsuccessful, as the courts refused to consider the legality of the Panama invasion itself and only focused on the allegations in Noriega's indictment. Whether courts will reconsider that precedent in Maduro's case remains to be seen.
    


            It is unusual to for a criminal defendant to say anything to a judge during an initial appearance, as defense attorneys typically warn their clients that anything they say could be used in their prosecution.
    


            Judge Alvin Hellerstein made a similar warning to Maduro on Monday as the Venezuelan president spoke.
    


            “There will be a time and a place to go into all of this,” the judge said.
    


            Jorge Rodríguez, the brother of Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodríguez, has been re-appointed President of the National Assembly.
    


            Lawmakers reelected him to lead parliament on Monday with overwhelming support.
    


            This puts the Rodriguez siblings in control of Venezuela's executive and legislative branches.
    


            Ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro is speaking using a translator during his first court appearance in New York today — something that could make it more difficult for the judge to limit the scope of Maduro's answers.
    


            CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the former Venezuelan leader “seems to be answering a little bit more than the judge is asking for.”
    


            For example, when entering a plea, Maduro said, “I am innocent, I am not guilty.” He also added that he was “a decent man.” When he was asked by the judge to confirm his name, Maduro said he was the president of Venezuela and said he was captured at his home.
    


            When answers and responses are going through a translator, “it's harder for a judge to control the proceedings, because if someone's speaking in English, the judge can just cut them off if he's saying too much,” Honig said.
    


            In this case, the judge has to wait for everything to be translated. “So we'll see to what extent Maduro is disciplined and stays within the parameters of the court,” Honig added.
    


            Crowds of people have been gathering near the New York courthouse where ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is currently appearing.
    


            Two groups divided into opposite pens were on scene to demonstrate, some cheering on his capture and others protesting against it.
    


            People waving Venezuelan flags were seen shouting chants including: “Who are we? Venezuela! What do we want? Libertad!”
    


            One person was seen waving a large flagpole with a Venezuelan flag, as well as a flag that said “Trump for king.” Another person held a sign reading, “Free our political prisoners in Venezuela.”
    


            Others were seen holding banners reading, “Free President Maduro.” They were also waving Venezuelan flags.
    


            Ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is making his first court appearance in New York after his capture following a US operation on Saturday. He is facing drug and weapons charges.
    


            Here's what we can expect from today's hearing, according to CNN's senior legal analyst Elie Honig.
    


            Energy and oil stocks jumped higher Monday as investors assessed the prospect of US companies gaining access to Venezuela's oil reserves and the country's drilling potential.
    


            Oil stocks' gains reflect expectations that US companies might benefit as President Donald Trump says the US will revamp Venezuela's oil industry.
    


            While oil stocks surged, oil prices rose by roughly 1.3%. Venezuela's beleaguered oil infrastructure and the challenges associated with ramping up production make the recent developments less consequential for global oil markets.
    


            “Venezuela's global economic importance has diminished significantly over the past 50 years,” Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
    


            “In theory, Venezuela could again become a major producer,” Shearing said. “But theory and reality diverge sharply … Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process.”
    


            The capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro was a “law enforcement operation,” the United States envoy to the United Nations said Monday, stressing that the US is “not occupying a country.”
    


            Mike Waltz described US military action in Venezuela on Saturday as a “surgical law enforcement operation facilitated by the US military against two indicted fugitives of American justice: narco-terrorist Nicolas Maduro and (his wife) Cilia Flores.”
    


            He told a UN Security Council meeting that Maduro is “responsible for attacks on the people of the United States, for destabilizing the western hemisphere and illegitimately repressing the people of Venezuela.”
    


                    “There is no war against Venezuela or its people. We are not occupying a country,” Waltz said.
                





            The envoy said that US President Donald Trump – who said Saturday that the US will “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” can be ensured – had “(given) diplomacy a chance,” which he claimed Maduro failed to take.
    


                    “The United States wants a better future for Venezuela. We believe a better future for the people of Venezuela and for the people of the region and the world is stabilizing the region and making the neighborhood that we live in a much better and safer place,” Waltz said.
                





            Russia's envoy to the United Nations on Monday called for the United States to release Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, and warned that Washington's actions could usher in a new era of colonialism and imperialism.
    


                    “The assault against the leader of Venezuela… has become a harbinger of a turn back to the era of lawlessness and US domination by force,” Vasily Nebenzya said at a meeting of the UN Security Council.
                





            Russia condemned the “US act of armed aggression against Venezuela” and called for Washington “to immediately release the legitimately elected president of an independent state and his spouse,” Cilia Flores.
    


                    “Washington is generating fresh momentum for neocolonialism and for imperialism, which were repeatedly and decisively condemned and repudiated by the peoples of this region and by the global south as a whole… The bell now tolls across the region, ringing for every country of the Western Hemisphere,” Nebenzya said.
                





            Given the US actions, the envoy said “those who, in other circumstances, froth at the mouth and demand that others respect the UN Charter, today seem particularly hypocritical and unseemly,” in apparent reference to Western criticism of Russia for its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
    


            The National Assembly of Venezuela began a new legislative term on Monday, in which lawmakers reiterated that Executive Vice President Delcy Rodríguez had assumed the role of acting president.
    


            They also demanded the release of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were captured on Saturday in a US military operation in Caracas. Rodríguez became acting president on Sunday following an order from the Supreme Court.
    


            “The president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro Moros, has been kidnapped by the government of the United States, in a barbaric, treacherous, and cowardly attack,” said pro-government deputy Fernando Soto Rojas, debate director for the parliamentary session.
    


                    “The president of the United States, Mr. Trump, intends to be prosecutor, judge, and policeman of the world. From Bolivarian Venezuela, we say to him: “you will not succeed. And we are now going to develop full solidarity so that our legitimate president, Nicolás Maduro, returns victorious,”” he insisted.
                





            The session is held days after Maduro's capture, which has been condemned by the government of Venezuela and some other Latin American countries, including Cuba, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay.
    


            Deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro will be represented Monday by Barry Pollack, a deeply experienced US trial attorney who represented Julian Assange and brokered the deal for his plea deal and release last summer.
    


            Mark Donnelly, a white collar lawyer from Houston and a former Justice Department prosecutor, notified the court he will represent Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores. Donnelly's firm biography says he speaks Spanish.
    


            Pollack doesn't come from the typical world of lawyers who represent defendants in drug trafficking cases. Instead, he specializes in more unusual white collar and national security matters, especially ones with an intense political cross-section.
    


            He briefly represented Pras Michel, the former Fugees star convicted in a sprawling campaign finance case.
    


This post has been corrected to reflect that Pollack represented Assange in the past.



            Abandoning the United Nations (UN) Charter and its prohibition of the kind of action undertaken by US President Donald Trump against Venezuela “would carry consequences of the gravest kind,” according to economist Jeffrey Sachs.
    


            Speaking at a meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday, Sachs called on member states to consider the wider implications of their reaction to Washington's decision to carry out military strikes on Venezuela and detain deposed leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores.
    


            “The issue before the council today is not the character of the government of Venezuela,” Sachs said.
    


            “The issue is whether any member state, by force, coercion or economic strangulation, has the right to determine Venezuela's political future or to exercise control over its affairs,” he said, adding that such actions contravene the UN charter.
    


            “The council must decide whether that prohibition is to be upheld or abandoned,” Sachs said. “Abandoning it would carry consequences of the gravest kind.”
    


            “Peace and the survival of humanity depend on whether the United Nations Charter remains a living instrument of international law or is allowed to wither into irrelevance,” he said.
    


            “That is the choice before this Council today.”
    


            The Justice Department unsealed a superseding indictment on Saturday against ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, along with his wife Cilia Flores, his son Nicolás Maduro Guerra and other Venezuelan officials.
    


                    In the indictment, federal prosecutors in New York allege that “for over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.”
                





            Maduro was “at the forefront of that corruption,” the indictment says, and used “his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.”
    


            According to the indictment, Maduro, in various government roles, provided Venezuelan diplomatic passports to drug traffickers, gave diplomatic cover to planes used to launder drug money from Mexico to Venezuela, and his co-conspirators, “partnered with some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world” for their own profit.
    


            Flores is accused, among other things, of accepting “hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to broker a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office” in 2007.
    


                    While allegedly trafficking cocaine between 2004 and 2015, Maduro and Flores jointly “ordered kidnappings, beatings, and murders against those who owed them drug money or otherwise undermined their drug trafficking operation, including ordering the murder of a local drug boss in Caracas, Venezuela,” the indictment alleges.
                





            Maduro is indicted on four counts: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.
    


            Flores is facing counts of cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.
    


            UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that he is “deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected” during US military action in Venezuela.
    


            In a statement read out at a meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday, Guterres stressed that international law “provides the foundation for the maintenance of international peace and security.”
    


            He also highlighted concerns around the knock-on effects of the detainment of deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores.
    


            “I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability in the country, the potential impact on the region and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted,” Guterres said.
    


            “Venezuela has experienced decades of internal instability and social and economic turmoil,” he said.
    


            “Democracy has been undermined. Millions of its people have fled the country. The situation is critical, but it is still possible to prevent a wider and more destructive conflagration,” Guterres added.
    


            “In situations as confused, as complex, as the one we now face, it is important to stick to principles,” he said.
    


            “International law contains tools to address issues such as illicit traffic in narcotics, disputes about resources and human rights concerns,” added Guterres.
    


            “This is the route we need to take.”
    


            In the early hours of Saturday morning, US President Donald Trump announced that Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores had been “captured and flown out of the country.”
    


            Here's what we know about what's happened to him since then:
    


CNN's Simone Pathe, Kevin Liptak, Kit Maher, Emma Tucker, Bonney Kapp, Omar Jimenez and Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this reporting.



            The morning after US forces bombed Caracas, dragged President Nicolás Maduro out of bed, carted him over the Caribbean and installed him in a Brooklyn jail, many Venezuelans hurried to the grocery store.
    


            “Why did I have to go out?” said Judith Ledezma. “I have a pet that needs exercise and I was really stressed out staying indoors.”
    


            Her orange dog sat beside her on a park bench in Caracas, along with numerous shopping bags. Ledezma, who lives near one of the airbases hit by US airstrikes, told CNN the noise from the attack woke her up.
    


            “I thought it was an earthquake,” Ledezma said. “I got scared and came running out with my daughter and the dog.”
    


                    “We have no idea what our fate will be now with this new situation,” Ledezma continued. “I am completely in the dark. I have no idea what is going to happen to the country, to us.”
                





            The government in Caracas wants Venezuelans out and about, though the streets are quiet, apart from a few militia members mustering with their motorcycles. Defense Minister Vladímir Padrino Lopez told people Sunday to “resume their economic activities, work, and all other types of activities, including educational activities, in the coming days.”
    


            Olga Jimenez told CNN she finally left her house on Sunday after staying in all of Saturday. Maduro or no Maduro, Jimenez said, she doesn't expect much to change in Venezuela – except maybe the lines at the shops. Maria Azocar, meanwhile, told CNN that “having lived through so much, nothing really worries me anymore.”

Delcy Rodríguez, who was Venezuela's vice president under Nicolás Maduro, has now become the country's acting president.
    


            Rodríguez – who was also minister for both finance and oil – stepped into the role on Saturday afternoon after an order from Venezuela's Supreme Court.
    


            The 56-year-old is from Caracas and studied law at the Central University of Venezuela. She has spent more than two decades as one of the leading figures of Chavismo, the political movement founded by the Venezuela's late President Hugo Chávez and led by Maduro since Chávez's death in 2013.
    


            After the capture of Maduro and Flores, Rodríguez accused the US of “kidnapping” her country's leader and said that violations of international law were committed, accusing US forces of having “savagely attacked” Venezuela's territorial integrity.
    


            Following remarks from US President Donald Trump that Rodriguez would face a worse fate than Maduro if she doesn't “do the right thing,” the acting Venezuelan leader softened her reaction, extending an invitation to the United States government to collaborate on an “agenda of cooperation.”



                    “President Donald Trump: our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war. This has always been President Nicolás Maduro's message, and it is a message of all Venezuela right now,” Rodríguez said in comments made directly to the US president.
                





            “Venezuela has the right to peace, to development, to sovereignty and to a future,” she added.

As we reported earlier, ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were transported from the Metropolitan Detention Center to a New York courthouse this morning,
    


            They were heavily flanked by armed Drug Enforcement Administration Agents.
    


If you missed it, take a look at photos from their transfer:



            Colombian President Gustavo Petro has warned that would “take up arms” if the US decides to attack him or his country following a series of threats from President Donald Trump.
    


            In a post on X, Petro underlined his efforts to combat drug trafficking, which Trump has criticized, and went on to claim that US military strikes against traffickers in Colombia would risk killing children and driving recruitment for separatist groups that have been in conflict with the state for decades.
    


            “And if they arrest a president that has the support and respect of a large part of the country, they will unleash a popular uprising,” he added.
    


            Petro, a former member of the M19 guerilla group, also said that he would himself fight to defend Colombia.
    


            “I swore not to touch a weapon again … but for the homeland I will take up arms again,” he said.
    


            Trump had harsh words for Petro on Sunday, describing him as “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long.”
    


            When pressed by a reporter if those comments meant there could be an “operation” in Colombia in the future, Trump responded, “sounds good to me.”
    


            Speaking to The New York Times on Monday, Colombia's defense minister Pedro Sánchez refused to address Trump's threats, instead emphasizing that the two countries have “a very close relationship.”
    


            Sánchez said he remains in communication with US officials, and that possible military strikes on Colombia have not been discussed during recent conversations, the Times reported.

            President Donald Trump's defenders had it half right.
    


            The US overthrow of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro isn't an exact copy of the haunted regime change that gutted Iraq's government and civil society.
    


            The emerging White House strategy instead looks more like a regime decapitation that is evolving into coercion of Maduro's left-behind lieutenants. The administration is demanding acquiescence to Trump's dream of an obedient, MAGAfied Western Hemisphere.
    


            The focal point of the effort is Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, the interim leader in Caracas since a spectacular US special forces operation spirited Maduro out of his bed and to New York, where he'll appear in court  Monday.
    


            Trump declared Sunday evening that the US was running Venezuela through its pressure on Rodríguez, now the acting president. “Don't ask me who's in charge, because I'll give you an answer, and it'll be very controversial,” he told reporters. “It means we're in charge. We're in charge.”
    


            The spectacle of an American president claiming to be “in charge” of a sovereign nation around 1,000 miles from the US mainland — even if it is not strictly true — shows just how fundamentally Trump has hardened the country's posture to the rest of the world and reveals his ambition to wield expansive power. And Trump apparently feels emboldened by the Venezuela raid, telling reporters Sunday that Colombia is “very sick” and that “Mexico has to get their act together.”
    


            Co-opting Maduro's remnant regime would require less US blood and treasure than failed nation-building efforts in the post-9/11 wars. But that route brings its own complications and has uncertain odds given the volatile political landscape. And it could create an unexpected and immediate consequence of Maduro's fall: a counterintuitive US turn away from Venezuela's democracy movement.
    


            Hurried efforts in Washington to piece together a viable path forward in Venezuela coincided Sunday with rising fury among Democrats over Trump's failure to seek congressional authorization for what looked like an act of war. Early signs indicate that Republicans are standing firm behind a president they've rarely challenged. But it will take time to gauge whether yet another foreign policy adventure will widen splits in Trump's MAGA movement.
    


            The Trump administration is now wrestling with the complex aftermath of their boss's headline-grabbing order of a daring military raid. It is walking a fine line in seeking to secure a stable source of authority in Caracas. And it's looking to avoid the kind of purges of top officials that could bring the government crashing down and lead to civil strife, which could turn Trump's latest triumph into a political disaster in a midterm election year in the United States.
    


            Trump created a storm Saturday when he said the US would “run” Venezuela ahead of a political transition. He also fueled fears of 21st century imperialism by fixating on getting the US a piece of Venezuela's vast oil reserves.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared on Sunday news shows to dispel comparisons to Iraq from what he called “clown-hour” analysts.
    


            He said the US would maintain its “quarantine” oil embargo to force Venezuela's remaining leaders to obey Trump's orders. The freshly demonstrated might of the US military is also supposed to concentrate minds in the Venezuelan capital.
    


            “We want drug trafficking to stop. We want no more gang members to come our way. We don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past,” Rubio said on CBS' “Face the Nation”
    


            “We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people. … We insist on seeing that happen,” Rubio said.
    


            Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, a key Trump ally, summed up the thrust of the strategy on CNN's “State of the Union.” He told Dana Bash, “When the president said that the United States is going to be running Venezuela, it means that the new leaders of Venezuela need to meet our demands.”
    


            In short, Trump's plan for Venezuela is to coerce its acting president to become a vessel for his power inside her own country. As Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told CBS News on Saturday, “President Trump sets the terms. … (He) has shown American leadership and he will be able to dictate where we go next.”
    


            The spectacular special forces smash-and-grab raid that captured Maduro and his wife looks in the immediate aftermath like one of the more successful CIA and US military attempts to shape the geopolitics of America's backyard — a preoccupation of presidents for more than 200 years.
    


            If Trump succeeds after years of Washington neglecting Latin America, he may turn an enemy into a pliant state and advance his effort to shape the Western Hemisphere into a region of pro-US powers. He might ease deprivation in the Venezuelan economy by getting oil revenues flowing; disrupt drug cartels; and drive out Russian and Chinese influences that threaten US national security.
    


            Washington wants a partner in Caracas to do the deals at which Maduro balked. “We just could not work with him. He is not a person that had ever kept any of the deals he made,” Rubio told CBS.
    


            The assumption that Rodríguez or another regime survivor will help the US is fine in theory. Outsiders are not privy to conversations and behind-the-scenes work from American diplomats and intelligence agencies with regime figures. Sources told CNN that Rodríguez had been identified as potentially providing more stable governance than Maduro.
    


            Yet the vice president has been publicly scathing about Maduro's ouster, and other key figures have vowed to stand behind the regime. Rodríguez may need to avoid any public show of betrayal to keep herself safe in Venezuela. But after portraying her as cooperative on Saturday, Trump issued a dark threat on Sunday. “If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” he told The Atlantic.
    


            On Sunday evening, Rodríguez issued a more conciliatory statement offering an “agenda of cooperation” with the US.
    


            Trump and several key members of his administration have warned that if Venezuelan officials don't play ball, they could court another, bigger US attack. But their threats raise a key question: Can Washington really force Venezuelan leaders to comply through the leverage of an offshore naval armada, special forces raids, intelligence operations or the threat of air attacks?
    


            Ivo Daalder, a former US ambassador to NATO, told CNN on Sunday that it was impossible for the Trump administration to “run” Venezuela without committing the resources needed to properly govern it.
    


            “This disconnect between the means that we have deployed and the goals that we have set is going to come and bite us in the back,” Daalder said.
    


            It already looks like the US risks falling yet again into one of the recurring traps of its modern foreign policy — creating plans that seem sound in Washington but that dissolve on contact with the reality of a foreign nation.
    


            Rodríguez might seem like a stabilizing force to US officials. As a former diplomat, she has good contacts abroad and in the oil industry.
    


            But she's long been a key face of the Maduro regime and that of his predecessor Hugo Chávez. There's been no sign that she's renounced the far-left ideology of the revolution. And Rodríguez herself may have limited room for maneuver​ or cooperation with the US in the snake pit of competing currents and strongmen that characterize the inner sanctums of the regime in Caracas.
    


            “She doesn't have the support among the various armed actors,” Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, a geopolitical risk consultant, told CNN's Boris Sanchez on Sunday. “She's going to have to straddle keeping the people who do have good contacts there, keeping them balanced with whatever instructions she is supposedly getting from DC.”
    


            The acting president's emerging importance to the administration means she risks becoming a fragile platform for Trump's entire gamble in Venezuela.
    


            “Delcy Rodríguez is a very powerful figure in her own right, handpicked by Maduro,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said on “State of the Union.”
    


            “There's really no explanation for how American interests are changed at all with a Rodríguez administration that right now seems to be intent on carrying through and carrying forward the policies of Nicolás Maduro,” Murphy said.
    


            Even Cotton will wait and see. “I don't think that we can count on Delcy  Rodríguez to be friendly to the United States until she proves it,” he told CNN's Bash.
    


            Perhaps the most shocking moment in Trump's Saturday news conference at Mar-a-Lago was the president's dismissal of María Corina Machado. The Nobel Peace laureate is credited with masterminding the campaign of opposition candidate Edmundo González, who is regarded as the winner of last year's election — a result Maduro refused to recognize.
    


            The US government has consistently said that González is the rightful president of Venezuela. Many people assumed that any US ouster of Maduro would swiftly lead to González's installation as president.
    


            But Trump said Machado “doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country. She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect.”
    


            The administration's shift away from the democratic movement and engagement with regime remnants is a blow to Venezuelans hoping their long political torment would end.
    


            Rubio, who has long supported Machado and democratic movements across Latin America, tried to square a politically uncomfortable circle. “There has to be a little realism here,” he told CBS.
    


            “They've had this regime … in place for 15 or 16 years and everyone's asking why 24 hours after Nicolás Maduro was arrested there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow. That's absurd,” Rubio said.
    


            Rubio argued that “these things take time” and that while he hoped to see Venezuela transition to a democracy, US national interests were the immediate concern.
    


            This Trump administration pragmatism is fueling anger on Capitol Hill.
    


            “My God, we're the United States of America, right?” Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on “State of the Union.”
    


            “We care — or at least we used to care — about democratic norms. We used to care about the idea that the people ought to have a little something to say about who governs them,” Himes said.
    


            Trump is clearly rushing for Venezuelan oil — and he wants to dominate the Western Hemisphere. But in courting Maduro's regime remnants, the US risks becoming complicit in the repression imposed by a government it has long reviled.

            The morning after US forces bombed Caracas, dragged President Nicolás Maduro out of bed, carted him over the Caribbean and installed him in a Brooklyn jail, many Venezuelans hurried to the grocery store.
    


            “Why did I have to go out?” said Judith Ledezma. “I have a pet that needs exercise and I was really stressed out staying indoors.”
    


            Her orange dog sat beside her on a park bench in Caracas, along with numerous shopping bags. Ledezma, who lives near one of the airbases hit by US airstrikes, told CNN the noise from the attack woke her up.
    


            “I thought it was an earthquake,” Ledezma said. “I got scared and came running out with my daughter and the dog.”
    


            “We have no idea what our fate will be now with this new situation,” Ledezma continued. “I am completely in the dark. I have no idea what is going to happen to the country, to us.”
    


            The government in Caracas wants Venezuelans out and about, though the streets are quiet, apart from a few militia members mustering with their motorcycles. Defense Minister Vladímir Padrino Lopez told people Sunday to “resume their economic activities, work, and all other types of activities, including educational activities, in the coming days.”
    


            Olga Jimenez told CNN she finally left her house on Sunday after staying in all of Saturday. Maduro or no Maduro, Jimenez said, she doesn't expect much to change in Venezuela – except maybe the lines at the shops.
    


            “I've been glued to the TV, watching to see what's going on, and what there is is uncertainty,” Jimenez said. “You don't feel a change of government because everything is the same. The only thing is that we don't know.”
    


Venezuelans lose their homes after US strikes



            “What's happening to us is that places aren't open, and you have to line up for everything, as if we were going backwards to the Chávez era, when you had to line up everywhere just to buy things,” Jimenez added. “I don't know how to put it – it was Maduro's government, and they should have taken them all, not just Maduro.”
    


            Maria Azocar, meanwhile, told CNN that “having lived through so much, nothing really worries me anymore.”
    


            “As I say, this is for the history books,” Azocar said, before listing the names of past Venezuelan leaders: “(Marcos) Pérez Jiménez, (Isaías Medina) Angarita, Rómulo Gallegos, Juan Vicente Gómez – people who, in their time, were overthrown or displaced.”
    


            “I'll tell you something straight: It was really an abuse on the part of the Americans,” Azocar said of the attack, “because they intimidated the people with their missiles. That says it all.”
    


            Acting President Delcy Rodríguez (whom Azocar said US President Donald Trump “appointed” to lead the country) is “a woman of real strength,” she added.
    


            “I think with her, it eases people's hearts a little, on one side and the other,” Azocar said.
    


            The United States is apparently tolerating having Rodríguez in charge, for now. Saturday, Trump told reporters he thought opposition leader María Corina Machado didn't have the “respect' or “support” to lead the country.
    


            Resident Mario Valdez told CNN he thought an immediate, forceful transition to opposition rule “could lead us into violence.”
    


            “It would mean the reds leave only for the blues to take over,” Valdez said, referring to the left and right respectively, “in a country which, at this moment, after 26 years of a Chavista government, can't handle, because it would lead to another bloodbath, like we've had in the past.”
    


            Still, Valdez said he is hopeful for a democratic transition, eventually.
    


            “I believe this democratic transition must take place, and we will all take part in it,” Vladez said. “The first thing the president of the Republic must do is release the political prisoners – all of them. There is no reason whatsoever for them to remain imprisoned.”
    


            Valdez said he also hopes international oil companies will return to Venezuela. His country has been plundered for years by Russia, China and Iran, he said, which provided nothing in return for Venezuela's vast oil wealth.
    


            “They stole all the money from this country to build major projects and did absolutely nothing,” Valdez said. “The motorways are unfinished.”
    


Trump wants the US oil industry to thrive in Venezuela again. That won't be easy



            All told, Valdez said, he was unsurprised by Maduro's abduction. “President Maduro should have been prudent and accepted one of the offers that were made to him; he was made multiple offers.”
    


            “He should have called new elections,” Valdez said, referring to the 2024 election that most observers say Maduro lost, despite clinging to power. “That is what I would have done: called new elections with a new National Electoral Council, changed things and summoned in the country a spirit of concord, where all organizations could take part.”
    


            “But that didn't happen, and so there are consequences – without making value judgments about whether all that was right or wrong.”

Nicolás Maduro and his wife are set to make his first appearance Monday in a U.S. courtroom on the narco-terrorism charges the Trump administration used to justify capturing him and bringing him to New York.

U.S. President Donald Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. Trump said he wanted Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, to provide “total access” to the country. He also commented on the 32 Cuban security officers killed in Venezuela.

Protesters gathered outside a courthouse Monday to denounce the U.S. government's moves in Venezuela. Chants like “No boots on the ground, no bombs in the air! U.S. out of everywhere!” were heard.

NEW YORK (AP) — A defiant Nicolás Maduro declared himself the “president of my country” as he protested his capture and pleaded not guilty on Monday to the federal drug trafficking charges that the Trump administration used to justify removing him from power.

“I was captured,” Maduro said in Spanish as translated by a courtroom reporter before being cut off by the judge. Asked later for his plea to the charges, he stated: ""“I'm innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man, the president of my country.”

The courtroom appearance, Maduro's first since he and his wife were seized from their home in a stunning middle-of-the-night military operation, kick-starts the U.S. government's most consequential prosecution in decades of a foreign head of state. The criminal case in Manhattan is unfolding against the diplomatic backdrop of an audacious U.S.-engineered regime change that President Donald Trump has said will enable his administration to “run” the South American country.

Maduro, wearing a blue jail uniform, was led into court along with his co-defendant wife just before noon for the brief, but required, legal proceeding. Both put on headsets to hear the English-language proceeding as it is translated into Spanish.

The couple were transported to the Manhattan courthouse under armed guard early Monday from the Brooklyn jail where they've been detained since arriving in the U.S. on Saturday. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The trip was swift. A motorcade carrying Maduro left jail around 7:15 a.m. and made its way to a nearby athletic field, where Maduro slowly made his way to a waiting helicopter. The chopper flew across New York harbor and landed at a Manhattan heliport, where Maduro, limping, was loaded into an armored vehicle.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Maduro's case will revive a legal debate over immunity for foreign leaders tested in Noriega trial.




A few minutes later, the law enforcement caravan was inside a garage at the courthouse complex, just around the corner from the one where Trump was convicted in 2024 of falsifying business records. Across the street from the courthouse, the police separated a small but growing group of protesters from about a dozen pro-intervention demonstrators, including one man who pulled a Venezuelan flag away from those protesting the U.S. action.

As a criminal defendant in the U.S. legal system, Maduro will have the same rights as any other person accused of a crime — including the right to a trial by a jury of regular New Yorkers. But he'll also be nearly — but not quite — unique.

Maduro's lawyers are expected to contest the legality of his arrest, arguing that he is immune from prosecution as a sovereign head of state.

Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega unsuccessfully tried the same defense after the U.S. captured him in a similar military invasion in 1990. But the U.S. doesn't recognize Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate head of state — particularly after a much-disputed 2024 reelection.

Venezuela's new interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, has demanded that the U.S. return Maduro, who long denied any involvement in drug trafficking — although late Sunday she also struck a more conciliatory tone in a social media post, inviting collaboration with Trump and “respectful relations” with the U.S.

Before his capture, Maduro and his allies claimed U.S. hostility was motivated by lust for Venezuela's rich oil and mineral resources.

The U.S. seized Maduro and his wife in a military operation early Saturday, capturing them in their home on a military base. Trump said the U.S. would “run” Venezuela temporarily, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that it would not govern the country day-to-day other than enforcing an existing "" oil quarantine.” 

Trump suggested Sunday that he wants to extend American power further in the Western Hemisphere. 

Speaking aboard Air Force One, he called Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States. And he's not going to be doing it very long.”

He called on Venezuela's Rodriguez to provide “total access” to her country, or else face consequences.

Trump has suggested that removing Maduro would enable more oil to flow out of Venezuela, but oil prices rose a bit more than 1% in Monday morning trading to roughly $58 a barrel. There are uncertainties about how fast oil production can be ramped up in Venezuela after years of neglect and needed investments, as well as questions about governance and oversight of the sector.

A 25-page indictment made public Saturday accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S. They could face life in prison if convicted. 

He and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been under U.S. sanctions for years, making it illegal for any American to take money from them without first securing a license from the Treasury Department.

While the indictment against Maduro says Venezuelan officials worked directly with the Tren de Aragua gang, a U.S. intelligence assessment published in April, drawing on input from the intelligence community's 18 agencies, found no coordination between Tren de Aragua and the Venezuelan government.

Maduro, his wife and his son — who remains free — are charged along with Venezuela's interior and justice minister, a former interior and justice minister and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, an alleged Tren de Aragua leader who has been criminally charged in another case and remains at large. 

Among other things, the indictment accuses Maduro and his wife of ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders of those who owed them drug money or undermined their drug trafficking operation. That included a local drug boss' killing in Caracas, the indictment said. 

Maduro's wife is also accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between “a large-scale drug trafficker” and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, resulting in additional monthly bribes, with some of the money going to Maduro's wife, according to the indictment.

In the battle against fake news, Finland starts the fight in the classrooms. For decades, the Nordic nation and neighbour to Russia has woven media literacy - including the ability to analyse different kinds of media and recognize disinformation - into its national curriculum, starting from early preschool, at ages 3-4. But experts warn that with the development of artificial intelligence, it could become much more difficult.

HELSINKI (AP) — The battle against fake news in Finland starts in preschool classrooms.

For decades, the Nordic nation has woven media literacy, including the ability to analyze different kinds of media and recognize disinformation, into its national curriculum for students as young as 3 years old. The coursework is part of a robust anti-misinformation program to make Finns more resistant to propaganda and false claims, especially those crossing over the 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with neighboring Russia.

Now, teachers are tasked with adding artificial intelligence literacy to their curriculum, especially after Russia stepped up its disinformation campaign across Europe following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago. Finland's ascension into NATO in 2023 also provoked Moscow's ire, though Russia has repeatedly denied it interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.

“We think that having good media literacy skills is a very big civic skill,” Kiia Hakkala, a pedagogical specialist for the City of Helsinki, told The Associated Press. “It's very important to the nation's safety and to the safety of our democracy.”




At Tapanila Primary School, in a quiet neighborhood north of Helsinki, teacher Ville Vanhanen taught a group of fourth graders how to spot fake news. As a TV screen beamed a “Fact or Fiction?” banner, student Ilo Lindgren evaluated the prompt.

“It is a little bit hard,” the 10-year-old admitted.

Vanhanen said his students have been learning about fake news and disinformation for years, beginning with reading headlines and short texts. In a recent class, the fourth graders were tasked with coming up with five things to look out for when consuming online news to ensure it's trustworthy. Now they are moving onto AI literacy, which is quickly becoming a vital skill.

“We've been studying how to recognize if a picture or a video is made by AI,” added Vanhanen, a teacher and vice principal at the school.

Finnish media also play a role, organizing an annual “Newspaper Week,” where papers and other news are sent to young people to consume. In 2024, Helsinki-based Helsingin Sanomat collaborated on a new “ABC Book of Media Literacy,” distributed to every 15-year-old in the country as they began upper secondary school.

“It's really important for us to be seen as a place where you can get information that's been verified, that you can trust, and that's done by people you know in a transparent way,” Jussi Pullinen, the daily newspaper's managing editor, said.

Media literacy has been part of the Finnish educational curriculum since the 1990s, and additional courses are available for older adults who might be especially vulnerable to misinformation.

The skills are so ingrained into the culture that the Nordic nation of 5.6 million people regularly ranks at the top of the European Media Literacy Index. The index was compiled by the Open Society Institute in Sofia, Bulgaria, between 2017 and 2023.

“I don't think we envisioned that the world would look like this,” Finnish Education Minister Anders Adlercreutz said. “That we would be bombarded with disinformation, that our institutions are challenged — our democracy really challenged — through disinformation.”

And with the rapid advancement of AI tools, educators and experts are rushing to teach students and the rest of the public how to tell what's fact and what's fake news.

“It already is much harder in the information space to spot what's real and what's not real,” Martha Turnbull, director of hybrid influence at the Helsinki-based European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, said. “It just so happens that right now, it's reasonably easy to spot the AI-generated fakes because the quality of them isn't as good as it could be.” 

She added: “But as that technology develops, and particularly as we move toward things like agentic AI, I think that's when it could become much more difficult for us to spot.”

President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters that U.S. officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters that U.S. officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week, disputing Kremlin claims that Trump had initially greeted with deep concern.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week said Ukraine launched a wave of drones at Putin's state residence in the northwestern Novgorod region that the Russian defense systems were able to defeat. Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.

The allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation. 

Trump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.

“I don't believe that strike happened,” Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”

Trump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.




But Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.

By Wednesday, Trump appeared to be downplaying the Russian claim. He posted a link to a New York Post editorial on his social media platform that raised doubt about the Russian allegation. The editorial lambasted Putin for choosing “lies, hatred, and death” at a moment that Trump has claimed is “closer than ever before” to moving the two sides to a deal to end the war.

The U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day. 

Both Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.

But Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.

NASA's 15th administrator Jared Isaacman discusses President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at advancing America's space policy on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

FIRST ON FOX: Recently confirmed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman is moving to demolish several testing facilities in Alabama as the space agency looks to modernize its infrastructure under Isaacman's new leadership.

The agency will demolish the Dynamic Test Stand and the Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, known as the T-Tower at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The removal is set to begin Saturday, Jan. 10.

""NASA is embarking on an exciting infrastructure modernization effort to prepare for the future of exploration,"" Isaacman told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""The first phase will make way for new facilities by retiring outdated ones, enabling investments in the capabilities needed to deliver on our world-changing mission of science and discovery.""

Sources at NASA tell Fox News Digital the demolition of the facilities is the first step in an initiative to remove 25 outdated structures at the Alabama flight center.

Funding for updated facilities at the Marshall Space Flight Center comes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump last July. Isaacman and the agency are looking to utilize the funding to bolster NASA's infrastructure broadly, beyond the Alabama location.

The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility (""T-Tower"") was originally constructed by the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency in 1957 before being given to NASA to test boosters featured on Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters and Saturn launch vehicles.

Isaacman was confirmed by the Senate in a 67–30 vote on Dec. 17, 2025, after the Trump administration pulled his nomination earlier in the year. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy served as acting administrator before Isaacman was renominated.

The decision to demolish the nearly 70-year-old facilities comes in the new administrator's first month of running America's top space exploration agency. 

Isaacman, a 42-year-old billionaire entrepreneur and space fanatic, founded and served as CEO of Shift4 Payments and his passion for space led him to command the first all-civilian orbital space mission in 2021, and complete the first-ever commercial spacewalk in 2024.

The NASA administrator faces tall orders from the White House after Trump signed an executive order the day after Isaacman's confirmation stating the U.S. will be the first to land on Mars and will continue moon exploration.

""We will lead humanity back to the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars,"" Trump stated.

The executive order also calls for Americans' return to the moon by 2028, the deployment of nuclear reactors on the moon and in orbit by 2030, and promoting private sector investment by upgrading launch infrastructure and developing a commercial pathway to replace the International Space Station by 2030.

Fox News contributor Paul Mauro joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss Maduro's impending arraignment, the potential for private vs. public defense and more.

While many Democrats erupted at President Donald Trump's decision to arrest Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro on drug trafficking and terrorism charges, one particular prior taunt from former President Joe Biden resurfaced Sunday and promptly got ratioed.

Responding to an Axios report on June 21, 2020, that Trump would consider meeting with Maduro after the despot ignored the disputed election versus opposition leader Juan Guaidó, Biden said, ""Trump talks tough on Venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like Nicolás Maduro.""

""As President, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy,"" Biden added.

VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO'S NARCO CASE ECHOES US HISTORY OF TARGETING ALLEGED FOREIGN DRUG KINGPINS

Soon after the weekend operation at Miraflores – the Venezuelan dictator's official residence – conservatives and at least one left-leaning political activist highlighted how, in the words of several civilian respondents, the comment ""aged like milk.""

""Whoops,"" remarked Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who is also running for the Yellowhammer State's governorship this year.

""And now, every Democrat is denouncing an operation to execute a federal warrant while we slept,"" Tuberville said.

The Auburn football legend went on to claim Biden's comment showed ""Democrats have no principles [and] it's about whatever way the left wind is blowing to gain power.""

""Yesterday's margaritas with Kilmar Abrego Garcia is today's Maduro,"" he said. ""They'll support a drug-trafficking dictator because this was another Trump win. Guaranteed.""

The Trump campaign arm's ""Rapid Response 47"" X account also re-upped Biden's message, responding with a photograph of Maduro blindfolded on a U.S. government aircraft following his capture.

MADURO'S CAPTURE IS 'BEGINNING OF THE END' FOR CUBA'S REGIME, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE CHAIR SAYS

""A tweet that did not age well,"" added Fox News host and former Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.

""Has anyone called to see if Joe is still sleeping?"" remarked Pennsylvania state Rep. Aaron Bernstine, who represents Butler County, where Trump was nearly assassinated in 2024.

One respondent on X replied with a clip of Earl Sinclair from the 1990s ABC sitcom, ""Dinosaurs,"" expressing surprise and dropping a glass.

GREGG JARRETT: NO, TRUMP'S ORDER TO SNATCH MADURO WAS NOT ILLEGAL OR UNCONSTITUTIONAL

""This aged well,"" Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, said of Biden's comment.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., added in a statement on social media that Trump ""doesn't just talk tough, he is tough.""

""Does Joe Biden have anything to say now?"" she asked, as other critics cited a second Biden comment from that timeframe wherein the Delaware Democrat called Maduro a dictator and criticized his ""human rights violations and extrajudicial killings.""

""Wait. You mean ‘Don't' diplomacy didn't get it done?"" remarked former NYPD inspector Paul Mauro, who is also a Fox News contributor.

TRUMP ISSUES DIRECT WARNING TO VENEZUELA'S NEW LEADER DELCY RODRÍGUEZ FOLLOWING MADURO CAPTURE

Mauro had referenced Biden's widely circulated response to an inquiry about what his message to Iran would be to prevent them from intervening in Israel. ""Don't,"" Biden replied before leaving the stage where he was speaking at MS-NOW host Al Sharpton's National Action Network.

In 2022, Biden climate envoy John Kerry – a former Massachusetts senator – was videotaped shaking hands and smiling in brief conversation with Maduro at the United Nations' climate change summit that year in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

KAMALA HARRIS BLASTS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S CAPTURE OF VENEZUELA'S MADURO AS ‘UNLAWFUL AND UNWISE'

When pressed on the surprisingly jovial greeting, Kerry spokesman Ned Price said the Venezuelan leader had ""interrupted what was an ongoing meeting at COP27"" and called the exchange ""very much an unplanned interaction.""

Other critics pointed out that former President Barack Obama established the first bounty on Maduro's head in 2015 via executive order, which was increased by the Biden administration, then doubled to $50 million by Trump more recently.

""Joe Biden hated Maduro just as much. He just wasn't bold enough to get him,"" said Ja'Mal Green, a former Chicago mayoral candidate and community activist who previously aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., but appeared to sour on some of the far-left's policies under current Mayor Brandon Johnson and now identifies as ""politically independent.""

TRUMP VOWS US 'IN CHARGE' OF VENEZUELA AS HE REVEALS IF HE'S SPOKEN TO DELCY RODRÍGUEZ

""All [Biden] did was impose sanctions and never get the money owed. Democrats have to stop.""

""Under Biden, he watched as Maduro slaughtered and oppressed the people of Venezuela. He watched as Maduro lost the election but still declared himself the winner. He then just allowed millions of Venezuelans to come to America to claim refuge, costing us hundreds of billions of dollars,"" said Green, who has also criticized Johnson over Chicago's response to the illegal immigration crisis.

""Under Trump, Maduro FAFO. He swooped in and took him out of the country altogether,"" Green said.

""Regardless of our disagreements, sometimes diplomacy doesn't work, and we must use aggression to free a nation. Trump freed Venezuelans today and I hope one day they can go home to a stable country.""

Green referenced recent nationwide protests against Trump and said the craziest part of ""socialist[s] crying about Trump taking Maduro [was] saying it's because he wanted a regime change. Maduro didn't win the election. He's only there because he took over the country. I thought y'all didn't want kings.""

Democratic strategist Melissa DeRosa and Sen. Bernie Sanders' senior advisor Faiz Shakir debate the Democratic Socialists of America's influence and future within the Democratic Party.

The Democratic Socialists of America, the nation's largest socialist group with ties to left-wing leaders such as New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, published a lengthy rebuke of the U.S. capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, demanding he and his wife be returned to power as they face criminal charges on U.S. soil. 

""The Trump Administration has started an illegal war against Venezuela,"" the DSA published in a rebuke Saturday. ""This is a nakedly imperialist war to install a US puppet government that will give Venezuela's oil resources over to US corporations and to force US hegemony over Latin America — the new ‘Trump Corollary' to the Monroe Doctrine. This war is illegal both under international law and the laws governing the declaration of war within the United States.""

President Donald Trump confirmed a successful strike on Venezuela Saturday morning in a military operation that did not kill any U.S. military personnel, did not damage U.S. military equipment, and yielded the arrests of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on sweeping narcotics charges. 

The dictatorial president of Venezuela, who was first elected in 2013, is accused of working with cartels and narco gangs in South America and Mexico to distribute millions of pounds of cocaine to the U.S. Trump had vowed to curb the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. while on the campaign trail. When he took office for his second term nearly a year ago, he imposed tariffs on nations such as China over deadly fentanyl or boat strikes in the Carribean targeting suspected drug traffickers from Venezuela.

The DSA hit back in its statement, saying, ""Trump's war has nothing to do with drug trafficking.""

""There is no substantiated evidence that high-level members of the Venezuelan government are 'narco-terrorists,'"" the DSA wrote. ""Yet, the Trump administration is using this claim as the pretext for this illegal war. This is another regime-change war to steal another country's oil, just like the failed war against Iraq, and to crush any resistance to US imperialism. Trump's war will only impoverish the people of Latin America.""

Trump called the strike a massive success over the weekend, celebrating to the media that Maduro and his wife were swiftly captured while commending the military for its execution of the operation. 

""The United States military is the strongest and most fearsome military on the planet. By far. With capabilities and skills our enemies can scarcely begin to imagine. We have the best equipment anywhere in the world,"" he said Saturday during a press conference on the strike. 

The DSA is supported by a handful of left-wing politicians and lawmakers. Most recently, longtime DSA member Mamdani rose through the ranks of New York politics and was elected mayor of the Big Apple in the November election. Lawmakers such as New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib are also prominent members of the left-wing group and have received its endorsement in previous elections.

TRUMP'S MADURO TAKEDOWN RESETS THE GLOBAL CHESSBOARD AND REASSERTS AMERICAN POWER

The DSA listed seven demands following the capture of the dictator, including that Maduro and his wife be returned to Venezuela, ""an end to the failed 'war on drugs,'"" an ""immediate end to the war,"" including the removal of all military presence in the ""Caribbean and an end to any operations with intervention purposes driven by SOUTHCOM.""

Maduro and his wife are being held at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Maduro is expected to be arraigned on Monday afternoon. 

""Democratic Socialists of America calls on the people of the United States to protest and resist this illegal war and to stand in solidarity with the sovereign people of Venezuela,"" the DSA added.

Left-wing political leaders such as Mamdani have railed against the U.S. operation in Venezuela, with the newly minted mayor telling the public that he spoke directly with Trump following the strike. 

TRUMP SAYS CUBA IS ‘READY TO FALL' AFTER CAPTURE OF VENEZUELA'S MADURO

""I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law and a desire to see that be consistent each and every day,"" Mamdani said Saturday. ""I registered my opposition, I made it clear and we left it at that.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the mayor's office Monday morning inquiring if Mamdani supports the DSA's rebuke of the operation and list of seven demands, but did not immediately receive a reply.

More moderate Democrats have also taken issue with the strike as unjustified and for failing to notify Congress ahead of the attack, while Republicans have for the most part backed the operation.

""Nicolas Maduro wasn't just an illegitimate dictator; he also ran a vast drug-trafficking operation. That's why he was indicted in U.S. court nearly six years ago for drug trafficking and narco-terrorism,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., posted on X. ""I just spoke to @SecRubio, who confirmed that Maduro is in U.S. custody and will face justice for his crimes against our citizens. I commend President Trump and our brave troops and law-enforcement officers for this incredible operation.""

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to weigh in on the arrest of Nicolás Maduro, the transition of power and the ripple effects for Cuba.

The top lawmaker on the House Intelligence Committee believes that the weekend capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro may have a domino effect in Cuba.

Chairman Rick Crawford, R-Ark., called it ""the beginning of the end"" for the regime there.

""Cuba and Venezuela have had a symbiotic relationship for a long, long time. Cuba needs Venezuelan oil. They no longer have the resources that will be provided by Venezuela,"" Crawford said on Fox News' ""The Big Weekend Show.""

According to Crawford, Venezuela also benefited from the partnership by receiving medical assistance from Cuba and military protections used by Maduro. 

President Miguel Díaz-Canel leads Cuba's government — a one-party Communist state that has long been at odds with the United States. The U.S. has an economic embargo on the country, restricting exports to and from Cuba as well as travel restrictions that limit tourism.

Those measures have been in place for 63 years.

""In February 1962, President John F. Kennedy proclaimed an embargo on trade between the United States and Cuba and directed the Departments of Commerce and the Treasury to implement the embargo, which remains in place today,"" the Department of State explains on its website.

Despite those longstanding tensions, Crawford noted that an impulse for change may also come from a cultural closeness between Cuba and the United States on top of the crumbling of its Venezuelan partnerships.

""You may very well see a popular uprising there. There's a lot of connective tissue. We have really, for lack of a better term, we have a familial bond with Cuba,"" Crawford said. ""We have so many families in South Florida that are directly connected to family members in Cuba that remittances are a big part of their economy. They rely on the United States, whether they want to admit it or not.

""We can play an outsize role there in influencing those folks and helping them to organically rise up and help overcome that oppressive regime,"" Crawford added.

Crawford did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the U.S. should also take military action in Havana.

Crawford said the political cascade caused by the capture of Maduro and the American presence in Venezuela would not be limited to Cuba.

""This also plays into what I call the communist triad of the Western hemisphere, that is Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. This probably doesn't bode well for Nicaragua if we're being honest about it. I mean, I'm sure they're watching anxiously, wondering when the next boot is gonna fall and where they'll be in relation to that,"" Crawford said.

He also sent a message to America's larger adversaries who have built relationships with those countries in Latin and South America.

""Iran, Russia, China, you're playing in the wrong sandbox,"" Crawford said.

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to weigh in on the arrest of Nicolás Maduro, the transition of power and the ripple effects for Cuba.

Cuba acknowledged that 32 of its citizens — described by the government as members of the island's armed forces and intelligence services — were killed during the U.S. operation that seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in Caracas, declaring two days of national mourning in their honor.

Havana did not specify where the personnel were stationed during the raid. But their deaths have renewed scrutiny of years of reporting and international investigations documenting Cuba's deep and covert involvement inside Venezuela's military and intelligence structures.

Jorge Jraissati, a Venezuelan political analyst, said Cuba's intelligence role was critical to the consolidation of power first under Hugo Chávez and later under Maduro. ""Experts usually link Cuba as the most important intelligence provider of Venezuela. This includes issues like running elections, building diplomatic leverage with other countries and keeping the security forces in check, among others,"" he told Fox News Digital.

(Adalberto Roque / AFP via Getty Images)

Jraissati said any transition in Venezuela ""would require the American government, in partnership with the Venezuelan people, to work together on minimizing the Cubans' influence over Venezuela's state apparatus and society at large.""

A Reuters investigation published in August 2019 found that two confidential agreements signed in 2008 granted Cuba sweeping access to Venezuela's armed forces and intelligence services. Under those agreements, Cuban officials were authorized to train Venezuelan troops, restructure intelligence agencies and help build an internal surveillance system focused on monitoring Venezuela's own military, according to the report.

Those arrangements played a central role in transforming Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency — the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM) — into a force designed to detect dissent, instill fear within the ranks and ensure loyalty to the government, the investigation found.

Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president, right, greets Miguel Diaz-Canel, Cuba's president, during the 23rd States of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America People's Trade Treaty (ALBA-TCP) Summit at Miraflores Palace in Caracas, Venezuela, on Wednesday, April 24, 2024. The alliance of leftist countries in the region are meeting to reject the U.S.' reimposed oil sanctions on Venezuela, ending a six-month reprieve for the Maduro regime. 

The findings were later echoed by the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela, which said it reviewed a 2008 memorandum of understanding between Cuba and Venezuela. The U.N. mission reported that the agreement provided for Cuban advisory oversight in the restructuring of Venezuelan military intelligence, including the creation of new agencies, training of counterintelligence officers and assistance with surveillance and infiltration techniques.

Former Venezuelan officials cited by Havana Times and El Toque have described Cuban advisers embedded across some of the country's most sensitive institutions, including the civilian intelligence service SEBIN, DGCIM, the defense ministry, ports and airports, and Venezuela's national identification system.

Human rights organizations and international investigators say those structures were central to the government's response to mass protests in 2014 and 2017, when Venezuelan security forces carried out widespread arrests and deadly crackdowns on demonstrators.

The U.N. fact-finding mission documented patterns of extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detention and torture, and reported that Cuban advisers helped train Venezuelan personnel in methods used to track, interrogate and repress political opponents.

Experts say Cuba's admission that its military and intelligence personnel were killed during a U.S. operation inside Venezuela has sharpened focus on the alliance's true depth, turning years of documentation into an immediate geopolitical issue.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Venezuela: It all depends on the meaning of the word ‘run'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/4406336/venezuela-all-depends-on-meaning-of-run/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:37:46 GMT","

VENEZUELA: IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE MEANING OF THE WORD ‘RUN.' There have been two parts to the political world's reaction to the American operation that deposed and captured Nicolas Maduro. The first part was to marvel at what Brit Hume called the “extraordinary level of skill, technology and daring” on the part of American forces and leadership. Hume noted that the U.S. performance, when considered alongside the flawless attack on Iran's nuclear program, sent to the world “precisely the opposite signal from that sent by the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan.”

The second reaction emerged after President Donald Trump's news conference. “We're going to run [Venezuela] until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,” Trump said. “So we don't want to be involved with having somebody else get in and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years. So we are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.”

With that, much of the attention to the Venezuela matter turned away from the military and intelligence aspects of the operation to a simple and absolutely vital question: What did Trump mean by “run”?

The president explained to some degree but still left a lot of questions. A reporter asked, “What is the mechanism by which you're going to run the country? Are you going to designate U.S. officials to coordinate?” “Yes,” answered Trump. “It's all being done right now. We're designating people. We're talking to people. … We're going to let you know who those people are.” When asked who would take part, Trump said, “It's largely going to be, for a period of time, the people that are standing behind me.” Behind Trump at that moment were Secretary of State Marco Rubio, War Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan “Razin” Caine.

Trump was also asked if “running the country means that U.S. troops will be on the ground.” He appeared a little impatient with the question. After all, the operation was proof that American forces were already on the ground in Venezuela. “You know, they always say ‘boots on the ground,'” Trump said. “So we're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have. We had boots on the ground last night at a very high level, actually. We're not afraid of it. We don't mind saying it, but we're going to make sure that that country is run properly. We're not doing this in vain.”

The next morning, Rubio hit the morning shows to flesh out the administration's position. He explained that the United States will not be “running” Venezuela in the sense of appointing its officials, rewriting its laws, and manning its offices. Instead, the U.S. aims to steer Venezuelan officials away from corruption in the nation's oil business, away from narcotics trafficking, away from mass migration, and toward better relations with the U.S. 

“Right now we have to take the first steps, and the first steps are securing what's in the national interest of the United States and also beneficial to the people of Venezuela,” Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press. “And those are the things that we're focused on right now: No more drug trafficking, no more Iran/Hezbollah presence there, and no more using the oil industry to enrich all of our adversaries around the world and not benefiting the people of Venezuela or, frankly, benefiting the United States and the region.”

Rubio stressed that the key to the plan is the oil that supports the country's entire economy. “We don't need Venezuela's oil,” he said. “We have plenty of oil in the United States. What we're not going to allow is for the oil industry in Venezuela to be controlled by adversaries of the United States. Why does China need their oil? Why does Russia need their oil? Why does Iran need their oil? They're not even in this continent. This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live, and we're not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors, and rivals of the United States. It's as simple as that.”

The U.S. has tremendous “leverage” over Venezuela, Rubio said, because the U.S. can block the country's oil transactions. “We have a quarantine on their oil,” he told ABC's This Week. “That means their economy will not be able to move forward until the conditions that are in the national interest of the United States and the interests of the Venezuelan people are met.”

Will the plan work? The early statements about it, both from Trump and Rubio, are at such a level of generalization that it is hard to visualize what the proposal will really involve. But the key to things, at least from the perspective of U.S. politics, is how much, and for how long, Venezuela will require intense U.S. effort and attention. 

The important thing is for Trump to stabilize the situation in Venezuela quickly. If the U.S. intervention leads to chaos and disorder, requiring increasing amounts of American involvement, Trump will face accusations that he has gotten the U.S. into a morass in South America. There will be accusations he has gotten involved in the kind of nation building he promised never to pursue. So the sooner Trump can accomplish a “safe, proper, and judicious transition,” the better. If Trump can pull that off, the critics will in retrospect seem alarmist, Trump's opponents will be wrong again, and Trump will have a success, even as he focuses on domestic issues in midterm campaigning. If he can't pull it off, he'll have big trouble.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The activists who courted U.S. intervention are now being sidelined.

As bombs landed on Caracas early Saturday morning, friends and family members told me that their houses seemed to shake. The city is in a valley, so nearly every building has a view—on this January morning, of fires dotting the hills and little, loud aircraft flying in all directions, like a mosquito swarm on a hot night.

Venezuelans have been through a lot in recent decades: the rise of Hugo Chávez, a ruinous revolution that turned democracy into dictatorship, an economic crisis that became a humanitarian one, the emigration of more than one in four inhabitants. Many people are by now familiar with the smell of tear gas and the sound of gunshots. But the sensory experience of bombs falling from the sky was for the most part novel. The Trump administration hit military bases mainly in or near Caracas; at least seven explosions killed dozens of people.

Many Venezuelans welcomed the strikes. Before Saturday, polls showed that a majority of Venezuelans both inside and outside the country favored U.S. military intervention. María Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition movement, issued a statement following the American operation: “Venezuelans, the hour of freedom has arrived!” she said, adding, “Let's remain vigilant, active, and organized, until the Democratic Transition is fulfilled.”

The simplest reason for celebration is that Nicolás Maduro is out. The dictator who imprisoned and tortured Venezuelan politicians, activists, and ordinary people was snatched from his bed and put on an American plane with his wife, Cilia Flores. Photos of him under arrest have already brought catharsis to millions. But there are reasons to be wary too. The dubious legality and shifting rationales behind Donald Trump's actions raise questions about the administration's intentions. The New York Times reported last month that some officials have sought a pretext to invoke emergency powers to deport Venezuelans from the United States. And Trump has given no indication of caring about the legitimacy of the regime that will follow Maduro's.

Machado appears unbothered by these concerns. She has long been close to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and their friendship may well have influenced the administration's Venezuela policy. Months before the first Caribbean strike—and before the administration singled out Venezuela as a drug threat—Machado told me that she hoped to see a “big anti-narcotics operation in the Caribbean.” In the spring, she hosted a press conference where she framed the fall of Maduro as “A Trillion-Dollar Opportunity” for American investors. She said that post-Maduro Venezuela would welcome American oil companies—an invitation that Trump officials appear to be seizing on. When she won the Nobel Peace Prize in October, she dedicated her award to Trump.

The Trump administration has done exactly what Machado asked of it, but Trump spoke of her dismissively in his press conference on Saturday. It's not clear whether she will have much of a role in shaping Venezuela's future. “She is a very nice woman, but she doesn't have respect within the country,” Trump told a reporter, without so much as naming her. Instead, power will be shared between the American government and Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, at least for the time being. Machado seems to have lost control of the operation she helped set in motion.



Venezuela's opposition wasn't always so sanguine about foreign military intervention. Its leaders and activists have tried and failed to bring down the dictatorship by many other means in the nearly 13 years since Maduro succeeded the far more charismatic Chávez as Venezuela's strongman. Protests erupted across the country in 2014 and again in 2017; Maduro sent tanks into the streets, arrested dissidents, and waited for the heat to subside. In 2019, opposition leaders persuaded the first Trump administration to recognize the politician Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate leader. Dozens of countries followed suit. Maduro ramped up repression and did what he does best—waited things out.

During the 2019 debacle, opposition leaders debated what exactly they wanted the United States to do if Maduro refused to relinquish power. Guaidó was himself ambivalent. “If the Americans would propose a military intervention, I would probably accept,” he told an Italian newspaper. Even then, Machado was more decisive. “I want to be very precise,” she told the BBC in 2019. “Maduro will only leave power when he's faced with a credible, imminent, and severe threat of the use of force.”

Leopoldo López, an opposition leader who spent many years in prison and is now in exile, told me in 2024 that he and Machado were always seen as “more radical” than others in the movement. At a time when some activists worried that calling Venezuelans to demonstrate would only put them at risk, López and Machado favored mass protests.

Machado ran for president against Maduro in 2024, after securing more than 90 percent of the vote in the opposition primary. Maduro barred her candidacy, perhaps calculating that no substitute would accrue the same gravitas. In fact, the substitute Machado chose, Edmundo González, beat Maduro 2–1. And Machado had the tally sheets to prove it, because she'd coordinated volunteer election watchers all over the country. International bodies certified Machado's counts. World leaders applauded her remarkable victory. Still, Maduro hung on to power.

The electoral fraud left the opposition dejected. “Everything that I always dreamt would happen happened,” Roberto Patiño, an opposition activist, told me in the fall. “We won; presidents backed us; Maduro was offered an exit path. I really thought, This has to work!”

“Maduro is a cockroach,” Ana Milagros Parra, a 28-year-old activist, told me. “He always survives.”

Parra fled Caracas for Bogotá after the election. Then two of her friends nearly died there in what Colombian authorities said might have been an assassination attempt ordered by Caracas, and she fled Bogotá for Buenos Aires. Now she's a social-media influencer. She told me that she doesn't like Trump and thought that his justifications for striking boats were bogus, because Venezuela is not a major player in drug trafficking. But, she said, the opposition couldn't “afford the luxury” of letting this opportunity slide.

I heard a similar line of argument from another opposition influencer, Germania Rodriguez, a freelance journalist. “Listen, what's going on here is, beggars can't be choosers,” Rodriguez told me. “And no one but Trump has taken an interest in our crisis.”



One could easily imagine that the fires around Caracas, and the belittling remarks of the U.S. president, would lead those who'd supported the strikes to reconsider their views. But that's not what I've observed. Figures who have long backed the opposition are praising the attacks as a success.

“The operation against Nicolás Maduro is not just any military operation,” Ivan Duque, a former president of Colombia and a longtime friend of Machado's, told me. “It is a humanitarian operation, because it was about freeing Venezuela from a satrap, a tyrant, a dictator.”

Duque had watched the press conference in which Trump dismissed Machado, but he wasn't too worried. After all, it was a spontaneous comment, possibly off-script. Duque expressed confidence that Trump was ultimately a “democrat” despite what others might claim about his authoritarian inclinations: “In politics, there are different styles,” he said. “But beyond style, what matters to me are results.”

Genesis Davila, a Venezuelan human-rights lawyer based in Washington, D.C., told me that she had “no reservations” about the way the strikes were carried out. As the founder of a nonprofit called Defiende Venezuela, Davila has worked to hold Maduro accountable under international law. For years, she has documented extrajudicial killings, persecutions, arbitrary detentions, and torture. “What mechanisms were international law and the human-rights system offering to stop Maduro?” she said. “More reports? More condemnations?”

Not even people on Machado's team seem to have been discouraged by Trump's contemptuous remarks. “María Corina Machado's force is not something that emanates from Trump's finger,” Milos Alcalay, a career diplomat who advises Machado on international politics, told me; it comes “from the support that Venezuelans have given to her.” Trump's claim that the United States would “run” Venezuela was “absurd,” Alcalay conceded. But he suggested that the president couldn't possibly have meant it, that he was just exerting pressure.

I asked him this: What if Trump has just claimed Maduro as a trophy, and nothing else changes in Venezuela?

“I've thought about it,” Alcalay said. “But I don't think that'll be the case.”

For the moment, however, regime change is far from guaranteed. Political prisoners remain imprisoned. Maduro's vice president is now interim president and seems keen on preserving the status quo: “In Venezuela, there is only one president,” she said on Saturday in a televised address. “His name is Nicolás Maduro.” Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino, two of Maduro's most important ministers, have made a point of speaking publicly many times over the weekend.

Maduro is now at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City. His first court appearance could come as soon as today, on counts of “narco-terrorism conspiracy,” “cocaine importation conspiracy,” and weapons offenses—charges that are at once extremely serious and grossly mismatched to the enormity of his record.

Venezuela's opposition, meanwhile, remains in limbo. Will it pay a price for courting a war based on lies? Right now, those I've contacted are ebullient, and the movement seems united in the faith that whatever comes next for Venezuela cannot be as bad as what it has endured under Maduro.

Truman, Reagan, and Monroe wouldn't approve of the language, but a doctrine is a doctrine, even if it's only five words long.

In Marco Rubio's telling, the stunning events in Venezuela on Saturday illustrate an essential truth—possibly the essential truth—about Donald Trump's presidency: Global leaders cross him at their peril. “I don't understand yet how they haven't figured this out,” Trump's secretary of state told reporters at Mar-a-Lago just hours after the capture of Nicolás Maduro.

World leaders could be forgiven for not understanding the simplicity of the Trump Doctrine, especially those who assume that the world's dominant superpower still possesses complicated mechanisms for the manufacture of foreign-policy strategies. The country that gave the world the Truman Doctrine and the Reagan Doctrine as well as Trump's apparent favorite, the Monroe Doctrine, now embraces the plainest and most ostentatiously bellicose of national-security policies: Fuck around and find out. Trump's own Pentagon chief, the self-styled (until Congress approves the title change) secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, said as much when he told the nation that Maduro “effed around, and he found out.”

If the Fuck Around and Find Out Doctrine doesn't sound like a concept for a stable and predictable foreign policy—one purpose of Washington's doctrine-articulation complex—then maybe you can sympathize with those who Rubio says are still struggling to get it. Some experts reject the idea that something this crude even earns the right to be called a doctrine. As John Bolton, currently a Trump nemesis but once one of his first-term national security advisers, told us, “There is no Trump Doctrine: No matter what he does, there is no grand conceptual framework; it's whatever suits him at the moment.” Kori Schake, the director of foreign- and defense-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, cautioned us that “we shouldn't ennoble Trump policy by saying there's a doctrine.”

In the early decades of the 20th century, “America First” was in part a euphemism for U.S. isolation from the ravages of war in Europe. Trump then revived the term, starting in 2016, when he promised to end America's long post-9/11 conflicts, which cost taxpayers trillions and failed to deliver clear victories. Instead, he would prioritize domestic issues and the well-being of Americans. Yet there he was on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, vowing to “run Venezuela for the foreseeable future.” And if that involves a bit of nation building and American boots on the ground, well, so be it. Trump, it turns out, seems to believe that a little foreign adventurism is just fine, as long as he's the one doing the adventuring. It was a departure from his previous instinct to limit his foreign interventions to short, kinetic bursts of force—an unofficial one-and-done doctrine—visible in his first-term strike on the Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and his more recent decision to dispatch U.S. bombers deep into Iran.

“Rebuilding is not a bad thing, in Venezuela's case; the country has gone to hell,” Trump told our colleague Michael Scherer in an interview yesterday. But when asked why similar actions in Iraq were an abomination, the president punted. “That was Bush,” Trump said. “You'll have to ask Bush that question, because we should have never gone into Iraq. That started the Middle East disaster.” (In a separate Atlantic interview last year, Trump said that “America First” is whatever he says it is: “Considering that the term wasn't used until I came along, I think I'm the one that decides that.”)

The White House quickly embraced the newly articulated doctrine, circulating after Saturday's Mar-a-Lago press conference an image of a determined-looking Trump striding up steps, with the caption—you guessed it—“FAFO.” Another administration publicity push featured Rubio's warning to foreign nations to not “play games with President Trump,” a politer version of the same idea. “The 47th president of the United States is not a game player,” Rubio said at Mar-a-Lago. “If you don't know, now you know.” (It's unclear if Rubio—a self-professed rap fan—was deliberately quoting the Notorious B.I.G., but the White House later posted a video set to the Biggie song.)

It should come as no surprise that Hegseth, with his penchant for scrapping on social media and dressing down generals for being fat, is practically tripping over himself to make FAFO happen. Asked Saturday about where the FAFO policy has applied, Hegseth cited Iran's nuclear program, Houthi rebels in Yemen, and the southern U.S. border. “There's been a lot of politicians that want to talk. They want to talk peace. They want to talk diplomacy. They want to talk negotiations. They want to talk globalism and international organizations,” he told CBS News. “President Trump speaks through action.”

So far, Trump appears most willing to take a FAFO approach to the Western Hemisphere. One person close to Trump told us that the president has embraced a different set of criteria for responding to what he sees as irritants in the Americas—such as Maduro—than for those farther afield. “If this were happening in a different part of the globe, none of this would have taken place,” this person said on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly. In other words, Trump views many parts of this hemisphere as a rightful extension of his U.S. sandbox, where he is free to snatch and grab what he pleases. (That glistening Venezuelan oil? The Panama Canal? Mine! That tantalizing slice of Greenland? Also mine!)

Trump told Scherer that Greenland had not been on his mind when he'd been ousting Maduro—but he then proceeded to offer real-time foreign-policy musings on that very topic, in one of his characteristic verbal weaves. “You know, I wasn't referring to Greenland at that time, but we do need Greenland, absolutely,” Trump said. “And we need it for defense. You know, it's surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships. We need Greenland.” (Katie Miller, the wife of the top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, posted an image on social media on Saturday of Greenland covered by an American flag, with the caption: “SOON.” And Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, urged Washington yesterday to end its threats, which she said make “absolutely no sense.”)

Kevin Whitaker, who served as U.S. ambassador to Colombia during the Obama and first Trump administrations, told us that the president's “or else” approach to Venezuela is visible in Trump's second-term blueprint for global statecraft. The idea behind Trump's new National Security Strategy, Whitaker said, is that “we're the hegemon in this hemisphere, and we can do whatever we want, including actions that are of questionable legitimacy.” The manifesto even cites a “Trump corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, the early-19th-century policy that sought to block European colonial activity in the Americas.

Like his predecessors, however, the U.S. president isn't just seeking to fend off transatlantic imperialists; he is also laying claim to the hemisphere's strategic sites and resources. The Maduro ouster is a manifestation of Trump and his senior officials' belief that powerful countries have the right to dominate their surrounding continents and oceans, an idea uncomfortably close to China's hegemonic claim to the western Pacific and Russia's imperial designs on Ukraine and other nations of the former Soviet Union. And U.S. actions, in turn, are designed to signal to those rival powers to stay away. One U.S. official told us that he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been “scared shitless” by the U.S. grabbing Maduro because he knows “not to fuck with the U.S. military.”

Trump, at the Mar-a-Lago press conference on Saturday, blamed past presidents for fighting far-off wars while allowing leftist regimes in America's vicinity to fester. He alleged that Venezuela has committed a host of offenses, including sending criminals to the United States en masse, running drugs, and stealing American oil. “All of these actions were in gross violation of the core principles of American foreign policy dating back more than two centuries—not anymore,” Trump said. “The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot, by a real lot.”

Many Venezuelans, both at home and in the U.S., welcomed Maduro's ouster after more than a decade of economic mismanagement, corruption, and repression. Trump said at Mar-a-Lago that a group of senior officials, including Rubio and Hegseth, would be part of a group that would “run” Venezuela. But that's about as far as the planning appears to have gone. On NBC News's Meet the Press yesterday, when asked whether he and other senior officials were indeed running Venezuela, Rubio responded that U.S. officials were just “running policy” there. He also depicted the capture of Maduro as a law-enforcement operation to apprehend the president and his wife because they face charges in U.S. court. “We are not going to be able to allow in our hemisphere a country that becomes a crossroads for the activities of all of our adversaries around the world,” he said.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One yesterday evening, “This isn't a country, like, we have to travel 24 hours in an airplane. This is Venezuela. This is our area: the Don-roe Doctrine.” He also managed, in just 37 minutes, to threaten or hint at military action against Colombia, Cuba, Greenland, Iran, Mexico, and Venezuela (again).

Even before he extracted Maduro, Trump was employing the instruments of U.S. power in new, radical, and contradictory ways across the Americas. His administration has threatened to strike cartels in Mexico over its government's objections, pardoned a former Honduran president convicted in the U.S. on drug-trafficking offenses, and offered a $20 billion line of credit to Argentina.

“There's example after example of where they treat the Americas differently than they treat involvement elsewhere,” Ricardo Zuniga, who served as a senior official for Latin America during the Biden administration, told us. “They have a very 19th-century view of the world, and they're proud of that.” The United States' historic penchant for heavy-handed involvement in Latin America has often had a perversely counterproductive effect, from Nicaragua and Cuba in the early 1900s to Chile in the 1970s: It has given rise to generations of nationalist leaders who railed against Yankee imperialism.

Read: Even close allies are asking why Trump wants to run Venezuela

There may be other limits on the FAFO doctrine. The person close to Trump said that the president still has no appetite for a prolonged occupation of a foreign nation. But he is more than willing to use the threat of such action as leverage over the country's interim leaders. In Venezuela, that is Maduro's second-in-command, Delcy Rodríguez, who was sworn in as interim president on Saturday. Trump has made clear that there is an “or else” hanging over her head: a second wave of military action should she not comply with U.S. demands. “If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told Scherer yesterday.

It is all, this person said, part of the plan. “Most presidents would not go out and say, ‘I'm not afraid to put boots on the ground,' because their base would go, ‘Wait a minute,'” the person told us. “But Trump is willing to be misunderstood in the short term to get what he wants.”

Trump's post-Maduro plans are murky.

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

The political takeover of Venezuela does not appear to be going according to plan, if there ever was a plan. A day after the raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump used the phrase “run the country.” A day later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio watered it down to “running policy” and made the next phase sound more like a series of strong suggestions. Trump also publicly suggested that Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez might cooperate with the United States. But then Rodríguez gave a televised address saying Venezuela “will never return to being the colony of another empire.” Trump followed that up with a threat, delivered through an interview with The Atlantic: “If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”

Unlike the precise military operation that whisked Maduro out of Venezuela, the political follow-up seems like improvisation and chaos, but maybe chaos is the point. In this episode of Radio Atlantic we talk with staff writers Michael Scherer, who talked with President Trump on Sunday, and Vivian Salama, who writes about the administration and Venezuela. They talk about Trump's evolving vision of his role in the world and how it might be unsettling other world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Salama notes that world leaders now may “think twice about crossing the U.S. when President Trump is so unpredictable and uses the U.S. military in very unconventional ways, and shuns the guardrails that keep a U.S. president in check.”

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: By all accounts, the U.S. military's raid in Venezuela on Saturday was efficient, clean, meticulously planned. President Trump, who watched it unfold in Mar-a-Lago, said it was like a TV show. Dead of night, Delta Force troops burst into Nicolás Maduro's compound and captured him and his wife. Soon after, Trump posted a picture of the Venezuelan dictator on social media, blindfolded, wearing headphones, and with his hands apart, like he just dropped the controls.

But since that military operation, everything about the U.S. government's entanglement with Venezuela is murky and messy.

I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic.

If the goal of the Venezuelan raid was to capture a defendant wanted in U.S. courts for suspected narco-terrorism, then mission accomplished. Maduro should be showing up in a New York courtroom today.

But in subsequent interviews—including with Atlantic staff writer Michael Scherer—the president sounds like he's constantly shifting the goalposts. Is the U.S. going to “run” Venezuela, as Trump suggested on Saturday? Are U.S. companies going to take over the country's oil reserves? And why is Trump now also talking about Greenland?

The answers to all these questions have massive implications for U.S. foreign policyand for signals the US is sending to other powerful countries about how to act in their own regions.

To help us know what to watch out for in the days ahead, we have staff writers Michael Scherer and Vivian Salama.

Michael, welcome to the show.

Michael Scherer: Thank you for having me.

Rosin: Vivian, welcome.

Vivian Salama: Always great to be with you.

Rosin: So, Michael, you talked to Trump this weekend. How did he sound and what did he tell you?

Scherer: Jovial as always. I called him a little after 9:30 [a.m.] on Sunday. He had just arrived at his West Palm Beach Golf Course, very happily took the call. We talked for a few minutes, and he was very happy to take my questions. You know, I had called mainly because I was curious how to square the two very different messages we'd gotten Saturday about what was going on in Venezuela. He said in a press conference midday that the vice president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, who's now the acting president, was going to work with the U.S. and had a very productive conversation with Marco Rubio.

And then a few hours later, she went on national television in Venezuela and rather forcefully rebutted that, saying that Nicolás Maduro was still the president, that the government was still in place, that it would follow out his wishes, that it would vigorously reject colonialism in any form, and that American actions were basically an effort to steal resources from Venezuela.

And so I asked him, does he still think Delcy Rodríguez is working with the U.S. government, willing to do everything? And his answer was, “If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” Which was an outright threat—not a specific threat, but clearly a threat, and indicated that this is still very much an unresolved situation.

Rosin: Vivian, how did you interpret that contradiction? Was she calling his bluff? How does this actually play out? How does this evolve?

Salama: Well, one of the interesting things that I noticed very soon after the Department of Justice unsealed the indictment against Maduro on Saturday was that Delcy Rodríguez was not named in that indictment.

A number of other officials were named in the indictment, but she was notably left out, and that suggested immediately that there was probably some sort of cooperation or understanding between her and the U.S., at least for the time being. And so we were really trying to dig in. Amazingly, Michael was able to eventually just ask Trump himself about what the understanding was.

And of course, later on, Trump came out to the podium and acknowledged that Secretary Rubio was speaking with her. And they basically described her in not these exact words, but said she was basically the best of the worst options until something can be sorted out for the country. And so it does seem that there is some sort of an understanding between them.

Whether or not she was condemning the U.S., calling for—you know, initially she was calling for proof of life of Maduro, and then she was saying he was the legitimate president and pushing back on a lot of the claims that the U.S. was putting out there. Whether or not she was doing so to save face or whether she's a true believer in these: That's really hard to tell at the moment.

Things are so chaotic and so fluid. She is probably, to a degree, very nervous for what will happen to her either way, either in Venezuela or if the U.S. were to come after her. And so she has to kind of play this game a little bit. And so there's definitely a number of contradictions, and I don't think that we should take her word as an absolute guarantee of what her position is.

It is obvious, though, that the U.S. did spare her, at least in the indictment, for the time being because they feel that she may be the most malleable person within Maduro's inner circle to deal with. And so that's kind of where we were on Sunday when Michael then reached President Trump himself to figure out what was happening.

Rosin: Right. So what you're both saying is, this is playing out, and we can't take exactly the words they're saying at face value. So I'm curious what you will be watching. Michael, did you get the sense that they were surprised? I mean, the military operation was so meticulously planned. They'd been researching and prepping. Was there a plan for the day one, day two, day three, as you saw it? Like, did they expect her to resist?

Scherer: I think what is remarkable is how much of a victory lap they took Saturday. It was a pretty well-executed operation. But they all, basically, in the senior ranks of leadership, declared victory at that point. You know, This is an example of Trump's leadership. You know, Pete Hegseth, his defense secretary, went on television to say, This is totally unlike Iraq because we basically already won. And what that leaves out, obviously, is that we don't know what the outcome is. We don't know yet what's happened. And it's gonna take some time before that sorts itself out.

I mean, there are scenarios here that we reported before all this happened where the military splits up and heads up into the woods and the mountains and you have a bunch of different moneymaking groups that are armed, that operate independently in the country that, you know, the country kind of falls apart. That's probably not gonna happen, but it could happen.

There are scenarios where the U.S. actually does try and directly run Venezuela, like President Trump said yesterday, and it goes very badly because history says that often goes very badly. You know, the local population resists, and things don't go as well as they should.

It's also possible that things go pretty well. So I think there's just a big open question about what is gonna come next.

Rosin: Vivian, as you are tracking this evolution, what are you gonna be watching for? Like, are you gonna be watching for what Delcy Rodríguez says? How the White House responds? What should we be keeping our eye on to see how this unfolds? What comes out of this chaos?

Salama: Well, one of the classic questions that we have starting this new week is who is actually running Venezuela. Now, of course, Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as the interim president, but President Trump came out to the podium on Saturday and said that the U.S. now runs Venezuela, which in my opinion was probably even more shocking than the arrest of Maduro itself and the operation that they had staged earlier.

This is exactly what President Trump had, dating back to his first campaign, condemned. These nation-building exercises where America spends billions of dollars going into countries and taking them over and trying to, kind of, build these democratic societies. And so it seemed, when he went to the podium, that that was what he was suggesting, although he made it very clear that the U.S. was doing so largely to capitalize on the enormous oil resources in Venezuela.

But then Secretary Rubio came out on Sunday and kind of backtracked that and didn't explicitly say the U.S. isn't running Venezuela, but he essentially said that, calling it instead a military quarantine where the U.S. is basically trying to just help the country go in the right direction.

And so the big question we really have is: What is the plan? Which was the question that we've had now for weeks and weeks. In fact, I wrote a rather lengthy article in The Atlantic about this very question: Does the U.S. have a plan for the day after Maduro?

They talk about a number of options, but whether or not they really charted out a course by shoring up loyalty in the military, it does seem to an extent that was happening within the CIA, that they were working covertly over the past few weeks to shore up some loyalty within the military, because the military was going to be key to the success.

But who comes in afterwards, how it plays out, whether or not the opposition is able to successfully, then, succeed this transition—that is the big question, and that is something that we have not been able to get answers from the administration about. They say, Of course there's a plan. We say, What is it? And they brush us off.

Now, folks I've spoken to in the administration say it's options, not so much a plan. And others say, There's a plan; it's just being kept very secret.

Rosin: What about María Machado? She's the Venezuelan opposition leader who won the Nobel Prize, but surprisingly, Trump dismissed her, calling her a nice woman who lacks respect. Is she part of this plan?

Salama: So she is definitely one of the most prominent figures within the opposition. But what ended up happening was Maduro—at the time when the elections happened and she had gained popular support—he issued a warrant for her arrest and declared it illegitimate. And so another figure, Edmundo González, ended up running in her place, and he won an election. Now, he's been in exile in Spain since winning that election, but he is viewed, including here in the U.S., as the legitimate president of Venezuela because of the fact that back in 2024, he won the popular vote.

María Machado has basically deferred to González the fact that he would ultimately be the leader, but there's a number of people who believe that Machado was the original legitimate successor to Maduro and that she should be the one to kind of carry that mantle.

But for now, it seems that the administration has thrown its back behind González. But you will not hear them really saying that explicitly. They support the opposition, but they've been very careful not to name names except for President Trump. And it was only because he was asked about her at that press conference that he made those comments. Secretary Rubio and others have sort of tap-danced around naming names because they want the Venezuelan people to be the ones to ultimately figure out who leads them moving forward.

Rosin: So, you are laying out a road map that's pretty organized. Essentially, the military keeps the peace, and then you usher in an opposition that's somewhat democratically elected.

Salama: But it's easier said than done. And you're talking now about a country that has economically been in shambles for decades now, where corruption is rampant and mismanagement—you're talking about poor infrastructure everywhere. Not to mention the fact that you have cartels running around in the country and what they call the colectivos, the armed civilian groups, which as of Saturday were reportedly kind of roaming the streets already, trying to seize on any potential chaos that might ensue in the aftermath of Maduro's arrest.

And so everyone I speak to, especially folks who know Venezuela so well, say, Unfortunately, the likelihood of things getting worse before they get better are very, very high. And the question is, can they sort of keep the train on the tracks and keep moving so that there can be a peaceful transition and things can stay stable long enough for the opposition to then get all of its people and all its ducks in a row, and then finally have a referendum to come into power? That is the question.

Rosin: Michael, do you have a sense of Trump's patience for this long process that Vivian is describing? You did talk to him about regime change, which as we all know, is a very sticky, complicated process. So what did he say to you about regime change?

Scherer: I was struck by that press conference in which he said, We run Venezuela. Having covered the U.S. involvement in Iraq in the 2000s, and then Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, in which he ran explicitly against these endless wars and nation building abroad and regime-change wars—and so I asked him about that apparent contradiction. And he said, Well, in the case of Venezuela, there is nothing wrong with either regime change or nation building

I don't think he was referring to a major U.S. taxpayer–led project. He's talking about bringing in U.S. oil companies to rebuild their oil infrastructure. But it's a pretty dramatic shift from where he's been before. In terms of how he's thinking of this process playing out, I think he sees this as a negotiation, as a deal he's trying to strike. It's all about this transaction, and he is trying to project maximum strength, maximum power. And that's how he does deals. He goes for the maximum to begin with, and then he figures out how much he has to pull back or whether he has to put another stick in there. And I think that was seen in my interview with him on Sunday morning.

Rosin: Oh, I see. So that's why he said we might attack again, because that's the place he always starts from.

Scherer: Yes. And that's why he said that the vice president has to watch herself because she could face an outcome even worse than Maduro.

Salama: Also, just to add to Michael, from the years of covering him, he likes to convey that sense of unpredictability. It's almost a superpower, if you think about it. This is something I hear from foreign diplomats around the world is that he's so unpredictable that some of America's adversaries, even, are a little bit too nervous to be the aggressor in this environment because they don't know how Trump will react.

And so when Trump throws veiled threats or just very blatant threats, like what he told Michael out there, people take it seriously because they don't find him to be predictable as maybe some of his predecessors were believed to be.

Rosin: Right. So Michael, then how do you judge things going forward? Like, do you watch what he does and not so much what he says? Or do you just think of it as a long negotiating game? Like, how can you just track what he's gonna do and not do?

Scherer: I think the biggest X factor here is not in his control. We have to find out what happens in Venezuela and how they react. And I think he is probably in more political peril around this, if things go south, than he would like to let on.

Rosin: Domestic political peril, you mean.

Scherer: Domestic. There was already a pretty stark division within his coalition over the bombing of Iran, over actions he's taken to continue supporting the Ukrainian military, even though he's pulled back in other ways. I think a lot of his voters, a lot of people in this country, are not happy with where the country is right now, were very drawn to his message of “America First,” which used to mean we are focused only on domestic issues and we're gonna leave the rest of the world to the world and we're gonna have a strong military and they're not gonna mess with us.

He's now talking about the “Don-roe Doctrine,” a remake of the Monroe Doctrine, which basically says the Western Hemisphere will be controlled entirely by the United States and that Europe has to stay away, and by extension, China has to stay away. And that's a pretty dramatic shift from where he was before.

So assuming things go well, assuming he can deliver on this promise he's basically made to the American people right now that we're gonna take their oil, and it's gonna make us wealthier, and American companies are gonna thrive now that we've gotten rid of Maduro, and drug trafficking is going to decline now that we've gotten rid of Maduro—that could be fine. But if things go poorly there, and I again think there's a lot of moving parts that the U.S. government does not control and that can't be immediately solved with helicopter gunship,s there's lots of scenarios here that are not ideal for the United States.

[Music]

Rosin: When we come back: Trump once said, “I run the country and the world.” Is he starting to figure out that second part? That's after the break.

[Break]

Rosin: I wanna talk about oil. Trump talked a surprising amount in his press conference about Venezuela stealing our oil. Vivian, what is the story behind this?

Salama: So back in 2007, Nicolás Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez, nationalized the oil industry. And what they essentially said is that any foreign companies, oil companies working in Venezuela needed to team up with the Venezuelan national oil company and give them a 51 percent stake in their projects. Otherwise they needed to pack up and go. And you had, at the time, Exxon, Conoco: They all packed up, they closed their projects, and they came back to the United States. The only one who remained was Chevron. Chevron has managed to get licenses over the course of the past few decades, and it was willing to team up with the Venezuelan oil company, but the others left.

And President Trump essentially has come to the conclusion that the U.S. was robbed of those projects, that it's only because of U.S. oil companies that Venezuela was able to do any work on its oil industry. And he has taken that to heart. And so in early December, he announced via Truth Social that he was going to impose an oil embargo on Venezuela, which—it wasn't exactly the right terminology that he was using, but what he was going to do was go after any tankers that were transporting oil illegally from Venezuela to be exported to any Venezuelan allies.

Now, just to give you a sense of what we're talking about, Venezuela has the largest estimated oil reserves in the world. It's about 17 percent of the global reserves or roughly 300 billion barrels. But the thing is, it's only producing about 1 million barrels of oil a day. Its potential has just never really been realized because of a number of factors like poor infrastructure and mismanagement, and not to mention U.S. sanctions that have been imposed over the years. And so the little bit that is produced, because of U.S. sanctions, has to be illegally exported to Venezuelan allies. The vast majority of it goes to China. And you have about 15 percent that does come to the U.S. because Chevron is still operating vis-à-vis waivers. So the U.S. said that it was going to seize any tankers that were transporting Venezuelan oil illegally, and it started doing that, which was pretty, pretty extraordinary.

Now Trump says, because Maduro is out and a lot of those barriers could potentially be lifted, the best use of America's time and effort in Venezuela at this point is to capitalize on those enormous resources in Venezuela. But I have to tell you, Hanna, just to emphasize—something like this, to rebuild Venezuela's economy through the development of its oil industry, it needs, minimum, a decade for that to happen and tens of billions of dollars. And so there's so many obstacles that are involved in even going and trying to do this.

And so President Trump doesn't get into the details in a lot of these press conferences. He says, We're there. We're gonna take the oil. But there are a lot of challenges in place right now.

Rosin: Yeah. What he described is really ambitious, like, way more ambitious than taking over an oil tanker. So what is in the gap here? Either of you can answer this question. Is he just being hopeful, not paying attention to the details? What is the game plan around oil?

Scherer: I think it's a broader strategic view that he has. He made very clear when he came into office for the second term—and it was sort of a surprise 'cause it wasn't really talked about in the first term—that he wanted American control of the entire hemisphere. He went after Panama for their Chinese contracts. He started rattling sabers about Greenland. He started talking about Maduro; his Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear that Cuba was dependent on Venezuela, so, you know, going after Maduro was a step towards going after Cuba. And I think he sees what Vivian just mentioned: There's just massive oil reserves. There's also massive mineral reserves in Venezuela, and he thinks that we should have access to them, that that should be, that is just sort of the right way to do it, and it's been a mistake of previous administrations not to take advantage of their own neighborhood in the way he wants to take advantage of it.

So I don't think he thinks of it in that sort of terms. I mean, I think it is pretty clear that his No. 1 interest here—you just listen to him speak—is not the welfare of the average Venezuelan citizen. It's projecting American power in a way that in the long run benefits the United States.

Rosin: So it's like a sphere. It's an old spheres-of-influence foreign-policy idea. Like, The Americas are our sphere of influence, so we should just—we just have interest in anything that happens here.

Scherer: That's right. And we also had another controversial move he made a few months ago where he guaranteed a number of loans to Argentina to back the sort of right-wing government there in their version of midterm elections because he wanted to make sure that country stays friendly with the United States. So yeah, it's the entire sphere.

I think he's taken with Putin's view of the way great powers should work. You know, Russia has argued for a long time that the former U.S.S.R. countries are properly in the Russian sphere of influence and other great powers should stay out of the way.

Rosin: So, Vivian, then what signal is that sending to other countries? If that is implicit in what he's doing, what does, say, Russia or China read off of that?

Salama: And that is the big question that a number of people have been asking since the raid in Venezuela took place, is that if the U.S. can go into a sovereign nation and pluck a sitting president out of bed essentially—I mean, he had run to the safe house to be technically correct—but take him with his sweatpants and put him on a helicopter and fly him out of the country and put him on a U.S. carrier and charge him in the U.S., shunning congressional approvals, shunning extradition processes, shunning immunity protections that are recognized internationally, then what's to stop Vladimir Putin from doing so in Ukraine? Or Xi Jinping from doing so in Taiwan, for example? It raises a lot of concerns.

Now, again, the fact that President Trump tends to be perceived as so unpredictable may be a saving grace. I've been talking to people all day today, including a few who are close to the president. And one of them in particular says—and this is a direct quote—told me that Putin is “scared shitless” after what happened to Maduro because, according to this person, and again, someone very close to the president, is that the U.S. military just staged something that is making every adversary terrified.

Rosin: Why?

Salama: It's not that it would empower him to go and do the same thing in Ukraine; it's that he would be too afraid to cross the U.S. military and to cross President Trump. And it's probably noteworthy that at the end of that press conference on Saturday in Mar-a-Lago, a reporter asked President Trump, Are you mad at Putin? And he went into a long discussion about how he was not happy with Putin. Remember that that also is being heard in Moscow, too. The president of the United States just took out a leader of a sovereign nation, arrested him, and brought him to the United States. What's to stop him from doing that to anyone else, as well?

So yes. Does it empower, potentially empower Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping or any other adversary [to do] that? Any other aggressor? It certainly does, and everyone I've spoken to acknowledges that is something to be concerned about. But do they also think twice about crossing the U.S. when President Trump is so unpredictable and uses the U.S. military in very unconventional ways and shuns, sort of, the guardrails that keep a U.S. president in check? Also something that they recognize.

Rosin: Interesting. So it both empowers and frightens leaders. It's just a way of keeping everything unstable and potentially under his control.

Salama: And there's the unpredictability element, right?

Rosin: (Laughs.) Yeah. Yeah.

Scherer: The other country that's paying a lot of attention to this is Denmark. Trump has said the U.S. needs Greenland. Greenland is part of Denmark right now. And this is something, this playbook—I mean, it would not be hard for the U.S. military to seize control of Greenland. There's not a lot of people there. The Danish military doesn't have a lot of power. I think there's probably other ways out of it.

But when the administration was talking this weekend about, The world should take notice. I mean, leaders were saying, The world needs to take notice that you can't play games with this president. And when he says he is gonna do something, he does it. Trump has been crystal clear since he took office the second time that Greenland will come under American control one way or another.

And I spoke to him on Sunday. I asked what the Danish should be taking away from this military operation in Venezuela. And he said to me, They're going to have to view it themselves. I really don't know. But then he went on to say, We do need Greenland. Absolutely. We need it for defense. So he wasn't backing down at all.

Rosin: Do you remember, Michael, in your last major interview with Trump, the big takeaway was: “I run the country and the world”?

Scherer: Yeah.

Rosin: Did this newest conversation you had with him, or what happened in Venezuela, color in that view about what Trump meant by that? Like, how he sees himself and his presidency?

Scherer: I think it was a really—you know, when he first said that to me, and this is in the spring, I was sort of struck by the construction. And the construction was, The first time I was president, I was sort of fighting for my life because there were all these investigations of me. And this time, I run the country and the world, and it wasn't something—I mean, obviously, he was feeling better at that time. But the world?

You know, he had just gone through an election that was entirely focused on domestic issues, almost. I mean, there was very little, other than immigration—which you can read as a domestic issue—there was very little discussion of foreign policy during that last race. And he has, from the moment he came in, sought to remake the global order in a way that he just didn't have the ambition the first time.

I mean, he was facing a lot of resistance, but also I think when he was elected in 2016, he didn't really have the theory in place. He didn't know enough about the world to know how to manipulate it to his desires. And it's striking how much he has accomplished in the last year. If you include, you know, the military adventures in Yemen and Iran and Israel, and that he supported the remaking of the global trade system through tariffs, the remaking of the Western Hemisphere through pretty aggressive military and diplomatic action. I mean, it's all been quite stunning. And I think he knew that he wanted to do this very early on.

Rosin: Well, Michael, Vivian, thank you both for joining us today.

Scherer: Thanks.

Salama: Thank you.

In Sentimental Value, the writer-director Joachim Trier probes the real purpose of confessional art.

Separating the art from the artist can be easier debated than done. In 1967, Roland Barthes infamously argued in his essay “The Death of the Author” that a writer's biography should be irrelevant to the meaning or value of their work. In 1983, Nora Ephron asserted the opposite in her novel, Heartburn: “Everything is copy.”

Today's pop culture has tended to agree with Ephron's take: Confession fuels the biggest songs; celebrity memoirs dominate best-seller lists. Whether art is inextricable from the artist is central to many of the buzzy dramas vying for trophies during this year's awards season, too. Hamnet imagines the intimate origins of Shakespeare's famed tragedy Hamlet. Blue Moon and Jay Kelly follow men who have infused their work with so much of their personal life that they find it hard to exist outside of their career. These movies observe how art can function as therapy for the creator, extracting a truth that they couldn't grasp otherwise.

Sentimental Value, an emotionally layered film up for eight Golden Globes this weekend, complicates that perspective. It follows a family of storytellers: Gustav (played by Stellan Skarsgård) is a celebrated director hoping to cast his estranged daughter Nora (Renate Reinsve), an actor, in his first project in 15 years. Nora's sister, Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), is a historian who helps Gustav with researching his script. The tender drama is the latest from the Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Trier who, along with his co-writer, Eskil Vogt, has made plenty of features about creative types. The protagonists of 2006's Reprise are novelists. The story of 2015's Louder Than Bombs hinges on the work of a war photographer. The aimless heroine of their 2021 Oscar-nominated romantic dramedy, The Worst Person in the World, abandons medical school to pursue writing and photography instead.

Read: The Worst Person in the World is devastatingly relatable

Focusing on artistic characters became a pattern—enough that conceiving of Sentimental Value, in part, as a movie about moviemaking brought “a certain shame to Eskil and me,” Trier told me recently, grinning sheepishly at the memory. “We were like, ‘Oh no, are we really doing a film about actors and directors?'” The conceit, they worried, could come off as extremely narrow; the plot's emphasis on the production of Gustav's movie could pull focus away from the emotional stakes, turning Sentimental Value into commentary on the film industry instead.

But when I watched the film, I found myself, like many viewers, wondering something different: whether the father-daughter relationships depicted echoed any of Trier's own feelings about becoming a parent. Those reactions didn't surprise the filmmaker. Since the movie's debut at the Cannes Film Festival, Trier has spoken often about how having children affected his mindset going into Sentimental Value. In one interview, he conceded that the movie was in part about “exorcising fears” about fatherhood; when we spoke, however, he seemed to bristle at that phrasing. He wasn't trying to extract his personal anxieties and commit them to celluloid, he clarified. Making his private thoughts so public in his work, he said, “would be my nightmare.”

If anything, Sentimental Value is about that tension between wanting to explain the origin of your ideas and wanting to distance yourself from your own creations. It also interrogates the cost of drawing from specific, individual experiences. “You deserve something more personal,” Gustav tells Nora when pitching her his screenplay, failing to notice how dismissive the comment sounds of her career. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of her artistry, too: Everything Nora does on stage has always been “personal.” When embodying a character, she can express herself more authentically, something Gustav would know if he ever saw her perform. But Nora suffers from severe stage fright as a result; being able to access her feelings under a fictional guise doesn't mean she's necessarily embracing them. The truth behind the most intimate art can remain a mystery, Sentimental Value posits—even for the artist.

A film is “lifeless,” Trier said, unless its viewers discover what is personal to them as they watch. “You have a wonderful word in English that we don't have in Norwegian,” he said, “and that is verisimilitude, the idea of some sort of contract with the viewer that conveys a sense of truthfulness, yet it's a construct. It's a code.” The goal, in other words, is for the story to feel genuine without being explicitly so.

That can happen when a performer imbues her character with her own nature. In one of the film's most affecting moments, Agnes visits a melancholic Nora, who has been unwilling to perform after Gustav moved forward with his movie without her; he recruited an American star, Rachel Kemp (Elle Fanning), to play the part he'd written for Nora, and has immediately bonded with Rachel. After Agnes encourages Nora to read their father's script, the sisters marvel at how Gustav reveals, in his writing, a side of himself they'd never seen. Nora goes on to wonder how Agnes turned out stable in such a forbidding household. “I had you,” Agnes replies, before crawling onto Nora's bed to embrace her. Agnes then whispers, “I love you”—a line that Lilleaas came up with on the spot.

Read: The sad dads of Hollywood

The ad-lib dramatically changed the scene from how Trier and Vogt had written it. The dynamic between the sisters was originally more antagonistic: Agnes would be carefree, the one in the family hoping to “make everyone happy through humor and avoidance,” Trier told me—much to her sister's annoyance. But Lilleaas, Trier explained, conveyed a “calm, grounded, truthful honesty” when they first met, outside of a formal audition. Her demeanor inspired him: “I could look into her eyes as we talked and I felt, You're real, like really grounded. And then I thought, Let's reinterpret Agnes.”

Realism and fiction occasionally do combine in Sentimental Value in more anticipated ways. The film is purposefully a family affair for Trier: His two children appear briefly as Nora and Agnes in flashbacks. Gustav's screenplay is inspired by memories of his mother's imprisonment in a Nazi camp; her experiences echo those of Trier's paternal grandfather, the filmmaker Erik Løchen. (Trier has reviewed the files on his grandfather's captivity the same way Agnes does in one scene, studying the reports about how her grandmother was tortured.) And the actor who narrates the opening scene, describing an essay Nora wrote as a child that anthropomorphized the family home, is Bente Børsum. She's a celebrated performer in Norway who starred in Løchen's 1959 film, The Chasers.

Trier doesn't expect audiences to know any of the above. Sentimental Value avoids explaining, for instance, who the speaker is in relation to the characters on-screen, let alone the fact that a younger Børsum had seen her mother taken to a German camp, too. “Her voice held a lot of weight for me,” Trier said of his choice to include the 91-year-old actor. The film draws power from the subtle specificity; Børsum's voice, low and knowing, comes suffused with an ineffable meaning. The viewer immediately feels encouraged to pay closer attention to the narration.

These veiled decisions inform the movie Gustav eventually directs as well: He'd wanted the shoot to take place inside Agnes and Nora's childhood home, but eventually settles for a reproduction on a back lot, a series of ceiling-less facades. A viewer wouldn't be able to tell that it's a set, but the care and history Gustav has brought to it lends it an abstract profundity. The opportunity afforded by art for artists to examine—or just merely observe—themselves is essential. “I need to distance myself from the characters to be able to create them,” Trier said. What's on-screen is akin to “a counter-life,” he explained. “It's not intended to say, ‘Hey, look at me!' It's saying, ‘I'm doing this about something that's deeply personal, and yet I feel that it's over there.'”

A film such as Sentimental Value, then, operates like a time capsule for its maker: It reveals its potency to Trier only in the rearview, when he revisits what had been on his mind. “It's like conversations with friends,” Trier said. “If someone says, ‘I sense around our latest coffees over the last year, that you talk a lot about this. What's the purpose?' I'm like, ‘What do you mean, purpose?'” He laughed. “Shit, I don't know. But I know I care about it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The College Backlash Is a Mirage","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/college-degree-value-enrollment/685384/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

Americans are more pessimistic than ever about the value of a degree—but enrollment keeps going up.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

If you were to judge by public-opinion polling, you might reasonably conclude that Americans have broadly given up on the idea of going to college. In 2013, 70 percent of adults surveyed by Pew said that a college education was “very important.” This year, only 35 percent did. Over the same time period, the share of Americans who believe that college is “not worth the cost” rose from 40 to 63 percent, according to NBC.

If you were to judge, instead, by the choices that Americans are actually making, you might draw a different conclusion. Despite the reported skepticism of higher education, enrollment in four-year colleges and universities is growing. These institutions awarded 2 million bachelor's degrees in 2023, compared with 1.6 million in 2010, and the fraction of 25-year-olds with a bachelor's degree has steadily increased for the past 15 years. Even as Americans tell pollsters that college isn't worth it, their behavior suggests that they still recognize the value of a degree for themselves and their children. And they're correct to do so.

For the overwhelming majority of graduates, the returns on going to college more than offset the cost of tuition. The college wage premium—the difference in earnings between people with only a high-school diploma and people with a four-year college degree—surged in the 1980s and '90s and has remained close to those historic highs for the past two decades. One recent analysis found that the average person with a bachelor's degree earns about 70 percent more than a high-school graduate with a similar amount of work experience. Researchers at the Cleveland Fed recently estimated that the college wage premium will stand at 76 percent in 2042. Even though plenty of young people struggle in the job market right after graduation, a college degree tends to unlock more lucrative career paths with greater long-term opportunities for advancement.

David Deming: The college backlash is going too far

And despite the proliferation of headlines about the skyrocketing cost of attending college, most American students are paying less in tuition than they were a decade ago. After factoring in financial aid, the cost of attending a public four-year college has fallen by more than 20 percent since 2015, even before adjusting for inflation. Prices at private universities have modestly increased over the same time period, but are down by 12 percent after adjusting for inflation. Even after accounting for student-debt payments, the average college graduate nets about $8,000 more a year than someone with only a high-school diploma.

The benefits of college aren't confined to the richest students attending the most prestigious universities. A large body of research finds that college graduates whose standardized-test scores placed them on the margin of acceptance to a public university in their state outearn their counterparts who attend community college or enter the workforce after high school. “Across the entire parental-income distribution, we think the benefit very substantially outweighs the cost,” Zach Bleemer, a Princeton University economics professor, told me. “College is very clearly worth it for almost everyone who is currently going to college and for people who are on the margin of going to college.”

So why do people insist, against the evidence, that college isn't worth the cost? One possibility has to do with the counterintuitive way that college is priced. The sticker price of attending college—the tuition figure that colleges post online—has increased astronomically over the past two decades. But because of financial aid, only the wealthiest families, less than 20 percent of all college-goers, actually pay it. Everyone else's tuition is essentially subsidized by those rich families. Unfortunately, polls suggest that Americans don't know that. A recent survey by the Association of American Universities found that almost half of U.S. adults think that everyone pays the same price for college. Perhaps these people think that college isn't worth the cost in general, but end up sending their kids because they believe themselves to have gotten an unusually good deal.

Kevin Carey: The myth of the unemployed college grad

Another factor is politics. Donald Trump has waged war against elite universities. His vice president, J. D. Vance, has argued that “professors are the enemy.” The result of such provocations has been to negatively polarize the Republican base against the idea of higher education. Across surveys, Republicans report cratering confidence in the value of a degree. Given the fact that enrollment keeps growing, such statements might be more a form of partisan signaling than literal cost-benefit analysis.

For some people, of course, going to college doesn't end up making financial sense. Some students take more than four years to graduate, or don't earn a degree at all; both scenarios substantially eat into the value of attending college. Some majors, generally those closely associated with a low-paying career, such as fine arts, tend to have a negative return on investment. Lower-income students are more likely to major in these fields, instead of pursuing more lucrative disciplines such as economics and computer science. And many for-profit colleges, in particular, cost students more than they benefit them. “There are some people it isn't worth it for,” Jeff Strohl, the director of the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, told me. “Averages miss the human experience.”

If the skepticism around the value of a college degree leads people to make more calculated decisions about what school to attend and what subject to major in, that could be a good thing. As Preston Cooper, a higher-education policy researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, told me, the best question is not whether college is worth it, but under what circumstances. So far, the popular narrative doesn't seem to have dented enrollment. How long that cognitive dissonance can endure is anyone's guess. “Oftentimes, people say that not everybody should go to college, and that these two-year programs, these trade schools, are really good,” Strohl said. “Ask them where they're sending their kids.”

The fascination with these stories reflects an existential interest in what in life is inevitable, and what we can control.

When I was 8 or 9 years old, my uncle and aunt gave me a copy of D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths, a standard-bearer for children's folklore that was originally published in 1962. I was immediately dazzled by the book: D'Aulaires' was my first exposure to Greek mythology, and I marveled at its vibrant cosmology, its richly illustrated tales of deities whose omnipotence was matched only by their strikingly human, self-indulgent caprice.

Over the years, I committed to memory the elaborate organizing logic of Greek antiquity. The immortal residents of Mount Olympus—philandering Zeus and his cascading (sometimes circular) family tree—governed every aspect of human existence. I was daunted by such a deterministic universe, in which the free will of mortals counted for so little. Yet I was compelled, even comforted, by the coherence of this worldview, in which one's life was entirely foretold.

The Greek writer Kay Cicellis, who died in 2001, might have shuddered at such a sunny view of fate. One year before Ingri and Edgar Parin D'Aulaire published their compendium of Greek myths, Cicellis released her second work of fiction, The Way to Colonos, which ruthlessly dramatizes the limits of individual freedom and the agony of facing one's powerlessness. The book has recently been reissued at what feels like a propitious moment, when modern treatments of Greek myth proliferate, many of them adapting stories about destiny and order for a chaotic and individualistic time.

Cicellis's book consists of three stories that parallel Sophoclean tragedies—“The Way to Colonos” (Oedipus at Colonos), “The Return” (Electra), and “The Exile” (Philoctetes). In an author's note, Cicellis calls any connection to the Greek playwright's work a “coincidence”: She was inspired by the original myths, rather than the plays based on them. Each of Cicellis's retellings transforms its myth into a short story set in mid-20th-century Greece, juxtaposing an ancient sense of fate against the messy uncertainty of modernity. In The Way to Colonos, the horror that emerges is more suppressed and internal than in the ancient texts. The violence is psychological and rarely fatal, in marked contrast to that in Sophocles's work (in other words, nobody gouges out their eyes after having mistakenly slept with their own mother). And unlike Sophocles's plays, in which the deities are persistently invoked, Cicellis's universe is spiritually arid. Her discontented characters seem to wander beneath an empty firmament.

But make no mistake: This is not a world of freedom and abandon. Each of Cicellis's young protagonists arrives at the grim realization that their life is circumscribed not by a god but by the pull of obligation to an undeserving parent or mentor. In these stories, Cicellis presents fate as the imposition of familial or vocational inheritance, rather than the decree of a higher power. It is something silently assumed, perhaps even chosen—if only because no other choice seems possible.

Read: Don't judge I'm Glad My Mom Died by its title

In the first story, “The Way to Colonos,” Antigone and her infirm, recently widowed father sail to the titular island, an isolated and inhospitable place, to make a new home. Antigone views their relocation as a dual exile: Both of them have committed “evil” acts, “indigestible as stone.” Antigone had an affair with a married man. Her father, after quarreling with Antigone's mother, locked her out of their house overnight, which led to a terrible accident. Antigone hopes that on the island, her father will join her in “complete despair,” a mental state characterized less by remorse than by self-abasing catatonia. For Antigone is a merciless judge; she regards both her father and herself as unworthy of rehabilitation, or even the oblivion of death.

“The Return” foregrounds another relationship between parent and daughter, though this one is much more tempestuous. Eugenia (a version of Electra) lives in a filthy house with her lazy, corrupt mother, Madame Nini, and Madame Nini's lover. The home is always swarming with visitors, many of them young women. Eugenia wonders bitterly if Madame Nini and her lover are running a brothel, or perhaps an underground abortion network.

As disgusted as she is by her mother, Eugenia is equally obsessed with her. She skulks around the house, scheming for opportunities to pick a fight. She writes constantly to her younger brother, Orestes, begging him to return from school and reestablish domestic order. When he does come home, he is repulsed by the squalor of his mother's house and by the violent antagonism between Madame Nini and Eugenia. He presses Eugenia to leave with him.

Eugenia has other ideas. “Orestes! Kill her!” she demands, in response to his proposal. But unlike his Sophoclean namesake, Orestes is bewildered by this escalation and refuses. Ultimately, Eugenia binds herself to Madame Nini, “like a seaman on deck who has cut off the moorings of his ship and abandoned himself to his element.” In Sophocles's play, the final acts of violence provide a kind of catharsis. By contrast, Eugenia condemns herself to a future of festering tension and fury.

Cicellis's third revised myth, “The Exile,” foregrounds a nonfamilial intergenerational bond. Stamos, 19, is a version of Neoptolemus, son of the warrior Achilles. He serves as a squire of sorts to Greek guerrilla soldiers who, after the Second World War, operated as Communist resistance forces in the mountains. At the start of the story, he has traveled to an obscure island in order to convince Rigas, an exiled former commander, to return to the ranks. Stamos quickly romanticizes the soldier's isolation—his freedom from social expectations—and begins to dream of defecting. Rigas actually detests his remote existence, but he adopts the persona of a rugged maestro who lives off the land. Eventually, he is forced to drop the charade. “You offered me a role. I took it,” Rigas explains to Stamos. “You gave me something to be. What did you expect?”

Unlike with Antigone and Eugenia, whose perceptions of their respective parents curdled long ago, the reader watches Stamos experience disillusionment. Reverence for one's elders, Cicellis implies, is a dangerous kind of fan fiction. Nonetheless, Stamos's disappointment does not prompt him to sever ties with the guerrillas, and he follows them back to the harbor, just as both Antigone and Eugenia adhere to their wretched parents.

Rachel Cusk, who wrote the foreword to the new edition of Cicellis's trilogy, argues that the author's “young protagonists claim as a freedom the right to hate or disapprove of the adults who hold so-called authority over them, when the forces of tragedy and fate have decreed that no such freedom exists.” In my view, this reading gives the characters more agency than they seem to think they have. Cicellis's young characters may despise the elders in their orbits, because even a universe governed by fate does not dictate human emotion. But that is not freedom: They are otherwise impotent, incapable of emancipating themselves from the adults who have harmed or disappointed them.

Read: Kaos offers a sharp twist on a familiar story

There is something dreadful in the resignation depicted at each story's denouement—in the cool viciousness of Antigone's sense of justice, and in Eugenia's realization that while her mother lives, she must be at her side. The brutality of “The Exile” manifests in its portrayal of enlightenment rendered powerless: Stamos learns that Rigas isn't who he thought he was, and yet he does not reject him. If these adaptations retain the solemnity of a Greek myth, it is less because of their source material than because their young characters come to understand their lives as roles they are bound to enact. Tragedy, in The Way to Colonos, emerges from its protagonists' obliterating desire to follow the story that is most legible to them, in which they are most legible to themselves.

Cicellis understands what I was too young to realize in my earliest encounters with Greek mythology: that our fascination with these stories is fundamentally existential. What, in one's life, is inevitable? What traits, decisions, or misfortunes exceed a person's jurisdiction? These are enduring human quandaries.  The abundance of contemporary retellings and revisions, from Kay Cicellis's trilogy to Emily Wilson's 2017 retranslation of The Odyssey to Madeline Miller's 2018 novel, Circe, expose an ongoing fascination with the tension between fate and control. In a modern world where free will is taken as a given, fate might be best understood as the tangle of powers that facilitate or obstruct individual wills. Perhaps it is our intuitive recognition of this dynamic—one not between gods and mortals, but between the free and the vulnerable—that brings us back to this ancient folklore, century after century.

No. Also, maybe.

Over the weekend, the United States invaded Venezuela, captured its leader, and then declared itself to be in charge of South America's fifth-largest country.

And no one — not even the US government — seems entirely sure why.

The Trump administration has offered multiple high-minded explanations for its toppling of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, none of which make much sense.

Vice President JD Vance suggested, for example, that the operation was about bringing drug kingpins to justice: In 2020, a US court indicted Maduro on charges of trafficking cocaine to the United States, among other offenses. “You don't get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas,” Vance declared on X.

In this account, President Donald Trump is fiercely committed to imprisoning Latin American leaders who export drugs — so committed that he's willing to risk American lives and nullify the UN charter to bring them to justice.

But we know this isn't true. Just last month, Trump pardoned a former Honduran president who'd been convicted of trafficking narcotics to the United States.

If this wasn't about drugs, perhaps it was about democracy?

Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued Sunday that Maduro was “an illegitimate president,” since he had refused to accept his defeat in Venezuela's 2024 election. Only through Maduro's ouster and “a period of transition and real elections” could Venezuelans achieve a legitimate “system of government,” Rubio said.

Yet Trump obviously has no principled objection to incumbent presidents ignoring election results they dislike. And Trump isn't even pretending to care about Venezuelans' democratic freedom.

In his press conference following Maduro's capture, Trump:

But the Trump administration has floated another explanation for its act of war — one that is both crasser and, on its face, more plausible: The White House wanted US fossil fuel companies to get a piece of Venezuela's oil reserves.

Speaking to the press Saturday, Trump announced that “very large United States oil companies” were going to fix Venezuela's “badly broken oil infrastructure” and then start pumping “a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground.” Some of this wealth would go to the Venezuelan people, in Trump's telling, some to the US as “reimbursement” for Maduro's crimes against America.

Meanwhile, Vance posted on X on Saturday that the American invasion was aimed in part at recovering “stolen oil” — apparently referring to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's expropriation of fossil fuel assets owned by ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.

For many observers, this story rang true.

After all, Trump is closely aligned with the fossil fuel sector. And Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves. Trump routinely takes extreme measures to enrich allied industries.

Moreover, his peculiar approach to regime change in Venezuela — capturing Maduro but leaving his party in charge — makes sense, if his goal were merely to coerce Caracas into handing over its oil fields (as opposed to liberating its people).

Many Democrats therefore declared that Trump's invasion was a “war for oil,” plain and simple. As US Rep. Pat Ryan of New York put it, “No matter what they say, it's always oil.” In this framing, Trump risked American lives — and violated international law — just to advance the interests of Big Oil.

Alas, even this account of Trump's actions doesn't quite check out.

For much of the past century, the United States was heavily reliant on foreign oil, while US fossil fuel companies were ravenous for overseas reserves. Ensuring America's access to the world's fossil fuel wealth was therefore a core objective of its Middle East policy, particularly following the energy shocks of the 1970s.

Given this reality, whenever the US intervened in a Middle Eastern conflict, many naturally assumed that its true motivation was resource extraction, not whatever pious rationale its presidents proclaimed. “No War for Oil” became a common slogan among American anti-war protesters during the George W. Bush era.

But over the past decade, the fracking revolution transformed America's energy economy. By learning how to crack rocks with fluid — and drill horizontally — US fossil fuel producers unlocked the vast oil and gas reserves trapped beneath America's shale formations. By 2019, fracking had turned the United States into a net exporter of energy for the first time since the 1950s.

Today, America's oil and gas sector isn't hankering for more reserves so much as for higher prices. Since this time last year, oil prices have dropped by about 23 percent, due to a global glut of carbon energy. At a little over $57 a barrel, the price of crude is now below many fossil fuel firms' breakeven prices.

And forecasters predict that 2026 will witness the biggest global surplus of fossil fuel supply on record.

In this context, Trump's official plans for Venezuela's oil sector would be a headache (if not a disaster) for most of America's fossil fuel industry: Were Venezuela to drastically increase its oil exports, that would further depress global prices, potentially putting many embattled frackers out of business.

Of course, a few US firms might directly profit from revitalizing Venezuela's energy industry. But even for these companies, Trump's proposition isn't especially attractive.

Although Venezuela's reserves are massive, its oil is mostly extra-heavy crude, which makes it more expensive to extract than America's shale resources. Analysts estimate that increasing Venezuelan production by half a million barrels a day would take $10 billion in capital investment. This isn't an especially attractive proposition for ExxonMobil, particularly given Venezuela's political instability.

All of which is to say: American fossil fuel companies had little reason to lobby the Trump administration into overthrowing Maduro. And there is no publicly available evidence that they did so.

So: If Trump wasn't acting at the behest of Big Oil, why did he topple Maduro?

The president's decision likely reflects a confluence of factors. And his personal attraction to Venezuela's resource wealth could be among them.

Although America's oil lobby isn't lusting after Venezuela's reserves, Trump himself might be. For years, the president has criticized the United States for failing to “take the oil” of various Middle Eastern countries. And Trump also called for America to expropriate Afghanistan's mineral wealth. In other words, he likes the general concept of pillaging conquered lands.

Meanwhile, many in the GOP — including Rubio — have longed to overthrow Venezuela's leftist regime for decades. For this reason, Trump's advisers likely put military action against Maduro on his menu of foreign policy options.

The Trump administration has also declared its intention to revive the Monroe Doctrine, which deems the Western Hemisphere the United States's rightful sphere of influence.

In concrete terms, this seems to entail deterring South American countries from forming alliances with Russia, China, or other powers hostile to the US. Trump suggested Saturday that Maduro's capture would aid that objective, ensuring that “American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again.”

This said, pettier and more performative motives also seem to have informed Trump's decision.

According to the New York Times, the White House offered Maduro the opportunity to go into “gilded exile in Turkey.” The Venezuelan leader rebuffed this offer, proceeding to dance on state television while a recording of his voice repeated “no crazy war.”

Trump's team reportedly felt that Maduro was mocking them, seemingly wagering that they didn't have the gall to make good on their threats. So, the Times implies, the White House felt compelled to make him pay for his insolence.

At the same time, Trump was intent on “kicking off the year with a win,” according to an administration official who spoke with The Atlantic. A separate White House insider told the magazine that Trump felt he needed a victory to counter “tough headlines” and “slumping poll numbers.”

In a sense then, those accusing Trump of waging war to advance the interests of a major American industry may be giving him too much credit: His real objectives could actually be less rational and more superficial than that.

Why an “America First” true believer is giving up.

Today, the controversial congressional career of Marjorie Taylor Greene comes to an end — at least for the foreseeable future.

But before her exit, she got a few more jabs in at President Donald Trump. First, in a wide-ranging New York Times Magazine profile last week, the retiring Georgia representative reignited her feud with the president, admitting to being “just so naïve” about Washington politics since being sworn in and lamenting the wasted potential of the MAGA movement by a do-nothing Congress.

“How did all of this end up to a point,” she complained to the Times's Robert Draper about her party's handling of the Epstein files, “where it was about releasing files about women who were raped, and not the serious things that I think truly matter about helping to get our economy stabilized again? Help reduce the cost of living, fix the housing market, fix health insurance — for the love of God, what the [expletive] is the matter with these people?”

Then, following the news from Caracas, she posted the following (lengthy) denunciation on X:

As the weekend progressed, the outgoing member of Congress kept up her critiques, saying in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press that Trump is forgetting what “America First” means, and is betraying the promises he made voters: “That was part of what [Americans] voted for in 2024, they voted to tear down the system that protects the rich, powerful elites; they voted to tear down the system that consistently goes for foreign wars and regime change.”

Greene is leaving Congress due to her high-profile split with Trump — he promised to support a primary challenge in 2026 after she started criticizing him — so it makes sense to take what she's saying now with a spoonful of salt.

But in dishing on her thinking over the last year, she also revealed some insightful dynamics about what she thinks is happening to Trump's movement.

While she believed that “Making America Great Again” was a set of principles and beliefs — “America First, Secure Borders, No Pointless Wars, End Globalization, and Protect Free Speech” — for Trump and the GOP, that's basically just doing whatever Trump wants; doing little of what they promised; or, even worse, doing the opposite.

It's a theme that she's talked about not just in this magazine story, but also in interviews and public comments she's given over the last few months: that when MAGA voters finally delivered Republicans unified control of the federal government, the party wasted that time and fumbled what little they did pick up.

From foreign policy to affordability to, finally, the Epstein files, 2025 appears, to her, to have been MAGA's lost year.

For the last few months, Greene has been pretty clear that she doesn't think the majority of her colleagues in Congress are actual MAGA believers. She's bemoaned how easily Trump critics or saboteurs have laundered their reputations, landed in the White House, or made it into his inner circle. And she's claimed that most elected Republicans would rather not do anything at all than implement a real MAGA agenda.

“The Republicans that I work with…look at [Trump] like a speed bump. Many of them can't wait to get him out of the way,” she told Tucker Carlson on his podcast in October. “So many times for our party…they get on board and they campaign and they say ‘America First' and they try to utter and mimic these Donald Trump talking points. But when it actually comes to getting to work and delivering those talking points into action for the American people…what are we doing? We're sitting at home.”

The October to mid-November government shutdown, in particular, seems to have turned her most against her party.

“I really have no respect for the House not being in session. And I have no respect for Speaker Johnson not calling us back to Washington because we should be passing bills…that reflect the president's executive orders, which are exactly what we voted for,” she told Carlson. “We should be at work on our committees. We should be doing investigations…We should be passing the discharge petition that Thomas Massie put in to release the Epstein files…[and] we should be passing our appropriation bills to actually fund the government and fund important projects.”

She expanded on this idea of Republicans squandering their power in appearances on cable news, including when she praised Nancy Pelosi's “ability to get things done” as speaker on CNN after Pelosi announced her retirement. “I wish we could get things done for our party like Nancy Pelosi was able to deliver for her party.”

And she revisited it in her interviews with the Times: the feeling that neither she, nor the House, had any real say in implementing an agenda because Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP leadership would only allow Congress to act as an extension of the White House.

“I want you to know that Johnson is not our speaker,” she told the Times in December. The speaker “is literally 100 percent under direct orders from the White House. And many, many Republicans are so furious about that, but they're cowards.”

Paired up with the sense that Congress just wasted a year of unified control of government is Greene's charge that when Republicans did act, they really only ended up betraying MAGA values and voters.

She describes her last year as one spent as a referee or parent: “What have I been doing since he became president? I've worked very hard to keep everybody inside the guardrails of what we campaigned on: ‘No, this is what we said. This is what we promised. Now we have to deliver. And not through executive orders or red-meat rants on social media,'” she told the Times. “And I always go back to the people that showed up at his rallies, because those are the people that should matter. Those people should matter over those big crypto donors or the AI big-tech people.”

What do those guardrails look like? She's specified those red lines over the last few weeks, and how she thinks Trump and congressional Republicans have crossed them:

Instead of disentangling America from foreign wars, the administration infiltrated Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro, launched airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen, bombed Iran, and continues to prop up Ukraine against Russia. Instead of cutting foreign aid, the US sent billions more to Israel, Egypt, Ukraine, and bailed out Argentina.

“I don't know how that's America First,” she told Carlson about that last one. “But what we have going on right now, I mean, seriously, look at it. It's a revolving door at the White House, a revolving door of foreign leaders and prime ministers and presidents all with their hands out demanding money and demanding attention and demanding America do this.”

She had a similar critique of the president's military actions in Venezuela, telling NBC's Kristen Welker on Sunday that Trump “campaigned on Make America Great Again, that we thought was putting America first…‘America First' actually means ‘for the American people.' … They voted for this administration, and their small-dollar donation should matter. And MAGA has its own enemy list. And the enemies of the world are not on their enemy list, and they're tired of being ignored.”

Instead of making life more affordable for Americans, Trump doubled down on tariffs, allowed Obamacare subsidies to expire, and called affordability concerns a Democratic “con job,” — all betrayals of MAGA voters, Greene argues.

Meanwhile, Trump was happy to implement cryptocurrency and AI policies that were friendly to billionaire donors and supporters, while allowing for more foreign student visas and obstructing the release of the Epstein files.

To be sure, there are probably other deeper personal and strategic reasons for Greene's break with Trump and retirement from politics for now. It is probably not a coincidence that this is happening as Trump's approval ratings sink to their lowest levels of his second term, after Republicans faced off-year election losses and look likely to lose more next year, and as Trump's MAGA coalition — at the elite and at the popular level — seems to fracture and pick sides over the future of the GOP.

But for all the fanfare of a year dominated by Trump and his movement, Greene's reflections suggest that at least for one of its true believers, MAGA wasn't as successful as it set out to be in its first year in office. And on top of that, she's suggesting that there are voters who will care about this, are paying attention, and might not be forgiving in 2026 and beyond. It's a clarion call for a movement she considered herself a founding member of, and one she thinks has been led astray.

Is the internet really worse than it used to be, or are some of us just getting older?

If you feel like the internet is full of slop and rage bait these days, you aren't alone.

Anger is fueling the internet so much that Oxford decided to make rage bait the word of 2025. But if you were born in the 1980s or 1990s, you probably remember a different time: the days of logging into a computer at your local library or in your family room, printing song lyrics, writing in your LiveJournal, or mulling over your MySpace Top 8.

Those days are long behind us, but Max Read remembers this era too. He's a writer and has a Substack called Read Max, all about technology and culture. “I would go to link aggregating sites like FARK,” he said on a recent episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast. “When I was a little older, Metafilter was another one. There'd be discussions in the comments and you would get linked out to other websites that you could find and discover web comics and bloggers and whatever else.”

Read says it was a much different landscape than the one we have online now.

“There were fewer mega platforms — by which I mean these huge sites that became the whole internet for people. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, places where you go and you can spend hours without ever leaving that particular website,” he said.

So what caused this shift in the internet? And was the change inevitable? Read tells us on the latest episode of Explain It to Me. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

What changed and when did it change? How did the internet get this way? 

I would say there's two big shifts. The first one happened almost 20 years ago. In 2006, Facebook introduced the newsfeed. People revolted, they hated it. But what Facebook was seeing on the back end was that all of their numbers were up. Engagement was up, time on site was up, visitors were up. People kept coming back from more. And the feed has become the paradigm for how we engage with the internet ever since.

Then the second change — which is an acceleration of something that was already happening — was TikTok introducing the For You page as a concept. You go to TikTok because TikTok has this incredibly dialed-in algorithm that's going to show you weird videos as you scroll through it. That's the other change that created this really wholly separate kind of antisocial internet that we're on now.

Has the algorithm killed the internet?

Yes and no.

I think it's worth keeping in mind the algorithm also brought the internet to what it is today: [the] size it is today, the engagement.

I think something that is worth grappling with is what Mark Zuckerberg would say if he was on this podcast with us: you guys can complain about this. But every single time we've made one of these moves, the numbers have shown that people spend more time on Facebook. They want to be there more. They enjoy the time spent. They feel like it was better spent.

Are we conflating time spent and actually liking a thing ? 

One thing to think about is that all of the metrics that Facebook is gathering tell us something fairly narrow. But it is also true that when they interview people, people will say they felt like their time was better spent with the algorithmic, FYP-type feeds than with the way Facebook was 10 years ago.

Was this trashy, toxic internet inevitable? Can a website grow and make money and be a place that brings in an audience without ruining itself? 

I think a website that shows us a different path is Wikipedia, which is as big by the numbers as basically any of the platforms we're talking about, and is arguably more essential to the web as we know it than even Facebook.

In that sense, to answer your question, no, it's not inevitable in the absolute sense that a huge important website will turn into shit. The culture of Wikipedia as formulated by Jimmy Wales and the many people who've worked at the Wikimedia Foundation over the years — and by the volunteers who contribute and edit and monitor and otherwise work on Wikipedia — the culture of Wikipedia has been a really important factor in ensuring that it maintains itself as a free resource for anyone online.

I think that part of the problem with many of the big platforms we're talking about isn't merely that there's a set of structural incentives that is pushing them into the darker corners of what they're doing, but that the overall culture of Silicon Valley isn't one that values any of the things we're talking about.

Max, you and I are millennials. Could it be that we've just aged out of the internet? That we are no longer the target audience?

I mean, I hate to break it to you. We are old…

Oh no!

Unfortunately, we have reached middle age. Millennials like us, we were the protagonists of the internet for a really long time, because we were the people who grew up on it. We were the people who in our office knew the most about it. We were the people who created most of the content first on most of the social networks.

And we're not the protagonists anymore. Some of that is aging-out. Some of that is, there are people who are even more raised by the internet than we were, who have been online for an even higher percentage of their lives.

And I think the other part of it is that the internet we see on all these websites now is really a truly global internet. In some sense there's a lot of stuff we don't see. There's also a lot of stuff we see that just isn't for us.

That's maybe slightly separate from the question of “Are the structures of the internet worse off than they were 20 years ago?” Because I think it's true, but the old internet's gone, it's not coming back. So it's people — I think people are aged. The best you can do is retreat to your group chats.

How critics of American interventionism fell for a myth.

In 2023, then-Senator JD Vance endorsed President Donald Trump's presidential bid for one big reason: Trump's commitment to peace. “He has my support in 2024,” Vance wrote, “because I know he won't recklessly send Americans to fight overseas.”

Flash forward to 2026, and Vice President Vance has been put in the awkward position of defending one of the most reckless US military raids of my lifetime: an explicit attempt to bring about regime change in Venezuela by abducting its president from his bed.

This is not an exaggeration. Trump said during a Saturday press conference that America now “runs” post-Maduro Venezuela. Administration officials have said that the country's Vice President, Delcy Rodriguez, will either rule according to American dictates or else. One of those dictates is that American oil companies be allowed to extract Venezuelan crude — and that the proceeds of their sales be used to finance US military activity in the country.

In essence, Trump is demanding Venezuela will become an American imperial vassal and pay for the privilege. If they do not, they will face a “a second and much larger attack” — and potentially even an invasion.

“We're not afraid of boots on the ground,” as Trump put it on Saturday.

We may not get that far. Perhaps Rodriguez will strike some kind of deal, or Trump's threats will prove to be empty. It wouldn't be the first time.

But the fact that the US is even attempting a kind of regime change by protection racket, one that began with the brazen abduction of a foreign leader, is proof that Vance and the many, many, many others who insisted that Trump is some kind of dove have been taken for a ride (which was obvious to me from the start).

One question now is why they missed that reality. But the much bigger one is what Trump's particular brand of hawkishness means for the country — and the world.

Nearly 10 years ago, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd published a column titled “Donald the Dove, Hillary the Hawk.” In Dowd's telling, Trump “thought the invasion of Iraq was a stupid idea.” While “he can sound belligerent,” he actually “would rather do the art of the deal than shock and awe.”

Nearly every part of this analysis was wrong — demonstrably wrong at the time. Trump had not opposed George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq in advance; he had publicly supported it. He had also supported the 2011 US war in Libya and was calling for US intervention in the Syrian civil war on the campaign trail.

But while Dowd's op-ed was demonstrably wrong, her basic frame — that Trump is the non-interventionist antidote to the hawkish bipartisan consensus — quickly became one of the dominant ways politicians and analysts described Trump. This was, in large part, at his own encouragement.

“If Kamala wins, only death and destruction await because she is the candidate of endless wars,” Trump said during the 2024 campaign. “I am the candidate of peace.”

This view has indeed become central to the Trump mythos, repeated both by his allies and third party observers.

“Good leaders don't foment pointless wars. They end them. If you voted for Donald Trump, that's reason enough to be proud you did,” Tucker Carlson said after the 2024 election. Christian Parenti, a Marxist economist, wrote an essay in Compact arguing that Trump “has done more to restrain the US imperium than any politician in 75 years.” Even NPR, in an ostensibly straight-news writeup from earlier this year, wrote that “Trump has long been known for his ‘America First' ethos and non-interventionist stance.”

This all was totally at odds with his first term record (more on that in a second). But it's also at odds with Trump's own explicitly stated worldview, in which “America First” is less about avoiding foreign wars than advancing narrowly-defined American interests through more nakedly imperialistic politics.

Let's take one issue of particular relevance to Venezuela: Trump's longstanding preoccupation with seizing foreign oil deposits. While that isn't the sole motivation of the Maduro abduction, and doesn't really make sense as a practical matter, it's clear that it played a major role in Trump's mind — as it has for years.

In 1987, he called on the US to invade Iran and take its oil. In 2011, he proposed an imperial US intervention in the Libyan civil war: “I'm only interested in Libya if we take the oil.” In 2013, he explained his evolution on Iraq — from war supporter to critic — as a kind of disillusionment with the US refusal to do naked imperialism.

“When I heard that we were first going into Iraq, some very smart people told me, ‘Well, we're actually going for the oil,' and I said, ‘All right, I get that.' [But] we didn't take the oil!” the future president said in a 2013 speech.

And, in 2019, as president, he sent US troops to seize Syrian oil fields, claiming “we're keeping the oil” to be developed by ExxonMobil at a future date. This plan went nowhere — partly because Exxon itself refused to play ball.

But in Trump's second term, his policy id has been unleashed. There are no more “adults in the room,” like Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who saw their job as protecting US foreign policy from the man in charge of it. Instead, the current Trump administration is made up of various competing sub-factions trying to influence his instincts. Vance is a genuine isolationist; Marco Rubio is an uber-hawk with a longstanding preference for regime change. They are all trying to sway Trump to their point of view by trying to sell their own positions as the best expression of his.

Rubio has figured out that the language of crude national interests — of seizing oil deposits for US corporations, or fighting “narco-terrorism,” or asserting American power — taps directly into the particular kind of hawkishness that Trump has consistently expressed for decades.

Hence how you can have what is, in effect, Rubio's longstanding preference for regime change in Venezuela enacted by a president who has long pretended to oppose regime change wars.

When pressed on these sorts of points, the defenders of Trump-as-peace-candidate have long fallen back on the same line: that Trump did not start any “new wars” during his first term. Vance wrote this in his 2023 op-ed; Curt Mills, the editor of the non-interventionist American Conservative magazine, made the same point in a 2024 piece arguing that Trump's second term would be a peaceful one.

This line was always a sleight of hand distracting from how Trump dramatically escalated the wars in which America was already involved.

In Iraq and Syria, for example, he removed Obama-era limitations on the use of force designed to prevent civilian casualties, leading to three times as many civilian deaths from US bombs as in in the 1991 Gulf War, the 1998-1999 Kosovo intervention, and the Libya war combined. It's absurd to call a president with this kind of body count a dove, especially when the civilian death toll from US air wars dropped dramatically after Biden took office.

But it also ignored the way in which Trump frequently took risks that could easily produce a full-scale conflict. In 2017, for example, he threatened North Korea with “fire and fury” and moved US naval assets nearby, bringing us far closer to war with a nuclear-armed power than most people remember. In 2020, he assassinated top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani — an outright act of war with the Islamic Republic that could easily have spun out of control.

Trump, in short, had proved himself willing to risk new wars in his first term frequently.

It's clear that he didn't necessarily want his provocations to escalate; he has a preference for shows of force over actual invasions. But it's also the case that once you start down a road toward conflict, things don't always go the way you want. Maybe Trump's first term avoidance of new wars in term one was the result of deft diplomacy on Trump's party, the sheer intimidating power of the US military, or the restrained policy choices of his targets. But it also could be attributed to luck.

In his second term, Trump seems determined to push that luck to the brink.

His bombing of Iran's nuclear site, for example, avoided the most dire predictions of immediate escalations. But, Iran appears to be rebuilding its nuclear capabilities, and Trump is now threatening more attacks over both the nuclear program and the country's repression of protestors.

His policy of drone strikes on drug traffickers in the Caribbean, allegedly aimed at stamping out “narco-terrorism,” seems to have opened the door to the abduction of Maduro, which the White House has justified as a law enforcement action aimed at putting him on trial on drug-related charges.

And now, the immediate question is whether that hawkishness will escalate to a broader war with Venezuela if the country refuses to comply with Trump's demands.

Currently, Delcy Rodriguez is striking a defiant tone, saying in a Saturday speech that “we shall never be a colony ever again.” Trump is threatening retaliatory escalation, telling the Atlantic on Sunday that “if she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”

If Rodriguez remains in power and defiant, Trump will have two choices: do nothing and expose his threats as empty, or make good on them. If it's the latter, his belligerence could lead to an escalation of catastrophic proportions.

Once you understand Trump's foreign policy as an essentially belligerent one, you begin to appreciate the full enormity of our new era of global politics.

It's not as if the United States hasn't been warlike in the past. This isn't even the first time that the US has launched an invasion to forcibly arrest a Latin American dictator whom it accused of involvement in drug trafficking.

Rather, it's that American belligerency in the post-World War II era has followed certain predictable rules and guidelines that limited the overall systemic impact of even acts of aggression. The United States was, for all its faults, widely understood as the anchor of an international order it created; charges of hypocrisy in places like Vietnam had bite because of the stated commitment to basic ideas like sovereignty and human rights.

There's good evidence that the predictability and strength of the US-led alliance system, however imperfect, played a major role in deterring aggression in the latter 20th century. After World War II, the number and severity of wars between states steadily declined, leading to a dramatic drop in the rate of people killed by war relative to historical averages. The term “Pax Americana” was not entirely a misnomer, even when you factor in America's criminally brutal Cold War policies in places ranging from Vietnam, to Argentina, to Indonesia.

The 2003 invasion of Iraq, with its brazen indifference to international law, weakened faith in the US-led order. Trump's first term hollowed it out. And now, the naked imperial violence of his second might have well and truly shattered it. Trump is making a series of wild threats and territorial claims, forcing Mexico to prepare for a potentially imminent US invasion and Denmark to take recent US threats to seize Greenland seriously.

What this new world disorder looks like is hard to say. Seva Gunitsky, a political scientist at the University of Toronto, suggested one model after the Maduro operation — a kind of regional “carve-up” in which the US, Russia, and China each get to do what they want in their respective spheres of influence.

“What just happened is entirely consistent with the spheres-of-influence approach that Putin has long advocated, and that Trump embraced in the latest National Security Strategy. The emerging order is one in which Putin, Xi, and Trump each get to do whatever they want in their respective zones: a grand bargain among the powerful at the expense of everyone else,” he wrote. “For ‘smaller' places caught in the gray zones, like Ukraine, Taiwan, the Baltics, even Greenland, this is not an abstract theoretical debate but a question of survival.”

But this is just one possibility. The truth is that an unconstrained Trump, acting on his longstanding hawkish impulses, could cause all sorts of chaos in his remaining three years. While US military interventionism is very precedented, Trump's particular brand of it — naked pre-modern imperialism backed by a modern globe-spanning military — is not.

Americans should be prepared for things to go very, very wrong.

President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that the US had conducted a raid on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and big names in business and foreign policy have been reacting as the aftermath unfolds.

Here's what they've been saying:

Myers, chairman of political risk consulting firm Signum Global Advisors, told Business Insider that foreign investment in oil, tourism, and construction will be the ""centerpiece"" of Venezuela's financial recovery going forward, adding that he expects the country's economy will grow ""faster over the next two years than people anticipate because of the extent or scale of foreign investment.""

Myers, also a former head of investment advisory firm Evercore, is planning a trip of 15-20 investors to visit Venezuela in March to identify investment opportunities. Signum Global Advisors has hosted similar trips for investor groups in Syria and Ukraine.

Bremmer, founder of the political risk research and consulting firm, Eurasia Group, in a post on LinkedIn, wrote that the ""US presumption is next Venezuelan leaders will now do what the Americans want because they've just seen the 'or else.'""

Accompanying the post was a photo of a drawing of a horse. The hindquarters of the horse were drawn in intricate detail, and labeled ""SOF operation to capture Maduro,"" referencing the special operations forces mission that was executed early Saturday. The horse's head was depicted as a rudimentary children's drawing, captioned ""plans for future of Venezuela.""I wouldn't exactly call it a plan,"" Bremmer added.

In a separate post, he wrote: ""The law of the jungle is dangerous. What applies to your enemies one day can apply to you the next. Make no mistake where the world is heading here.""

The billionaire hedge fund manager wrote in a post on X that ""The removal of Maduro will lower oil prices, which is good for America and very bad for Russia. A weaker Russian economy will increase the probability that the war in Ukraine ends sooner and on more favorable terms for Ukraine. And Putin will be sleeping in his safe room from this point going forward.""

Gao is a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a law professor at Singapore Management University. In a series of posts on X, he said the raid on Caracas ushered in ""the brave new world of international law.""

""Maduro's capture has triggered the biggest revival of international law since Grotius — and overnight turned everyone on X into an international law wonk, eager to compare Venezuela to Taiwan,"" he wrote.

""But China has never treated the Taiwan issue as a matter of international law,"" he continued. ""It has always been framed as an internal affair, with Taiwan regarded as a renegade province. The reason China has not acted is not because it lacks legal justification, but because it lacks the capability. Thus, US ops in Venezuela provide China with no additional legal justification.""

The Democratic senator from Massachusetts is a former Harvard Law professor who holds deep expertise in bankruptcy and consumer finance. In a post on X, she wrote that Trump's action to seize Maduro, ""no matter how terrible a dictator he is — is unconstitutional and threatens to drag the US into further conflicts in the region.""

""What does it mean that the US will 'run' Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?"" Warren wrote. ""The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump's dangerous military adventurism overseas that won't make the American people safer.""

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent most of Saturday posting praise for the Trump administration and the military operations in Venezuela, posting that it was ""heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant.""

In another post, Musk retweeted a White House image of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after being apprehended, with the caption ""Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.""

Musk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, alternating between appearing to be close allies and trading sharp criticisms in the media.

Writing on X, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group said Maduro's ""corrupt and inept reign"" had ""caused endless suffering for the Venezuelan people and brought this beautiful country to the verge of economic and social collapse.""

""He will not be missed,"" he wrote.

Branson added that a ""just and fair transition means handing power to Venezuelans, and especially to those with a clear mandate to lead.""

Washington's effective control of Venezuela would hand the US a major energy advantage, according to Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's head of macro research for Asia ex-Japan.

The first advantage is practical and industrial: Venezuela's heavy crude is well suited to US refining capacity. The second advantage is strategic: Access to Venezuela's vast oil reserves would give the US a decisive energy edge in the AI race, particularly relative to China.

Finally, Varathan highlighted a shipping advantage. Proximity gives the US a logistical edge to Venezuelan oil supply, while the loss of access leaves China's remaining oil imports increasingly vulnerable to major maritime chokepoints.

""China's energy security is compromised at the margin whilst the US gains significant energy dominance advantage,"" Varathan wrote.

Panikoff, director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council and a former deputy national intelligence officer at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, pushed back on the idea that Trump's raid was primarily about oil.

In an X post on Saturday, he said that while Venezuela holds an estimated 17% to 18% of global oil reserves, it accounts for just 1% to 1.5% of global production, calling oil a ""secondary benefit"" rather than the main motivation.

Panikoff said the move reflects Trump's long-held view that the US should assert dominance in the Western Hemisphere and push out the influence of China, Russia, Iran, and Cuba.

""America First requires American dominance in the Western Hemisphere,"" he wrote, adding that the operation looked more like a revival of the Monroe Doctrine than a traditional war-on-drugs effort.

Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said Maduro's removal may be widely welcomed, but that the operation was not strategically wise.

Writing in his ""Home & Away"" newsletter, Haass called the raid a ""military operation of choice, not of necessity,"" saying that Maduro ""hardly posed an imminent threat to the United States.""

He said that removing a leader is far easier than replacing a regime, invoking former Secretary of State Colin Powell's ""Pottery Barn rule"" — the idea that if you break a country, you own the consequences.

""We broke it, so now we own it,"" Haass wrote.

Haass also said that the operation could set a dangerous precedent, potentially emboldening Russia and China to justify interventions in Ukraine and Taiwan under similar logic.

Elon Musk joined Donald Trump for dinner during a packed weekend for the president, who was hosting meetings at Mar-a-Lago as his administration announced a US military operation in Venezuela.

Trump said on Saturday that the US had captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, a move that drew swift international reaction.

In a post on X on Sunday, Musk wrote that he had ""a lovely dinner"" with Trump and first lady Melania Trump, adding: ""2026 is going to be amazing!""

The photo posted on X shows the three of them seated at a dinner table, chatting. The dinner took place on Saturday evening at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, according to Fox News.

In November, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO attended a White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — his first public appearance at the White House since falling out with Trump in June. The guest list included several top executives.

After the dinner, Musk shared photos on X showing himself with the crown prince, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Trump. ""I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,"" Musk wrote.

In September, the two were spotted shaking hands at a memorial service for political activist Charlie Kirk, marking their first public interaction since their alliance collapsed.

The relationship between the two publicly unraveled in June, shortly after Musk stepped away from his role as the de facto head of the White House's DOGE Office.

Before the fallout, Musk was one of Trump's most visible and influential allies. He described himself as Trump's ""first buddy"" after the president's election win. 

Musk later played a central role in the administration's effort to cut government spending before leaving the post in May.

Tensions escalated after Musk criticized Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" prompting a public back-and-forth between the two men. Musk said Trump owed his presidential election win to him, while Trump threatened to pull government contracts held by Musk's companies.

In July, Musk said he would launch a new political party called the ""America Party.""

""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,"" Musk wrote in an X post. Trump fired back on his Truth Social platform, saying Musk had gone ""completely off the rails.""

The Pentagon will cut the military retirement pay of Sen. Mark Kelly for what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the Arizona Democrat's ""seditious"" statements on a video with other members of Congress telling service members they have the right to refuse to execute illegal orders.

Hegseth also issued a formal letter of censure against Kelly, which the Defense secretary said details  ""reckless misconduct"" by the retired Navy captain and astronaut.

Hegesth said the Defense Department has begun a proceeding aimed at reducing Kelly's rank in retirement, which would in turn lead to a decrease in retirement pay. 

""Six weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,"" Hegseth said in a statement on X.

""As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he is still accountable to military justice. And the Department of War — and the American people — expect justice,"" Hegseth said.

Kelly has 30 days to file a response to the decision to cut his rank and retirement pay, according to Hegseth's tweet.

The Pentagon in November announced a probe of Kelly for his involvement with the video, and said that further actions could include a recall to active duty and a court-martial proceeding. 

Hegeth's statement on Monday suggests that the Pentagon has ruled out that more severe option.

But, in his tweet, Hegseth warned, ""Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.""

Kelly, in a statement on X, vowed to fight the disciplinary action ""with everything I've got,"" and called Hegseth ""the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history.""

""Over twenty-five years in the U.S. Navy, thirty-nine combat missions, and four missions to space, I risked my life for this country and to defend our Constitution – including the First Amendment rights of every American to speak out,"" Kelly wrote. ""I never expected that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense would attack me for doing exactly that.""

""My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,"" Kelly wrote. ""Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve.

""Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way,"" the senator said. ""It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.""

The video that Kelly spoke on was made in response to the U.S. military conducting 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people.

The legality of those strikes, which were made without authorization from Congress, has been questioned.

In the video, which was posted on X on Nov. 18, Kelly says, ""Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.""

The five other Democratic members of Congress who delivered similar messages on the same video are Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.

Slotkin is a former CIA analyst. Deluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer.

But unlike Kelly, the other three veterans on the video separated from their service branches rather than retiring from them. As a result, they are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as Kelly is.

Hegseth, in his statement on Monday, said about the Pentagon's move to discipline Kelly: ""These actions are based on Captain Kelly's public statements from June through December 2025 in which he characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders.""

""This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay,"" Hegseth said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the Pentagon's action on Monday.

""Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,"" Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a tweet responding to Hegseth.

""Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump. This is a despicable act of political retribution,"" Schumer wrote. ""I stand with Sen. Kelly, who will always do the right thing no matter the consequences.""

Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota is dropping his bid for reelection, he announced Monday morning. 

The announcement came as Walz, who was Kamala Harris' vice presidential pick for her failed 2024 White House bid, continues to weather heated criticism over a sweeping fraud scandal in his state.

""As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can't give a political campaign my all,"" Walz said in a statement.

""Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,"" he said.

""So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work,"" the governor said.

Walz read the same statement during a brief news conference later Monday. He took no questions.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, is weighing a Minnesota gubernatorial bid in light of Walz bowing out, The New York Times reported Monday. Walz and Klobuchar spoke over the weekend, multiple outlets reported.

Walz had announced in September that he would seek a third term in office. But his plans were soon upended by damning reports on the social services fraud scams that have blossomed in Minnesota in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, while Walz led the state.

A federal prosecutor in Minnesota last month estimated that the fraud schemes may have totaled more than $9 billion, though Walz has called that number ""sensationalized.""

The scandal has put focus on the state's Somali community, where the majority of people so far charged by the Department of Justice in connection with the fraud have come from.

President Donald Trump has responded to the fraud reports with vehemently anti-Somali rhetoric and renewed attacks against Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, the first Somali American member of Congress.

The Trump administration's Health and Human Services Department last week announced it would freeze all federal child-care payments to Minnesota.

Walz, in Monday's statement, defended Minnesota's Somalian population while acknowledging that the fraud in the state must be addressed.

""Make no mistake: We should be concerned about fraud in our state government. We cannot effectively deliver programs and services if we can't earn the public's trust,"" Walz said, listing the steps his administration has already taken.

""But the political gamesmanship we're seeing from Republicans is only making that fight harder to win,"" he said.

""We've got the President of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating childcare funding that Minnesotans rely on.""

Amazon on Monday launched an Alexa+ website that lets some users chat with its assistant via their browser, putting it in more direct competition with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

The Alexa.com website is only available to users of Alexa+, its revamped artificial intelligence assistant that debuted last February and remains in early access. Users have to join a waitlist to gain access to the service or purchase newer devices.

Amazon says consumers can use Alexa.com to ""get quick answers, explore complex topics, create content, plan trip itineraries and get help with homework."" Users can also manage their smart home gadgets within the Alexa+ chat window, the company said.

By launching a browser-based version of Alexa, Amazon wants to make sure users can interact with its AI assistant across different interfaces. 

Previously, Alexa+ was only available via a mobile app or some Echo devices. 

It also puts Amazon's service more in line with popular AI chatbots made by the likes of OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Perplexity, all of which are frequently accessed via web browsers. 

Amazon has faced growing pressure to update its hardware and software for the generative AI age following the success of ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and others. 

Alexa+ has gradually rolled out to users since its debut, and the company has said tens of millions of people now have access to the service.

Amazon previewed Alexa.com when it launched Alexa+ last year, saying at the time that the website would launch in the coming months. The company told the Washington Post last July that the feature would be available for early access users in the summer.

In this article

Versant Media Group, the portfolio of cable TV networks and digital assets spun off by Comcast, joined the small cohort of public media companies Monday as the industry reckons with ongoing disruption. 

Versant began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""VSNT,"" opening at $45.17 per share. 

The company's so-called when-issued stock — a security that is expected to be issued and has been authorized to trade on a conditional basis to give investors an early chance to buy shares — initially began trading on Dec. 15 at $55 per share and ended trading Friday at $46.65 per share. 

As of mid-morning Monday, Versant shares had fallen to roughly $40 per share, down 14% on the day. 

The company's market capitalization stands at roughly $6.5 billion with shares outstanding of 145.76 million based on the spinoff ratio. As part of the spinoff, Comcast shareholders received one share of Versant stock for every 25 shares of Comcast stock they owned. 

""It's been a year in the making,"" said Mark Lazarus, Versant CEO, on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday. 

In November 2024, Comcast announced its intention to separate out the bulk of NBCUniversal's cable TV networks, including MS Now (formerly MSNBC), CNBC, Golf Channel, USA, E!, Syfy and Oxygen, as well as digital properties Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow and Sports Engine. 

""As part of Comcast and NBCU we had other priorities as a company,"" Lazarus said. ""We made different decisions, because we had a different company and a different strategy. Now we're bringing these [assets] into their own company, we're going to be able to invest into them. We'll invest organically ... and hopefully the market is listening to what we're saying."" 

Lazarus said ""vertical scale"" is necessary to diversify the business away from a dependence on pay TV. 

""While that's still a big, profitable part for us, it's not going to be the end game,"" he said.

There are few traditional media companies that have gone public in recent years — namely because of the significant challenges the industry has been facing due to the shift away from the TV bundle and toward streaming.  

In 2025, Newsmax, the conservative cable news network, went public on the New York Stock Exchange and quickly saw its shares soar from its $14 per share opening price. It has fallen precipitously since its debut. 

Instead, the media sector has been marked by a rush for consolidation and fresh M&A deals. Paramount Skydance completed its merger last year, and since then CEO David Ellison has been acquisitive. Warner Bros. Discovery, itself formed following a merger in 2022, last year kicked off a sale process that resulted in a proposed deal with Netflix. Paramount has since made a hostile offer to WBD shareholders to upend the proposed transaction with Netflix. 

The Versant spinoff was likewise a result of the disruptive media landscape. Its executives, led by CEO Lazarus, former chairman of NBCUniversal's media group, spent the final months of 2025 convincing Wall Street investors that the future of the business would be focused on growing the digital presence of its portfolio. 

The company has also highlighted its strength in news and sports, the two categories of programming that still receive the bulk of TV viewers. Although networks like those in Versant's portfolio are seeing declines in financials, they are still profitable and beckon ad dollars. 

On Monday, Lazarus once again pointed to Versant's weight in sports and news, saying 62% of the portfolio is in those two content areas. 

""We have a really strong position,"" Lazarus said. 

In September Versant reported declining revenue in recent years as consumers exit the cable TV bundle. 

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of going public, Versant's assets generated $7.1 billion in revenue in 2024 , down from $7.4 billion in 2023 and $7.8 billion in 2022. The company said its net income attributable to Versant was $1.4 billion in 2024, down from $1.5 billion in 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022. 

Shortly after, ratings agencies S&P Global and Fitch Ratings each issued BB credit ratings on the company's debt noting stable outlooks, placing the company's rating in junk territory. This was based on Versant's plans to issue $2.75 billion of new senior secured debt to fund a one-time $2.25 billion cash distribution to Comcast and add $500 million to its balance sheet, according to S&P. 

Versant's low debt levels have boded well for the company with both ratings agencies and have been a highlight in its pitch to Wall Street investors. Media peers like Warner Bros. Discovery have grappled with heavy debt loads while also contending with the decline of cable TV subscribers and lower ad revenue. 

Both ratings agencies noted the headwinds facing the traditional TV landscape, which S&P said ""offset the strength of [Versant's] portfolio,"" noting that revenue from linear distribution and advertising from its networks accounted for more than 80% of total revenue. 

Fitch said ""the strong viewer loyalty and engagement"" with Versant's TV networks, as well as its conservative debt structure, bodes as a positive for the company. 

Versant executives said at a recent investor day presentation that the company intends to grow its digital business through acquisitions and investments.

Deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro appeared in a New York court on Monday afternoon and pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking charges two days after their dramatic capture by U.S. forces in their home country, according to media reports.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who is also charged in the case, have been held since they were taken from Venezuela after a U.S. strike on the country at the orders of U.S. President Donald Trump. Flores also pleaded not guilty, according to reports.

""I'm innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man, the president of my country,"" Maduro told Judge Alvin Hellerstein during his appearance Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, according to the Associated Press.

Flores said, ""I am first lady of the Republic of Venezuela,"" according to the AP.

""Not guilty. Completely innocent,"" Flores reportedly replied when asked her plea.

The couple reportedly agreed to remain in jail without bail pending a possible detention hearing. Hellerstein set the next court date for the case on March 17.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, whose office is prosecuting the couple, during an interview Monday morning on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" said, ""From the perspective of where I sit, my people and I are completely comfortable with this prosecution.""

Court filings on Monday morning show that defense lawyer Barry Pollack entered an appearance to represent Maduro. Pollack previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Assange's federal criminal case.

Pollack reportedly said during the hearing said Maduro ""is head of a sovereign state and entitled to the privilege"" from that status. Pollack also said there were ""questions about the legality of his military  abduction"" and that there would be ""voluminous"" court filings addressing that issue.

Flores is being represented by Mark Donnelly, a former federal prosecutor in Texas.

Maduro, 63, is charged in a federal indictment with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. He has previously denied the allegations.

Flores, 69, is charged with the cocaine conspiracy and weapons counts.

Maduro, whom the indictment refers to as the ""illegitimate ruler"" of Venezuela as a result of fraudulent election results, is accused of partnering with co-conspirators, narcotics traffickers, and narco-terrorist groups to import tons of cocaine into the United States.

Maduro and his wife appeared at around noon before Judge Hellerstein. 

""Nicolas Maduro Moros, the defendant, now sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug  trafficking,"" the 25-page indictment alleges.

""This cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,"" the indictment says.

Among the alleged overt acts detailed in the indictment is a meeting that Flores attended in approximately 2007, in which she purportedly ""accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to broker a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres.""

""The drug trafficker later arranged to pay a monthly bribe to Reverol Torres, in addition to approximately $100,000 for each flight that was transporting cocaine to ensure the flight's safe passage, a portion of which was then paid to Flores de Maduro,"" the indictment alleges. 

""Reverol Torres was charged with narcotics offenses in the Eastern District of New York and is a fugitive.""

The other defendants charged in the same indictment are not in U.S. custody.

Those defendants are Maduro's son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guerra; Diosdado Cabello Rondon; Ramon Rodriguez Chacin; and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores.

Cabello is Venezuela's interior minister, a post previously held by Rodriguez.

Guerrero has been identified as the leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

The Trump administration has faced questions about Maduro's apprehension in his own country, given Trump's recent pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted in 2024 of conspiring with drug traffickers and using his government position to help hundreds of tons of cocaine enter the United States.

In this article

Novo Nordisk will start rolling out the first-ever GLP-1 pill for weight loss in the U.S. on Monday, the company announced, marking a new chapter of obesity treatment in the U.S. 

The drug's cash prices are among the lowest on the market, ranging from $149 to $299 per month, depending on the dose. That fuels hopes that pills could help address the long-standing affordability hurdles tied to the weekly injections dominating the weight loss drug market. 

The official launch of the oral drug, called the Wegovy pill, comes just two weeks after U.S. regulators cleared the treatment. 

The starting dose of 1.5 milligrams is available at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as select telehealth providers, including Ro, LifeMD, Weight Watchers, GoodRx and Novo Nordisk's NovoCare Pharmacy. The higher, remaining doses of the pill will be available to patients by the end of the week, Novo Nordisk said. 

Cash-paying patients can pay $149 per month for the starting dose. The 4-milligram dose of the pill will also be available for $149 per month through April 15, then $199 per month after that. 

The highest doses of the Wegovy pill – 9 milligrams and 25 milligrams – will be available for $299 per month. Patients with insurance coverage for the drug can pay as little as $25 per month for the treatment. 

Cash-paying patients will also be able to access the starting dose of the pill for $149 per month on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration in November. The site also launches in January, though it's unclear when. 

Novo Nordisk on Monday said the pill's availability ""opens new possibilities"" for the more than 100 million Americans living with obesity. 

Injections from Novo Nordisk and its chief rival, Eli Lilly, carry a list price of roughly $1,000 per month. But both companies offer lower cash-pay prices for their shots that range from $299 to $499 monthly, depending on the dose. 

Pills are the next battleground for the two companies, which established the booming GLP-1 space that some analysts say could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s. Goldman Sachs analysts said in August that oral drugs could capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market.

The launch of Novo Nordisk's daily oral drug on Monday gives the company a clear head start. The Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment on Dec. 22 and will decide whether to clear a rival pill from Eli Lilly later this year. 

The FDA also approved Novo Nordisk's pill for use to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke, in adults with obesity and established cardiovascular disease. 

That's consistent with the approval label of the company's blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Both work by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 to suppress appetite.

""This moment is about changing what's possible in weight management, and to make that possible, we have worked to ensure [the Wegovy pill] is affordable and accessible to those who need it, however they choose to receive their care,"" said Ed Cinca, Novo Nordisk's senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions, in a release. 

People who take Novo Nordisk's pill have to wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking each day.

In a phase three trial that followed more than 300 adults with obesity and not diabetes, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average after 64 weeks. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug.

The pill appears to be slightly more effective than Eli Lilly's experimental oral drug, which does not have dietary restrictions.

Russia's reaction to the ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has been cautious, with Moscow weighing up the potential geopolitical benefits and opportunities of the U.S.' unilateral action against the loss of an important regional ally in Latin America. 

Moscow initially condemned U.S. strikes on Venezuela on Saturday, and the subsequent capture of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. 

Russia's Foreign Ministry decried the U.S.' ""aggressive actions,"" saying they constituted ""an unacceptable infringement on the sovereignty of an independent state."" But the Kremlin has not issued an official response on the ousting, nor has Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Maduro was an ally of Putin and Venezuela has long-standing ties with Russia; Caracas backed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the two countries shared energy ties and military cooperation. The allies also had a shared interest in counteracting the U.S.' geopolitical, military and economic influence in the region.

Still, Maduro's removal is not all bad news for Russia, and Moscow is likely to be looking at ways it can leverage the crisis in Venezuela to its own benefit. 

For a start, the Venezuela crisis comes at a delicate moment in Moscow's own relations with Washington. It's likely to be wary of burning bridges with the White House at a time when it's trying to curry favor with the administration to get the most favorable terms from a prospective Ukraine peace deal.  

But events in Venezuela provide a welcome distraction on that front, with Russia benefiting from any relaxation of efforts — or pressure — to reach a peace deal with Ukraine, or to enter into a ceasefire as part of any agreement.

While Russian forces are seen to have an advantage on the battlefield, not least in terms of manpower, and are making incremental progress in eastern Ukraine, a ceasefire is not seen to be in Russia's interests. 

""The Kremlin's response to the U.S. operation in Venezuela has been boilerplate thus far,"" analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, noted Sunday, adding that the Kremlin ""will likely have to balance its responses between maintaining its credibility as a partner to other states with its continued efforts to cater to the Trump administration.""

Analysts have also expressed concern that Trump's capture of Maduro, and the criminal charges levelled against him, could give Russia carte blanche to do the same to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who Moscow frequently describes as a ""criminal"" without presenting evidence to back up its accusations.

""He [Trump] is giving Putin permission to go as far as he wants with Zelenskyy,"" Sarah Lenti, political consultant and former director on the National Security Council at the White House, told CNBC on Monday.

""The president saying Maduro was a criminal, therefore he had the right to take [and] capture him. And we know that President Putin has often called Zelenskyy, wrongly, I believe, a criminal. And so he's setting a precedent and saying that it's OK for countries to go against the political sovereignty of another nation,"" she said in comments to CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition.""

""I think this is setting a very bad precedent for countries that China and Russia are looking to infringe upon, whether that's Taiwan or whether it's Ukraine,"" Lenti added.

On an ideological level, Trump's intervention in Venezuela and the foreign policy stance underpinning it — a desire to reassert the U.S.' power and dominance in the Western Hemisphere — chimes with Russia.

Putin is also widely seen as wanting to reestablish Russia's sphere of influence in Europe and Central Asia, which was lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, an event that Putin described as the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the 20th century. 

There has been speculation that Trump's newfound focus on reestablishing American hegemony in the West could allow Russia to do the same in its own backyard. But several analysts commented to CNBC that the U.S.' intervention in Venezuela showed countries like Russia and Iran that Trump was ready to act if it was deemed to be in the U.S.' interests.

""What he is doing in Venezuela is definitely going to be seen and heard very clearly in Iran, and in Russia,"" Amrita Sen, founder of Energy Aspects, told CNBC on Monday, 

""Whether that's in terms of needing to take Trump seriously, or in terms of, 'Don't dismiss it when he says, ""I am going to be doing X,""' and I think that's something that world leaders will be very careful about,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

Marko Papic, strategist at BCA Research, contended that Russia had no bargaining power with the U.S. when it came to allies like Venezuela. 

""If the U.S. gets a free rein in the sphere of influence, do other great powers get a free rein in theirs? The answer is 'no.'  There is nothing that Russia could have given America in Venezuela. ... There was no need for any kind of a bargain between Russia and the U.S. [as] the U.S. has free rein in its Western hemisphere,"" he noted.

Analysts are keen to stress that Maduro's ousting won't be actively welcomed in Moscow, as it removes an important ally and a bulwark against U.S. influence and aspirations in Latin America.

""With Maduro's fall, another Russian client state bites the dust, reducing the value of a Kremlin security guarantee to slightly better than zero,"" Tina Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight, stated in analysis on Monday.

""To make matters worse from the Kremlin's perspective, the U.S. operation effortlessly cut through the much-vaunted S-300 Russian air defence systems that had been installed in Venezuela, after having also failed to deliver air protection in Syria and Iran,"" she noted. 

Correction: Tina Fordham is founder of Fordham Global Foresight. An earlier version misstated the firm's name.

In this article

Foxconn, a major partner for Nvidia, has reported a 22% surge in revenues in the final quarter of 2025, as tech firms continue to ramp up spending on AI infrastructure. 

Also known as Hon Hai, Foxconn reported revenues of 2.6 trillion Taiwan dollars ($83 billion) in the quarter up to December, as its components and cloud businesses demonstrated strong growth, the company said. 

The figure tops analyst expectations of NT$2.4 trillion ($77 billion), according to LSEG estimates.

Foxconn is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and makes the servers that hold chips in data centers. It also assembles Apple's iPhone.

The company has emerged as a key player in AI as companies race to build out infrastructure for the technology. Its share price rose 25% across 2025, following a 76% uptick over the previous year.

""Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2025 achieved strong growth both QoQ and YoY, exceeding our expectation of significant growth, causing a high base for the first quarter,"" the company said in a statement.

Foxconn signed a partnership with OpenAI in November to collaborate on designs for next-generation AI infrastructure hardware.

In May, it was announced that the company would partner with Nvidia and the Taiwanese government to provide infrastructure to a major AI factory in Taiwan. 

also announced in July that it was taking a stake in data center construction company TECO Electric & Machinery Co.

Foxconn said it expected earnings to be near the upper end of the past five-year range thanks to the continued rise in AI rack shipments, despite entering the ""traditional off-season"" for ICT products in the first quarter of the year.

For Chick-fil-A's 80th anniversary, the chicken chain is going all out: retro packaging, collectible cups, themed merch and even the chance to win free food for a year.

The chain's anniversary comes as the restaurant industry struggles with declining traffic. To win back diners, many restaurants have leaned into deals, buzzy promotions and larger marketing budgets. 

As a privately held company, Chick-fil-A does not disclose quarterly financial results, but franchise disclosure documents show that the company's system sales growth slowed to 5.4% in 2024, making it the first year in more than a decade with less than double-digit sales growth.

Chick-fil-A has stayed out of the so-called value wars other restaurants have leaned into to compete, but the anniversary gives the chain the opportunity to attract more customers to its restaurants. The yearlong marketing campaign kicks off on Monday and represents the biggest promotional push ever for Chick-fil-A. Khalilah Cooper, Chick-fil-A's vice president of brand strategy, advertising and media, told CNBC that new advertising will spotlight the anniversary in both national TV spots and on social media.

At the center of the campaign is what the company is calling ""newstalgia,"" a portmanteau of ""new"" and ""nostalgia.""

""We've thought about this as a way to celebrate our heritage with customers who've been with us, potentially for decades, for all 80 years, or whether they've been with us for eight days or have never tried Chick-fil-A before,"" Cooper said.

While Chick-fil-A's growth is slowing, its sales are still rising even as the broader restaurant industry struggles with more budget-conscious consumers who are eating out less often and spending less, leading to shrinking traffic to eateries. In 2025, July was the only month with increasing restaurant visits compared with the year-ago period, according to Black Box Intelligence. Monthly traffic hit a low point in February, with the firm reporting a 5.7% fall from a year earlier.

Chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Papa John's and Wendy's have reported declining traffic and falling same-store sales. Hundreds of restaurant locations, from the likes of Starbucks and Jack in the Box, permanently closed in 2025 due to weak traffic.

To start, Chick-fil-A is also rolling out four retro collectible cup designs every few weeks, inspired by the company's archives and the shape of its 32-ounce cup. The chain is selling the cups for $3.99 at restaurants nationwide. 

Plus, Chick-fil-A has come up with its own riff on Willy Wonka's famous golden ticket: the Golden Fan Cup. The 3,000 customers who buy a collectible cup and receive the Golden Fan Cup will receive free Chick-fil-A for a year.

The chain will also give its iconic chicken sandwich limited-time, vintage-inspired packaging.

Chick-fil-A plans to sell themed merch through its website over the course of the year. Customers who visit its restaurants will also be able to purchase limited-edition designs of its stuffed cows. 

Also as part of the campaign, Chick-fil-A is adding its frosted sodas and floats to its menu permanently, starting Monday. Customers can also expect to see more limited-time menu items throughout the year than Chick-fil-A typically offers, according to Cooper.

The focus on ""newstalgia"" will also be front and center at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on Friday, when the Oregon Ducks face off against the Indiana Hoosiers in the College Football Playoff semifinal.

Chick-fil-A traces its roots to 1946, when S. Truett Cathy and his brother opened a restaurant called The Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. More than two decades later, Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A location, with its trademark chicken sandwich. The business is still family owned, and Cathy's grandson Andrew serves as its CEO.

The privately held chain's system sales reached $22.74 billion in 2024, making it the third-largest restaurant chain in the U.S., trailing only McDonald's and Starbucks. Over the past decade, Chick-fil-A has expanded far beyond its Southeastern stronghold, opening locations all across the U.S. and planning to expand its international business into the United Kingdom and Singapore.

Defense stocks in Europe and Asia surged on Monday as investors assessed how the dramatic overthrow of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro could herald a significant geopolitical shift that will boost the rearmament trade in the long run.

Rheinmetall, Germany's largest arms manufacturer, gained over 9.3% by the closing bell in London, while military technology and surveillance specialist Hensoldt rose more than 8.2%. Italy's Leonardo added more than 6.3%, while German counterpart Renk added around 8%.

Swedish fighter jet maker Saab added more than 6%.

Earlier, Japan's IHI Corp led Asian defense stocks' gains, advancing about 9%, followed closely by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which rose more than 8%. Kawasaki Heavy Industries, meanwhile, was up nearly 8%. In South Korea, Hanwa Aerospace closed 7% higher, while shares in Poongsan gained more than 2%.

In the U.S., meanwhile, fighter jet giant Lockheed Martin and military aircraft maker Northrop Grumman both advanced more than 2%. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) rose more than 1%, notching a new all-time intraday record.

Fawaz Chaudhry, chief investment officer at Fulcrum Asset Management, said Maduro's overthrow is a ""signaling exercise"" that will reshape geopolitics.

""As President Trump invoked the Monroe Doctrine, he's talking about the near sphere in America taking control through hard power, through hard power assets,"" Chaudhry told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday. 

""We're talking about a world trying to shift to a new era, where we will basically [have] hard power military assets, and go and take control, which basically is a different policy from before.""

Chaudhry expects that this more assertive U.S. foreign policy approach will mean ""more rearmament of Europe, rearmament of Asia,"" in the longer term, adding that defense stocks and military spending will continue to rise.  

""What President Trump and what America just did in Venezuela will actually reinforce that. More military spending, more rearmament, of Europe, of Asia, so that trend will continue,"" he explained.

The gains made by European defense names mark a sharp reversal for the sector, which has struggled in recent weeks amid the prospect of a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

Aoifinn Devitt, senior investment advisor at Moneta, expects defense spending to surge as a result of U.S. exceptionalism and the ""gunboat diplomacy"" theme on display in recent days.

""We know that the defense stocks did wobble when it looked like there might be peace in Ukraine. But ironically that theme, if anything, is going to be underscored especially [by] this rhetoric that is spreading things around to the neighboring countries,"" Devitt told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.

More broadly, defense has several key structural tailwinds behind it, Devitt said, highlighting a ramp-up in Germany's military spending, which has been ""endorsed wholeheartedly"" by the current German administration.

""New year, new world order – I think we all have to accept that. That will drive precautionary spending on defense,"" Devitt observed. ""Do we think that's a productive use of funds, where we will actually generate jobs and generate long-term economic growth? Probably not. But it is actually where we need to go.""

Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of Franklin Templeton Institute, said that other countries with territorial interests elsewhere could be emboldened by the Trump administration's unilateral use of force. 

This action will also likely add to the uncertainty of the dollar's role as a safe haven, Dover said in a note, ""while raising further questions about deterioration of international institutional pillars.""

""The U.S. military's recent action is therefore likely to reinforce the trend, well underway, for various countries worldwide to invest more in their national security. That has been one of our key investment themes since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""

Shares of U.S. oil companies soared in premarket trade on Monday, as investors scrutinize the fallout from the Trump administration's surprise military operation in Venezuela.

Chevron shares rose 6.4% at 7:40 a.m. ET, with Exxon Mobil up 3%, exploration and production company ConocoPhillips advancing 5.5% and oilfield services giant SLB climbing 8.5%.

The moves come after the U.S. conducted a major military operation in Venezuela over the weekend, capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in an audacious intervention that has sent shockwaves across the globe.

U.S. President Donald Trump has since said the White House will ""run"" the South American country until such a time that ""a safe, proper and judicious transition"" can take place. 

Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC, an influential energy alliance, and sits on the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world at 303 billion barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That represents roughly 17% of global oil reserves.

Trump has said U.S. investment in Venezuela's energy sector is now a core objective for his administration. 

""We're going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,"" Trump said in a press conference from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.

""Let's start making money for the country,"" Trump said on Saturday.

Oil prices were last seen trading slightly higher on Monday. 

International benchmark Brent crude oil futures with March delivery were up 0.5% at $61.03 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with February delivery stood 0.6% higher at $57.64. 

Allen Good, director of equity research at Morningstar, said Chevron appeared to be best positioned among the oil majors to benefit from U.S. involvement in Venezuelan crude restoration projects, highlighting the firm's significant presence in the country.

The Trump administration's intervention in Venezuela could also allow for Exxon and ConocoPhillips to re-enter the country, Good said, although he warned that Venezuela's oil industry ""will require tens of billions in investment"" to meaningfully lift production. 

""Oil companies will need to be cautious about deploying capital until there is greater regulatory and contractual certainty,"" Good said.

""While Chevron may be able to add incremental production in the near term with US approval, meaningful volume increases are likely years away. With this in mind, the possibility of US companies developing Venezuela's oil reserves remains far from certain,"" he added.

Neil Atkinson, an independent energy analyst and former London-based employee of Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA, said there are several challenges to address when it comes to fixing Venezuela's oil industry. 

""Look at it cynically, you want to get Venezuela's oil industry back up and running. If you want to do that, you can only do it if you have stability, and that means you have to ensure that there is law and order, which there isn't now,"" Atkinson told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.

""You have to ensure that there is stable electricity supplies, which there isn't now. You have to ensure that food and fuel supplies are reliable, where they are not now. So, a lot has to happen and it cannot happen without the consent of the Venezuelan people,"" he added.  

Asked whether American oil companies would want to go into Venezuela given relatively low oil prices, Atkinson said, ""Well, I would think for long-term strategic reasons, yes. But, as you say, the price is low currently."" 

He added: ""There are special issues in terms of increasing oil production in Venezuela, the type of oil that it is, the cost and complexity of processing it. But for them, it would be a long-term play. That, to me, is the main reason why investors might feel more positive toward those companies.""

Good morning. It was anything but a quiet weekend for news, so I'll cut to the chase.

S&P 500 futures are up slightly this morning. The market is coming off a losing week.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

President Donald Trump said early Saturday that the U.S. carried out a large-scale strike on Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife were captured and taken to New York to be indicted for narco-terrorism.

Here's what to know:

Oil prices and stocks are being closely watched this morning as investors wonder what the shakeup in Venezuela would mean for the market structure.

As CNBC's Spencer Kimball notes, Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. Still, analysts say the energy market is unlikely to see big swings in the near term as a result of the strike. Petroleum-focused intergovernmental group OPEC+ kept its oil output unchanged yesterday.

Shares of oil stocks such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil jumped in premarket trading today. Follow live markets updates here.

""Do more with less."" This phrase-turned-governing principle has been a bedrock for Anthropic president and co-founder Daniela Amodei.

As CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos reports, the buzzy artificial intelligence startup has been disciplined when it comes to spending. This strategy stands in stark contrast to other major AI players, who have raced to ink billion-dollar deals to bolster their leadership on the technology.

As Amodei puts it: ""Anthropic has always had a fraction of what our competitors have had in terms of compute and capital, and yet, pretty consistently, we've had the most powerful, most performant models for the majority of the past several years."" Read and watch the full interview here.

Tesla lost its spot as the world's largest electric vehicle maker for the first time last week.

The company reported 418,227 deliveries in the fourth quarter on Friday, missing Wall Street's forecast and marking a 16% decline from a year ago. Tesla's 2025 calendar year total of 1.64 million placed it behind China-based company BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles in the year.

Users also criticized Musk's xAI company last week over recent Grok chatbot posts showing AI-generated, sexualized images of children shared on X. Meanwhile, Musk's Starlink business said it would provide free broadband internet service to Venezuela users until early February following the U.S. strike.

Chick-fil-A is ringing in its 80th anniversary with its biggest marketing campaign ever.

As CNBC's Amelia Lucas found, the fast-food chain is dishing out retro packaging, collectible cups, special merchandise and freebies to mark the occasion. The company said the theme at the heart of the campaign is ""newstalgia"" — a combination of the words new and nostalgia.

Chick-fil-A's marketing blitz comes as the restaurant industry grapples with sliding traffic. The company's franchise disclosure documents show system sales growth came in at 5.4% in 2024, which marked the first year in more than a decade with an increase in the single digits.

Here's what we're keeping an eye on this week:

BEIJING — Even as China eyes new opportunities to build global influence in the wake of the U.S. attack on Venezuela, Beijing's immediate priority is protecting its economic interests, analysts said.

China reacted swiftly to the military strike on Saturday night, expressing shock and condemnation. Beijing subsequently called on the U.S. to release the ousted Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and urged Washington to resolve the crisis through dialogue.

China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press briefing Monday that China maintains ""positive communication and cooperation"" with the Venezuelan government and that its willingness to deepen cooperation, including on oil exports, would not change regardless of how the situation evolves. 

He added that Chinese interests in Venezuela would be protected under the law.

The U.S. attack on Venezuela helps China bolster its position as a ""force for stability"" in the world, said Zichen Wang, a research fellow at the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.

But Wang said the situation raises concerns for Beijing because of China's exposure in the country.

""How this unfolds in the future is also very concerning, because China has a lot of commercial interests there,"" he said, adding that the uncertainty could spill over to Chinese business across Latin America and beyond.

Beijing has made significant inroads in Latin America over the past two decades, persuading several countries, including Panama, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, to shift diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China.

Chinese companies, mostly state-owned, have invested $4.8 billion in Venezuela over the last two decades, according to data compiled by the U.S.-based research firm Rhodium Group. Most of the deals occurred in the decade following the global financial crisis — and during the final years of former President Hugo Chávez's rule — with a focus on energy projects.

State-owned oil giant China National Petroleum Corporation has joint ventures with its Venezuelan counterpart, Petróleos de Venezuela. In August, privately held China Concord Resources Corp. announced rare plans to invest more than $1 billion in a Venezuelan project, targeting production of 60,000 barrels of crude oil a day by the end of 2026, according to Reuters. 

Protecting Chinese nationals and Chinese companies remains Beijing's top priority, said Dong Shaopeng, a senior researcher at Renmin University of China. China's Foreign Ministry said Monday it has received no reports of Chinese citizens being harmed by the U.S. strike.

Beijing also criticized what it described as bullying actions that violate another country's sovereignty and said it opposes interference in the internal affairs of Latin American nations for any reason.

China said it follows a noninterference policy and will remain a ""good friend"" to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean ""and does not draw ideological lines.""

""China never seeks spheres of influence, nor does it target any third party,"" Lin added.

China is the top destination for Venezuela crude, according to S&P Global. 

But Venezuela accounted for only 2% of China's crude oil and condensate imports in 2024, with the majority coming from the Middle East, according to figures published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 

Imports from Iran and Iraq increased between 2023 and 2024, while those from Venezuela fell, the data showed.

""China is likely to be wary of being dragged into this conflict, as Venezuela carries limited economic significance for China and little geopolitical proximity,"" said Yue Su, principal economist, China, at The Economist Intelligence Unit.

""Rather than choosing sides decisively, China's priority has been to protect its interests, so long as partner countries do not take an explicit stance on Taiwan,"" she said.

China's broader geopolitical posture remains unchanged, analysts added, including its approach to Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory. 

China staged live-fire drills around Taiwan last week in a massive military display, days after the U.S. announced a record-size arms package to Taiwan.

""This Venezuela episode is quite a big crisis, but it doesn't change China's playbook on Taiwan. It doesn't change the expectation on what will happen between China and the U.S.,"" Dan Wang, a director on Eurasia Group's China team, said Monday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""

What may change, she said, is Beijing's thinking on the need to establish a legal framework for taking Taiwan, similar to how the U.S. justified Maduro's capture with drug trafficking charges.

Against the backdrop of the U.S. attack on Venezuela, China's high-level diplomacy continued in earnest on Monday.

Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Ireland's Prime Minister Michael Martin — the first visit by an Irish  leader in 14 years — and was set to host South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung later in the day.

""China pulled from 6% to more than 20% of world GDP (PPP) in 15 years,"" Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of ""The Black Swan,"" wrote back in September. ""So consider what the state of geopolitics would be in 2035."" 

""In the future, discussions about war might need to happen in Beijing, not Washington.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum can move beyond Bitcoin-style limits as new scaling tools mature: Vitalik Buterin","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/05/ethereum-can-move-beyond-bitcoin-style-limits-as-new-scaling-tools-mature-vitalik-buterin","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:48:56 GMT","

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the network is approaching a turning point as two major upgrades, PeerDAS and zkEVMs, move from research to working code.

In a post on X, Buterin argued that the combination could shift Ethereum into “a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” because it targets the core tradeoff that has historically limited blockchains where a system can be decentralized and have consensus, but bandwidth and throughput stay low.

He framed the problem through two internet-era models. Systems like BitTorrent can move enormous amounts of data in a decentralized way, but they do not need consensus. Bitcoin has strong decentralization and consensus, but it stays low-bandwidth because every node effectively re-checks the same work instead of dividing it up. 

Ethereum's next phase, he said, is about getting all three at once.

The first leg is already live. PeerDAS (data availability sampling) is now on Ethereum mainnet, letting nodes verify that data is available without downloading the full dataset.

PeerDAS is a prototype for Data Availability Sampling (DAS), which is essential for Ethereum's scaling via sharding. It allows light clients to check if all shard data has been published by sampling small portions, greatly enhancing scalability while maintaining decentralization and security.

The second leg, zkEVMs, is now “production-quality on performance,” Buterin said, meaning the remaining work is safety and proving robustness at scale.

Buterin described this as a practical step toward solving the so-called “blockchain trilemma,” not as a theory, but through “live running code,"" adding that zkEVM nodes could start appearing in limited form in 2026.

A longer-term goal is “distributed block building,” Buterin added, where no single party assembles the full block in one place, reducing censorship risks and improving geographic fairness.

The message is that Ethereum's scaling roadmap is increasingly about splitting verification work across the network, rather than asking every node to replicate everything.

Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies added 32,977 ETH valued around $104 million during the final week of 2025, the firm announced on Monday. 

The latest purchase brings its total holdings to more than 4.14 million ETH, worth more than $13 billion as of this writing. Its holdings now represent around 3.4% of the circulating ETH supply, leaving BitMine about 1.9 million ETH shy of its stated goal of 5% of the total circulating supply. 

""In the final week of 2025, total equity and crypto activity slowed, and yet we acquired 32,977 ETH in the past week,"" said Bitwise Chairman Tom Lee, in a statement.

“Our analysis shows that BitMine has continued to accumulate ETH at an accelerated pace versus other Ethereum [digital asset treasuries]. We remain the largest 'fresh money' buyer of ETH in the world.""

The firm's purchase announcement follows aggressive forecasting for the price of Ethereum and shares in BitMine (BMNR) as part of Lee's latest chairman's message. In his Friday remarks, Lee predicted a move to $250,000 for ETH—a roughly 7,760% increase from the recent trading price of $3,180. ETH is up nearly 9% over the last week.

Lee also predicted a future price of $5,000 per share for BMNR based on its relationship to the price of Ethereum. But that mark is without any stock splits, a major focus for the firm as it seeks shareholder approval to increase the authorized share count from 500 million to 50 billion. 

""BitMine needs the increase in authorized shares primarily to allow the company to selectively issue shares for capital market activities, accommodate future share splits (as ETH moves to our long-term targets), and enable us to consider selective acquisitions,"" Lee said. 

The firm cited stock splits as the most important reason for the share increase, highlighting a focus on keeping the stock price accessible to the public and around $25. Lee's message urged all shareholders to vote yes on the proposal by January 14. 

Other proposals ahead of its annual meeting include electing eight directors and implementing special compensation and incentive plans. 

Shares in the Ethereum treasury firm are up around 4% on Monday, recently changing hands at $32.49 and up nearly 14.8% in the last five trading days, according to data from Yahoo Finance. 

The company remains the largest Ethereum treasury firm and is the second-largest publicly traded crypto treasury overall, trailing only Strategy, the Bitcoin treasury firm that holds around $63 billion in BTC. 

In addition to its $13 billion in ETH, BitMine holds around $915 million in cash and 192 Bitcoin valued near $18 million.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has said the network has effectively solved blockchain's long-standing “trilemma,” arguing that recent upgrades have transformed Ethereum into a “fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network” capable of achieving security, decentralization and scalability.

“Now, Ethereum with PeerDAS (2025) and ZK-EVMs (expect small portions of the network using it in 2026), we get: decentralized, consensus and high bandwidth,” he tweeted Saturday, referring to Peer-to-Peer Data Availability Sampling and Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines.

“The trilemma has been solved - not on paper, but with live running code, of which one half (data availability sampling) is on mainnet today, and the other half (ZK-EVMs) is production-quality on performance today - safety is what remains.”

The claims come as Ethereum continues to navigate market volatility following last month's Fusaka upgrade. ETH is currently trading at $3,185, up 1.4% over the past 24 hours but about 36% below its peak of $4,946.05 reached on August 24, 2025, according to CoinGecko data.

On prediction market Myriad, owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, sentiment is cautiously optimistic. Users place a 56% chance on Ethereum's next move taking it to $4,000 rather than $2,500.

The blockchain trilemma refers to a belief thatblockchain networks can optimize for only two of the three core properties of decentralization, security and scalability at once. Previously, efforts to increase transaction throughput have required sacrificing decentralization, while highly decentralized networks have struggled to scale without compromising performance or costs.

Buterin contrasted Ethereum's latest technical progress with that of earlier distributed networks. He compared BitTorrent, launched in 2000, as highly decentralized with massive total bandwidth but no shared consensus, and Bitcoin, introduced in 2009, as decentralized and secure but limited in bandwidth because computation on the network is replicated rather than distributed.

Crypto Crystal Ball 2026: Will Ethereum Finally Start Going Parabolic?

Ethereum's roadmap seeks to overcome this constraint by separating data availability, execution and validation across the network.

A central component of this roadmap is PeerDAS, which Buterin has highlighted as a key feature of the Fusaka upgrade last month. PeerDAS allows nodes to verify that transaction data exists without downloading it in full by sampling small portions of data that can be reconstructed using erasure coding.

The approach reduces the computational and storage burden on validators, lowers the barrier to running a node and is expected to significantly increase Ethereum's throughput, with a target of up to 12,000 transactions per second by 2026.

Looking ahead, Buterin said the full scope of Ethereum's scaling strategy will roll out over several years. In 2026, he expects large gas limit increases that do not depend on ZK-EVMs, alongside the first opportunities to run a ZK-EVM node.

Between 2026 and 2028, further changes are expected, including gas repricings, updates to Ethereum's state structure, and moving execution payloads into data blobs to make higher gas limits safer. From 2027 to 2030, Buterin said the network could see additional major gas limit increases as ZK-EVMs become the primary method for validating blocks.

Buterin also highlighted the potential of distributed block building. ""A long-term ideal holy grail is to get to a future where the full block is never constituted in one single place,"" he said. ""This will not be necessary for a long time, but IMO it is worth striving for us at least have the capability to do that.”

“Even before that point, we want the meaningful authority in block building to be as distributed as possible,” Buterin wrote, adding that it can be done either in-protocol or out-of-protocol with distributed builder marketplaces. ""This reduces risk of centralized interference with real-time transaction inclusion, AND it creates a better environment for geographical fairness,” he explained.

Ethereum's price will surge 8,000% and trade at $250,000 per token, according to Bitmine chairman Tom Lee.

That surge would catapult the value of the second-largest crypto to about $30 trillion — more than Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla combined. 

In a message to Bitmine shareholders, Lee cites the six-figure target while proposing an increase in the company's authorised shares to grow 100-fold from 500 million to 50 billion in order to set the stage for a future stock split. He urges shareholders to vote by January 14.

Bitmine's share price jumped 15% after Lee's proposal. This signalled investor confidence in the company and support for the strategy, which also includes “opportunistic acquisitions” and capital markets plays including “convertibles and warrants.” 

The confidence bump comes as digital asset treasury firms like Bitmine is under pressure due to the crypto market having shaved roughly $1 trillion of its value since October. 

This means that many of the public firms that have pivoted into becoming DATs are trading at lower values than their underlying assets, putting the viability of their business models into question. 

This marks a dramatic change from the beginning of 2025 when a wave of companies pivoted into becoming DATs, spurred on by the Trump administration support of the crypto industry.

“The initial hype is over,” Brian Huang, co-founder of investment platform Glider, told DL News earlier in January.

Lee's bold call comes as Ethereum trades just above $3,100. That's less than half of Lee's prediction that the crypto's price would hit $7,500 by the end of 2025. 

In recent weeks, Bitmine purchased $1.4 billion more of the crypto, bringing the firm's Ethereum holdings to over $12 billion. 

Publicly-traded companies perform stock splits to lower the price of a single share. That will make it seem more affordable for regular investors to buy in without changing the company's actual total value. 

By increasing the number of shares available at a lower price, the company also makes its stock easier to trade on the market.

Backed by top institutional investors — including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest — Bitmine now owns over 3.4% of Ethereum's circulating supply and is aiming for 5%.

Lee argues that a stock split will be necessary because Bitmine's “stock price follows Ethereum price,” and projects the company's stock trading at $5,000 per share when Ethereum reaches $250,000. 

He did not offer a timeframe for any of his targets.

To be sure, Lee is far from the only one with grand plans for Ethereum. 

Vitalik Buterin, the blockchain network's co-founder, described the technology as “civilisational infrastructure” on the first day of 2026. 

Commenting on the development of new ZKEVM technology, Buterin said “they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralised network.”

“Over the next four years, expect to see the full extent of this vision roll out.”

Banking-focused crypto is quietly re-entering investor conversations as investors seek the best altcoins to buy now, particularly those focused on payments, settlement, and real financial infrastructure rather than speculative narratives. Not to replace banks overnight fantasy, but the boring part that actually matters: moving money, settling payments, and bridging cash with stablecoins.

Digitap ($TAP) focuses on the consumer banking layer, where users convert, spend, and settle crypto rather than speculate on price moves. It is designed for low-liquidity market conditions where fast conversion and predictable settlement matter more than upside volatility.

The list below focuses on altcoins to watch that are connected to payments, settlement rails, and financial infrastructure, plus one early-stage banking presale designed around capital protection.



Digitap is a consumer-facing banking app that prioritizes settlement reliability and conversion speed in volatile markets. When markets are fearful and liquidity is thin, number-go-ups become unreliable, and working financial tools become more valuable.



Digitap supports real-time crypto-to-fiat conversion, allowing users to convert supported assets into fiat quickly within the same platform. Digitap offers a no-KYC wallet setup, with additional verification requirements applying to expanded banking features.

On the token side, $TAP is framed around a fixed supply (2B) and deflationary mechanics. The model is designed to use app-generated revenue for token buybacks, with a portion of those tokens permanently removed from circulation over time. 

Staking and rewards also matter here, and $TAP holders can currently earn 124% APY. Digitap's native $TAP token is currently priced at $0.0411, with the next step at $0.0427 coming soon. The project reports Round 3 as nearly sold out, with approximately $3.5 million raised.



XRP remains one of the most visible banking-adjacent assets because the broader Ripple ecosystem focuses on enterprise payments infrastructure. In July 2025, OpenPayd announced a partnership with Ripple to provide stablecoin and payments infrastructure for businesses, combining OpenPayd's fiat rails with Ripple Payments and stablecoin liquidity access. 



OpenPayd and Ripple are working together to integrate stablecoin liquidity and payment rails into enterprise banking systems. (Source: OpenPayd)

That type of integration matters because it pushes crypto payment rails closer to the systems businesses already use: treasury flows, cross-border settlements, and multi-currency operations.

Why XRP ranks behind Digitap in this list: XRP is mostly payment infrastructure and network positioning, not a consumer banking surface where token value capture is directly tied to app usage and defensively framed tokenomics.

Stellar's strongest banking angle is real-world access. MoneyGram Ramps is designed to connect cash and digital dollars through a single integration, enabling cash-in and cash-out in many countries without requiring a bank account.

For beginners, the plain-English value is simple: stablecoins become more useful when converting between cash and digital dollars is easier. Stellar sits inside that on/off ramp layer, where utility matters more than memes.

Why XLM ranks behind Digitap: Stellar is a payment rails and distribution infrastructure, while Digitap focuses on being the direct consumer layer for spending, conversion, and settlement, plus a presale structure designed around asymmetric entry and value capture.

Quant's banking relevance is tied to interoperability and regulated finance projects. In September 2025, Quant stated it was selected by UK Finance and a consortium of commercial banks to provide technology underpinning the UK's tokenised sterling deposits (GBTD) project, running until mid-2026. 

Tokenised deposits are essentially digital representations of commercial bank money, designed to keep the trust and regulatory protections of traditional deposits while adding programmability and speed. 

Why QNT ranks behind Digitap: Quant is institutional plumbing, not a beginner-friendly banking product layer. It can matter massively for finance infrastructure, but it does not offer the same direct consumer utility and presale asymmetry that Digitap is selling for 2026.

XDC Network is built around trade finance, real-world asset tokenization, and enterprise use cases. The ecosystem around TradeFinex describes an ISO 20022-aligned trade finance protocol with industry partners, which is part of why XDC is often discussed in banking rails circles. 

This is less about retail trading and more about modernizing the settlement and documentation side of global trade, where slow processes and fragmented systems cost real money.

Why XDC ranks behind Digitap: XDC is infrastructure-first and enterprise-oriented. Digitap is designed as a consumer-facing app focused on spending, conversion, and crypto-to-fiat access, plus a token model explicitly pitched as defensive during drawdowns.



XRP, Stellar, Quant, and XDC each connect to real payment or settlement narratives, but most of that value lives in rails, partnerships, and infrastructure layers.

Digitap is different: a live app that turns those banking crypto ideas into something usable at the consumer level, and a token system designed to behave like a defensive tool rather than a hype vehicle. This matters as global remittance fees still average around 6%, while crypto-native banking tools aim to significantly reduce those costs compared to traditional remittance channels.



This approach fits cleanly into a bear-market environment: fixed supply, buyback-and-burn mechanics, stable settlement, and practical tools for converting and spending value when charts are unstable. Presale mechanics also matter when evaluating the best crypto presales 2025, because Digitap's price steps are programmed and time-boxed rather than driven by market hype.



Banking altcoins are not exciting in a loud way. The projects above are connected to settlement rails, cash access, tokenized deposits, and trade finance infrastructure, all areas that tend to grow quietly and matter later.

For users searching for the best crypto to buy right now, Digitap stands out by combining a working banking layer with a value-capture token model.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Ethereum has long talked a big game. Now it's time for the second biggest blockchain to deliver","https://fortune.com/crypto/2026/01/05/ethereum-2026-vitalik-buterin-fork-in-the-road/?utm_source=flipboard&utm_content=fortune%2Fmagazine%2FPersonal+finance","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:36:00 GMT","

On Jan. 1, Vitalik Buterin announced a New Year's resolution for the blockchain he devised way back in 2013. It's time, he declared, for Ethereum to step up and deliver on its original mission: “To build the world computer that serves as a central infrastructure piece of a more free and open internet.” 

Buterin's message is a timely one. For more than a decade now, Ethereum has offered the tantalizing promise of a global computer, available to anyone, that can be used to create decentralized alternatives to Big Tech's data-gobbling monopolies. The blockchain popularized smart contracts, and has been a springboard for thousands of projects backed by billions of dollars. It has also spawned legions of mostly fly-by-night imitators.

Despite all of this, the promise of Ethereum always seems just over the horizon. In recent years, the blockchain has come to resemble that can't-miss sports prospect who can't quite hack it in the big leagues. Instead of evolving into a popular global computer, Ethereum still feels like a sub-culture where cliques of insiders build esoteric applications for each other. In response, many in the crypto world started betting on other horses like Solana that promised to deliver practical results.

Ethereum's problem, ironically, has been its idealism. The blockchain has a core community that believes passionately in decentralization, and is mistrustful of anything resembling formal authority. That includes Buterin, who stepped back from his creation several years ago, preferring to let Ethereum find its own path forward.

All of this is admirable, especially in contrast to many recent arrivals on the crypto scene, whose first and only concern is to make a buck. Unfortunately, it has also led Ethereum developers to dither in the face of obvious problems, including congestion and high gas fees. To be fair, the blockchain has made some important fixes—but only after allowing piggy-back chains, known as layer 2s, to siphon off large amounts of revenue and make the crypto landscape painfully complicated.

Now, though, change could be in the air. In the last two years, both BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase have launched tokenized assets that settle directly to the main Ethereum blockchain. This is a testament to how Ethereum remains the gold standard for security and points to a future where it will be the backbone of global finance. The tokenized transactions also legitimize Ethereum's claim to be a universal computer, and could spur the mainstream adoption of other decentralized applications for social media, identity, and more.

For this to happen, though, the Ethereum community will require Buterin's ongoing leadership. That's why his New Year's Day post is a welcome development. The piece reinforced the primacy of decentralization as Ethereum's paramount value: “We're building decentralized applications. Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party interference. Applications that pass the walkaway test: they keep running even if the original developers disappear.”

But it also delivered a pragmatic piece of advice to the community seeking to build this decentralized future: Get on with it, already.

It was once fashionable for journalists to seize on price slumps in order to write sneering columns predicting Bitcoin's demise. These “Bitcoin obituaries” persisted well after the currency's viability became clear, but now appear to have finally faded altogether.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Vitalik Buterin Says Ethereum Solved The Blockchain Trilemma","https://bitcoinist.com/buterin-ethereum-solved-blockchain-trilemma/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:30:07 GMT","

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the network has effectively “solved” the blockchain trilemma: decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth, arguing that the missing ingredients are now live on mainnet or within reach as zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machines (ZK-EVMs) move toward production use.

In a Jan. 3 post on X, Buterin framed the moment around two technical developments: PeerDAS, which he said is now live on Ethereum mainnet, and ZK-EVMs, which he described as being at an “alpha stage” with “production-quality performance” while “remaining work is safety.”

“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote. “To see why, let's look at the two major types of p2p network so far.”

Buterin drew a contrast between early peer-to-peer systems that could scale throughput but lacked agreement on shared state, and blockchains that achieved robust consensus but paid for it with constrained bandwidth. He pointed to BitTorrent as a model of decentralized distribution without consensus, and to Bitcoin as a model of decentralization and consensus that keeps bandwidth low because “it's not ‘distributed' in the sense of work being split up, it's replicated.”

The claim, in Buterin's telling, is that Ethereum is entering a third category. “Now, Ethereum with PeerDAS (2025) and ZK-EVMs (expect small portions of the network using it in 2026), we get: decentralized, consensus and high bandwidth,” he said. “The trilemma has been solved — not on paper, but with live running code, of which one half (data availability sampling) is on mainnet today, and the other half (ZK-EVMs) is production-quality on performance today — safety is what remains.”

Buterin cast this as the culmination of a multi-year roadmap rather than a sudden breakthrough. He described it as a “10-year journey,” pointing back to early data availability sampling research and noting that ZK-EVM efforts began around 2020. The arc of his argument is that data availability sampling changes what a decentralized network can safely publish and verify at scale, while ZK-EVMs change how nodes can validate execution, shifting validation toward proof-based verification as the technology matures.

Looking ahead, Buterin laid out an approximate timeline for how he expects the vision to roll out over the next four years. In 2026, he expects “large non-ZKEVM-dependent gas limit increases” tied to BALs and ePBS, alongside what he described as the first opportunities to run a ZK-EVM node.

From 2026 through 2028, he anticipates a sequence of changes, gas repricings, adjustments to state structure, moving execution payloads into blobs, and other steps, aimed at making higher gas limits safe. Between 2027 and 2030, he expects “large further gas limit increases,” with ZK-EVMs becoming “the primary way to validate blocks on the network.”

He also flagged what he called a “third piece” of the puzzle: distributed block building. The long-term goal, he wrote, is a world where “the full block is never constituted in one single place,” though he stressed it “will not be necessary for a long time.” The nearer-term focus is distributing “meaningful authority in block building,” either through in-protocol mechanisms—he floated expanding FOCIL as a primary transaction channel—or through out-of-protocol systems such as distributed builder marketplaces.

For Buterin, distributing block building is not just an engineering preference but a risk and fairness question: he argued it would reduce the chance of “centralized interference with real-time transaction inclusion,” while creating “a better environment for geographical fairness.”

At press time, ETH traded at $3,164.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has said the network has effectively solved blockchain's long-standing “trilemma,” arguing that recent upgrades have transformed Ethereum into a “fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network” capable of achieving security, decentralization and scalability.

“Now, Ethereum with PeerDAS (2025) and ZK-EVMs (expect small portions of the network using it in 2026), we get: decentralized, consensus and high bandwidth,” he tweeted Saturday, referring to Peer-to-Peer Data Availability Sampling and Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines.

“The trilemma has been solved - not on paper, but with live running code, of which one half (data availability sampling) is on mainnet today, and the other half (ZK-EVMs) is production-quality on performance today - safety is what remains.”

The claims come as Ethereum continues to navigate market volatility following last month's Fusaka upgrade. ETH is currently trading at $3,185, up 1.4% over the past 24 hours but about 36% below its peak of $4,946.05 reached on August 24, 2025, according to CoinGecko data.

On prediction market Myriad, owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, sentiment is cautiously optimistic. Users place a 56% chance on Ethereum's next move taking it to $4,000 rather than $2,500.

The blockchain trilemma refers to a belief thatblockchain networks can optimize for only two of the three core properties of decentralization, security and scalability at once. Previously, efforts to increase transaction throughput have required sacrificing decentralization, while highly decentralized networks have struggled to scale without compromising performance or costs.

Buterin contrasted Ethereum's latest technical progress with that of earlier distributed networks. He compared BitTorrent, launched in 2000, as highly decentralized with massive total bandwidth but no shared consensus, and Bitcoin, introduced in 2009, as decentralized and secure but limited in bandwidth because computation on the network is replicated rather than distributed.

Crypto Crystal Ball 2026: Will Ethereum Finally Start Going Parabolic?

Ethereum's roadmap seeks to overcome this constraint by separating data availability, execution and validation across the network.

A central component of this roadmap is PeerDAS, which Buterin has highlighted as a key feature of the Fusaka upgrade last month. PeerDAS allows nodes to verify that transaction data exists without downloading it in full by sampling small portions of data that can be reconstructed using erasure coding.

The approach reduces the computational and storage burden on validators, lowers the barrier to running a node and is expected to significantly increase Ethereum's throughput, with a target of up to 12,000 transactions per second by 2026.

Looking ahead, Buterin said the full scope of Ethereum's scaling strategy will roll out over several years. In 2026, he expects large gas limit increases that do not depend on ZK-EVMs, alongside the first opportunities to run a ZK-EVM node.

Between 2026 and 2028, further changes are expected, including gas repricings, updates to Ethereum's state structure, and moving execution payloads into data blobs to make higher gas limits safer. From 2027 to 2030, Buterin said the network could see additional major gas limit increases as ZK-EVMs become the primary method for validating blocks.

Buterin also highlighted the potential of distributed block building. ""A long-term ideal holy grail is to get to a future where the full block is never constituted in one single place,"" he said. ""This will not be necessary for a long time, but IMO it is worth striving for us at least have the capability to do that.”

“Even before that point, we want the meaningful authority in block building to be as distributed as possible,” Buterin wrote, adding that it can be done either in-protocol or out-of-protocol with distributed builder marketplaces. ""This reduces risk of centralized interference with real-time transaction inclusion, AND it creates a better environment for geographical fairness,” he explained.

Key Takeaways

A mystery trader turned $32,500 into $400,000 betting on Maduro's arrest hours before the official White House announcement.

Rep. Ritchie Torres introduced the Public Integrity Act of 2026 to ban government officials from trading on prediction markets.

One savvy trader earned $80,000 by tracking late-night Domino's orders at the Pentagon to predict military operations.

A mysterious insider on Polymarket gains $400K following the capture of Nicolás Maduro, sparking immediate calls for federal regulation. After a trader turned $32,500 into a massive windfall just hours before the U.S. military operation was public, Rep. Ritchie Torres is proposing the Public Integrity Act of 2026. The bill seeks to ban government officials from profiting on “insider information” within the prediction market ecosystem, which exploded to over $44 billion in volume in 2025.

On Saturday morning, while global headlines focused on the high-stakes military operation, blockchain analysts began dissecting a series of unusual transactions. They identified a newly created account on Polymarket that executed only four trades in late December, all of which focused exclusively on U.S. intervention in Venezuela.

The trader purchased contracts betting that Maduro would be “out of office” by January 31. At the time, the market gave this outcome a single-digit probability, with contracts priced at a mere $0.07. Then, at approximately 10:00 PM ET on Friday, nearly three hours before the White House officially announced the arrest, the price began a vertical ascent.

Insider's address, 0x31a56e9e690c621ed21de08cb559e9524cdb8ed9, gained over $400K on Polymarket.

By the time President Trump posted a photograph on Truth Social showing Maduro blindfolded aboard the USS Iwo Jima, the unknown trader had realized a 1,200% return as contract values hit $1.00, leading regulators to suspect a textbook case of insider trading rather than a speculative hunch.

Interestingly, one Polymarket user claimed an $80,000 profit by tracking the “Pentagon Pizza Index.” They noticed a massive surge in late-night Domino's orders at locations surrounding the Pentagon, a classic, low-tech proxy for increased military staffing and imminent operations.

How i made 80,000$ in a single night using @Polymarket Basically ever since the US brought their largest aircraft carrier i knew a strike was 100% going to happen, but i did not know when. So i built a vibe coded bot to track the dominos pizza orders around the pentagon because… https://t.co/Jx1ODEGtJ2

The incident caught the immediate attention of the U.S. Representative Ritchie Torres. On Saturday, Torres announced he will introduce the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026.

NEW — RITCHIE TORRES (D-N.Y.) will introduce a bill on this.

Bill will be called the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026

Description, per a source:

This bill prohibits federal elected officials, political appointees, and Executive Branch employees… https://t.co/eZZ9BmAMgJ

— Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) January 3, 2026



While the STOCK Act already restricts officials from using non-public information to trade stocks and bonds, the legal status of prediction markets remains a murky gray area. Torres's legislation seeks to explicitly prohibit federally elected officials, political appointees, and executive branch employees from trading prediction market contracts related to government policy or political outcomes.

“The public must have confidence that government officials are not treating sensitive state secrets like a personal piggy bank,” a source familiar with the draft legislation stated.

Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated exchange, responded quickly to the news. Through its public relations channels, the company emphasized that its platform rules already prohibit insiders and policymakers from trading on material non-public information (MNPI). Because Kalshi operates under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), it maintains strict “Know Your Customer” (KYC) protocols and surveillance systems to flag suspicious activity.

FWIW, Kalshi prohibits this activity on our exchange: Rule 5.17 (y) and (z) https://t.co/5SSbM75CKf

— Kalshi News (@KalshiNewsroom) January 3, 2026



Polymarket, on the other hand, operates as a decentralized platform. While it has exploded in popularity, often serving as a more accurate barometer of political outcomes than traditional polling, its decentralized nature makes enforcement difficult. Users can often trade with significant anonymity, making it a preferred venue for those who might want to stay off the regulatory radar.

The timing of the legislation is particularly sensitive given Donald Trump Jr.'s high-profile advisory roles at both Kalshi and Polymarket following significant venture investments from his firm in 2025.

The 2026 Act signals a shift in how Washington views political wagering. Lawmakers now treat bets on political outcomes with the same gravity as commodity investments.

Whether the trader in question was a lucky speculator or a government employee with a tip remains a mystery. However, the $400,000 profit has provided Representative Torres with all the political capital he needs to push for tighter restrictions. As prediction markets continue to influence the public narrative, the U.S. government is making it clear: the era of the “unregulated insider” is coming to an end.

 By NFTPlazas Editorial Team

The big presale crypto market is becoming more selective as buyers focus less on promises and more on proof of participation. Instead of betting on roadmaps alone, attention is shifting toward presales that show live activity, transparent token distribution, and visible growing demand. This change has pushed a few names into focus as buyers rush to secure early positions before conditions tighten.

What stands out across today's big presale crypto projects is urgency. Live presale auctions, rising participation, and parallel demand for infrastructure are reshaping how early exposure is evaluated. Below are the four leading presale cryptos, including Zero Knowledge Proof, IPO Genie, Digitap, and Best Wallet, which are currently drawing strong interest, each for different reasons.

Zero Knowledge Proof sits at the high position of the leading presale crypto list because it's fully live and actively reshaping buyer behavior. Instead of a static sale with fixed pricing, ZKP runs a daily presale auction that refreshes every 24 hours. Each window resets allocation and pricing based on demand, which has created visible urgency as missed days cannot be reclaimed.

Participation has been accelerating as buyers rush to secure positions before the daily supply tightens. This pressure is not coming from a single source. Contributors are entering consistently across presale auction windows, signaling sustained interest rather than short-term spikes. That flow has turned the presale auction into a live signal of demand.

What amplifies this urgency is that buyers are not limiting themselves to token exposure. Proof Pods are being purchased alongside auction participation. These devices allow users to operate inside the network by running verifiable compute and earning ZKP through real workload contribution. This dual demand shows that participants are positioning for both ownership and activity.



Momentum strengthened further after confirmation that the first Proof Pod has already been delivered to Australia. That milestone reinforced confidence that infrastructure is already moving into deployment while the presale auction is still open. For many buyers, that combination is what places Zero Knowledge Proof at the top of the leading presale crypto discussion right now.

IPO Genie has carved out a different lane within the big presale crypto space by focusing on tokenized access to private and pre-IPO investments. This is a segment traditionally reserved for institutions, and IPO Genie positions itself as a structured gateway rather than a speculative play.

Its presale follows a tiered pricing model that reflects gradual expansion rather than sharp jumps. From Stage 1 at $0.0001000 to Stage 24 at $0.00010830, growth has remained controlled, reinforcing the project's long-term framing. Utility is centered on governance participation, staking rewards, and direct deal access, which supports holding rather than fast exits.



For buyers comparing the popular presale crypto options, IPO Genie stands out for combining private market access with mainstream visibility while still in its presale phase.

Digitap approaches the big presale crypto conversation from a utility-first angle. The project is designed to integrate crypto wallets with traditional banking infrastructure via a phased deployment strategy and growing fiat on-ramp partnerships.

Payment and banking infrastructure projects tend to follow steadier adoption curves, which has attracted attention from buyers seeking measured growth rather than sharp volatility. Digitap's roadmap emphasizes integration over experimentation, aligning with broader fintech trends rather than short-term narratives.

As regulatory clarity improves across regions, crypto-fiat bridges continue to draw long-term interest. Digitap benefits from this backdrop by positioning itself as a functional layer rather than a speculative token. This framing places it among analyst-watched presales where progress is expected to compound over time.

For participants scanning the big presale crypto market for practical exposure, Digitap offers a quieter but structured alternative centered on real-world usage.

Best Wallet rounds out the list by focusing on access rather than assets alone. The project operates as a multi-chain mobile wallet designed to surface upcoming presales directly inside the user experience.

Wallet platforms have historically scaled in parallel with ecosystem growth, particularly during early access phases. Best Wallet ties its utility directly to onboarding users into presales and early token opportunities, making discovery part of the product rather than an external process.

The focus on simplicity and visibility supports sustained engagement rather than short-term trading behavior. Instead of chasing individual launches, users are positioned to remain connected to the presale pipeline itself.



Within the popular presale crypto space, Best Wallet stands out as an infrastructure play that benefits from continued presale activity across the market rather than dependence on a single token narrative.

The leading presale crypto is the one that shows live participation, clear structure, and visible demand while access is still open. Zero Knowledge Proof leads on that front with a live presale auction and rising Proof Pod purchases, creating urgency that builds day by day. 

Other presale cryptos also bring unique opportunities, but they aren't as exciting as what ZKP offers. IPO Genie brings institutional-style access and real-world exposure, Digitap focuses on steady crypto-fiat infrastructure, and Best Wallet simplifies presale discovery at the wallet level.



Together, these projects show how crypto presales are shifting away from static fundraising toward active ecosystems where timing, structure, and participation shape early opportunity.

The retail digital yuan is no longer a central bank digital currency. China's version 2.0 upgrade, launched 1 January 2026, has transformed it into a commercial bank deposit solution where retail balances become liabilities of the holding institution – whether a bank or non-bank payment provider. Banks can now use these deposits for fractional reserve banking with balances covered by deposit insurance, while non-bank providers must hold full reserves. The fundamental pivot, positions the approach as a more financially stable alternative to stablecoins.

The major state-owned banks and others have issued announcements stating they now pay interest on digital RMB deposits at the same rate as existing demand deposits. In the case of many banks that rate is just 0.05%.

In an article published in the Financial News, the deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, Lu Lei, outlined that this approach addresses the risks of stablecoins. That's partly because stablecoins could result in outflows from banks, but also because it avoids the volatility in the valuation of stablecoin backing assets (such as Treasury bonds) and supports full integration with current systems. Ledger Insights anticipated this direction following remarks by Mu Changchun the leader of the Digital Currency Research Institute at the People's Bank of China in September 2025, though the latest announcement provides the first official confirmation of the transformation.

However, it's not clear whether the project will win the backing of a majority of the European Parliament, the Financial Times (FT) reported Monday (Jan. 5), with one official telling the news outlet that the vote “could really go down to the wire.”

To convince the plan's skeptics, the European Central Bank (ECB) has launched a public relations campaign in hopes of issuing its first central bank digital currency (CBDC) in 2029 after a pilot next year, the FT said.

According to the report, left-leaning members of the European parliament support the plan but are more than 40 votes short of clinching an absolute majority. The far right opposes it and views are divided within other parties, the FT added.

“Building a majority will prove difficult,” German EPP MEP Markus Ferber, who is skeptical about the ECB's plans, told the FT, adding that “positions differ widely.”

The report notes that Fernando Navarrete, a Spanish minister appointed by parliament to assess the digital euro, has argued for a scaled-down version of the coin used solely for offline use for person-to-person payments.

Ferber supported that view, arguing that offline payments are the only ones where existing private sector solutions had “genuine gaps” — like digital payments availability in situations where there is no electricity or internet access.

“A digital euro only makes sense if it offers clear and comprehensible added value for citizens and businesses,” said Ferber, adding that “it must not become a political prestige project.”

He cautioned that “it is by no means a given that there is clear demand” for an ECB-backed plan for online payments.

The digital euro has received some pushback from European banks that argue a CBDC could subvert private sector payment systems.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve has studied the idea of a CBDC but has made no commitments to develop or test a retail version of the coin, PYMNTS wrote last year.

“Fed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently said that such a move would need clear support from the executive branch as well as authorization from Congress,” the report said. “That position may be politically prudent, but it also reflects a gridlock… Still, the political momentum favors stablecoins, not central banks. A U.S. CBDC would represent a public alternative to the privately-issued stablecoin solutions promoted by the crypto industry.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","China expands yuan CBDC cross-border with Laos pilot","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-yuan-cbdc-cross-border-laos-pilot/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 17:00:00 GMT","

China's digital currency program has completed its first cross-border consumer payment using the digital yuan in Laos. 

China is attempting to spread the use of its digital yuan through fast and easy consumer transactions. 

In late December 2025, through the joint efforts of the People's Bank of China and the Bank of Laos, the Bank of China's Vientiane branch connected to the PBOC's cross-border digital payment platform and processed merchant QR payments in Laos. 

The system works through QR code scanning technology. Chinese tourists can make payments in Laos without exchanging foreign currency by opening the digital RMB app and scanning the merchant's QR code to pay directly in local currency at the real-time exchange rate. The merchants do not need to change their existing payment equipment for this to work. 

The digital yuan has been tested domestically since 2019, but this Laos pilot is its first international retail deployment.

Starting January 1, 2026, banks will be permitted to pay interest on customers' digital yuan deposits under the new regulatory framework. Lu Lei, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, said that the system will transform the digital yuan's role from digital cash to digital deposit money.

The digital yuan will also now receive the same protections as conventional bank deposits through the national deposit insurance system. 

By November 2025, the digital yuan had processed 3.48 billion transactions with a total value of 16.7 trillion yuan (approximately $2.38 trillion). The system currently supports 230 million personal wallets and 18.84 million corporate wallets. 

However, adoption has been slow compared to established payment platforms in China like WeChat Pay and Alipay. 

China operates a multilateral central bank digital currency bridge, known as mBridge. The platform processed 4,047 cross-border transactions worth 387.2 billion yuan ($54.2 billion), and digital yuan transactions accounted for approximately 95.3% of total mBridge activity. 

The mBridge system includes China, Hong Kong, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. The project uses distributed ledger technology to enable real-time payments between countries without traditional banking intermediaries.

In October 2024, the Bank for International Settlements withdrew from the mBridge project due to concerns that the platform might help people avoid sanctions and harm the dollar's global role. The participating countries continued developing the system without BIS involvement.

The People's Bank of China released a comprehensive action plan in late December 2025 that covers the 2026-2030 period. The plan includes the PBOC establishing a Digital RMB Management Committee and operating dual centers for domestic and cross-border systems. It will also work to emphasize security, continuity, and coordinated oversight as priorities.

Published: January 05, 2026 at 5:00AM EST

Stablecoins have become increasingly popular over the years, drawing the attention of the federal government to regulate them in Canada.

Cryptocurrency groups called on the government to simplify the rules to make it easier to launch Canadian dollar-linked stablecoins in the New Year.

Proposed stablecoin rules, expected in the Spring 2026 session, will introduce asset management requirements intended to bolster domestic financial sovereignty and counter foreign digital currency influence.

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency token built on a blockchain network, designed to maintain a steady value redeemable for a pegged flat currency, such as a Canadian or American dollar, on a 1:1 basis. The backing of a dollar ensures their stable value. 

Ottawa said it aims to foster a domestic, Canadian dollar-backed stablecoin ecosystem to counter the import of foreign currencies. 

“It really is designed to be the equivalent of holding cash at the end of the day, just digitally, on a blockchain, on the computer,” Adam Garetson, partner of blockchain and fintech at Gowling WLG told BNN Bloomberg. 

Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin, stablecoins are centralized, issued and managed by companies or issuers like Tether and Circle and designed for everyday transactions. 

Stablecoins bridge the gap between traditional and digital finance. They act as primary on-ramps and off-ramps for the crypto ecosystem, according to a report from Mastercard.

International transfers can be settled within minutes at minimal costs, 24/7, offering an efficient alternative to slow, expensive traditional wire transfers, according to TD Economics.

Mastercard said efficiency and accessibility promote financial inclusion for the world's unbanked populations, requiring only an internet connection and a digital wallet to access global financial services.

The Bank of Canada and cryptocurrency industry groups say the main concern for Ottawa is the potential impact on Canadian monetary sovereignty and financial stability, particularly as financial markets see an increase of U.S. backed digital currencies. 

“Large firms like Shopify moved quickly to accept USDC,” Vass Bednar, managing director of the Canadian SHIELD Institute for Public Policy told BNN Bloomberg in an interview. “When our most valuable company is transacting through stablecoin, the policy environment here needs to recognize that innovation.”

The cryptocurrency groups warn if U.S. backed stablecoins become common in Canadian transactions, Canada could lose influence over it's own currency and monetary policy.

A significant driver for the push of Canadian backed stablecoins is international development and corporate action, Bednar said. The U.S. introduced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, a law designed to enforce the use and support of the U.S. dollar as a stablecoin.

“I think the biggest prompt to our expedited policy response was the general threat to monetary sovereignty through the GENIUS Act,” said Bednar.

Budget 2025 will bring legislation to establish rules for stablecoin issuers with Bill C-15. The rules will require genuine support of the digital assets and deal with issues of risk management, information privacy and national security. 

“The Stablecoin Act governs issuers,” said Gareston. “It governs the issuance, creation and redemption of stable coins. So effectively an investor could go to an issuer, an actual creator of the stablecoin, and give them cash for stable coins.”

An investor could then use the currency on digital financial markets such as Kraken or Coinbase and trade on the market. Issuers of the coin, however, cannot generate interest on supported dollars.

Garetson helps public and private businesses navigate a complex legal and commercial environment around finance and tech sectors. He does not have a timeline for when the act will be enforced but advises businesses to begin preparing now by aligning with governance, compliance and operational systems.

Bednar meanwhile expects it will pass early next year as opposing parties back it.

“It is anticipated that the Conservative party is supportive of this legislation, meaning it could be passed in the Spring 2026 session,” said Bednar.

The draft law includes a strict ban on issuers paying interest or yield on stablecoins. Further, federal, provincial securities laws still apply.

“Canadians expect regulatory environments to reflect and anticipate the realities of today, and not be in constant catch-up mode,” said Bednar. “Trump's GENIUS Act was the kick in the pants we needed.”

The Act mandates stablecoin issuers use qualified custodians to hold reserves, ensuring assets are backed, separate from the issuer's own funds, and protected from bankruptcy. Custodians are typically regulated financial institutions that safeguard reserve assets reporting to the central bank or regulator. Bednar wonders who can qualify as a custodian.

“Legislation is silent about who can act as a qualified custodian, and where, geographically, reserve assets must be held,” said Bednar.

The retail digital yuan is no longer a central bank digital currency. China's version 2.0 upgrade, launched 1 January 2026, has transformed it into a commercial bank deposit solution where retail balances become liabilities of the holding institution – whether a bank or non-bank payment provider. Banks can now use these deposits for fractional reserve banking with balances covered by deposit insurance, while non-bank providers must hold full reserves. The fundamental pivot, positions the approach as a more financially stable alternative to stablecoins.

The major state-owned banks and others have issued announcements stating they now pay interest on digital RMB deposits at the same rate as existing demand deposits. In the case of many banks that rate is just 0.05%.

In an article published in the Financial News, the deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, Lu Lei, outlined that this approach addresses the risks of stablecoins. That's partly because stablecoins could result in outflows from banks, but also because it avoids the volatility in the valuation of stablecoin backing assets (such as Treasury bonds) and supports full integration with current systems. Ledger Insights anticipated this direction following remarks by Mu Changchun the leader of the Digital Currency Research Institute at the People's Bank of China in September 2025, though the latest announcement provides the first official confirmation of the transformation.

However, it's not clear whether the project will win the backing of a majority of the European Parliament, the Financial Times (FT) reported Monday (Jan. 5), with one official telling the news outlet that the vote “could really go down to the wire.”

To convince the plan's skeptics, the European Central Bank (ECB) has launched a public relations campaign in hopes of issuing its first central bank digital currency (CBDC) in 2029 after a pilot next year, the FT said.

According to the report, left-leaning members of the European parliament support the plan but are more than 40 votes short of clinching an absolute majority. The far right opposes it and views are divided within other parties, the FT added.

“Building a majority will prove difficult,” German EPP MEP Markus Ferber, who is skeptical about the ECB's plans, told the FT, adding that “positions differ widely.”

The report notes that Fernando Navarrete, a Spanish minister appointed by parliament to assess the digital euro, has argued for a scaled-down version of the coin used solely for offline use for person-to-person payments.

Ferber supported that view, arguing that offline payments are the only ones where existing private sector solutions had “genuine gaps” — like digital payments availability in situations where there is no electricity or internet access.

“A digital euro only makes sense if it offers clear and comprehensible added value for citizens and businesses,” said Ferber, adding that “it must not become a political prestige project.”

Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the company moves towards unveiling its commercial MAVAN (Made in America VAlidator Network) in 2026. ""At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking fee is $374 million annual (using 2.81% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day,"" stated Tom Lee.

""We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN). This will be the 'best-in-class' solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026,"" continued Lee.

Bitmine crypto holding reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (MSTR), which owns 672,497 BTC valued at $61 billion. Bitmine remains the largest ETH treasury in the world. 

Bitmine is now one of the most widely traded stocks in the US.

The Bitcoin network hashrate, a metric measuring mining competition, declined for a second consecutive month in December, according to a report released by Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) on Monday.

""The monthly average network hashrate, a proxy for industry competition, declined 30 EH/s (-3%) m/m to an average of 1,045 EH/s in December,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.

The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is measured in exahashes per second.

Despite the lower competition for the miners, mining profitability also fell. The analysts estimated that miners earned an average of $38,700 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue last month, ""down 7% from November and 32% y/y, representing the lowest level on record."" Daily block reward gross profit also declined last month, dropping 9% to $17,100 per EH/s, the report said.

While the bank didn't go into detail about why mining profitability is falling, lower bitcoin prices since October have likely added to the margin squeeze for miners who are already feeling the pain from the most recent halving and higher energy prices.

Although it's not all doom-and-gloom. The combined market cap of the 14 U.S.-listed bitcoin miners and data center operators that the bank tracks rose to $48 billion by the end of 2025, up 73% for the year. Hut 8 (HUT) was the best performer of the group last month with a 2% gain, while CleanSpark (CLSK) underperformed with a 33% decline.

While only two of the companies outperformed bitcoin in December, 9 of the 14 beat the largest cryptocurrency over the course of the year, led by IREN (IREN) and Cipher Mining (CIFR), the report added.

In 2020, Ledger experienced a data breach that exposed information of 270,000 customers through e-commerce partner Shopify. In 2023, Ledger was hacked for nearly $500,000, affecting several decentralized finance applications. 

Global-e said it detected unusual activity and swiftly implemented controls while launching an investigation, which verified the improper access. 

""We retained independent forensic experts to conduct an investigation into the incident and we were able to determine that some personal data including name and contact information were improperly accessed,"" it said in the email.

Ledger's social media channels show no active incidents, urging vigilance yet.

In an email response to CoinDesk, Ledger emphasized that the breach occurred at Global-e, adding that the payment processor sent the email notification to customers because it is the data controller. 

""Ledger was made aware of an incident at Global-e, an e-commerce partner for global brands and retailers, including Ledger,"" the company told CoinDesk. ""This incident consisted of unauthorized access to order data in Global-e information systems. Some of the data accessed as part of this incident pertained to customers who made a purchase on Ledger.com using Global-e as a Merchant of Record. 

""This was not a breach of Ledger's platform, hardware or software systems, which remain secure. For the avoidance of doubt, as the Ledger product is self-custodial, Global-e does not have access to your 24 words, blockchain balance, or any secrets related to digital assets,"" it said. 

Ledger explained that clients' payment information wasn't involved in the breach and it is working with Global-e to reach out to affected users with relevant information. It added that Ledger wasn't the only brand affected – an unauthorized party also accessed a Global-e cloud system holding shopper order data from multiple other brands.

""We remain united with the industry at war against hackers and bad actors who are tirelessly trying to steal users' information in the ecosystem and e-commerce space at large,"" Ledger said. 

CORRECT (Jan. 5, 12:47 UTC): Changes email sender to Global-e, an earlier version of the story said it had been sent by Ledger. Adds Ledger confirmation, comment.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the network is approaching a turning point as two major upgrades, PeerDAS and zkEVMs, move from research to working code.

In a post on X, Buterin argued that the combination could shift Ethereum into “a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” because it targets the core tradeoff that has historically limited blockchains where a system can be decentralized and have consensus, but bandwidth and throughput stay low.

He framed the problem through two internet-era models. Systems like BitTorrent can move enormous amounts of data in a decentralized way, but they do not need consensus. Bitcoin has strong decentralization and consensus, but it stays low-bandwidth because every node effectively re-checks the same work instead of dividing it up. 

Ethereum's next phase, he said, is about getting all three at once.

The first leg is already live. PeerDAS (data availability sampling) is now on Ethereum mainnet, letting nodes verify that data is available without downloading the full dataset.

PeerDAS is a prototype for Data Availability Sampling (DAS), which is essential for Ethereum's scaling via sharding. It allows light clients to check if all shard data has been published by sampling small portions, greatly enhancing scalability while maintaining decentralization and security.

The second leg, zkEVMs, is now “production-quality on performance,” Buterin said, meaning the remaining work is safety and proving robustness at scale.

Buterin described this as a practical step toward solving the so-called “blockchain trilemma,” not as a theory, but through “live running code,"" adding that zkEVM nodes could start appearing in limited form in 2026.

A longer-term goal is “distributed block building,” Buterin added, where no single party assembles the full block in one place, reducing censorship risks and improving geographic fairness.

The message is that Ethereum's scaling roadmap is increasingly about splitting verification work across the network, rather than asking every node to replicate everything.

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

Happy New Year, readers! Crypto's kicking off 2026 with good vibes: Bitcoin BTC$92,457.12 is buoyant near $92,700, up 1.3% in 24 hours and 5% in the first five days of the year.

Major altcoins like XRP, SOL, BNB, and ETH have risen 1%-3% over the past 24 hours, with XRP up 2.49%, SOL up 1.27%, BNB up 0.54%, and ETH up 0.99%. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) rose 1.25%, reflecting strength in the biggest, most active assets, while the CoinDesk 80 Index (CD80) shed early gains, signaling relative weakness in the broader altcoin market.

Analysts cited safe-haven demand following the U.S. action in Venezuela and exhaustion in tax-related selling as key catalysts for bitcoin's price rise.

Data from Deribit shows renewed trader demand for bullish option bets, predominantly the $100,000 strike call.

""We noticed ETF inflows on January 2nd after consecutive outflows during December and 3000x lots of Jan-end BTC calls going through on the last day of December,"" Laser Digital told CoinDesk in an email.

Over the weekend, the U.S. attacked Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro. Since then, crypto social media has lit up with speculation that Venezuela may be controlling a substantial shadow BTC reserve, possible as large as that of bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR), which holds BTC worth over $62 billion. These claims remain unverified.

If true, however, the U.S. might seize those coins and add them to its strategic BTC reserve. 

""The prospect of the U.S. adding any seized BTC to its own strategic reserve reduces the likelihood of forced selling and underscores BTC's rising strategic importance as nations compete to accumulate,"" QCP Capital said in a market note Monday.

The other trending narrative is that President Donald Trump could soon tap into Venezuela's 300 billion barrels of oil reserves, boosting supply. This, in turn, could crash oil prices, allowing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates more rapidly.

However, having reserves and producing them in the first place are two different things. Several analysts said Venezuelan crude from the Orinoco Belt is heavy, impure sour crude, making it difficult and expensive to extract and refine, which requires huge investments.

This means the reserves may not start flowing in the near future, limiting their impact on oil prices. In other words, the disinflationary impulse anticipated by BTC bulls may not materialize anytime soon.

In other key news, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the network has effectively solved the blockchain scalability trilemma, balancing decentralization, security and high transaction speed, with the help of key upgrades like zkEVMs and PeerDAS.

In traditional markets, the dollar index rose for the fourth straight trading day, rising above 98.50. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 traded higher. In the macroeconomy, we have a flurry of key U.S. data releases this week, starting with the ISM Manufacturing PMI later today, followed by the non-manufacturing PMI, the ADP Employment report, and nonfarm payrolls data in the days ahead.

Want to Make Your Resolution Stick This Year? Behavioral Science Has the Answers

Behavioral economist Katy Milkman explains why most New Year's resolutions fail and shares how science-backed strategies can build habits that last.

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Sushmita Pathak & Fonda Mwangi

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

Hello and happy new year! I love the first few days of a new year. It evokes a feeling that change is possible. That feeling, in part, leads some of us to set New Year's resolutions.

An estimated 40 percent of U.S. adults set resolutions any given year. We promise ourselves that we'll save money, exercise regularly or spend more time with friends and family.

And yet, for many of us, as that feeling of newness fades so, too, do our resolutions. Some research suggests that as many as 88 percent of Americans give up on their resolutions within two weeks.

But it doesn't have to be that way, according to Katy Milkman, a behavioral economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. She's the author of How to Change: The Science of Getting from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be.

Katy says there are science-supported tools we can use to spark positive changes in our lives. Doing so involves not only asking high-level questions about what we want to achieve and why but also finding ways to make the path toward achieving those goals, well, fun.

Here's our conversation.

Pierre-Louis: In your book you talk about how moments like a new year, even a move, you talk about them as fresh starts, and can you talk a little bit about what a fresh start is, and how they can be useful in changing our behaviors and even, also, their limitations?

Katy Milkman: Yeah, absolutely. The “fresh start effect” is one of my favorite topics I've ever studied. It's work I did with Hengchen Dai of [the University of California, Los Angeles,] and Jason Riis, a former colleague here at Wharton.

We got really interested in this after I visited Google in, I think, it was 2012, and learned that they were struggling to motivate their employees to take advantage of lots of wonderful benefits. And they had brought in a bunch of outside speakers to share insights about what could be done to sort of nudge people towards making positive change; I was one of them. And after I presented some research I got this great question from a member of the audience about whether there are moments when people are more open to making a change in their life, and that's what kick-started this research agenda. The immediate response was, “I don't know. The research really hasn't looked at whether or not our motivation varies over time.” But my collaborators and I all immediately had a very strong intuition—and that's what drove us to work on this question—that there are moments that bring us added motivation; the first one, of course, that comes to mind is New Year's. But what we did is we started digging into the literature on the way that people think about their lives and what's sort of driving this effect.

We learned there's a whole literature on what's called “autobiographical memory” and that the way we think about time is not linear. Instead, we actually think about our lives like we're characters in a novel and there are chapter breaks in that storyline, if you will. So you might have, you know, the years living in a certain city, the years attending college, the years working for a certain employer. Those are chapters in your life story in the way that you tell it and think about it. And instead of thinking about every day being equally weighted, those chapter breaks are really momentous.

When we cross into a new chapter, we feel a sense of a discontinuity and a new beginning, and we feel disconnected from who we were in the prior chapter. We can say, “Oh, that was the old me, and the old me didn't do XYZ that I wanted to do, but the new me will be different.” It gives us optimism about what we're capable of, and also, with that sense of possibility, we often become more reflective at these chapter breaks and do big picture thinking.

So what was really interesting in our work, though, is these chapter breaks don't just come at major life shifts. We found that they come at lots of moments that signal miniature new beginnings—so the start of every new year being kind of a miniature new beginning, right? It's not a major chapter break in your life story ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Milkman: Like moving to a new community or taking a new job, but it's a minor one, and it comes with a bunch of, also, social pressure to make change because everyone starts talking about New Year's resolutions—about 40 percent of Americans make them.

We also found that there are other moments on the calendar like New Year's that haven't been as widely discussed that have the same effect to a smaller degree, so every Monday is a miniature fresh start ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Milkman: The start of a new month, celebrating birthdays and other holidays that we associate with new beginnings, so that might be Easter or Rosh Hashanah, Eid—so each religion has its own marker of new beginnings. And all those dates tend to spur positive behavior change. In our research we've looked at when people show up and attend the gym; when people search for the term “diet” on Google, which is the most popular New Year's resolution, for better or for worse; and also, we see it when we look at when people set goals on a popular goal-setting website online about everything from their health to their finances and the environment.

Pierre-Louis: So one of the studies that you reference in your book about baseball players who get traded is that fresh starts aren't always positive, right? Can we talk a little bit about that?

Milkman: Yeah, so Hengchen did a number of experiments and also analyzed data on Major League Baseball players. What she was interested in is the fact that trades in Major League Baseball have different implications for your performance statistics depending on whether you're traded across leagues or within leagues. So if you're traded across leagues, all of your season-to-date statistics reset because you're in a new league and it's sort of a different playing field, if you will. But if you're traded within league, all of your season-to-date statistics are retained, and you just keep working on that baseline.

She was interested in these two people who essentially are experiencing the same thing—they're both moving to a new city; they're both working with new teammates—but one of them has a much bigger fresh start than the other. They have a performance reset. Is there a difference in how that affects them? And what she found was that there are differences in a really interesting pattern: If you've been having a good season and you have a performance reset, it's harmful.

So two people, both get traded, both have been performing really well, but one of them has to deal with the fact that they're starting their season over in terms of their statistics, that person's harmed more than the person who gets to hold on to their record. On the flip side, though, for two players who were both underperforming season to date and they both get traded—one of them gets to hold on to their record, and the other doesn't—the clean slate is beneficial and improves the performance of the person who gets that clean slate when they've been having a tough season.

So this is sort of the double-edged sword of a fresh start in a very nice field study, showing that when things are going well, these kinds of fresh starts and disruptions can be harmful.

Pierre-Louis: And it felt like, to me, that kind of underpinning it is a question of, like, “What happens to our habits?” And when we're trying to make a big change, in many ways, what we're trying to do is change our habits, right? Like, if you want to get in shape, you don't get in shape overnight; that's, like, days and days and days of repetitive behavior. And so I think that's the thing most people struggle with, is: “How do we develop and maintain these consistent habits, and when we get disrupted how do we get back to it?” Can you talk about some tips and techniques that people can use?

Milkman: I think one of the most important things is to plan for the disruption. If you're going away for the holidays and you're in a routine that's working for you, whether it's around meditation or exercise or, you know, practicing Spanish on Duolingo, if you're like me, whatever it is, when you're away it breaks those routines; it breaks those cycles. It's no longer going to be automatic to engage in the same sets of routines when you come back, and so you need to be deliberate about planning: “Okay, when I get back how am I going to start up this habit that I had built again? How am I gonna make sure it's worked into my schedule?” That can be through making explicit plans—this is boring but important—like, you know, when are you gonna do it? Where are you gonna do it? Put it on your calendar. Set a reminder for yourself.

And it can also be by being deliberate about using some of the other tools we know help a lot with habit formation, like ensuring it's rewarding and that you have a fun way to get it done. So maybe that's finding ways to combine something that you feel is a chore with something that you really enjoy. So exercise, the example is, like, you know, “I only let myself binge-watch my favorite TV shows while I'm exercising.” Maybe you only get to listen to your favorite podcast or open your favorite bottle of wine when you're cooking a fresh meal for your family, and you set that as a rule when you wanna get back on that habit.

Maybe it's accountability that you need. Maybe it's somebody who you're going to exercise with, right? And in fact, research shows that when you have a workout buddy, that can boost your likelihood to follow through by both making it fun and ensuring you're accountable to someone. Or you could have a commitment device—you can put money on the line that you'll have to forfeit if you fail to follow through. But basically, you need to use these tools that we know help us start healthy habits to a greater degree after a disruption.

Pierre-Louis: I know in the book you talk about the “Mary Poppins effect,” the idea of “spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down”—pairing something really lovely, like your favorite TV show, with exercise, for example. But something that kind of struck me when I was reading that portion of the book is: sometimes it feels like people are setting goals for themselves that they, like, want to want to set; they don't necessarily actually want it.

So they want to be healthier, so they want to exercise, right? But in their head, because of the way we talk about exercise in society, it becomes very prescriptive, so they're like, “I should run a marathon because that's what fit people do.”

Milkman: Mm-hmm.

Pierre-Louis: But they hate running, and maybe instead of focusing on running, they should actually be ice-skating because they've always wanted to ice skate as a kid, and they couldn't afford to, maybe, and now they can.

But it also seems like sometimes, especially with New Year's resolutions, we kind of lose a forest for the trees, where we're focusing on a specific form of exercise or a specific type of diet and not sort of a bigger picture of, like, what healthy eating looks like or what exercise can look like and finding the joy in things we naturally want to do.

Milkman: I love that takeaway from the book and 100 percent agree with you that one of the things we can do is just step back and think big picture about whether we're setting the right goals and what the higher-level goal is and if there's another path to the higher-level goal that's more likely to work, so if your high-level goal is “be in shape this year,” and you've chosen to pursue it in an unpleasant way that you don't like, then step back and ask, “Can I do something that I will enjoy more to get to the same outcome?” Because one of the best predictors of success is whether you enjoy the process of pursuing your goals. If you find it miserable, you do not persist.

So yes, ice-skate rather than running a marathon [Laughs] if that will bring you joy. Any way you move your body is good for you, whether it's going to dance class with a friend, taking a walk in the morning in the fresh air with a cup of coffee and someone you enjoy talking to—you know, making it social is another really important way to improve how much we enjoy goal pursuit, and the same is true for eating right and, and, frankly, achieving goals at work.

Pierre-Louis: One of the things that I thought was really interesting is that, like, we talk about making things enjoyable, but you also talk about self-imposed constraints and how sometimes, to execute on a goal that we want, we can choose to opt in to constraints to reach that goal. Can you talk a little bit about that?

Milkman: Yeah, I think this is some of the most counterintuitive but powerful research in behavioral science and goal pursuit. The idea is really, you know, we know how useful it is when we have a great boss or a great teacher or a great parent who is, you know, holding our feet to the fire and saying, like, “These are the deadlines. These are the consequences.” That can be really effective for getting us motivated in getting things done. But what we often, I think, fail to appreciate is that we have the power to be our own boss [Laughs], our own teacher or our own parent and create constraints and deadlines with consequences in a way that will motivate us and help us achieve more.

So let me give you a really concrete example of a study that I think illustrates just how powerful this way of thinking can be. This is a study that was done by Dean Karlan of Northwestern University and collaborators where they were looking at whether they could help people quit smoking ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Milkman: So, like, a really tough goal, right?

Pierre-Louis: Yeah.

Milkman: There's even addiction involved here. The tool was: randomly assign people to either get a standard smoking-cessation program or that standard program plus what we call a commitment device. A commitment device, in this case, meant a savings account that you could put your own money into—it's optional—but you learn that if you fail a nicotine or cotinine test in your urine six months later, all the money will be taken away. That savings account will disappear. So you're basically given an opportunity to fine yourself for continuing to smoke. And what the researchers found is: those who had access to this account, they quit at a 30 percent higher rate than the standard group.

So finding a way to be able to hold your feet to the fire by penalizing yourself if you don't succeed can be really powerful. And there are many ways you can do this. You can do this with friends. You can ask them to insist that you pay them [Laughs] or put money towards a charitable cause if you fail to achieve a certain goal. There are actually websites that I have no affiliation with that will let you do this—Beeminder is one; Stickk.com with two k's is another—where you can put money on the line that you will have to forfeit if you fail to achieve a goal.

And they can also be as simple as just creating friction in your life, so it doesn't have to involve money. You can think of, you know, not having any junk food in your house—you clear out all your cabinets. That's a commitment device because now you've created a constraint: you're gonna have to leave your house or pay delivery fees to get the junk food you crave. So there's a lot of different tools we can use that fall into this category of creating constraints for ourselves, behaving like our own boss, in order to set ourselves up for success with our goals.

Pierre-Louis: One of the things I really appreciated in your book is when you talked about how people will often harp on the fact that [more than] 80 percent of people who set New Year's resolutions fail, but that means 20 percent succeeded, right?

Milkman: Look, it's brave to try to make a change. The easy thing to do is do nothing. And so I think it's great anytime someone wants to find a way to improve—just because New Year's is sort of a gimmicky moment to leap on the bandwagon doesn't mean it's not a great moment to make a change. And you can give yourself a better probability of success, though, if you do more than just saying, “I'm gonna try to be healthy this year,” “I'm gonna try to raise my performance at work,” or “I'm gonna try to improve my relationships with my family.”

Be more concrete. Be thinking about: What's a measurable goal that you wanna achieve? How are you gonna do it? You know, map out your strategy, just the way you would if you had a big project assigned to you at work. Use the science that we've talked about in the show to give yourself a better chance of success.

And then, P.S., if it doesn't work out this time, that doesn't mean New Year's resolutions are a bad idea next time. And P.S., you can make a new resolution next Monday, the beginning of the next week, on your birthday or on any arbitrary day because all of this is in our head about fresh starts anyhow. [Laugh.] So give yourself some grace and try your best, and then if it doesn't work out, try again the next time.

Milkman: Yeah, thank you so much for having me.

The mirror spider can rapidly shift a patchwork of minuscule reflective plates underneath its abdomen's outer surface, altering the pattern of mirrorlike flashes. This uncommon display comes from common building blocks: Similar tilelike arrangements of plates and soft joints appear throughout the tree of life, from turtle shells to tropical fruit peels. Researchers have now compiled 100 examples of this pattern across animals, plants, microbes and viruses, which they describe in PNAS Nexus.

Study co-author Mason Dean, a biologist at City University of Hong Kong, first noted a regular tiled pattern in micro computed tomography scans of a ray skeleton. He was surprised to find that what looked like pixelated graininess was actually a mosaic of tiny hexagons and pentagons packed edge to edge across the cartilage. Humboldt University of Berlin zoologist Jana Ciecierska-Holmes, also a co-author, began looking for tile examples and was similarly surprised to spot intricate interlocking plates on the outer coating of millet seeds. They and their colleagues set out to determine just how widespread such tiling patterns were.

The researchers focused on true tessellations, in which geometric tiles are discrete structural pieces separated by softer seams, rather than purely visual or hollow patterns such as animal coloration or honeycombs. To compare such systems across very different organisms, they created a framework describing what different natural tiles are made of, how they're shaped, how they connect and what they do. The results reveal structural parallels across many organisms without any shared ancestry.

Chitons evolved articulated shell plates, whereas sharks developed tessellated cartilage—two tiled structures that arose independently in distant evolutionary lineages, the researchers found—and microscopic amoebae build architecturally similar protective casings from scavenged mineral tiles. Other variants tile the lenses of insect eyes and form corky plate patterns in the elephant's foot plant. Across kingdoms, the same basic layout helps animals see, move and protect their bodies.

The recurrence reflects how geometry and growth push organisms toward the same solutions. Predominantly six-sided patterns such as those on sharks and rays are a classic way to efficiently cover curved surfaces, for instance. Dean also notes that tile borders often align with regions where new cells are added during growth, allowing tissues to function as they expand. Plus, pairing hard tiles and softer seams balances stiffness and flexibility, adds Kiel University zoologist Stanislav Gorb, who was not involved in the study. “Too rigid a structure is good for resisting forces but poor for generating motion.”

The authors hope their online catalog becomes a living resource to help people recognize these patterns in the organisms and structures they study. “Once you start paying attention to that, you see it everywhere,” Dean says. Ciecierska-Holmes agrees: “You kind of go into the tessellation world.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This CRISPR breakthrough turns genes on without cutting DNA","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260104202813.htm","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:14:33 GMT","

Scientists at UNSW Sydney have developed a new form of CRISPR technology that could make gene therapy safer while also resolving a decades-long debate about how genes are switched off. The research shows that small chemical markers attached to DNA actively silence genes, rather than simply appearing as harmless byproducts in inactive regions of the genome.

For years, researchers have questioned whether methyl groups, tiny chemical clusters that collect on DNA, merely show up where genes are already turned off or whether they are the direct cause of gene suppression.

In a study published recently in Nature Communications, researchers from UNSW, working with colleagues at the St Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis), demonstrated that removing these chemical tags causes genes to become active again. When the tags were added back, the genes shut down once more. The results confirm that DNA methylation directly controls gene activity.

""We showed very clearly that if you brush the cobwebs off, the gene comes on,"" says study lead author Professor Merlin Crossley, UNSW Deputy Vice-Chancellor Academic Quality.

""And when we added the methyl groups back to the genes, they turned off again. So, these compounds aren't cobwebs -- they're anchors.""

How CRISPR Technology Has Evolved

CRISPR, short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is the foundation of modern gene-editing technology. It allows scientists to locate specific DNA sequences and make targeted changes, often replacing faulty genetic code with healthy versions.

The system is based on a natural defense mechanism found in bacteria, which use CRISPR to recognize and cut up the DNA of invading viruses.

Early versions of CRISPR tools worked by cutting DNA to disable malfunctioning genes. Later versions became more precise, allowing scientists to correct individual letters in the genetic code. However, both approaches rely on breaking DNA strands, which can lead to unintended changes and increase the risk of serious side effects.

The latest version, known as epigenetic editing, takes a different approach. Instead of cutting DNA, it targets chemical markers attached to genes inside the nucleus of each cell. By removing methyl groups from genes that have been silenced, researchers can restore gene activity without altering the underlying DNA sequence.

New Possibilities for Treating Sickle Cell Disease

The team believes this approach could lead to safer treatments for Sickle Cell-related diseases. These inherited conditions affect the shape and function of red blood cells, often causing severe pain, organ damage, and shortened life expectancy.

""Whenever you cut DNA, there's a risk of cancer. And if you're doing a gene therapy for a lifelong disease, that's a bad kind of risk,"" Prof. Crossley says.

""But if we can do gene therapy that doesn't involve snipping DNA strands, then we avoid these potential pitfalls.""

Rather than cutting DNA, the new technique uses a modified CRISPR system to deliver enzymes that remove methyl groups. This process releases the genetic brakes that keep certain genes switched off. One key target is the fetal globin gene, which helps deliver oxygen before birth. Reactivating this gene after birth could help bypass defects in the adult globin gene that cause Sickle Cell diseases.

""You can think of the fetal globin gene as the training wheels on a kid's bike,"" says Prof. Crossley. ""We believe we can get them working again in people who need new wheels.""

What the Research Shows So Far

So far, all experiments have been carried out in laboratory settings using human cells at UNSW and in Memphis.

Study co-author Professor Kate Quinlan says the findings could have far-reaching implications beyond Sickle Cell disease. Many genetic conditions involve genes that are improperly turned on or off, and adjusting methyl groups may provide a way to correct those problems without damaging DNA.

""We are excited about the future of epigenetic editing as our study shows that it allows us to boost gene expression without modifying the DNA sequence. Therapies based on this technology are likely to have a reduced risk of unintended negative effects compared to first or second generation CRISPR,"" she says.

Looking ahead, the researchers describe how the therapy might one day work in practice. Doctors would collect a patient's blood stem cells, which produce red blood cells. In the lab, epigenetic editing would be used to remove methyl tags from the fetal globin gene, reactivating it. The edited cells would then be returned to the patient, where they could settle into the bone marrow and begin producing healthier blood cells.

The Next Steps in Epigenetic Editing

The research teams at UNSW and St Jude plan to test the approach in animal models and continue exploring additional CRISPR-based tools.

""Perhaps the most important thing is that it is now possible to target molecules to individual genes,"" Prof. Crossley says.

""Here we removed or added methyl groups but that is just the beginning, there are other changes that one could make that would increase our abilities to alter gene output for therapeutic and agricultural purposes. This is the very beginning of a new age.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Earth has been feeding the moon for billions of years","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260104202730.htm","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:49:04 GMT","

New findings suggest that Earth's magnetic field has played a surprising role in transporting particles from our atmosphere to the moon over vast stretches of time.

At first glance, the moon appears lifeless and inert. But its surface may tell a more complex story. For billions of years, tiny fragments of Earth's atmosphere have likely been arriving on the moon and becoming embedded in its soil. These materials may include substances that could one day help support human activity on the lunar surface. Until recently, however, scientists were unsure how these particles could travel such enormous distances or how long the process had been underway.

Researchers at the University of Rochester now report that Earth's magnetic field may assist rather than prevent this transfer. Their study, published in Nature Communications Earth and Environment, shows that atmospheric particles lifted by the solar wind can be guided outward along Earth's magnetic field. Since this magnetic shield has existed for billions of years, it could have enabled a slow but continuous movement of material from Earth to the moon across deep time.

""By combining data from particles preserved in lunar soil with computational modeling of how solar wind interacts with Earth's atmosphere, we can trace the history of Earth's atmosphere and its magnetic field,"" says Eric Blackman, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and a distinguished scientist at URochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE).

These results suggest that lunar soil may preserve a long-running archive of Earth's atmosphere. They also raise the possibility that the moon contains resources that could prove valuable for astronauts living and working there in the future.

What Apollo Samples Revealed

Moon rocks and soil collected during the Apollo missions in the 1970s have been central to this research. Analyses of these samples show that the moon's surface layer, known as regolith, contains volatile substances such as water, carbon dioxide, helium, argon, and nitrogen. Some of these materials clearly come from the solar wind, the steady flow of charged particles streaming from the sun. However, the quantities found, particularly nitrogen, are too large to be explained by solar wind alone.

In 2005, scientists from the University of Tokyo proposed that part of these volatiles originated in Earth's atmosphere. They argued that this transfer could only have occurred early in Earth's history, before the planet developed a magnetic field. Their assumption was that once the magnetic field formed, it would block atmospheric particles from escaping into space.

The Rochester team reached a different conclusion.

Simulating the Journey From Earth to the Moon

To better understand how atmospheric particles might reach the moon, the researchers used advanced computer simulations. The team included Shubhonkar Paramanick, a graduate student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and a Horton Fellow at the LLE; John Tarduno, the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences; and Jonathan Carroll-Nellenback, a computational scientist at the Center for Integrated Research Computing and an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.

Their simulations tested two conditions. One represented an early version of Earth with no magnetic field and a stronger solar wind. The other modeled present-day Earth, complete with a strong magnetic field and a weaker solar wind. The results showed that particle transfer to the moon was far more effective in the modern Earth scenario.

In this case, the solar wind can knock charged particles loose from Earth's upper atmosphere. These particles then follow Earth's magnetic field lines, some of which extend far enough into space to intersect the moon's orbit. Over billions of years, this process acts like a slow funnel, allowing small amounts of Earth's atmosphere to settle onto the lunar surface.

A Record of Earth's Past and a Resource for the Future

Because this exchange has occurred over such long timescales, the moon may hold a chemical record of Earth's atmospheric history. Studying lunar soil could offer scientists new insights into how Earth's climate, oceans, and even life itself evolved over billions of years.

The steady delivery of particles also suggests the moon may contain more useful materials than previously assumed. Volatile elements such as water and nitrogen could help sustain long-term human activity on the moon, reducing the need to ship supplies from Earth and making future exploration more practical.

""Our study may also have broader implications for understanding early atmospheric escape on planets like Mars, which lacks a global magnetic field today but had one similar to Earth in the past, along with a likely thicker atmosphere,"" Paramanick says. ""By examining planetary evolution alongside atmospheric escape across different epochs, we can gain insight into how these processes shape planetary habitability.""

The research was supported in part by funding from NASA and the National Science Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A legendary fossil is forcing scientists to rethink human origins","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260104202738.htm","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 07:11:33 GMT","

An international research team led by scientists from La Trobe University in Australia and the University of Cambridge is questioning how one of the most complete early human fossils has been classified. Their findings suggest the specimen may not belong to any known human ancestor species and could represent an entirely new one.

The fossil, uncovered in South Africa's Sterkfontein Caves in 1998 and nicknamed ""Little Foot,"" has long been considered part of the Australopithecus genus. This group includes early, upright-walking relatives of humans that lived in southern Africa between about 3 million and 1.95 million years ago.

Ronald Clarke, the paleoanthropologist who led the painstaking 20-year effort to excavate and study the skeleton, initially identified Little Foot as Australopithecus prometheus when it was formally introduced in 2017. Other researchers argued it belonged to Australopithecus africanus, a species first described in 1925 by Australian anatomist Raymond Dart and already known from the same region.

New Evidence Challenges Old Assumptions

In a peer-reviewed study published in the American Journal of Biological Anthropology, a team led by La Trobe University adjunct Dr. Jesse Martin reached a different conclusion. Their analysis found that Little Foot does not share a distinct combination of features with either Australopithecus prometheus or Australopithecus africanus. This opens the door to the possibility that the fossil represents a previously unrecognized species.

""This fossil remains one of the most important discoveries in the hominin record and its true identity is key to understanding our evolutionary past,"" Dr. Martin said.

""We think it's demonstrably not the case that it's A.prometheus or A. africanus. This is more likely a previously unidentified, human relative.

""Dr. Clarke deserves credit for the discovery of Little Foot, and being one of the only people to maintain there were two species of hominin at Sterkfontein. Little Foot demonstrates in all likelihood he's right about that. There are two species.""

Why Little Foot Matters

Formally known as StW 573, Little Foot is still considered the most complete ancient hominin skeleton ever found. Despite its significance, no team had publicly challenged its species classification since its debut in 2017 until now.

""Our findings challenge the current classification of Little Foot and highlight the need for further careful, evidence-based taxonomy in human evolution,"" Dr. Martin said.

Dr. Martin, who holds an adjunct position at La Trobe University and is a postdoctoral research fellow at Cambridge, will continue this work alongside La Trobe students. Their goal is to determine exactly which species Little Foot belongs to and where it fits within the broader human family tree.

Broader Implications for Human Evolution

The research was conducted under an Australian Research Council grant led by Professor Andy Herries at La Trobe University. Professor Herries emphasized the fossil's importance for understanding early human diversity and how ancient relatives adapted to the varied environments of southern Africa.

""It is clearly different from the type specimen of Australopithecus prometheus, which was a name defined on the idea these early humans made fire, which we now know they didn't. Its importance and difference to other contemporary fossils clearly show the need for defining it as its own unique species.""

The study reflects a wide-ranging collaboration among researchers and institutions in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and the United States.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find a safer way to make cells burn more calories","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260104202750.htm","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 08:58:34 GMT","

Scientists have developed experimental compounds that prompt the mitochondria inside cells to use more energy and burn additional calories. This early research suggests a possible new path toward treating obesity while also supporting better metabolic health.

Obesity affects people worldwide and raises the risk of serious conditions such as diabetes and cancer. Many current weight loss medications require injections and can lead to unwanted side effects. A safer method for increasing calorie burn could therefore have major benefits for public health.

The study was led by Associate Professor Tristan Rawling of the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and was recently published in Chemical Science, the flagship journal of the UK Royal Society of Chemistry. The research was also recognized as a ""pick of the week.""

How Mitochondrial Uncouplers Work

The research team, which included scientists from UTS and Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, focused on compounds known as ""mitochondrial uncouplers."" These molecules cause cells to use fuel less efficiently, releasing some of that energy as heat instead of converting it into usable power.

""Mitochondria are often called the powerhouses of the cell. They turn the food you eat into chemical energy, called ATP or adenosine triphosphate. Mitochondrial uncouplers disrupt this process, triggering cells to consume more fats to meet their energy needs,"" said Associate Professor Rawling.

He compared the process to a hydroelectric system. ""It's been described as a bit like a hydroelectric dam. Normally, water from the dam flows through turbines to generate electricity. Uncouplers act like a leak in the dam, letting some of that energy bypass the turbines, so it is lost as heat, rather than producing useful power.""

A Dangerous History of Weight Loss Chemicals

Substances that interfere with mitochondrial energy production were first identified about a century ago. However, the earliest versions were extremely dangerous and caused severe overheating that could be fatal.

""During World War I, munitions workers in France lost weight, had high temperatures and some died. Scientists discovered this was caused by a chemical used at the factory, called 2,4-Dinitrophenol or DNP,"" said Associate Professor Rawling.

""DNP disrupts mitochondrial energy production and increases metabolism. It was briefly marketed in the 1930's as one of the first weight-loss drugs. It was remarkably effective but was eventually banned due to its severe toxic effects. The dose required for weight loss and the lethal dose are dangerously close,"" he said.

Designing Safer Mild Uncouplers

In the new study, researchers aimed to overcome these risks by creating safer versions known as ""mild"" mitochondrial uncouplers. They carefully modified the chemical structure of experimental molecules, allowing them to control how strongly the compounds increased energy use inside cells.

Some of these experimental drugs successfully raised mitochondrial activity without damaging cells or interfering with ATP production. Others behaved more like the older toxic compounds, producing dangerous levels of uncoupling.

By comparing these outcomes, the researchers were able to identify why the safer molecules acted differently. Mild mitochondrial uncouplers slow the process to a level that cells can tolerate, reducing the risk of harmful side effects.

Beyond Weight Loss Potential Benefits

Mild mitochondrial uncouplers also appear to lower oxidative stress within cells. This reduction could support healthier metabolism, slow certain aging-related processes, and help protect against neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia.

Although the research is still in its early stages, the findings provide a roadmap for developing a new generation of drugs. These future treatments could harness the advantages of mild mitochondrial uncoupling while avoiding the dangers that plagued earlier approaches.

New research from Johns Hopkins University shows that artificial intelligence systems built with designs inspired by biology can begin to resemble human brain activity even before they are trained on any data. The study suggests that how AI is structured may be just as important as how much data it processes.

The findings, published in Nature Machine Intelligence, challenge the dominant strategy in AI development. Instead of relying on months of training, enormous datasets, and vast computing power, the research highlights the value of starting with a brain-like architectural foundation.

Rethinking the Data Heavy Approach to AI

""The way that the AI field is moving right now is to throw a bunch of data at the models and build compute resources the size of small cities. That requires spending hundreds of billions of dollars. Meanwhile, humans learn to see using very little data,"" said lead author Mick Bonner, assistant professor of cognitive science at Johns Hopkins University. ""Evolution may have converged on this design for a good reason. Our work suggests that architectural designs that are more brain-like put the AI systems in a very advantageous starting point.""

Bonner and his colleagues aimed to test whether architecture alone could give AI systems a more human-like starting point, without relying on large-scale training.

Comparing Popular AI Architectures

The research team focused on three major types of neural network designs commonly used in modern AI systems: transformers, fully connected networks, and convolutional neural networks.

They repeatedly adjusted these designs to create dozens of different artificial neural networks. None of the models were trained beforehand. The researchers then showed the untrained systems images of objects, people, and animals and compared their internal activity to brain responses from humans and non-human primates viewing the same images.

Why Convolutional Networks Stood Out

Increasing the number of artificial neurons in transformers and fully connected networks produced little meaningful change. However, similar adjustments to convolutional neural networks led to activity patterns that more closely matched those seen in the human brain.

According to the researchers, these untrained convolutional models performed on par with traditional AI systems that typically require exposure to millions or even billions of images. The results suggest that architecture plays a larger role in shaping brain-like behavior than previously believed.

A Faster Path to Smarter AI

""If training on massive data is really the crucial factor, then there should be no way of getting to brain-like AI systems through architectural modifications alone,"" Bonner said. ""This means that by starting with the right blueprint, and perhaps incorporating other insights from biology, we may be able to dramatically accelerate learning in AI systems.""

The team is now exploring simple learning methods inspired by biology that could lead to a new generation of deep learning frameworks, potentially making AI systems faster, more efficient, and less dependent on massive datasets.

High energy proton collisions can be pictured as a roiling sea of quarks and gluons, including short lived virtual particles. At first glance, this extreme environment seems far more complex than the later stage, when fewer and more stable particles fly outward from the collision point. One might expect particles in this early phase to behave very differently. But data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) show that this intuition is misleading. The results are better explained by a refined model that captures how proton collisions truly unfold.

When two protons collide at very high energies, an enormous amount happens in an instant. Protons are hadrons, meaning they are made of partons, which include quarks and the gluons that hold them together. During a collision, these quarks and gluons, including virtual ones that appear only briefly, interact in complicated ways. As the system cools, quarks combine to form new hadrons that scatter outward and are detected by experiments. Based on this picture, it seems reasonable to assume that the disorder of the system, known as entropy, should change between the early parton phase and the later hadron phase. The parton stage looks especially chaotic, with many particles interacting at once.

New Research on Entropy in Proton Collisions

The latest findings on this question were published in Physical Review D by Prof. Krzysztof Kutak and Dr. Sandor Lokos from the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IFJ PAN) in Cracow. Their work focuses on comparing entropy in the early quark gluon phase with the entropy of the particles eventually produced and measured.

""In high-energy physics, so-called dipole models have been used for some time to describe the evolution of dense gluon systems. These models assume that each gluon can be represented by a quark-antiquark pair that forms a dipole of two colors -- here we are not talking about ordinary colours, but the colour charge that is a quantum property of gluons. Dipole models based on the average number of hadrons produced in a collision allow us to estimate the entropy of partons,"" explains Prof. Kutak, who has studied the entropy of quark gluon systems for more than ten years.

Improving Dipole Models With New Ideas

Two years ago, Prof. Kutak and Dr. Pawel Caputa of Stockholm University introduced an updated version of the dipole model. They started with an established model that describes how gluon systems evolve and treated it as the dominant contribution. They then added additional effects that become important at lower collision energies, where fewer hadrons are produced. This advance was possible because the researchers identified links between the equations used in dipole models and those found in complexity theory.

To test this generalized dipole model, Dr. Lokos suggested comparing it with real experimental data from the LHC. Measurements from the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments were included. Together, these data span a broad range of collision energies, from 0.2 teraelectronvolts up to 13 TeV, which is the highest energy currently achievable at the LHC.

""In our article, we show that the generalized dipole model describes the existing data more accurately than previous dipole models and, moreover, works well in a wider range of proton collision energies,"" Prof. Kutak says.

Entropy and a Core Rule of Quantum Mechanics

This raises a key question. Does the entropy during the quark and gluon dominated phase of a proton collision differ from the entropy of the hadrons that later escape the collision zone? According to the Kharzeev-Levin formula for entropy, it should not. The new analysis confirms this prediction. While this result surprises some physicists, others see it as a natural outcome of one of the most basic principles of quantum mechanics known as unitarity.

Unitarity may sound abstract, but the idea itself is straightforward. The equations that describe how a quantum system evolves over time must conserve total probability, which always adds up to one, and they must allow processes to be reversed. Put simply, unitarity means that information and probability cannot disappear or appear from nothing.

""The unitarity of quantum mechanics is something that physics students learn about. The formalism of quantum chromodynamics, the theory describing the world of quarks and gluons, is based on unitarity. However, it is one thing to deal with a theory that exhibits a certain feature at the level of quarks and gluons on a daily basis, and quite another to observe it in real data on produced hadrons,"" Prof. Kutak notes. He adds that unitarity makes it possible to extract information about parton entropy across a wide range of collision energies.

What Comes Next for Testing the Model

Further tests of the generalized dipole model are expected in the coming years. After the planned upgrade of the LHC, the improved ALICE detector will be able to study regions where gluon interactions are even denser than those examined so far. Additional insights are also expected from the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), now under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the USA. At the EIC, electrons will collide with protons. Because electrons are elementary particles, these experiments will offer a clearer way to probe dense gluon systems inside individual protons.

Blood biomarkers have emerged as accurate tools for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, offering a minimally invasive alternative to traditional diagnostic methods such as imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Yet, the logistics surrounding venipuncture for blood collection, although considerably simpler than the acquisition of imaging and CSF, require precise processing and storage specific to AD biomarkers that are still guided by medical personnel. Consequently, limitations in their widescale use in research and broader clinical implementation exist. The DROP-AD project investigates the potential of dried plasma spot (DPS) and dried blood spot (DBS) analysis, derived from capillary blood, for detecting AD biomarkers, including phosphorylated tau at amino acid 217 (p-tau217), glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light. Here, 337 participants from 7 centers were included, with 304 participants providing paired capillary DPS or DBS and venous plasma samples. We observed strong correlations between DPS p-tau217 and venous plasma p-tau217 (rS = 0.74, P < 0.001). DPS p-tau217 progressively increased with increasing disease severity, and showed good accuracy in predicting CSF biomarker positivity (area under the curve = 0.864). Similarly, we demonstrated the successful detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light with strong correlations between DBS and DPS, respectively, using paired venous plasma samples. Notably, the method was also effective in individuals with Down syndrome, a population at high genetic risk for AD but in whom standard blood sampling by venipuncture may be more complicated, revealing elevated biomarkers in those with dementia compared with asymptomatic individuals. The study also explored unsupervised blood collection, finding high concordance between supervised and self-collected samples. These findings underscore the potential of dried blood collection and capillary blood as a minimally invasive, scalable approach for AD biomarker testing in research settings. Yet, further refinement of collection and analytical protocols is needed to fully translate this approach to be viable and useful as a clinical tool.

In less than a decade, the development of blood biomarkers for the identification of AD pathology has transitioned from a promising research endeavor to a valued tool that is now included in research diagnostic criteria1 and is increasingly being adopted in clinical practice. Phosphorylated tau at amino acid 217 (p-tau217) has emerged as an early and accurate AD blood biomarker2,3, offering higher accuracy compared with other putative blood biomarkers for detecting cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology4, a required hallmark for an AD diagnosis5,6. Several blood p-tau217 assays, spanning different immunological detection methods and mass spectrometry techniques7 are now available with some—but not all—meeting the recommended criteria for clinical usefulness, approved for clinical use, or currently under regulatory evaluation8. Thus, a cost-effective and timely tool is now available to identify individuals who may benefit from approved and emerging treatments or to monitor disease progression9. Specifically, the most likely clinical applications of blood p-tau217 will be based on a two-cutoff approach10 aimed at identifying people at either very high or very low risk of brain amyloidosis and for whom additional biomarker investigations are unnecessary, thereby lowering the need for positron emission tomography (PET) or CSF testing11. Other supportive blood biomarkers also offer insights into disease pathophysiology. Specifically, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrogliosis, has been associated with the onset of Aβ deposition12,13; and neurofilament light (NfL), a marker for axonal degeneration across neurodegenerative diseases14, has also been developed and is widely deployed in research and some clinical and therapeutic settings.

Although current guidelines recommend AD blood biomarker testing for symptomatic individuals15, there is also the potential to screen cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults using a simplified test in a research setting and prevention strategies. This is because of the expectation of improved effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies targeting amyloid pathology in earlier disease stages, with trials currently ongoing16. Moreover, broader implementation of blood biomarkers will likely substantially advance the treatment, management and biological understanding of AD and related disorders in populations and communities currently underrepresented in research; for example, in individuals with Down syndrome (DS).

Substantial efforts have been made to ensure that blood tests become widely accessible, rather than confined to specialized laboratories. A major advancement in this area is the development of high-performing commercial and fully automated immunoassays for AD blood biomarkers, in particular p-tau21717. These fully automated immunoassays demonstrate performance identical or almost identical to immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry, as shown in a series of papers17,18,19,20,21. Although immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry remains difficult for widespread research and clinical implementation because of its high costs and limited instrument availability, automated immunoassays offer reliable and scalable solutions that address these limitations. Yet, for their global adoption to be fully realized, logistical challenges surrounding blood collection—such as the need for timely and standardized sample handling and storage22, as well as limited access to phlebotomy services—must be overcome to avoid constraining the impact of blood-based biomarker testing.

The DROP-AD project aims to streamline blood sample collection for larger-scale research, therapeutic trial enrollment and, potentially, clinical care, by introducing an alternative method that addresses the logistical challenges of traditional venipuncture blood collection and processing. By using capillary blood collected on DBS or DPS cards, the latter needed for p-tau217, reliance on guided venipuncture, immediate centrifugation and temperature-controlled shipment is eliminated. This approach enables a simplified, and potentially self-administered, protocol using fingertip blood collection. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of measuring AD biomarkers from dried blood spots23, with the blood source being venous, followed by manual transfer onto a card for shipping and storage advantages. Here we extend this previous work by evaluating the feasibility of remote biomarker assessment using capillary blood, obtained by fingerstick collection, thus potentially self-collected and remote. A total of 337 participants were recruited across 7 European centers to assess the quantification of key AD pathology and neurodegeneration biomarkers—plasma p-tau217, NfL and GFAP—from capillary-derived blood collected from the finger. These values were directly compared with those obtained by standard venous plasma sampling, as well as to CSF biomarker concentrations routinely used in clinical diagnostics.

We recruited 337 participants (mean (s.d.) age, 70.8 (11.7) years; 167 women (53.4%) (Table 1) from 7 centers. Depending on the research site, and the evolution of the DROP-AD project, participants followed different capillary blood collection and testing procedures, which are summarized in Fig. 1. Cohort characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

a, Collection and processing of venous plasma and capillary DPS and DBS samples. For DPS and DBS sample collection, a finger prick was carried out by trained study personnel and a few drops of capillary blood were spotted onto DPS and DBS collection devices. DPS and DBS were collected via semi-automated spot collectors and incubated with analyte-specific extraction buffer in a 96-well filter plate. After incubation and centrifugation, the eluate was immediately measured using ultrasensitive immunoassays on the single molecule array platform. b–f, Participant numbers and collection device numbers per cohort: capillary p-tau217 (b), capillary GFAP (c), capillary NfL (d), DS cohort (e) and self-sampling cohort (f).

In total, 252 participants (mean (s.d.) age, 72.7 (9.0) years; 143 women (56.7%)) provided paired capillary DPS samples and venous plasma samples. We found a high correlation between DPS p-tau217 and venous plasma p-tau217 across all merged cohorts (Spearman's rank correlation (rS) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.678–0.791; P < 0.001) (Fig. 2a). The strength of this correlation varied among participating centers (Extended Data Fig. 1) and was highest in the Gothenburg cohort (rS = 0.904, 95% CI 0.731–0.968; P < 0.0001) and the Brescia cohort (rS = 0.838, 95% CI 0.694–0.917; P < 0.0001), followed by the Exeter (rS = 0.765, 95% CI 0.530–0.891; P < 0.0001) and Barcelona (rS = 0.735, 95% CI 0.646–0.805; P < 0.0001) cohorts, and the Malmö cohort (rS = 0.429, 95% CI 0.159–0.640; P < 0.001), the only cohort in which a different assay (Lilly2) for venous plasma was used. To further demonstrate the strength the relationship between capillary and venous blood, we stratified plasma p-tau217 concentrations into tertiles and computed Spearman correlations in each tertile, allowing us to assess agreement at low, medium and high concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 2). Significant correlations were observed for p-tau217 concentrations in tertile two (rS = 0.51; P < 0.0001) and tertile three (rS = 0.62; P < 0.0001), but no relationship in tertile one, where all participants were CSF Aβ42/p-tau181 negative. The strength of the relationship between capillary and venous blood was not confounded by age or sex (Supplementary Table 2).

Next, we investigated the association of capillary biomarkers with cognitive testing. DPS p-tau217 showed significant correlations with both Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) (n = 209; rS = −0.374, 95% CI −0.485 to −0.251; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2b) and age (n = 249; rS = 0.334, 95% CI 0.219–0.440; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2c), which were similar to the correlations of venous plasma p-tau217 with MMSE (n = 209; rS = −0.410, 95% CI −0.517 to −0.290; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2b) and age (n = 249; rS = −0.317, 95% CI 0.200 to 0.424; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2c).

DPS p-tau217 was significantly increased in clinically defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (no biomarker classification) compared with CU participants and clinically defined non-AD dementias (Fig. 3a). Next, we investigated the discriminative accuracy of DPS p-tau217 to detect abnormal CSF biomarkers. In participants with DPS p-tau217, venous plasma p-tau217 and CSF Aβ42/p-tau181 (n = 176; mean (s.d.) age, 74.6 (7.9) years; 102 women (58.0%)), capillary DPS p-tau217 was significantly increased (+198%; P < 0.001) in the AD CSF biomarker-positive group (Fig. 3b). DPS p-tau217 had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.863 (95% CI 0.809–0.917); however, this was significantly lower than venous plasma p-tau217 which had an AUC of 0.982 (95% CI 0.968–0.996; P < 0.0001) (Extended Data Fig. 3) in the same participant subsample. We also show the distribution of capillary p-tau217 across clinico-biological diagnostic groups (Fig. 3c), which shows a similar pattern to venous derived p-tau217, with similar statistical significance across groups (Extended Data Fig. 4). Results demonstrating DPS p-tau217 against CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 as the standard of truth are shown in Extended Data Fig. 5. Next, we tested the accuracy of capillary DPS p-tau217 to determine abnormal venous plasma p-tau217 (n = 252), which had predetermined cutoff validated against Aβ-PET (ALZpath single molecule array (Simoa) > 0.42 pg ml−1)3. DPS p-tau217 was more concordant with venous plasma p-tau217 and was increased by 217% in individuals with venous plasma p-tau217 > 0.42 pg ml−1, compared with individuals with venous plasma p-tau217 ≤ 0.42 pg ml−1, and had a discriminative accuracy to detect abnormal venous plasma p-tau217 of 0.868 (95% CI 0.825–0.911) (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Exploratory diagnostic accuracy metrics were derived in a subset of individuals (n = 176) with paired capillary and CSF Aβ42/p-tau181 metrics, at a prevalence of 56.3% of CSF biomarker positivity. A capillary p-tau217 cutoff of 0.01 pg ml−1, with 90% sensitivity for abnormal CSF Aβ42/p-tau181, led to a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.738 (95% CI 0.653–0.808) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.833 (95% CI 0.713–0.910), at a specificity of 58.4%. A capillary cutoff of 0.02 pg ml−1, with 90% specificity for abnormal CSF Aβ42/p-tau181, led to a PPV of 0.884 (95% CI 0.789–0.940) and an NPV of 0.645 (95% CI 0.551–0.729), at a sensitivity of 66.7%. A Youden's J statistic capillary cutoff (0.016 pg ml−1) led to a PPV of 0.849 (95% CI 0.758–0.909) and an NPV of 0.711 (95% CI 0.610–0.795), at a sensitivity of 73.7% and specificity of 83.2%. When combining the 90% sensitivity cutoff (0.01 pg ml−1) with the 90% specificity cutoff (0.02 pg ml−1) in a two-cutoff approach, the NPV of the lower cutoff was, as above, 0.833 (95% CI 0.713–0.910) and the PPV of the upper cutoff was 0.884 (95% CI 0.789–0.940), reaching an overall accuracy for those below the lower cutoff and above the upper cutoff of 86.2% (95% CI 78.8–91.7%), with 53 of the 176 individuals falling in the intermediate zone, which corresponded to 30.1% of the evaluated participants.

Based on 240 individuals (mean (s.d.) age, 69.9 (10.8) years; 99 women (48.8%)) measured using at least one of the three candidate DBS methods, we found that B50 and Telimmune collection cards were most compatible for GFAP and were combined for this analysis (Extended Data Fig. 7B). When comparing GFAP levels from capillary samples with venous plasma, a strong correlation was found (r = 0.773, 95% CI 0.710–0.823; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4a). We also observed a similar correlation of capillary GFAP and venous plasma GFAP with age (capillary GFAP, r = 0.392, 95% CI 0.261–0.509; P < 0.0001; venous plasma GFAP, r = 0.276, 95% CI 0.135–0.405; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4b) and MMSE (capillary GFAP, r = −0.448, 95% CI −0.558 to −0.324; P < 0.0001; venous plasma, r = −0.436, 95% CI −0.547 to −0.310; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4c).

Source data

Based on a set with 237 individuals measured with at least one of the three DBS method candidates, only Telimmune DPS cards were useful in examining capillary NfL using our protocol (Extended Data Fig. 7C). Therefore, we examined 72 participants for NfL using Telimmune DPS cards (mean (s.d.) age, 76.4 (7.0) years; 45 women (62.5%)). When comparing NfL levels from capillary DPS to venous plasma, a strong correlation was observed (r = 0.83, 95% CI 0.743–0.892; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4d). Similarly to GFAP, we observed similar correlations between DPS and venous plasma NfL in relation to age (capillary DPS, r = 0.429, 95% CI 0.219–0.601; P < 0.001; venous plasma, r = 0.524, 95% CI 0.333–0.674; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4e) and MMSE (capillary DPS, r = −0.269, 95% CI −0.471 to −0.039; P = 0.02; venous plasma, r = −0.367, 95% CI −0.552 to −0.148; P < 0.001) (Fig. 4f).

We examined 31 participants with DS and DBS biomarker data. As with the euploid participants, we found a significant relationship between biomarkers measured in capillary blood and venous blood (p-tau217, r = 0.875, 95% CI 0.503–0.973 (Fig. 5a) GFAP, r = 0.629, 95% CI 0.347–0.806 (Fig. 5c)). Capillary biomarker levels were, as also shown in venous plasma (Fig. 5e,f), increased in DS with dementia (dDS), compared with DS without AD-related cognitive impairment (aDS), for both p-tau217 (Fig. 5b) and GFAP (Fig. 5d). Participants positive for CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 more often had higher levels of capillary GFAP (Fig. 5f), although there were not sufficient participants with DS and DBS p-tau217 and CSF biomarker data (n = 5, CSF-negative only). Telimmune cards were not collected in this study, so no NfL results were obtained.

Statistical tests were two-sided, and for group comparisons Tukey adjustment was used.

Source data

In the previous result sections, all capillary DPS or DBS collection was supervised and guided by trained personnel. Here we evaluated the within-person difference if collection was supervised compared with unsupervised. In 30 participants, capillary blood guided by study personnel and self-collected unsupervised samples showed a very high concordance with little difference between timepoints (DPS p-tau217, 0.014 pg ml−1 versus 0.013 pg ml−1, P = 0.57 (Extended Data Fig. 8A); DBS GFAP, 10.1 pg ml−1 versus 11.0 pg ml−1, P = 0.26 (Extended Data Fig. 8B)). Because only one Telimmune card was sampled per participant dedicated to p-tau217 quantification, no NfL data were obtained.

The DROP-AD project, constituting an effort to assess biomarkers for AD-type pathology and neurodegeneration from capillary blood, showcases the capability of quantifying p-tau217, GFAP and NfL protein levels. The study evaluated straightforward capillary blood collection methods, a new extraction protocol and ultrasensitive immunoassay biomarker determination. Biomarker levels from capillary blood correlated well with conventional venipuncture-collected plasma measures, and in the case of p-tau217, predicted with good accuracy, abnormal AD CSF biomarkers, as demonstrated in individuals classified as asymptomatic, MCI, dementia, as well as in individuals with DS, who are at high-risk for AD.

In blood, p-tau217 is the principal blood biomarker for determining AD pathology8 and is increasingly adopted as a reliable metric in research, clinical trials and clinical practice. It has the capabilities of high diagnostic accuracy to detect AD pathology, primarily amyloid3,24, but is also tightly associated with severity of tau pathology assessed by tangle counts at post-mortem examination2 and by tau PET during life25 not only in the symptomatic phase of the disease4, but also in the asymptomatic phase26. Therefore, p-tau217 holds promise not only for clinical use, but also population-level screening, identifying at-risk individuals in preclinical phases and enabling early intervention strategies27. Plasma p-tau217 has already been used to assess outcomes in secondary preventive trials16,28. A drawback in expanding blood biomarker testing outside specialized centers, is the strict protocol and guided venipuncture collection, sample handling and shipment. Dried blood sampling23 overcomes this limitation by enabling simplified, minimally invasive and potentially, remote self-collection, reducing the need for specialized personnel and facilitating broader population access to biomarker testing.

The DROP-AD project, conducted across multiple centers, highlights the strong potential of using dried capillary blood samples to accurately quantify plasma p-tau217. We observed robust correlations between p-tau217 concentrations measured from DPS and matched venous plasma samples, although the strength of these correlations varied by site. Importantly, p-tau217 levels showed a stepwise increase across clinical stages—CU, MCI and AD—and demonstrated good accuracy in predicting CSF biomarker-confirmed AD pathology. In addition to p-tau217, we successfully quantified GFAP and NfL using DBS and DPS matrices, respectively. Both GFAP and NfL showed high concordance between capillary and venous samples, and were similarly associated with cognitive performance and age, reinforcing the validity of these remote sampling methods. Although our primary focus was on biomarkers of AD neuropathology, the reliable detection of NfL from DPS samples has broader implications. Given its established role as a diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring biomarker, capillary-based NfL measurement could be transformative for other neurodegenerative and neurological conditions—including frontotemporal dementia, atypical parkinsonian syndromes, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and acute neurological injuries. Biomarker levels extracted from DPS or DBS cards, for all analytes of interest, were substantially lower than those quantified from venous plasma, which we believe is attributable to the elution of dried blood or plasma with buffer, resulting in dilution. Protein concentrations were not adjusted using a uniform dilution factor, because we cannot currently estimate the volume of plasma that is dried onto a card. Attempts to measure Aβ42 and Aβ40 using this technique yielded mixed results. Although Aβ40 was readily quantifiable, Aβ42 levels were mainly below the limit of detection and could not be included in the analysis, limiting the utility of this approach for this biomarker.

Imaging, CSF and blood-based biomarkers for AD pathology have shown strong translational applicability in individuals with DS, which represents the most common genetically determined form of AD29. Given the near-universal risk of AD in this population, there is a critical need for scalable and accessible methods to enable longitudinal biomarker monitoring, particularly in the context of preventive and disease-modifying clinical trials. Collection of blood samples by standard venipuncture may be complicated in individuals with DS—for example, due to relatively high rates of institutionalization and a lack of professionals—and remote blood collection thus offers a promising solution by reducing reliance on in-clinic visits and facilitating broader participation across diverse spectrum of intellectual disability. To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, we conducted a pilot study in which capillary blood samples were successfully collected from individuals with DS across a spectrum of cognitive stages. Our results revealed significantly elevated levels of capillary-derived GFAP and p-tau217 in participants with symptomatic AD compared with those who were cognitively asymptomatic. Importantly, biomarker concentrations derived from capillary samples showed strong concordance with those obtained from matched venous plasma, supporting the reliability and translational potential of remote sampling for biomarker quantification and ultimately, AD diagnosis, in this high-risk population.

This study has limitations. First, we have indicated that capillary blood collection may be useful in an unsupervised fashion, remotely. This has not been fully examined in this proof-of-principle study, where all capillary sampling was performed in research centers guided by trained staff. To gain some initial insights, we conducted a pilot in 30 participants who provided two capillary samples: one sampled by research staff and one unsupervised—1 h later. These initial findings demonstrate the reproducibility of both the collection method and the laboratory extraction procedure. Further, our venous plasma analyses were performed in single-batch analysis for all study sites, and this is particularly important to consider when comparing results directly to capillary testing, which was analyzed prospectively in multiple batches (less than 4 weeks from collection) throughout the 24-month study period. The observed lower accuracies to determine AD pathology by capillary p-tau217 could be partially attributed to this key difference in analytical design. This 24-month period also reflects a time of protocol optimization, in sample collection at multiple study sites and biomarker determination in the laboratory. Despite this optimization, we do experience a proportion of unsuccessful collections of capillary samples because of insufficient capillary blood flow, coagulation or technical issues during plasma separation in 15–25% of cases. This may, in part, reflect the inherent challenges of fingertip capillary blood sampling in clinical practice, where achieving consistent blood flow from a fingerstick collection is difficult and often complicated by hemolysis or admixture of interstitial fluid due to external compression of the fingertip30. We believe that diligent training of the study personnel and patients and/or caregivers and the provision of informational material is essential for successful collection of dried blood; however, alternative capillary blood collection methods—other than fingerstick—should be considered and examined given the encouraging finding from this study. Moreover, studies with larger cohorts are needed to investigate the impact of confounders on DPS or DBS biomarker levels.

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that dried blood analysis offers a feasible and scalable approach for detecting AD pathology, particularly in research, population-based and epidemiological contexts. This minimally invasive method has the potential to substantially broaden our understanding of the prevalence and distribution of AD pathology across the general population, while also facilitating the inclusion of historically underrepresented populations and geographically diverse regions in AD research. However, despite the promise shown, we do not currently recommend the use of dried blood analysis for clinical use, decision-making or patient management, because of observed differences in analytical performance and diagnostic accuracy between capillary-derived and venous blood samples. Further methodological refinement and validation will be essential before clinical translation can be considered.

To evaluate the feasibility of capillary-derived blood as a simplified collection method compatible with AD biomarker analysis, paired venous plasma and capillary blood samples obtained by fingerstick were collected from CU and cognitively impaired individuals across seven European study centers. Capillary blood collection was conducted by trained study personnel at each site. Dried blood cards were shipped without temperature control to the Neurochemistry Laboratory at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, within 1–40 days of collection. In parallel, venous plasma samples were stored at −80 °C at the respective study sites and shipped on dry ice to the same laboratory at the end of the study. Complementary CSF data (total n = 227; Barcelona, n = 131; Barcelona (DS), n = 13; Brescia, n = 7; Gothenburg, n = 13; Malmö, n = 40; Copenhagen, n = 23) and cognitive assessments (total n = 244; Barcelona, n = 130; Brescia, n = 32; Copenhagen, n = 24; Gothenburg, n = 14; Malmö, n = 44) were obtained from each site as part of routine clinical evaluations or existing research protocols.

At each study site, all participants provided written informed consent before enrollment, and the studies were approved by local ethical review authorities. The inclusion criteria for each cohort are depicted below and summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Participants were not compensated for participation in this study. Biological sex was determined based on self-identification.

The Ace Alzheimer Center Barcelona, Spain (the ‘Barcelona' cohort) included participants under investigation for cognitive complaints recruited between September 2022 and April 2024. At Fundació ACE, clinical diagnosis was carried out through a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation using the NBACE battery31, assessment of functional status with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and supported by biological diagnosis through CSF biomarkers following the AT(N) classification framework32. Individuals with MCI and dementia were offered a voluntary (and informed consented) lumbar puncture in accordance with established consensus recommendations. Venous plasma, CSF and capillary DPS or DBS samples were collected on the same day under fasting conditions. All biospecimens obtained were part of the ACE collection, which was registered in Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII, Ministry of Health of Spain) under the code C.0000299. Capillary DPS and DBS samples were stored and shipped at room temperature between 1 and 3 days after the collection. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, Barcelona (Ref. PR148/22). The H70 Clinical Studies (the ‘Gothenburg' cohort) consecutively recruited participants under investigation for cognitive symptoms from the memory clinic at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden between June 2023 and April 2024. There were no exclusion criteria. Capillary DPS and DBS samples, venous plasma and CSF samples were collected at the same study visit. Cognitive testing (MMSE and CDR) was performed in each participant. Capillary DPS and DBS samples were stored at room temperature and delivered to the Neurochemistry Laboratory between 1 and 7 days after the collection. Ethical approval for H70 Clinical Studies was provided by The Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Etikprövningsmyndigheten; EPM: 2023-06137-02). In the BioFINDER Primary Care (NCT06120361) and BioFINDER Preclinical AD (NCT06121544) studies (the ‘Malmö' cohort), cognitively asymptomatic volunteers (asymptomatic AD or healthy controls) and individuals with cognitive symptoms undergoing cognitive diagnostic evaluation in primary care were included between December 2023 and November 2024. The exclusion criteria were (1) not undergoing CSF or blood sampling as part of clinical practice and (2) not undergoing cognitive testing as part of clinical practice. Cognitive testing (MMSE) and CSF samples were available for each participant. Capillary DPS and DBS were collected at the same day as venous plasma samples, stored at room temperature and shipped to the Neurochemistry Laboratory between 1 and 7 days after the collection. The studies were approved by Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr. 2021-05724-01 and 2019-04320). Participants enrolled at the Center for Neurodegenerative Disorders at the University of Brescia, Italy (the ‘Brescia' cohort) met current clinical criteria for the diagnosis of fontotemperal dementia33,34 or AD35, or were healthy individuals recruited among spouses or family members. Consecutive recruitment took place between October 2023 and June 2024. Each participant underwent an extensive clinical and neuropsychological evaluation and simultaneous venous EDTA plasma and dried blood spot collection. Cognitive testing (MMSE and CDR) was available for each participant and CSF samples were collected in a subgroup. Capillary DPS and DBS samples were stored at room temperature and shipped to the Neurochemistry Laboratory between 1 and 30 days after the collection. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (NP2189 and NP1965). Participants enrolled at the University of Exeter Medical School (the ‘Exeter' cohort) were adults aged 50 years or above with a body mass index >25 kg m−2 and within 2 h travel of Exeter consecutively recruited from PROTECT-UK (Platform for Research Online to investigate Cognition and Genetics in Ageing) taking part in the DailyColors polyphenol supplement study in January 2024 (ref. 36). Exclusion criteria were the diagnosis of dementia and participation in an interventional clinical trial. Capillary dried blood samples and paired venous blood were collected at the same day. Capillary dried blood samples were stored at room temperature and shipped to the Neurochemistry Laboratory between 1 and 10 days after collection. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Exeter, Faculty of Health & Life Sciences REC (Ref. 529634). Participants under investigation of a neurodegenerative disease from the memory clinic at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital (the ‘Copenhagen' cohort) were enrolled between May 2024 and July 2024. For each participant, paired capillary DPS and DBS and venous plasma, sampled on the same day, and CSF and MMSE data were available. Individuals were excluded if they did not consent to the Danish Dementia Biobank, if the lumbar puncture was unsuccessful, or if they were clinically evaluated as incapable of participating in the project. Capillary dried blood samples were stored at room temperature and shipped within 7–40 days after collection. This study was approved by the Danish Research Ethics Committee (Ref. H-23078392). For the Sant Pau cohort, participants with DS with (dDS or prodromal AD (pDS)) and without AD-related cognitive impairment (aDS) were consecutively recruited at the Sant Pau Memory Unit, Barcelona, Spain from the Down Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative (DABNI) study between May 2024 and November 2024. Capillary DPS and DBS samples were collected at the same day as venous EDTA plasma samples and stored at room temperature and shipped within 1–14 days after collection. This study was approved by the Sant Pau Ethics Committee. All participants or their legally authorized representative gave written informed consent before enrollment.

Three different dried blood spot collection devices were used in this study. Capitainer SEP-10 (Capitainer AB), Capitainer B50 (Capitainer AB) and Telimmune Plasma Separation Card (Novilytic). Capitainer SEP-10 and the Telimmune Plasma Separation Card were used interchangeably to measure p-tau217. Capitainer B50 and the Telimmune Plasma Separation Card were utilized for GFAP quantification. Telimmune Plasma Separation Cards alone were used for NfL measurements based on comparative studies (Extended Data Fig. 7). In all cohorts, capillary blood was collected by study personnel from the middle or index finger using a single-use lancet with a 1.5-mm wide and 2.0-mm deep cut. In the Exeter cohort, a secondary unsupervised capillary blood collection was carried out by all participants on the same day.

The Capitainer B50 and Capitainer SEP-10 cards collect 50 μl and 70 μl of capillary whole blood, respectively. In the SEP-10 cards, blood cells are separated from the whole blood generating 10 μl of a plasma-like sample. Whole blood and plasma-like spots are left to dry at room temperature for 30 min. The Telimmune Plasma Separation Card does not restrict blood volume and 50 μl of capillary whole blood, equivalent to 6 μl of plasma-like sample, was pipetted from the finger to the card to standardize collection volume. Telimmune Plasma Separation Cards were left to dry for 3 min, then the cell separation membrane layer was removed, and the samples were left to dry for additional 30 min. After drying, all cards were stored at room temperature and shipped without temperature control or cooling on a regular basis to the Neurochemistry Laboratory, Gothenburg, Sweden. Before analysis, one filter disk from Capitainer B50 and Capitainer SEP-10 cards and both filter disks from the Telimmune Plasma Separation Cards were removed from the card using a semi-automated spot collector (Capitainer AB), and transferred to a deep 96-well plate (Sirocco protein precipitation plate, Waters). Samples were then incubated shaking with 170–300 μl of protein extraction buffer depending on the analyte of interest and at 37 °C and 500 rpm for 30 min; for p-tau217 quantification, filter papers were eluted with 170 μl buffer for all card types (Quanterix, catalogue number 105909); for N2PE and N4PE assays, Capitainer B50 filter papers were eluted with 300 μL and Telimmune filter papers with 170 μl of analyte-specific buffer (Quanterix, catalogue numbers 103659 (N4PE) and 103516 (N2PB)). After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 20 °C and 2,626g for 15 min and the eluate was collected in a conical 96-well plate (Quanterix). After spinning, the filter disks and protein precipitation plate were discarded, and the eluate was immediately used for biomarker analysis in singlecates by Simoa technology on the HD-X platform using a neat protocol (ALZpath Simoa pTau-217 v2 Assay3 (Quanterix, catalogue number 104371), Simoa Neurology 4-plex E (Quanterix, catalogue number 103607) or Simoa Neurology 2-plex B (Quanterix, catalogue number 103520).

Venous plasma samples collected by venipuncture and CSF collected by lumbar puncture are summarized for each cohort37,38,39,40,41,42. Before immunoassay procedures, venous EDTA plasma samples were thawed for 45 min at room temperature, vortexed for 30 s at 2,000 rpm and centrifuged at 4,000g and 20 °C for 10 min. Venous plasma samples were analyzed in singlecates with the same immunoassays using standard operating procedures, except for the Malmö cohort where venous plasma p-tau217 was quantified using an immunoassay on the Meso Scale Discovery platform developed by Lilly2. CSF biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40 or Aβ42/p-tau181) were analyzed by either Lumipulse G1200 (Fujirebio) or Elecsys e801 analyzers (Roche Diagnostics).

For the Gothenburg cohort, paired capillary blood extracts and venous plasma samples were measured in the same experiment. In all other cohorts, for logistic reasons, capillary blood extracts were measured prospectively with the accompanying venous plasma samples measured in a single batch at the end of the study. High and low dried blood quality controls were developed for p-tau217, GFAP and NfL on Capitainer SEP-10 filter disks. Dried blood quality controls were extracted on the day of each experiment and measured in duplicates at the beginning and end of each plate. Moreover, additional high and low venous plasma controls were run in duplicates at the beginning and end of each plate. Here, the inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was <17% for DPS and <15% for venous plasma p-tau217; the intra-assay CV was <15% for DPS p-tau217 and <7% for venous plasma p-tau217; the inter-assay CV for NfL and GFAP was <22% for DPS and <15% for venous plasma; and the intra-assay CV for NfL and GFAP was <11% for DPS and <10% for venous plasma (Supplementary Table 3).

To test the potential of capillary dried blood collection as self-sampling method, participants in the Exeter cohort underwent a second independently performed sampling session using Capitainer SEP-10, Capitainer B50 and Telimmune cards. During the first collection carried out by the study personnel, participants observed the sampling process and were handed written instructions (short text boxes and pictograms). Participants were then left alone with the instructions and performed the capillary dried blood collection independently (n = 44 pairs for DPS p-tau217; n = 18 pairs for DBS GFAP).

Demographic information from participants were summarized with descriptive statistics, with mean and s.d. for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables. For visualizing associations between capillary dried blood spot biomarkers and variables of interest, we used scatterplots and presented a mean linear regression line to represent trends in associations. To numerically quantify and compare these associations, we used Spearman's rho. To visualize between-group differences in DBS biomarkers, we plotted individual data points overlaid with boxplots. When group comparisons were made, we used linear models adjusted for age, sex and center (when applicable), and obtained P values from post-hoc Tukey contrasts between the levels of categorical variables. P values and 95% CIs were presented or described when appropriate. When evaluating biomarker discriminative ability for binary outcomes such as CSF biomarker positivity, we computed the AUC of receiver operating characteristics and used the DeLong test when receiver operating characteristic curves were compared. When evaluating diagnostic properties of DPS p-tau217, we assessed cutoffs derived with 90% sensitivity, 90% specificity or maximum Youdens' Index for CSF or venous plasma biomarker positivity and computed their respective NPV and PPV based on the prevalence of biomarker positivity in the subset of participants with available data for each analysis. Statistical significance was set as a two-sided alpha = 0.05. We did not control for multiple comparisons, and statistical significance was interpreted taking this into consideration. All analyses were performed in R v.4.2.1 (2022-06-23) on macOS 15.6.1.

Scatterplots display the relationship between venous plasma p-tau217 (y-axis) and capillary p-tau217 (x-axis), stratified in each panel according to the cohort in which biomarkers were measured. Spearman correlation coefficients are displayed alongside their p-values and a mean regression line with 95% confidence intervals. Of note, all venous plasma and capillary p-tau217 measurements were performed with the ALZpath assay, with the Malmö cohort being the exception, where the venous plasma values were acquired with the Lilly MSD assay, hence different correlation magnitudes. Number of individuals in each plot is presented in the figure. Statistical tests were two-sided. P-tau 217 = Phosphorylated tau 217.

Source data

Scatterplots representing the association between venous plasma (y-axis) and capillary (x-axis) p-tau217 values, stratified by tertiles (n = 84 for each panel; A, in the first venous plasma tertile; B, in the second venous plasma tertile; and C, in the third venous plasma tertile) of plasma p-tau217 distribution so as to visualize the magnitude of venous plasma-capillary correlation across different concentration strata. Spearman correlation coefficients are shown alongside their p-values and a mean regression line with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical tests were two-sided. P-tau 217 = Phosphorylated tau 217.

Source data

ROC curve representing the discriminative accuracies of capillary (red) and venous plasma (brown) p-tau217 for abnormal CSF Aβ42/p-tau181 values based on a dataset of individuals with paired venous plasma p-tau217, capillary p-tau217 and CSF data (n = 176). In their correspondent colors, AUCs and their 95% confidence intervals are displayed as text. Statistical tests were two-sided. Aβ = Amyloid-β; AUC = Area under the curve; CI = Confidence interval; CSF = Cerebrospinal fluid; p-tau = Phosphorylated tau; ROC = Receiver operating characteristic.

Source data

Venous plasma p-tau217 levels (y-axis) are displayed with boxplots according to the clinical-biological groups, which combine clinical diagnosis with the CSF Aβ42/p-tau181 status of participants (CU Aβ–, n = 12; CU Aβ+, n = 1; MCI Aβ+, n = 48; AD Aβ+, n = 37; non-AD Aβ+, n = 6; MCI Aβ–, n = 39; AD Aβ–, n = 2; non-AD Aβ–, n = 14). P-values for between-group comparisons were obtained with post-hoc contrasts from linear models adjusted for age and sex and Tukey's adjustment was used. Boxplots show the median (center line), interquartile range (box limits, 25th–75th percentiles), whiskers extending to the most extreme values within 1.5×IQR from the quartiles. Statistical tests were two-sided. Aβ = Amyloid-β; AD = Alzheimer's disease; CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; CU = Cognitively unimpaired; IQR = Interquartile range; MCI = Mild cognitive impairment; p-tau = Phosphorylated tau.

In twisted van der Waals materials, local atomic relaxation can alter the underlying electronic structure. Characterizing lattice reconstruction and its susceptibility to strain is essential for understanding emergent electronic states, especially in multilayers in which interference between moiré lattices yields larger supermoiré patterns whose energy is highly sensitive to local stacking. Here we image spatial modulations in the electronic character of helical trilayer graphene, which indicate relaxation into a superstructure of large domains with uniform moiré periodicity. We show that the supermoiré domain size is increased by strain and can be altered in the same device while preserving the local properties within each domain. Finally, we observe a higher conductance at the domain boundaries, consistent with predictions that they host counterpropagating edge modes. Our work provides a real-space visualization of moiré-periodic domains, reveals two independently tunable length scales and demonstrates strain engineering as a route towards designing correlated topological networks at the supermoiré scale.

Schematic of the local stacking configurations within h and \(\bar{h}\) domains and AAA sites. The domains exhibit moiré-periodic order: a honeycomb lattice of alternating AAB and BAA stackings (orange and purple, respectively) with uniform moiré wavelength λM, surrounded by local ABA stacking (white). The h and \(\bar{h}\) domains are related by a C2z transformation. The outermost schematics show the corresponding local real-space alignment of the bottom, middle, and top graphene layers in red, green, and blue, respectively. Here, A and B refer to the sublattices of the monolayer graphene honeycomb lattices.

a, Optical micrograph of the sample overlaid with the rasterized trajectory of the SET tip. b, dμ/dn at T = 1.6 K in the vicinity of ν = 4 along the trajectory in a. A single peak is observed throughout. c, Spatial map of θ determined from the location of the ν = 4 peak in b. θ varies by less than 0. 1∘ across the entire area, highlighting the high degree of uniformity in the device.

a-c, Spatial dependence of dμ/dn in a 1 × 1 μm2 area of the sample at ν = 4 (a), ν = − 4 (b) and ν = 0 (c). Scale bar: 250 nm. Similar supermoiré modulations are visible for each incompressible state. This is consistent with the theoretical expectations that valley-contrasting domain boundary modes are present for each of these states. Data measured at T = 1.6 K for ∣ν∣ = 4 and at T = 330 mK for ν = 0.

Spatial dependence of dμ/dn at T = 330 mK in a 1 × 1 μm2 area of the sample for different incompressible states, respectively labeled by their Chern number C and zero-field intercept (C, ν). Scale bar: 250 nm. Similar supermoiré modulations occur in all cases. This is again consistent with theoretical expectations that the valley-contrasting domain boundary modes are also stable in the presence of a magnetic field.

Blue dots are data and the dark blue curve is a Gaussian fit. b, Map of the spatial distribution of Δn. Scale bar: 500 nm. c, The corresponding local twist angle disorder Δθ = θ(nmax + Δn/2) − θ(nmax − Δn/2), where nmax is the density where the Gaussian peak is maximized and θ(n) is given by the equation in the “Twist angle determination"" subsection in the Methods. From the data, we estimate the median Δθ across the sample to be Δθ = 0.012∘. This is (up to factors of order unity) an effective bound on the overall twist angle variability on length scales smaller than the ~ 100 nm spatial resolution of the SET probe. Notably, Δθ exhibits a periodic spatial dependence at the supermoiré scale. It is enhanced along domain boundaries and maximized at the AAA sites, while it is minimized within the domains. This observation is consistent with theoretical calculations of the relaxed HTG lattice structure: within the domains, the system is expected to be moiré-periodic and can be characterized by a single (relaxed) twist angle, whereas at the domain walls and AAA sites, the lattice structure is predicted to be moiré-aperiodic. The aperiodicity is expected to be larger at the AAA sites than at the domain walls. The black dashed lines indicate the domain walls, while black dots at their intersections correspond to the AAA sites.

Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a highly aggressive and untreatable pediatric cancer primarily arising in the pontine brainstem region, necessitating the development of representative models for treatment advance. Here we developed an FGF4-driven human brainstem organoid model, which we used to genetically engineer H3.3K27M-altered DMG. We demonstrated that brainstem pontine glial specification is critical for DMG tumorigenesis, yielding infiltrative tumors that recapitulate patient-representative intratumoral heterogeneity. Prolonged GD2 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell treatment mirrored clinical outcomes and revealed extensive transcriptional heterogeneity, from which both potent effector and dysfunctional CAR T cell populations could be identified. Furthermore, incorporation of myeloid cells generated DMG-specific microglia that reduced treatment efficacy and revealed CAR T cell functional states most vulnerable to microglia-mediated immunosuppression. Thus, we present a representative DMG model offering a months-long experimental window in vitro, which we leveraged to delineate CAR T cell functionality and microglial impact, aiding therapy development for this devastating disease.

Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are rare and aggressive pediatric brain tumors often caused by somatic mutations in histone 3 (H3) genes, commonly a K27M substitution1, occurring at a high prevalence in the pons region of the brainstem2. Primarily, affecting children under 10 years3, they present the highest mortality rate of any cancer, with a median overall survival of only 9–15 months4,5. This detrimental prognosis necessitates a better understanding of the disease's biology to develop effective treatments.

Single-cell analyses of H3K27M-altered DMG revealed intratumoral heterogeneity, with a spectrum of tumor cell profiles ranging from stalled stem-like oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC-like) to more differentiated astrocyte (AC-like) and oligodendrocyte (OC-like) phenotypes, which closely resemble normal developmental cell types, alongside a recently identified mesenchymal-like (MES-like) state6,7,8. In addition, insights from both animal9,10,11 and human pluripotent stem-cell-derived12,13 studies suggest an early neurodevelopmental window of tumor initiation. Thus, dysregulated mechanisms during hindbrain development10,14,15, particularly involving glial progenitors in the region responsible for brainstem pons formation16, likely have a central role in driving H3K27M-altered gliomagenesis. Capturing this region-specific embryonic patterning is, therefore, crucial for accurately modeling pontine DMG. Furthermore, previous work identified a tight relationship between DMG progression and its unique environment, including neuron and synaptic signaling17,18,19, which can promote glioma growth20.

Human brain organoids have become valuable in vitro tools for investigating brain development and understanding the onset, progression and potential therapeutic targeting of nervous system disorders, including cancer21,22,23. Given the rarity and inoperable nature of DMG, which limits the availability of patients participant material2, organoids could offer a scalable model for generating DMG tumors de novo and enabling in vitro testing of emerging therapies. This includes the latest advances in immunotherapy for DMG, GD2 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells5, which showed promising, yet variable treatment outcomes between patients in a recent clinical trial24. Correlative data from this trial suggest that an expansion of the immunosuppressive myeloid compartment coincides with unfavorable treatment outcomes25. Uncovering the functional profiles of CAR T cells and their interplay with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment may offer key insights to improve their therapeutic outcomes in DMG.

Here, we report a human cerebral guided organoid model for the brainstem region, enriched for pontine medulla glial lineages. Genetic modeling of H3.3K27M-altered DMG in these brainstem-regionalized organoids (BrOs) replicates the infiltrative nature and transcriptomic landscape of DMG. We demonstrate the utility of this accessible human DMG organoid model (DMGO) for modeling CAR T cell functional heterogeneity during prolonged treatment (up to 1 month) and within the context of brain-resident microglia.

To generate human organoids with appropriate hindbrain brainstem identity for DMG modeling, we applied sequential morphogen guidance using a timely sequence of Wnt, dual SMAD inhibitors, retinoic acid (RA), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). While FGF2 and FGF8 can be used in combination with RA and Wnt to pattern the midbrain26, cerebellum27 or spinal cord28 in growing organoids, we evaluated FGF4 because of its role in specifying rostral hindbrain, particularly in the pontine area29,30, as well as its involvement in the development of hindbrain-specific serotonergic neurons31. A direct comparison of replacing common FGF2 supplementation with FGF4 after 7 days of patterning demonstrated that 10 ng ml−1 FGF4 specifically promotes developing the pontine, including the prepontine to retropontine area, according to bulk sequencing data (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2). Furthermore, among HOX genes important for hindbrain formation, expression of HOXB1, a marker of pontine precursor cells32, emerged already at an early stage (day 14) (Extended Data Fig. 1c) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging revealed HOXB1-expressing cells within early neurodevelopmental SOX2+ neural rosette structures (Fig. 1c). Bulk sequencing analysis from day 7 to day 84 showed that the patterning remained consistent and reproducible across and within multiple batches, as well as between human embryonic stem cell (hES cell) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell) sources (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e).

Source data

To investigate cellular composition and regional identities at higher resolution, we performed time-course single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) across eight time points, spanning from day 5 to day 120 (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). Following quality control (Extended Data Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 3) and doublet filtering, we recovered 55,327 high-quality cells. Spatial similarity mapping using VoxHunt33, a tool based on Mus musculus in situ hibridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas, confirmed a hindbrain identity with a more pronounced pontine signature (Fig. 1d). We next generated an integrated uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) representation of the different time points and performed cell-based annotation using reference datasets, including the recently published Human Neural Organoid Cell Atlas (HNOCA)34 and the Human Developing Brain Cell Atlas (HDBCA)35,36 (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2c–g). Temporal analysis revealed an initial phase of high proliferation that diminished over time (Extended Data Fig. 3a), as cells transitioned from pluripotent stem cells to the neuroepithelium and radial glial cells, as well as into distinct neuronal and glial populations that emerged by days 14 and 60, respectively (Fig. 1f), reflecting the natural occurring segregation of neurogenesis and gliogenesis phases35. Projection of the organoid dataset onto the HNOCA that was regionally annotated for neuronal lineages (Fig. 1g) revealed that most neuronal precursor cells, neuroblasts and neurons originated from a heterogeneous nontelencephalic cluster with enrichment for midbrain, pons and medulla regions (Fig. 1h), which collectively form the brainstem37. These neuroblasts and early neurons expressed STMN2 and RBFOX3 (NeuN) but lacked the telencephalic marker FOXG1 (ref. 35) (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Furthermore, neurotransmitter transporter analysis revealed a predominance of excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons, the latter known to form synapses with DMG and promote its growth17,18. Smaller proportions of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons were also detected, consistent with their distribution in the HDBCA (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis identified cells expressing tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Extended Data Fig. 3e), a key enzyme involved in serotonergic synthesis, suggesting that, albeit undetectable at the scRNA-seq level similar to the HDBCA35, this population of neurons is present. Thus, consistent with HNOCA and adult brain data showing greater heterogeneity and intermixing among nontelencephalic neurons, including hypothalamic, brainstem and hindbrain neurons (referred to as splatter neurons) compared to cortical neurons34,38, our organoid model recapitulates this regional diversity, with an enrichment in brainstem identity compared to profiles described in most HNOCA protocols.

DMG is rooted in the glial lineage8, prompting us to investigate the glial composition within our BrO model. First, we showed the presence of committed ACs (GFAP+AQP4+) and OCs (OLIG2+) at the protein level (Extended Data Fig. 3f). At the single-cell transcriptomic level, we identified glial populations spanning pre-OPCs, OPCs, committed OC precursors, glioblasts and ACs, offering a detailed representation of glial diversity and maturation states (Fig. 1e). By comparing age-matched cells of HNOCA-covered protocols, BrOs showed significant enrichment in the glial lineage, particularly glioblasts and OPCs (Fig. 1h). Additionally, we assessed glycolysis, an indicator of cell stress in brain organoids34. Consistent with models described in the HNOCA, we observed similar glycolysis levels (Extended Data Fig. 3g). However, in the glial lineage, glycolysis levels were lower (Extended Data Fig. 3h), suggesting reduced stress and a healthier metabolic state of glial cells in BrOs. Moreover, OPC (referred to as oligo in the HDBCA35) and glioblast populations demonstrated a reduced number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to HNOCA datasets (Extended Data Fig. 3i), reflecting higher transcriptional fidelity and closer alignment with primary counterparts in the HBDCA35. To date, no comprehensive region-wide analysis has been conducted on glial cells derived from organoids. However, the HBDCA revealed strong region specificity in the glial lineage during early brain development, which may be particularly relevant for H3.3K27M-altered DMG in the brainstem pontine region. Projection of the BrO datasets onto the HBDCA latent space (Extended Data Fig. 3j,k) and comparison to organoid protocols embedded in the HNCOA revealed significant coverage of glial clusters in BrOs. Notably, 13 of the 19 gained clusters exhibited pontine and medulla-specific identities (Fig. 1i,j and Extended Data Fig. 3j,k). Thus, our newly generated BrO model offers an experimental framework for studying gliogenesis within the context of pontine medulla regionality, offering relevance for DMG modeling.

We next investigated whether BrOs could be exploited to model DMG tumors. Plasmids11 expressing the most common H3.3K27M-defining DMG mutation39, alongside typical accompanying and pons-specific tumor suppressor TP53 and platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFRA) alterations3,40,41, were introduced using in situ electroporation of developing BrOs (Fig. 1a). This mutation cocktail has been shown to be time sensitive in in utero electroporation mouse models9,11,42; hence, we tested different time points of electroporation between days 11 and 28. We identified day 11 as the time point most efficiently inducing tumorigenic growth (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 4a), reinforcing the concept of a restricted early developmental time window for DMG transformation9,11. At this stage of development, we observed a dominance of radial glia and neuroepithelial stem-like cells in BrOs (Fig. 1f), aligning with earlier work identifying neural stem cells as a permissive cell state for H3.3K27M-driven neoplastic transformation9,11,12,13,14. Tracking tumor growth over 2 months showed that the resulting tumors display infiltrative growth (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the use of empty control plasmids resulted in only a few localized electroporated cells (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Whole-organoid 3D imaging at week 16 (4 months after electroporation) with tumors color-coded for invasion depth further confirmed a diffuse growth pattern characteristic of DMG (Fig. 2c). In addition, DMGOs orthotopically transplanted in immunodeficient mice were able to progress in vivo, demonstrating invasive growth (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Quantification of H3.3K27M expression, combined with dominant-negative TP53 (DNp53) and PDGFRA-D842V at the protein level, showed incorporation of all three mutations into the majority of GFP-positive cells (Fig. 2d–f). These findings illustrate DMG invasive outgrowth in our guided brain organoids dependent on combined common driver mutations typically observed.

Source data

To further assess the representability of our in vitro grown tumor model (DMGO), we conducted histological comparisons to patient samples sharing the same mutational profile. This showed that H3.3K27M cells (H3K27M+) display loss in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in both patient samples and DMGOs (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e), a hallmark of H3K27-altered DMG1,39. Furthermore, our in vitro grown tumors exhibited a global methylation profile closely resembling DMG, distinguishing our tumors from glioblastoma and posterior fossa (PFA1 and PFA2) epyndomas, which present with a similar loss of H3K27M trimethylation caused by H3K27M substitution or EZHIP overexpression, respectively43 (Fig. 2g). We next conducted scRNA-seq profiling of sorted GFP+ tumor cells and, after quality control filtering, analyzed approximately 7,000 cells from 14 DMGOs (Fig. 2h, Extended Data Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Table 4). The malignant state of these cells was further supported by the analysis of inferred copy-number variation (iCNV) from scRNA-seq data, which showed large-scale amplifications and deletions in these cells compared to healthy cells, including losses of chromosomes 10 and 13 and a gain of chromosome 19q (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Using published DMG references6,8, we first annotated cancer cell states previously described for DMG, including OPC-like, AC-like and MES-like cell states and a population of cycling cells. In line with the early developmental window of our model, we identified only few cells with a more mature OC-like phenotype. Importantly, we identified a major proportion of OPC-like tumor cells that resembled recently defined OPC-like 2 and 3 states, both described as pediatric and pons-specific pre-OPC states8 (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 5d–f). Furthermore, we found the highest similarity score between DMGOs and primary DMG patient material6, as opposed to cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and material from patients with glioblastoma6 or both PFA subtypes44 (Fig. 2i). Together, this highlights the ability of DMGOs to closely resemble primary DMG tumors.

We investigated the mechanisms driving tumorigenesis to identify the attributes of BrOs that appear to be critical for supporting the growth of DMG tumors. We used TrackerSeq, a PiggyBac-based genetic lineage-tracing approach (Extended Data Fig. 6a), and analyzed cancer clone dynamics at 2 months after electroporation. We retrieved 167 unique barcodes from six DMGOs and two healthy BrOs (Extended Data Fig. 6b–h and Supplementary Table 5) and detected individual clones spanning up to approximately 800 cells per barcode, indicative of cancerous transformation (Extended Data Fig. 6i,j). By comparing large versus small, traced clones (Fig. 3a,b) through DEG and METASCAPE analysis, we identified glial specification as a critical feature driving cancer clone expansion in contrast to neuronal specification enriched in smaller clones (for example, synapse organization and modulation of chemical synaptic transmission) (Fig. 3a,b). Larger clones were characterized by higher gene expression of OLIG1, a canonical OPC marker, as well as IER2, JUNB, FOS and EGR1, previously described as key markers of the OPC-like 3 pre-OPC state8. Interestingly, we also identified a higher expression of AQP1, an aquaporin previously shown to be exclusive to ACs in the human brainstem45. Furthermore, analysis of patient data7 revealed AQP1 expression in tumors located in the pons but not in those arising from the cortex or thalamic regions (Extended Data Fig. 6k). These data hint toward a glial-specific tumorigenic process that is, furthermore, dependent on pontine location. This is further illustrated by genes upregulated in large DMG tumor clones mapping back to the glial lineage of BrOs (Fig. 3c), indicating that tumorigenesis is dependent on gliogenesis. To confirm this experimentally, we performed in situ electroporation of our mutation cocktail in unguided cerebral organoids, revealing a reduction in tumor induction (Fig. 3d). In addition, the outgrowth was nondiffuse, with almost no GFP-positive tumorigenic cells carrying the H3.3K27M substitution (Fig. 3e,f). These findings demonstrate that H3.3K27M-driven tumorigenesis depends on the correct anatomical cell identity, which our BrO model recapitulates. Consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 6l,m) and lineage relationship analysis identified malignant metagene programs 1 and 2 to be present in the highest number of clones (30 and 26 of 34 clones, respectively; Fig. 3h) and belonging to the OPC-like lineage, emphasizing the central role of this lineage in H3K27M DMG tumorigenesis8. More specifically, we show overlap with the pre-OPC state, OPC-like 2 (Extended Data Fig. 6m). In the context of human early gestation, regionally distinct gene signatures for the glial lineage have been suggested to underlie the strong region-specific occurrence pattern of glial-related diseases, such as DMG35. In line with this, both programs 1 and 2 specifically enrich for the hindbrain pons OC precursor lineage35, as opposed to midbrain and forebrain lineages (Fig. 3i). Collectively, these findings highlight the role of pons glial specification, captured in BrOs, in driving DMG tumorigenesis, emphasizing the need for spatial and developmental precision in modeling DMG and establishing a human-relevant experimental system for therapeutic testing.

Given the relevant tumor progression observed in DMGOs, we evaluated their potential as a human in vitro platform for preclinical testing of GD2 CAR T cells (Fig. 1a), motivated by promising yet variable treatment outcomes in a recent first clinical trial in patients with H3K27M-mutant DMG24,25. By exposing untransformed BrOs to GD2 CAR T cells, we first visually inspected with brightfield imaging that the presence of GD2 CAR T cells did not affect the general health of the model (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Next, we confirmed GD2 target expression in DMGO (Extended Data Fig. 7b) and tumor cell killing through confocal imaging of cleaved caspase 3 in GFP+ tumor cells (Fig. 4a). Having established these experimental preconditions, we treated DMGOs 4 months after tumor induction by administrating CD8+ GD2 CAR T cells on days 0 and 7 and monitored T cell activation, measured by interferon-γ (IFNγ) secretion (Extended Data Fig. 7c) and tumor control (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e) over time. Similar to heterogeneous outcomes reported in individuals24,25, we observed an overall partial reduction in tumor burden (Fig. 4b) and heterogeneous response rates over time and between individual DMGOs (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e). As GD2 CAR T cell activation was evident by a robust IFNγ response for all treated DMGOs (Extended Data Fig. 7c), limited response profiles (for example, DMGO179) are unlikely to result from a lack of antigen recognition. Therapy effects could be detected after >1 month of treatment (Fig. 4c), offering advantages for modeling CAR T cell functionality in vitro in a manner that is representative of T cell states at the tumor site in vivo, including potential exhaustion profiles associated with prolonged tumor exposure. To test our model for this purpose, we sequenced over 20,000 GD2 CAR T cells retrieved from DMGOs, as well as unexposed GD2 CAR T cells (Supplementary Table 6). This revealed a substantial level of heterogeneity induced upon DMGO exposure (Fig. 4d). In GD2 CAR T cells retrieved from DMGOs, we identified nine transcriptional states (Fig. 4e) that, on the basis of a combined interrogation of curated gene signatures (Extended Data Fig. 8a), DEGs, DEG-associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Extended Data Fig. 8b–f), expression of canonical immune effector (Fig. 4f) and exhaustion markers (Fig. 4g) and comparison to a pan-cancer tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) dataset including brain malignancies46 (Extended Data Fig. 8g), reflected different T cell activation, differentiation and effector states. For instance, we identified a GD2 CAR T cell population that, albeit activated (on the basis of HLA gene expression) (Extended Data Fig. 8a), does not fully differentiate toward effector function (undifferentiated; TUND) (Extended Data Fig. 8b,h), as well as an IL-2-responsive population (TIL-2) (Extended Data Fig. 8c,i), probably differentiating into effector T cells (Extended Data Fig. 8i). In addition, we observed an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)-expressing population (TISG) (Extended Data Fig. 8a), corresponding to ISG-expressing TILs46 (Extended Data Fig. 8j) and considered as an interferon-induced activation state47,48. Other clusters included a CAR T cell population with migrating properties and interconnectivity that appeared to be influenced by its neuronal environment (Extended Data Fig. 8d), as well as proliferating (TPR) (Extended Data Fig. 8e) and metabolically stressed T cells (TMS) (Extended Data Fig. 8a,f). Importantly, we distinguished potential DMG-targeting effector T cell populations on the basis of their cytotoxic profile (Fig. 4f) and putative level of exhaustion (Fig. 4g). While one of these clusters predominantly expressed GZMK (TGZK), cytotoxic T cells (TCYT) expressed GZMB, PRF1 and IFNG (Fig. 4f). In contrast, exhausted T cells (TEX) displayed reduced IFNG and concomitant expression of immune checkpoint genes, LAG3, HAVCR2, TIGIT (ref. 49) and SELPLG50, as well as the transcriptional repressor PRDM1 associated with exhaustion51 (Fig. 4g). Weekly CAR T cell administration (days 0 and 7) did not improve TEX reduction or TCYT enrichment over a single dose (Extended Data Fig. 9a), indicating that exhaustion may set on as early as day 7.

To confirm that exhaustion detected in our DMGO model reflects representative T cell exhaustion at the tumor site, we compared the TEX phenotype present upon DMGO exposure to preexposure GD2 CAR T cells that, although alleviated by the 4-1BB endodomain, can still display exhaustion features resulting from tonic signaling52. Indeed, a fraction of preexposure GD2 CAR T cells overlapped with our TEX cluster detected upon DMGO exposure (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). However, separating the cells in this cluster according to experimental condition (Extended Data Fig. 9c) revealed that DMGO-exposed TEX upregulated a wide array of additional exhaustion markers (Fig. 4h), as well as known transcription factors and functional modulators of exhaustion (Fig. 4i) that include those described in cancer patients across TIL datasets (Supplementary Table 7). In addition, overlap with exhaustion markers found in the antigen-driven lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus mouse model of chronic infection53,54, as well as an in vitro model of CAR T cell dysfunction based on continuous antigen exposure55, demonstrates that the observed exhaustion profile is antigen driven (Supplementary Table 7). For in vitro model systems, this has not been achieved in the context of naturally expressed tumor antigen, only through persistent anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody stimulation56 or by using repeated rounds of stimulation with antigen- pulsed57 or overexpressing58 tumor cell lines55. Thus, DMGOs model the functional heterogeneity of CAR T cells, including representative T cell functional exhaustion, an actionable axis for improving outcomes59 and, therefore, critical factor to evaluate preclinically.

Consistent with their potent cytotoxicity and lack of exhaustion, the TCYT population overlaps with the ‘killer' gene signature of ‘super-engager' engineered T cells that we recently identified to have profound tumor-targeting capacity and serial killing behavior in a short-term coculture assay60 (Fig. 4j). As we previously identified NCAM1 as a selection marker to enrich for this population60, we exploited this strategy (Fig. 1a) to further investigate the relevance of this CAR T cell functional profile in a prolonged treatment setting. We sorted GD2 CAR T cells on the basis of NCAM1 expression before DMGO treatment (Extended Data Fig. 9d) and compared tumor control between NCAM1+ and NCAM1− cells (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 9e). This demonstrated the initial potent antitumor activity of NCAM1+ GD2 CAR T cells, with a 1.4-fold enrichment in tumor control over NCAM1− GD2 CAR T cells on day 2. However, this enhanced potency stabilized between days 5 and 7, with NCAM1− T cells displaying more gradual antitumor activity over time, slightly outperforming NCAM1+ cells by day 7 (Fig. 4k), in line with a higher recovery of NCAM1− cells at day 14 (Extended Data Fig. 9f). To gain insight into potential transcriptomic profiles explaining these differential outcomes, we performed scRNA-seq of NCAM1− and NCAM1+ GD2 CAR T cells and mapped them back to our previously identified GD2 CAR T cell signatures (Extended Data Fig. 9g). This revealed an additional stressed GD2 CAR T cell cluster specific to NCAM1− cells (THS) (Fig. 4l and Extended Data Fig. 9h) that differed from the TMS cluster through expression of heat-shock proteins (Supplementary Table 8) and overlapped with the stress response state identified in TILs that associates with immunotherapy resistance46 (Extended Data Fig. 9i). Further aligning with the initially enhanced tumor control observed (Fig. 4k), NCAM1+ cells showed a 3.3-fold enrichment in TCYT compared to NCAM1− cells (Fig. 4l). However, in line with poor persistence of the cells (Extended Data Fig. 9f), NCAM1+ T cells were additionally enriched for TEX (Fig. 4l), explaining their reduced performance over time (Fig. 4k). Together, this identified NCAM1+ cells as a potent tumor-targeting, yet short-lived effector GD2 CAR T cell population and offers proof of concept for cell selection as a means to narrow CAR T cell functional heterogeneity before administration.

The upregulation of features associated with tissue residency48, including the canonical marker CD103 (ITGAE) used to identify tissue-resident T cells61,62 (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 7), underscores the capacity of DMGOs to model T cell performance within tissue. While this may inform strategies to enhance CAR T cell trafficking and tissue residency63, DMGOs lack the myeloid compartment, a key regulator of T cell responses. Therefore, to enhance the complexity of DMGOs, we incorporated microglia, a main component of the DMG tumor microenvironment8. We generated primitive macrophage progenitors (PMPs) from hES cells, previously shown to differentiate into mature microglia in mouse brains64 and human midbrain organoids65, as well as in coculture with neurons66. PMPs similarly integrated into BrOs and, within 7 days, adopted the ramified morphology characteristic of homeostatic microglia67 (Fig. 5b,c). Confirming functional maturation, the cells displayed typical microglia behavior, migrating to sites of myelin injection (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Video 1) and removing myelin through phagocytosis68 (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Video 2). Furthermore, 3 weeks after incorporation in BrOs, above 80% of cells expressed the microglia-specific marker P2RY12 at the protein level (Fig. 5f,g) and scRNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Table 9) demonstrated increased expression of microglia-specific transcription factors69,70 (Fig. 5h). Additionally, they resembled an adult state when referenced against microglia developmental programs identified in mice71 (Fig. 5i), further validating microglia maturation. Comparison to a myeloid cell reference dataset from DMG tumors72 confirmed microglia as opposed to macrophage identity (Fig. 5j).

Microglia incorporation in tumor-bearing DMGOs led to the acquisition of recently described DMG-associated functional phenotypes72, including an IFN-activated, phago lipid and hypoxic state (Fig. 5k). Moreover, compared to BrOs, microglia from DMGOs showed enrichment of GO terms related to antigen presentation and immune responses, such as peptide processing mediated by major histocompatibility complex class II and type I IFN response, previously described as upregulated in DMG-associated microglia and macrophages73 (Extended Data Fig. 10a). These DMG-specific microglia states were accompanied by reduced chemokine expression and upregulation of genes associated with an immunosuppressive profile, in line with patient data72 (Fig. 5l). This was confirmed by protein expression of CD163, associated with an anti-inflammatory state, and SPP1, associated with immunosuppressive lipid-laden macrophages74 (Extended Data Fig. 10b,c). Together, these findings show that, within an appropriate neuronal environment, PMPs differentiate into mature microglia that, in the presence, of DMG tumor cells adopt a DMG-specific immunosuppressive phenotype.

Correlative clinical data suggest that expansion of the immunosuppressive myeloid compartment may be associated with poor GD2 CAR T cell outcomes25 and myeloid cells, including microglia, are also implicated in CAR T cell-induced toxicity75. To address this experimentally, we performed GD2 CAR T cell treatment in DMGOs with integrated microglia. Confocal imaging showed interactions between GD2 CAR T cells and microglia within tumors (Fig. 6a). Moreover, we observed increased cytokine secretion in the presence of both GD2 CAR T cells and integrated microglia (Fig. 6b). This included upregulated chemokines related to myeloid cell chemotaxis, including MCP3 and CXCL1, as well as myeloid-cell-associated growth factors, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). We also observed elevated interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-6 levels, key proinflammatory cytokines linked to CAR T cell (neuro)toxicity and clinically targeted to manage adverse effect24, suggesting that microglia-integrated DMGOs may serve as a relevant model to study CAR T cell–microglia interactions underlying treatment-related toxicity. Furthermore, analysis of DMGO-induced CAR T cell transcriptional heterogeneity in the presence of microglia (Extended Data Fig. 10d and Fig. 6c), showed an increased proportion of the exhausted cluster and identified a microglia-affected GD2 CAR T cell population (TMA), aligning with undifferentiated TILs, as well as naive and tissue-resident memory cells, from the pan-cancer TIL atlas46 (Extended Data Fig. 10e). To validate the low effector profile of the TMA population, we compared curated gene signatures from the same resource46 across GD2 CAR T cell clusters (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 10f). TMA cells showed reduced activation and effector signatures, including cytotoxicity, but higher senescence-related genes. Thus, the presence of microglia shifts the transcriptional profile of GD2 CAR T cells toward reduced effector function. In line with this, when we monitored CAR T cell-mediated tumor control, it was reduced in integrated-microglia DMGOs (Fig. 6e). Together, these findings demonstrated that microglia integrated in DMGOs yield a suitable representative phenotype for probing CAR T cell function and toxicity. This establishes a direct role for microglia in shaping CAR T cell functional states and impairing tumor control.

Here, we showed that morphogen-guided patterning with FGF4 and RA produces BrOs, characterized across region-specific neuronal and glial lineages through benchmarking against recent single-cell organoid and brain atlases34,35,36. BrOs enable spatial and temporal modeling of the developing brainstem, including pons-specific features, the regional origin and niche for H3.3K27M-altered DMG. We demonstrated an interplay between the H3.3K27M substitution and pontine glial fate in driving DMG tumorigenesis, resulting in an experimentally accessible organoid model that recapitulates features of DMG tumors. While DMG patient-derived organoids are emerging as platforms for drug testing60,76,77, our model offers a complementary approach to generate in vitro tumors for this rare and fatal disease, for which tissue samples are limited. Moreover, the use of iPS cells as a cell source establishes the potential for individualized modeling, supporting personalized drug evaluation and direct comparison to clinical outcomes. However, because the model is derived from hES cells and iPS cells, it is limited in recapitulating postnatal tissue, as reported for other neural organoids34,78. Furthermore, the current model does not capture complex intraregional interactions, which are particularly relevant in the pons—a key relay between the forebrain and motor or sensory pathways. Assembloid methodologies79,80, such as linking cortical organoids with BrOs and DMGOs, could improve neuronal health and lineage diversity while enabling modeling of DMG invasion and progression across brain regions in response to neural secretion18,81 and activity17,19,20,82. Such neuronal interplay should be further characterized in DMGOs in the future to validate the model for these critical processes, for instance, through live calcium imaging of synaptic signaling or retrograde labeling of GABAergic neurons using viral tracers17.

Despite current limitations, the model provides a therapeutically relevant platform to interrogate CAR T cell function in DMG tissue-specific context. Prolonged treatment of DMGOs reflects the variable outcomes seen in individuals24,25,83, revealing CAR T cell heterogeneity and functional exhaustion. From this heterogeneity, we identified the most potent yet short-lived CAR T cell population and validated a means to enrich for these cells, offering a potential approach to optimize therapy composition84. This model could also be leveraged to uncover how CAR T cells modulate cancer cell states and reveal mechanisms of acquired resistance that may be cotargeted to improve clinical efficacy.

Given the recognition that the tumor microenvironment can significantly impact treatment response, we integrated microglia, a key immune component in DMG70. In line with representative tumor cell states observed in DMGOs, microglia differentiated into DMG-specific and immunosuppressive profiles72. This enabled an experimental interrogation of microglia impact on CAR T cell functionality, revealing increased exhaustion and a TMA population, marked by stalled differentiation and low effector function. This shift toward dysfunction correlated with reduced tumor control, offering a framework to counteract microglia-induced resistance and enhance antitumor efficacy. While T cell exhaustion might be addressed through immune checkpoint inhibition, strategies targeting the newly identified TMA population require further investigation. Our imaging data revealing direct microglia–CAR T cell interactions, suggest that dissecting the underlying signaling involved could be a critical starting point. Furthermore, similar approaches could be used to assess microglial influence on tumor phenotypes, as prior studies linked MES tumor states to tumor-associated macrophages8.

Altogether, we generated a human brainstem organoid model for DMG with applications toward understanding CAR T cell functionality in the context of the tumor microenvironment that could aid further therapy development for this detrimental disease.

All murine experiments were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Body of the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology based on local and international regulations under CCD license AVD39900 202216507. For the use of DMG samples, patients and/or their parents or guardians provided written informed consent according to national laws and in agreement with the declaration of Helsinki (2013). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IVB) and registered under national registry number 2020.142.

Brain organoids were generated from three different cell lines encompassing H9 (WA09, WiCell) and H1 (WA01, WiCell) hES cells (both derived from human blastocysts85) and C7-a iPS cells (RUID 06C52463, derived from CD4+ T cells). The iPS cell line C7-a was obtained from Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository and contains a Cre-inducible H3.3K27M reading frame in the endogenous H3F3A locus13. Cell lines were cultured in mTeSR Plus medium (StemCell Technologies, 100-0276) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were grown on Matrigel-coated (Corning, 354277) six-well plates and passaged when 70–80% confluent by nonenzymatic detachment of colonies using Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (GCDR) (StemCell Technologies, 100-0485). All cell cultures were routinely tested for the presence of Mycoplasma species.

Cells were washed with 1× Dubecco's PBS (Gibco, 14190144), detached with GCDR and spun down at 300g for 5 min, before resuspending in base medium (1:1 advanced DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco, 12634010) and Neurobasal medium (Gibco, 10888022), supplemented with 1× GlutaMax (Gibco, 35050061)) and counting. A total of 70,000 cells per ml were added to day 0 medium (base medium, 10 µM Y-27632 (ROCKi, AbMole BioScience, M1817) and 4 ng ml−1 FGF2 (PeproTech, 100-18 C)). For EB formation, 7,000 cells in 100 µl of medium were seeded per well of an ultralow-attachment treated U-bottom 96-well plate (Nexcelom, ULA96U020; PHC Europe, MS-9096UZ) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. From day 2 to day 21, patterning medium (base medium, 1× N2 (Gibco, 17502048) and 1 mg ml−1 heparin solution (StemCell Technologies, 07980)) was used.

In week 1, week 1 medium (patterning medium, 50 ng ml−1 FGF2, 1 µM dorsomorphin (DM; StemCell Technologies, 72102), 10 µM SB431542 (SB43; StemCell Technologies, 72232) and 3 µM CHIR99021 (CHIR; StemCell Technologies, 72052)) was used. On day 2, 100 µl of week 1 medium was added per well. On day 5, 100 µl of medium per well was replaced with fresh week 1 medium. In the second week, week 2 medium (patterning medium, 1 µM DM, 10 µM SB43, 3 µM CHIR, 10 ng ml−1 FGF4 (StemCell Technologies, Cat.#78103.1), 10 µM all-trans RA (StemCell Technologies, 72262) and 1 µM purmorphamine (PMA; StemCell Technologies, 72202) was used. On day 7, 190 µl of medium was replaced with fresh week 2 medium and, on day 9, 100 µl of medium was replaced. On day 11, EBs were embedded in 12 µl Matrigel droplets and five droplets were transferred to each well of a 12-well suspension plate (Greiner Bio-One,665102) with 1 ml of week 2 medium and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. In week 3, week 3 medium (patterning medium, 10 ng ml−1 FGF4, 10 µM RA and 1 µM PMA) was used. Until day 21, the medium was refreshed every 2 days with week 3 medium. On day 17, the plates were placed on an orbital shaker inside a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. From day 21 onward, the medium was refreshed every 2–3 days with maturation medium (1:1 advanced DMEM/F-12 medium and neurobasal medium, supplemented with 1× GlutaMax, 0.5× N2, 0.5× B27 without vitamin A (Gibco, 12587010) and 1× penicillin–streptomycin (Pen–Strep, Gibco, 15140122).

PCAGPbase, PBCAG_DNp53_IRES_luciferase, PBCAG_PDGFRA-D842V_IRES_eGFP and PBCAG_H3K27M_eGFP plasmids were used to induce tumor growth in hES cell-derived organoids. In iPS cell-derived organoids, the H3K27M-expressing plasmid was replaced with 1.00 µg µl−1 SSi-Cre. PCAGPbase and PB_Venus were used as a control. All plasmids were kindly provided by the T. N. Phoenix laboratory11. For genetic lineage tracing, 1.50 µg µl−1 TrackerSeq86 was added to the plasmid mix.

On day 11, unless stated otherwise, organoids were injected with a mixture of plasmid DNA (1.50 µg µl−1 per plasmid) and 0.1% (w/v) FastaGreen (Merck, F7252-5G) using a FemtoJet 4i (Eppendorf, 5252000013) with the following parameters: injection pressure, 15 hPa; compensation pressure, 5 hPa. Subsequently, electroporation was performed using a NEPA21 Super Electroporator (Nepagene) and CUY650P1 (Nepagene) tweezers with the following parameters: voltage, 50 V; pulse length, 10 ms; pulse interval, 50 ms; number of pulses, four; decay rate, 10%. Transfer pulse parameters were as follows: voltage, 20 V; pulse length, 50 ms; pulse interval, 50 ms; number of pulses, five; decay rate, 40%. Using the impedance (kΩ) measurement of the NEPA21 Super Electroporator, voltage was automatically readjusted to optimize cell perforation and viability per individual organoid. Electroporation was performed by applying a shock twice in orthogonal direction and organoids were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for at least 2 h to recover.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but they are close to those previously published87. NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice (The Jackson Laboratory, 005557) were housed at 45–65% humidity and 20.5–23.5 °C with a 12-h light–dark cycle, in specific-opportunist-pathogen-free conditions using individually ventilated cages and sterile food and water ad libitum. Ten 3–4-week-old male and female NSG mice were anesthetized using isoflurane/O2 inhalation and transferred to a stereotaxic frame. Eye ointment was applied and 0.05 mg kg−1 buprenorphine was injected subcutaneously. After removing hair from the surgical site, a 1-cm incision was made in the skin to expose the skull and 3 mg kg−1 lidocaine was applied topically. Under a stereo microscope, a Dremel was used to drill a circular groove of 5 mm in the skull above the right cerebral cortex. Cortex buffer was applied before the dura mater and 2 mm3 of brain tissue was removed to accommodate the DMGO transplant. DMGOs were preselected on the basis of GFP signal 1–2 weeks after electroporation and, if too big in size, cut in half before transplantation. After placing the DMGO, the brain was covered with a neuropatch, the skull was closed with dental cement and the wound was closed using skin glue. After surgery, 0.06 mg ml−1 carprofen was provided in the drinking water for 3–5 days and mice were monitored 2–3 times per week for signs of weight loss, lack of grooming and/or reduced mobility.

If mice reached the study (21 days) or humane endpoint according to the monitoring of clinical symptoms, they were put under deep anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg kg−1 ketamine and 1 mg kg−1 medetomidine. Transcardiac perfusion was performed with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde and, after resection, brains were cut into 300-μm sections using a vibratome. Staining, clearing and imaging were performed as described below. Antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 10.

Organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, 441244) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed three times in PBST (1:1,000 Tween-20 in 1× PBS) for 15 min at 4 °C, embedded in 4% low-melting-point agarose (Invitrogen, 16520-050) and sliced into 100–250-µm sections using a Leica VT 1200 S vibratome. mLSR-3D was performed on the sliced organoids as described previously88. All combinations of primary and secondary antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 10. The slices were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with a ×25 (numerical aperture (NA): 0.8) objective and Leica Stellaris with ×20 (NA: 0.75) and ×40 (NA: 1.3) objectives. Alternatively, intact organoids were fixed and cleared using the organic solvent-based vDISCO method89 and imaged using a Leica SP8 microscope with a ×16 (NA: 0.6) BABB-compatible objective.

Routine histopathology procedures were followed to obtain FFPE tissue for World Health Organization standardized tumor classification. Patient and organoid material was sliced into 3-µm sections before hematoxylin and eosin and subsequent stainings. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on the Leica BOND RX fully automated research stainer using the bond polymer refine detection kit (Leica, DS9800). Stained tissue sections were analyzed by an experienced neuropathologist.

The DNA methylation profile of a pooled DMGO sample consisting of three independent replicates was compared to cases of DMG, glioblastoma and PFA ependymoma obtained from published datasets90,91. Data were loaded in R (version 4.3.1), probe filtering was performed using package ChAMP92 and each array platform was processed separately (HumanMethylation450 or EPIC) using the ‘minfi' method93 and filtering out probes located on single-nucleotide polymorphisms or sex chromosomes or with detection P value > 0.01. Raw β values were merged using function combineArrays and normalized with method BMIQ94. In total, 10,000 probes with the highest s.d. were selected and the Pearson correlation between samples was calculated, weighted by the inverse of variance. This correlation matrix was used to compute a distance matrix, which served as the input for the Rtsne function from the Rtsne package.

Organoid FFPE sections were deparaffinized in xylene (three times, 3 min each) followed by rehydration in a graded alcohol series for 1 min each (100% twice, 95% twice and 70% once). Sections were washed in deionized water (two times, 1 min each) and put in target retrieval solution, pH 9 (Agilent Dako). Antigen retrieval was performed for 40 min at 95 °C. Sections were allowed to cool to room temperature and washed for 5 min in deionized water followed by storage in PBS until further use. Cyclical immunofluorescence imaging was performed as previously described95. All combinations of primary and secondary antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 10. Imaging was performed on a Leica DMi8 Thunder imaging system with an HC PL APO ×20 (NA: 0.80) objective. Images of each cycle were aligned based on DAPI signal using a previously developed tool (https://github.com/Dream3DLab/CycFluoCoreg). The resulting composite images were imported into QuPath (version 0.4.4)96, where nuclei were segmented using a cell expansion of 2.5 μm. An object classifier using RandomTrees was trained for each marker on two separate images. These object classifiers were combined into a composite classifier that was applied to all images. The resulting dataset containing the count of classified cells in each image was exported to R for quantification and visualization.

The detailed step-by-step approaches were deposited to the protocols.io repository (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.6qpvrwq13lmk/v1)97.

CD8 GD2 CAR T cells (14G2a GD2-4-1BBz CAR) and donor-matched mock-transduced CD8 T cells were produced as previously described98. CAR T cells and mock-transduced T cells were expanded using a rapid expansion protocol99 and cryopreserved after 14 days. T cells were thawed and rested in RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with GlutaMax, 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher, 10500064), 1% Pen–Strep, 50 U per ml IL-2 (Miltenyi, 130-097-743), 2,000 U per ml IL-7 (Miltenyi, 130-095-367) and 50 U per ml IL-15 (Miltenyi, 130-095-760) for 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For selection of GD2 CAR T cells based on NCAM1 expression, a similar expansion protocol was used but without the addition of IL-15 and Daudi cells. After resting, cells were washed and stained for 30 min at 4 °C in flow cytometry (FC) buffer (1× PBS with 2% FBS) with live–dead fixable near-IR dead cell stain (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher), CD3–APC (1:80; BD BioLegend, clone SK7) and NCAM1–HiLyte-488 (1:200; QVQ, FSH-10B10). CD3+NCAM1− or CD3+NCAM1+ GD2 CAR T cells underwent fluorescence-activated cell sorting on a BD FACSAria II and were immediately used for experiments.

Firstly, 4 months after tumor induction, DMGOs were untreated or treated with 500,000 CD8+ GD2 CAR T cells or mock-transduced CD8+ T cells per DMGO added on days 0 and 7. For prolonged treatment, GD2 CAR T cells were administrated on days 0, 8 and 15. Tumor size was monitored by imaging using a Leica Thunder DMi8 microscope with a ×10 objective. After THUNDER software-mediated computational clearing of the imaging data, tumor size for each time point was quantified using Fiji. Background signal, defined as GFP-negative areas within the organoid, was subtracted. The organoid surface was set as the region of interest (ROI) and mean gray values of the GFP channel for the ROI were calculated. Supernatant of the cocultures was collected and IFNγ concentration was measured with ELISA (R&D Systems, DY285B). Untransformed BrOs were similarly treated and organoid appearance was monitored by brightfield imaging.

Firstly, 60 days after electroporation, a DMGO sample was dissected for the tumor region, mechanically dissociated and cultured for two additional weeks to expand tumor cells. Cells were retrieved from the culture plate using StemPro Accutase (Gibco, A1110501) and passed through a 70-µm Flowmi cell strainer (Merck, BAH136800070) to create a single-cell suspension. Dissociated cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended and washed in FC buffer. Cells were either left unstained or stained with live–dead fixable near-IR dead cell stain (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher) and GD2–PE (1:200; clone 14.G2a, BD Biosciences, 562100) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice in FC buffer, acquired on a Sony SH800s (Sony Biotechnology) and analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.9.0).

DMGOs treated with GD2 CAR T cells were dissociated and washed twice with PBS +/+ (Mg2+/Ca2+, 3% FBS). Cell suspensions were filtered using a 70-µm Flowmi cell strainer and stained in FC buffer with CD3–APC (1:80; BD Biosciences, clone SK7) and live–dead fixable near-IR dead cell stain (1:1000; Thermo Fisher) for 30 min at 4 °C. CD3+ T cells were sorted on a CytoFLEX SRT benchtop cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) and immediately processed for scRNA-seq.

Doublets were identified and removed using the scDblFinder package100, with default settings. Low-quality cells (>15% mitochondrial content, <200 or >6,500 genes or >35,000 reads) were removed. The Seurat (version 4)101 workflow was used to normalize and scale reads and 3,000 highly variable genes were determined. Cell-cycle confounding effects were eliminated by the removal of cell-cycle-related genes from the variable features of the dataset. Principal component analysis was performed using the ‘RunPCA' function. The first 30 principal components were used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction applying the UMAP102 method with the ‘RunUMAP' function of the Seurat package. Clustering analysis was performed using the Seurat package ‘FindNeighbors' and ‘FindClusters' functions. To identify subpopulations, marker genes for each cluster were determined through the ‘FindAllMarkers' function. Markers (adjusted P value < 0.05) were examined to profile genes associated with known CD8 T cell subsets, as well as project previously published signatures. In addition, DEGs were used as input for GO enrichment analysis using the GO resource (https://geneontology.org). To integrate three batches of NCAM1-selected cells, we applied the Seurat-based canonical correlation analysis integration method. As integration features, we used 1,000 variable features from each dataset, along with DEGs between conditions to account for biological variability. To assign cell populations to the clusters identified in Fig. 4e, we estimated the proportion of cells from these clusters for every cluster of the integrated dataset. Newly emerging populations were defined on the basis of differentially expressed markers and their origin, categorized by whether they originated from exposed, unexposed, NCAM1+ or NCAM1− populations. To determine the identity of the TMA cluster, we mapped our GD2 CAR T cell subsets to the CD8+ TIL resource dataset46 using Seurat's FindTransferAnchors(). The GD2 CAR T cell identities were then transferred to this dataset with TransferData(), retaining only high-confidence predictions (score > 0.5). These transferred identities were used to calculate the proportion of TMA GD2 CAR T cells within each CD8+ TIL subset.

To evaluate the expression of established T cell signatures, we used a gene signature specific to serial killer engineered T cells that we previously obtained60. Using the VISION R package103, we computed and visualized the overall enrichment of the identified gene set atop UMAP cell embeddings of our dataset. In addition, we projected our GD2 CAR T cell signatures onto a pan-cancer CD8 TIL atlas46 through T Cell Map (https://singlecell.mdanderson.org/TCM/) using the VISION package. For each GD2 CAR T cell subset, markers obtained through DEG analysis were filtered using an adjusted P value < 0.00001.

PMPs were generated using an adjusted protocol104. Briefly, 70–80% confluent H1 stem cells were detached with GCDR. For EB formation, 7,000 cells were plated per well of an ultralow-attachment treated U-bottom 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, 650970) in mTeSR+ (StemCell Technologies, 100-0276) medium, containing 50 μM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632; AbMole, M1817), 50 ng ml−1 bone morphogenetic protein 4 (StemCell Technologies, 78211), 50 ng ml−1 VEGF (PeproTech, 100-20-100ug) and 20 ng ml−1 SCF (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-093-991). On day 2, fresh medium was added and, on day 4, EBs were transferred to a six-well plate with X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza, BE02-060F), containing 1× GlutaMax (Gibco), 1× Pen–Strep (Gibco), 100 ng ml−1 M-CSF (PeproTech, 300-25-50ug) and 25 ng ml−1 IL-3 (PeproTech, AF-200-03-10ug). The medium was refreshed once a week. After ~3 weeks, the release of PMPs in the supernatant was observed. PMPs were collected and 100,000–200,000 cells were added per brain organoid in maturation medium (1:1 advanced DMEM/F-12 (Gibco) and Neurobasal (Thermo Fisher) medium, 1× GlutaMax, 0.5× N2 (Gibco), 0.5× B27 without vitamin A (Gibco) and 1× Pen–Strep). Organoids were kept on a microtiter orbital shaker inside a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 1–3 weeks for PMP integration and differentiation. For CAR T cell treatment experiments, organoids were sectioned into 200-µm-thick slices using a vibratome, transferred to a 24-well suspension plate in 750 µl of maturation medium and incubated at 5% CO2 and 37 °C for 3 days. A total of 50,000–200,000 PMPs were added per slice in 750 µl of maturation medium in a 24-well suspension plate for 7 days before adding 200,000 CD8+ GD2 CAR T cells in 750 µl of maturation medium. Tumor size during treatment was monitored by imaging using a Leica DMIL LED FLUO microscope with a ×10 objective.

BrOs and DMGOs containing microglia and optionally treated with GD2 CAR T cells were dissociated 21 days after initial microglia incorporation as described above for the preparation of scRNA-seq and TrackerSeq libraries. Dissociated cells, control PMPs and unexposed GD2 CAR T cells were washed and stained in FC buffer with CD3–BV421 (1:100; BD Biosciences, clone SK7) and live–dead fixable near-IR dead cell stain (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher) for 30 min at 4 °C. CD3+ T cells and mScarlet+ microglia and PMPs were single-cell-sorted into 386-well plates containing well-specific barcoded primers (Single Cell Discoveries) on a Sony SH800s (Sony Biotechnology). Plates containing sorted cells were immediately snap-frozen on dry ice and processed for SORT-seq by Single Cell Discoveries. Cells were heat-lysed at 65 °C followed by complementary (cDNA) synthesis. All the barcoded material from one plate was pooled into one library and amplified using in vitro transcription. Library preparation was performed following the CEL-Seq2 protocol105 to prepare a cDNA library for sequencing using TruSeq small RNA primers (Illumina). The DNA library was paired-end sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq 500, with high output, using a 1× 75-bp Illumina kit (read 1: 26 cycles, index read: 6 cycles, read 2: 60 cycles).

CSFE-labeled myelin debris, kindly provided by the L. Akkari lab74, was injected into PMP-integrated organoid slices using a glass needle and a FemtoJet 4i. The slices were immediately imaged on a Leica STELLARIS microscope at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight with a time interval of 5–10 min.

Protein was detected in the culture supernatant by Luminex. Acquisition of data was performed using a FLEXMAP 3D system (Bio-Rad) with xPONENT 4.3u1 software (Luminex). Data analysis was performed using Bio-Plex Manager 6.2 (Bio-Rad). All assays were performed at the ISO9001:2008-certified MultiPlex Core Facility of the University Medical Center Utrecht.

Statistics on bulk sequencing data were computed using built-in functions of R (‘stats', version 4.3.1) through a one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Tukey honestly significant difference test. Statistics on electroporation efficiency and tumor induction were calculated using two-tailed independent t-tests (function: t.test). All statistical tests were performed with a confidence interval of at least 95% (α = 0.05). Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested, unless otherwise indicated, and no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. To evaluate tumor response to GD2 CAR T cells in the presence or absence of microglia, the normalized tumor area at each time point was analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model, accounting for fixed and random effects related to batch and organoid variation. Multiple models were tested and the best-fitting model was selected. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (Benjamini–Hochberg). The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

The precise manipulation of unfunctionalized hydrocarbons remains a fundamental challenge for chemical synthesis and catalysis. Stereodifferentiation in strained alkanes is particularly difficult to accomplish because a catalyst has to distinguish various highly exergonic chemo- and stereoselective strain-release channels. Here we disclose an organocatalytic asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of bicyclobutanes with alcohols to efficiently access tertiary cyclopropylcarbinyl ethers with high enantioselectivity (e.r. up to 98:2). Enantiocontrol is accomplished through chiral recognition between the confined iminoimidodiphosphoric acid catalyst and the substrate, mediated by non-covalent interactions between a Lewis basic binding site of the confined anion and the polarized C–H bond of the cyclopropylcarbinyl ion intermediate. Our work establishes bicyclobutane activation by harnessing strain-release energetics while maintaining precise stereo- and regiocontrol through structural confinement.

Although Baeyer introduced the ‘ring strain' concept as long ago as 18851, strain-release chemistry has experienced a renaissance over the past decade as a transformative strategy for molecular manipulation2. Strain-release tactics are used to create versatile synthetic intermediates, finding broad applications across total synthesis3, polymer science4,5 and bio-orthogonal chemistry6,7. Representative examples include the radical/anionic ring opening of [1.1.1]propellane towards bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes8,9,10,11, structural analogues that serve as three-dimensional bioisosteres for planar para-substituted arenes due to their matching substituent vectors12,13. Parallel advances use [3.1.1]propellane to construct bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes through radical-mediated pathways, establishing meta-arene bioisosterism (Fig. 1a)14,15. Despite these successes, the activation of simpler hydrocarbon-based bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) remains underexplored16,17,18, presumably due to the intermediacy of cyclopropylcarbinyl and non-classical bicyclobutonium carbocations19, the dynamic behaviour of which is difficult to control20. Functionalized BCB derivatives bearing ketone, ester or amine groups have been extensively investigated21,22,23. These functional groups often act as stabilizing and directing groups and enable diverse transformations, including cycloadditions, C–C couplings and radical processes24,25,26. In contrast, the absence of such coordinating functionalities in hydrocarbon BCBs fundamentally impedes selective bond activation and enantiocontrol and enhances side reactions (see below), complicating efforts to harness their strain energy.

a, Strain-release alkane activation and calculated strain-release energies for strained alkanes8. b, Our design: asymmetric organocatalytic hydrocarbon BCB activation. HX*, chiral Brønsted acid; Bn, benzyl.

Our research group has developed a class of chiral Brønsted acid catalysts, including imidodiphosphate (IDP), imidodiphosphorimidates (IDPis) and iminoimidodiphosphates (iIDPs)27,28,29,30, which exhibit extraordinary acidity and spatial confinement effects. These catalysts have previously demonstrated remarkable efficacy in activating inert hydrocarbon systems through cyclopropane ring-opening reactions and controlling stereoselectivity in Wagner–Meerwein rearrangements31,32,33.

Inspired by these investigations, we envisioned applying this catalytic platform to resolve the long-standing challenges in BCB hydrocarbon activation, in which the absence of directing groups has historically hindered both reactivity modulation and stereochemical control. We hypothesize that stereochemistry may be controlled through the stabilization of the cyclopropylcarbinyl–bicyclobutonium cation intermediate within the enzyme-like chiral environments of our IDP-type catalysts. In this study, we report the enantioselective hydroalkoxylation of BCB hydrocarbons using alcohols as nucleophiles, yielding enantioenriched ether products with up to 98:2 e.r. (Fig. 1b). The synthetic utility of these ethers lies in their facile conversion to chiral tertiary alcohols—key intermediates in pharmaceuticals and materials science34.

At the onset of our study, several organic chiral Brønsted acids were tested in the targeted ring-opening of substrate 1d. The mild and unconfined chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) delivered the desired product 3d with poor enantiocontrol and a high yield of side product 4. However, our confined IDP catalyst 2a gave product 3d in moderate yield and a high e.r. of 93.5:6.5. We found that its sterically congested 2,4,6-tripentyl phenyl substitution was crucial in achieving excellent selectivity and enantiocontrol. Using the same 2,4,6-tripentyl phenyl substitution in the more acidic sulfonylimidophosphoryl iIDP catalyst sustained the high enantioselectivity (96.5:3.5 e.r.), while increasing the yield of 3a and reducing the amount of unwanted ‘cracking' side product 4. Compared with the chemoselectivity of IDP 2a and iIDP 2d, stronger acids enhance alcohol trapping to give the ether, whereas weaker acids favour elimination. To visually assess this substituent effect, buried volumes were calculated using a model of the substrate in the catalyst pocket35,36 (Fig. 2). A higher percentage of buried volume, which corresponds to a narrower pocket, may indicate that the substrate is stabilized within the iIDP pocket by non-covalent interactions, possibly compensating for the absence of traditional heteroatom or resonance stabilization.

Yields were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy using CH2Br2 as the internal standard. The e.r. was determined by gas chromatography analysis (see Supplementary Section 9 for further details).

Compared with iIDP 2b (47.2% buried volume) and 2c (58.8% buried volume), the tripentyl-substituted iIDP 2d has a more confined microenvironment, leading to stronger enantiocontrol on the BCB substrate. Despite having good chemoselectivity, IDPi 2e (74.3% buried volume) unexpectedly showed negligible enantiocontrol (53.5:46.5 e.r.). We hypothesized that the Lewis basic phospho-oxy moiety (P=O) of the iIDP 2d had a crucial effect on the chiral recognition of the BCB substrate (see below). Collectively, a precise balance between Brønsted acidity, confinement and oxy Lewis basicity seems to be essential to achieve good chemoselectivity, enantiocontrol and overall reactivity. After a further screening of catalysts and reaction conditions, we selected iIDP 2d, n-heptane (0.1 M) at −40 °C for 3 h as the optimal reaction conditions to afford product 3d in good yield and excellent enantioselectivity (71%, 96.5:3.5 e.r.).

With optimized conditions in hand, we investigated the substrate scope (Fig. 3). First, benzyl alcohol was used as the nucleophile: alkyl chain (–R1)-substituted BCBs gave products 3a–3d in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (61−75%, 96.5:3.5−98:2 e.r.), albeit moderate enantioselectivity was obtained with an ethyl group (3e, 84.5:15.5 e.r.). Unfortunately, low yields of 3f and 3g—containing branched alkyl substituents on –R1—were displayed with 3g exceptionally displaying high enantioselectivity (3g, 93.5:6.5 e.r.). A substrate bearing a chloroalkyl substituent was well tolerated, providing product 3h with an e.r. of 95.5:4.5 in 65% yield. The aryl-substituted alkyl chain substrate reacts efficiently with benzyl alcohol, affording products 3i and 3j in good yield with excellent enantioselectivity. Subsequently, we examined various alcohol nucleophiles with two representative BCB substrates (1c and 1d): n-butanol as the nucleophile gave products 3k and 3o in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. To our delight, the smallest alcohol, methanol, displayed excellent yield and equally high enantioselectivity for product 3l (67% yield, 93.5:6.5 e.r.). Further, allylic alcohols (3m and 3n), 2-methoxyethan-1-ol (3r) and phenylethanol (3q) added to BCBs resulted in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Branched nucleophiles, such as isopropanol, resulted in low product yields, but excellent enantioselectivities were retained (3p, 96:4 e.r.). The reaction could be applied to the natural monoterpenoids R-(+)-citronellol and S-(−)-citronellol, leading to products 3s and 3t, respectively, in good yields and excellent catalyst-controlled diastereoselectivity. The tertiary alcohol products 5d and 5i could be prepared from the benzyl ether precursors 3d and 3i in excellent yields, without erosion of enantiopurity under simple hydrogenation conditions (10 mol% Pd/C, H2). X-ray diffraction analysis of ester 8, derived from the tertiary alcohol 5i, allowed the unambiguous determination of the absolute configurations of the obtained products to be (R)-configured37,38.

Reactions were performed at 0.1-mmol scale. Isolated yields after chromatographic purification. The e.r. was determined by gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis (see Supplementary Section 9 for further details).

Mechanistically, we speculated that the reaction proceeds via a stepwise protonation of BCB 1c to form the corresponding carbocation, which is subsequently attacked by the alcohol nucleophile. However, a concerted mechanism in which protonation and C–O bond formation occur simultaneously is also plausible39,40. To explore the mechanism, we conducted a series of experimental and theoretical investigations. We found that the reaction of deuterated benzyl alcohol with BCB 1d afforded the corresponding deuterated benzyl ether 3d2 with 85% deuterium incorporation and 3d3 with 15% deuterium incorporation (Fig. 4a). This suggests that the protonation occurs from only one site, and the catalyst shows some site preference in the protonation. Kinetic profiling by 1H NMR spectroscopy shows that hydroalkoxylation and decomposition of BCB 1c are parallel and not consecutive processes (Fig. 4b). In addition, we performed a control experiment using isolated 4 and BnOH as the starting material under the standard reaction conditions, and no reactivity was observed. Overall, the olefin by-product is inactive towards hydroalkoxylation, excluding it as a productive intermediate in the reaction mechanism.

Notably, Olah et al. reported in 1992 that cyclopropylcarbinyl intermediates could arise from cyclopropanol substrates41. Nevertheless, using cyclopropanes 6 or 7 with excess BnOH (5 equiv.) afforded product 3c in poor enantioselectivity (Fig. 4c), in sharp contrast to the high selectivity observed from substrate 1c. This rules out a cyclopropylcarbinyl pathway under our conditions and further sets our system mechanistically apart from Patel and Marek's stereospecific generation of such cations from chiral homoallylic alcohols42. To investigate the mechanism, density functional theory studies were performed at the CPCM(heptane)-PBE0-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP//CPCM(heptane)-PBE0-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level of theory (Fig. 4d; see Supplementary Section 11 for further details)43,44,45. The iIDP/BnOH complex B is more stable (ΔG‡ = −13.8 kcal mol−1) than the iIDP/1d complex C (ΔG‡ = −9.7 kcal mol−1), suggesting that the more basic BnOH binds more strongly to the iIDP pocket than the substrate 1d. The Gibbs free activation energy from B to (R)-TS2 (ΔG‡ = 2.2 kcal mol−1) supports a concerted, although asynchronous mechanism, in which the reaction is triggered by the protonation of the BCB followed by C−O bond formation. The transition state conformer (R)-TS2 leading to the (R)-3d is 2.4 kcal mol−1 lower compared with the conformer (S)-TS2 leading to (S)-3d. This is in reasonable agreement with the experimental e.r. of 96.5:3.5.

To further understand why iIDP 2d leads to superior enantioselectivities, while IDPi 2e results in poor enantioselectivities, non-covalent interaction plots were generated (Fig. 4e). The transition states (R)-TS3 and (S)-TS3 for IDPi catalysis display only non-directional dispersion interactions (N1–H2 distance, 2.45 Å for (R)-TS3 and 2.49 Å for (S)-TS3) with the substrate. In stark contrast, in iIDP catalysis (S)-TS2 exhibits a well-defined, spatially oriented hydrogen bonding between the Lewis-basic component (P=O) of the iIDP fragment and the polarized C−H bond at the methyl group of the cyclopropylcarbinyl cation. Moreover, in the favoured (R)-TS2, another hydrogen bond between iIDP and the protonated hydrogen of the cyclopropyl moiety is also present, whereas this interaction is absent in (S)-TS2. This leads to preferred stabilization of (R)-TS2 compared with (S)-TS2, in which these hydrogen bonds are less pronounced (O1–H1 distance, 2.08 Å; O1–H2 distance, 2.52 Å for (R)-TS2; O1–H1 distance, 2.21 Å for (S)-TS2), explaining the observed enantioselectivity.

A delicate interplay between Brønsted acidity, Lewis basicity and steric confinement of the iIDP catalyst class enables the asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of BCB alkanes using simple alcohols in enantioselectivities up to 98:2. Traditional directing groups and metal catalysts are not required and we demonstrate how molecular strain and confined catalyst design synergistically enable enantiocontrol in the strain release of hydrocarbon ring systems.

A 5-ml vial was charged with IDPi 2d (3.0 µmol, 3 mol%) and a magnetic stir bar under an atmosphere of argon. Dry pentane/heptane (1 ml) and alcohol (0.3 mmol, 3.0 equiv.) were added. The vial was cooled to –40 °C. The BCB substrate (0.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) was added dropwise at –40 °C and the reaction was stirred at –40 °C for 3 h. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was treated with triethylamine (0.1 mmol, 1 equiv.) at –40 °C. After the mixture had been stirred for 0.5 h, the solvent of the reaction mixture was directly removed under reduced pressure. The product was then collected by column chromatography on silica (methyl tert-butyl ether:cyclohexane = 1:30), and its e.r. determined by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography.

Type I/II cytokine receptors mediate cytokine-specific biological responses by employing a defined combination of four Janus kinases (JAKs) and seven signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) for cellular signal transduction. Deregulation of the JAK–STAT pathway leads to various diseases, with JAK and STAT proteins representing attractive therapeutic targets. Fifteen JAK inhibitors are approved for several immunological and haematological diseases, offering significant benefits for patients. However, safety restrictions have limited their clinical use. Mechanistic and structural insights are driving current drug development approaches focused on improving their potency, selectivity and safety. Development of STAT inhibitors has been more challenging, and none has yet received clinical approval, although promising new compounds are now entering clinical trials. This Review discusses the recent advances in JAK and STAT inhibitor development and presents emerging therapeutic indications for JAK–STAT inhibition.

Early embryo geometry is one of the most invariant species-specific traits, yet its role in ensuring developmental reproducibility and robustness remains underexplored. Here we show that in zebrafish, the geometry of the fertilized egg—specifically its curvature and volume—serves as a critical initial condition triggering a cascade of events that influence development. The embryo geometry guides patterned asymmetric cell divisions in the blastoderm, generating radial gradients of cell volume and nucleocytoplasmic ratio. These gradients generate mitotic phase waves, with the nucleocytoplasmic ratio determining individual cell cycle periods independently of other cells. We demonstrate that reducing cell autonomy reshapes these waves, emphasizing the instructive role of geometry-derived volume patterns in setting the intrinsic period of the cell cycle oscillator. In addition to organizing cell cycles, early embryo geometry spatially patterns zygotic genome activation at the midblastula transition, a key step in establishing embryonic autonomy. Disrupting the embryo shape alters the zygotic genome activation pattern and causes ectopic germ layer specification, underscoring the developmental significance of geometry. Together, our findings reveal a symmetry-breaking function of early embryo geometry in coordinating cell cycle and transcriptional patterning.

Developmental reproducibility and robustness are critical for the survival of a species. Understanding the foundations of this robustness is, therefore, a question of fundamental importance and has become a central focus of research. Although most studies have concentrated on the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying development, the potential influence of geometry on developmental robustness has remained largely overlooked.

Recent work using minimal active matter models has revealed that geometry and curvature play a pivotal role in the mechanical response of epithelial sheets1,2,3,4,5. These insights can, for example, account for the anisotropic distribution of myosin II observed in Drosophila embryos6. Such findings highlight geometry as a key organizer of mechanical force generation during morphogenesis. Yet, whether—and how—geometry governs more complex, large-scale developmental processes, such as embryo patterning and coordinated cell divisions, remains an open question.

Metazoan development begins with a single cell, the zygote, which undergoes several rounds of rapid divisions (cleavages) to generate a large population of cells capable of adopting multiple fates and exhibiting diverse morphogenetic behaviours. In many species, these early divisions are initially highly synchronous. This cell cycle synchrony is best understood in Drosophila, where it is driven by the propagation of a chemical wave. In cleavage-stage Drosophila embryos, which are syncytial, nuclear cycles synchronize through ‘sweep waves'—coupling-independent phase waves emerging on top of gradients of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity established through reaction–diffusion dynamics7,8. Similar mechanisms have been observed in Xenopus egg extracts, another syncytial system, where nuclear divisions are coordinated by trigger waves of Cdk1 activity9. By contrast, in intact Xenopus embryos, where cells are fully separated, early cleavage divisions synchronize independently of cell–cell coupling10. Importantly, across systems, the propagation of cell cycle waves slows progressively with successive division rounds, leading to ‘metasynchronization', where cell cycles remain spatially patterned before eventually becoming fully desynchronized7,10,11.

Initial cleavages in the zebrafish embryo are meroblastic; that is, the cytoplasm but not the yolk is partitioned through cytokinesis11. Cell cycles at this stage occur highly synchronously, to begin with, and gradually desynchronize (metasynchrony) before completely desynchronizing at division round 10 (ref. 11). Importantly, although the cleavage-stage cells cycle between only the S and M phases with no detectable gap phases, complete desynchronization around division round 10 is thought to occur mainly due to a heterogeneous introduction of gap phases to the cell cycles12. To determine the spatiotemporal pattern of cell divisions in cleavage-stage zebrafish embryos, we recorded time-lapse images of Tg(actb2:rfp-pcna) embryos. Due to the absence of gap phases in the cleavage stages, the disappearance of the nuclear red fluorescent protein (RFP)-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) localization allowed us to reliably score the conclusion of the S phase and the onset of mitosis13. Consistent with previous reports, we observed three distinct phases with different extents of mitotic synchrony11,14. In the first three cell division rounds, cell cycles exhibited very high synchrony (synchronous phase) (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Thereafter, cell divisions from division rounds 4–9 showed slight but clearly detectable delays (metasynchronous phase) (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). These delays increased throughout the metasynchronous phase, with cells in division round 4 dividing with a mean division timing variance of 0.10 min2 and in division round 9 with 3.43 min2 (Fig. 1b). In particular, as previously reported, these metasynchronous divisions occurred in a spatiotemporally patterned manner, forming a radial ‘mitotic wave' that originates near the animal pole (AP), where cells divide first and propagate towards the margin, where they divide last (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1c,d)11,15,16. Furthermore, consistent with the increasing variance in division timings during the metasynchronous phase, the speed at which this mitotic wave travels gradually decreased over consecutive division rounds (Fig. 1d). After division round 9, cells divided largely non-synchronously, marking the onset of the asynchronous phase.

Source data

To understand how cell cycles are seemingly coordinated into radial mitotic waves during the metasynchronous phase, we asked if their synchronization occurs via cell–cell coupling. To that end, we artificially desynchronized cell cycles at the 32/64-cell stage through mosaic Histone 1 protein injections, previously shown to effectively alter cell cycle progression17,18,19. We found that Histone 1-positive and thus desynchronized cells failed to resynchronize with their neighbouring control cells by division round 9, after which cell cycles normally desynchronize in control embryos (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary Section 5 and Supplementary Video2). To address the possibility that these cell cycles could have resynchronized given sufficient time, we assessed the cell cycle progression in embryos ectopically expressing the Cdk1 inhibitor, Chek1, through chek1 mRNA injection in the one-cell stage embryo, which, by being heterogeneously distributed in the embryo, has previously been shown to interfere with cell cycle synchronization20. chek1-overexpressing embryos exhibited cell cycle desynchronization considerably earlier than control embryos, and failed to resynchronize despite completing all cleavage division rounds (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 2and Supplementary Video 3). Collectively, these observations suggest that cell cell coupling plays only a minor role, if any, in cell cycle synchronization in the zebrafish embryo.

To determine by which coupling-independent mechanism the radial mitotic wave is formed, we analysed the evolution of the mitotic wave through consecutive division rounds. We found that the transition from synchrony to metasynchrony was gradual rather than abrupt, suggesting a progressive accumulation of delays rather than distinct switches leading to the observed loss of synchrony (Fig. 1b). Importantly, this gradual loss of synchrony was due to unequal cell cycle periods. For instance, between the metasynchronous division rounds 6–8, cells at the margin cycled with 2%–4% longer periods than those at the AP (Fig. 1g). This discrepancy arose exclusively due to a longer S phase (assuming absent gap phases), which increased in cells as a function of their distance from the AP (Fig. 1h,i). Although noisy, such period gradients may lead to the observed gradual slowing down of the radial mitotic wave by accumulating increasing delays in the marginal cells over consecutive division rounds. To test this hypothesis, we assumed that the period T is a linear function of the distance z from the AP: \(T={T}_{0}\,(1+\frac{kz}{L})\), where T0 is the typical period at the AP, L is the total AP–margin distance and k is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This implies that the speed of the mitotic wave, v, in the nth division round is expected to be inversely proportional to n (Fig. 1d) with \(v=\frac{L}{{T}_{0}}\frac{1}{{kn}}\). To compare our experimental observations with these theoretical predictions, we first performed linear regression on the division timings to obtain the wave speed for each division round (Extended Data Fig. 1d). We then fitted the obtained v against \(\frac{1}{n}\) using the least squares fit. Using k = 1.9%, we obtained a close match between experiments and theory (Fig. 1d), suggesting that a 1.9% slower cell cycle at the margin would, in principle, be sufficient to explain the observed slowing down of the mitotic waves during consecutive division rounds. Considering that we experimentally observed a 2%–4% longer period at the margin, close to the theoretically predicted 1.9%, this suggests that a linear gradient of cell cycle periods, rather than cell–cell coupling, gives rise to the observed radial mitotic waves found during embryonic cleavages.

We note that constant T and κ are simplifying assumptions, as cell cycle periods increase over rounds and exhibit embryo-to-embryo variations. Incorporating these variations would complicate our analysis due to the difficulty in accurately quantifying the appropriate parameter variations, without altering our qualitative conclusions. Hence, given the reasonable theory–experiment agreement (Fig. 1d) and in the spirit of minimal models, we maintain these assumptions throughout our model analysis, allowing us to focus on the consequences of cell–cell coupling mechanisms.

Next, to challenge our conclusion that the mitotic waves are produced in a coupling-independent manner, we asked how they would appear if the cell cycles were instead coupled. To that end, we performed numerical simulations of the Kuramoto model of interacting oscillators on a hemisphere with free boundary conditions21 (Fig. 2a). The oscillators were placed on a Fibonacci lattice covering the hemisphere, with the nearest neighbours obtained with Delaunay triangulation. The phases of the oscillators obeyed the following equation: \({\delta }_{{\rm{t}}}{\theta }_{i}={\omega }_{i}+\epsilon \sum {j\epsilon N}_{i}\sin ({\theta }_{j}-{\theta }_{i})\), where \({\omega }_{i}\) represents the natural frequency of the ith oscillator, and the second term describes the interactions between neighbouring oscillators parameterized by the interaction strength \(\epsilon\), with Ni being the nearest neighbours of the ith oscillator. Due to cell–cell variations, we further assumed the presence of noise in the cell cycle lengths. Mathematically, we decomposed the frequencies into two parts \({\omega }_{i}=\varpi \left(z\right)+{{\wedge }}_{i}\), where the first term \(\varpi \left(z\right),\) is the inherent AP–margin oscillation gradient, and the second term is an independent spatial noise with covariance \(\left\langle {{\wedge }}_{i}{{\wedge }}_{j}\right\rangle ={\sigma \delta }_{{ij}}\).

In the equation, θi represents the cell cycle phase of cell i, and Ni denotes its nearest neighbouring cells, determined through Delaunay triangulation of the hemisphere. The coupling strength ε represents how strongly each cell influences its neighbours' timing.

Specifically, simulations with small interaction strength (ε) and low noise (σ) qualitatively recapitulated the wild-type behaviour, where mitotic waves originated at the AP, and accumulated delays, causing a gradual slowdown over time (Fig. 2b,c). To reach a better quantitative agreement with the data, we considered that the initial cleavage events are incomplete, and consequently, the cytoplasm of early blastomeres remains interconnected through the yolk and via cytoplasmic bridges22. These connections are thought to progressively diminish over successive division rounds as cells become smaller—an assumption supported by our observation that single-blastomere injections of 40-kDa dextran, comparable in size to key cell cycle regulators such as Cyclin B1, Cdk1 and Chek1, resulted in its widespread distribution within a single division cycle when performed at the 16-cell stage but not at the 64-cell stage (Extended Data Fig. 4)22. On the basis of this, we modelled wild-type embryos as exhibiting a time-dependent coupling that decays to near-zero values, which provided a substantially better fit to the experimental data than models assuming constant, minimal coupling throughout (Supplementary Section 4).

By contrast, the introduction of greater interaction strength and noise led the system to self-organize into smooth mitotic waves originating at the margin, similar to the case in Xenopus egg extracts, even though the ‘natural' cell cycle lengths at the AP were preset to be shorter on average23 (Fig. 2b,d). For even larger values of noise, multiple waves emerged from random points of the simulated embryo (Fig. 2b). Overall, this theoretical phase diagram suggests that wild-type embryos are characterized by low-to-intermediate noise and progressively decaying coupling, and that increasing cell coupling should, in theory, shift the origin of the mitotic wave from the AP to the blastoderm margin.

To experimentally test this prediction, we syncytialized cleavage-stage embryos by preventing cytokinesis—but allowing karyokinesis—through transient inactivation of Aurora kinase B24 (Fig. 2e,f). We reasoned that such a syncytialized embryo would resemble conditions observed in Drosophila embryos and Xenopus egg extracts—both syncytial systems in which cell cycles are partially or fully synchronized via coupling-dependent trigger waves—and would, therefore, function as a coupled system. Remarkably, consistent with our theoretical predictions, we found that in syncytial embryos, the mitotic wave originated at the margin rather than at the AP, as seen in wild-type embryos (Fig. 2b,d,f and Supplementary Videos 1 and 4). Moreover, by analysing the wave characteristics at division round 8 in syncytial embryos, we were able to estimate the effective ratio of coupling and noise, two competing factors promoting synchronization and desynchronization, respectively (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Section 2).

In particular, our model also predicted key differences in the evolution of cell cycle synchronization—measured by the variance in division timing across division rounds—between wild-type and syncytial embryos: in the absence of coupling (wild-type embryos), noise is expected to accumulate progressively, resulting in a monotonically increasing variance in division timing. By contrast, in the presence of coupling (syncytial embryos), this variance should plateau over time, with a characteristic timescale determined by the coupling strength (Fig. 2h). Strikingly, our experimental observations confirmed this prediction. In syncytial embryos—unlike in wild-types—‘cells' continued to cycle metasynchronously even beyond division round 10, indicating a strong coupling between cell cycles (Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Videos 1 and 4). The temporal evolution of variance closely matched our theoretical prediction, particularly for ε = 0.08 and σ = 0.028 (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Section 2). By contrast, wild-type embryos exhibited continuously increasing variance, which could be quantitatively explained by the incomplete nature of cytokinesis during early cleavages, suggesting the presence of a transient coupling that rapidly diminishes as development progresses.

Finally, to further challenge the notion of the increased coupling of cells in syncytial embryos, we injected chek1 mRNA into embryos before syncytialization and assessed whether they could resist premature desynchronization typically observed when chek1 was overexpressed in wild-type embryos (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Video 3). We theoretically reasoned that the coupling inferred for syncytial embryos is large enough that it can override a substantial increase in noise, such as the desynchronizing effects of chek1 expression (Fig. 2b). Indeed, we found that in chek1-overexpressing embryos, the mitotic waves originated at the margin and cells continued to cycle metasynchronously even beyond division round 10, suggesting that cells in the syncytial embryo are, in fact, tightly coupled (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Video 5). By extension, this implies that such a coupling is absent/minimal in wild-type embryos and, consequently, that mitotic waves are produced largely independently of cell–cell interactions in wild-type embryos. Collectively, these findings suggest that cell cycles are only weakly coupled during cleavages and that metasynchrony arises predominantly by cell-autonomous processes.

For the cell cycle to slowdown from the AP to the margin in a predominantly cell-autonomous manner, there must be a factor causing an unequal lengthening of the S phase along the AP–margin axis. Among the most important factors regulating the S-phase length is the nucleocytoplasmic (N/C) ratio25,26. A high N/C ratio causes S-phase lengthening, for instance, by retarding Cdk1 activation25. Consistent with such an effect of the N/C ratio on cell cycle length, we found that the length of the S phase across the metasynchronous division rounds negatively correlated with cell volume (Fig. 4a,b). Therefore, we hypothesized that an AP–margin gradient of cell volumes in the cleavage-stage embryo might be responsible for unequally lengthening cell cycles from the AP to the margin. To test this hypothesis, we measured cell volumes by semiautomatically segmenting surface cells at the 128-cell stage (division round 8). Indeed, we found that, on average, cells closer to the AP were significantly larger than those away from it (Figs. 3a and 4g). To determine at what stage such a volume gradient first becomes apparent, we also measured N/C in embryos at the 8-cell stage (division round 4) and the 16-cell stage (division round 5)—the first stages in which cells can be classified as being ‘central' or ‘peripheral' based on their position. Interestingly, we observed that cells, but not nuclei, closer to the AP were consistently larger than the marginal cells, leading to central cells typically exhibiting a smaller N/C ratio than peripheral cells (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5). Furthermore, the cell volume gradient not only persisted but was also further enhanced by subsequent cell divisions, as mother cells having unequal sizes themselves again divided asymmetrically to produce yet unequally sized daughters, thereby further diversifying cell volumes through cell lineage in addition to the already established position-driven cell volume diversity (Fig. 3d). For such unequal cell divisions to robustly give rise to a gradient in cell volumes along the AP–margin axis, upon division, the daughter cell closer to the AP must be, on average, larger than the daughter cell further from the AP. In line with this, we found that cell divisions in the early cleavage stages showed a tendency to produce larger daughter cells closer to AP, with the central daughter cell (closer to AP) being, on average, ~12.4% larger by volume than its peripheral sister cell (away from the AP) (Fig. 3e).

To determine what causes such patterned asymmetric cell divisions, we investigated how cell divisions are oriented and the cleavage plane positioned in the early embryo. Although several sophisticated models have been proposed to explain the orientation and positioning of the cleavage plane across systems, we started by first testing if following the simplest model, the ~140-year-old Hertwig's rule, can recapitulate the experimentally observed pattern of asymmetry27,28. More specifically, we assumed that the mitotic spindle in dividing blastomeres would orient along the longest cell axis, thereby dividing the cell along this axis. To test if such a geometry-driven mechanism would suffice to generate the observed pattern of asymmetric cell divisions and, therefore, the cell volume gradient, we predicted daughter cell volumes at the 16-cell stage by first identifying the longest axes of segmented cells at the 8-cell stage through principal component analysis and then bisecting them to obtain two daughter cells from each division29 (Fig. 3e). Indeed, we found that with this approach, the predicted asymmetry in the daughter cell size closely matched the observed asymmetry for most cell divisions, such that the central daughter cells (closer to the AP) at the 16-cell stage were, on average, ~18.5% larger than their peripheral sister cells (further away from the AP) by volume (Fig. 3e). Importantly, this tendency of central daughter cells being bigger than peripheral ones is determined by the specific geometry of the first cell of the fertilized egg, the blastodisc, which is delineated not only by a plasma membrane at its outer side but also by the interface to the yolk granules on its inner side11,30. As the interface to the yolk granules is curved, the first two cell divisions will give rise to equally sized daughter cells that are more pointed and narrow at their peripheral ends. Dividing these cells again along their long axis will then, as a result, generate daughter cells in which the central cell is larger than the peripheral one. This suggests that a gradient of cell volumes along the AP–margin axis in the cleaving embryo can be explained by the specific geometry of the first cell in the fertilized egg, leading to unequal cell division along the AP–margin axis during subsequent division rounds.

Although the influence of cell volume on cell cycle length has been established in several systems, its role in zebrafish embryos remains unclear due to conflicting reports regarding the determinative effect of cell size in this context14,16. To unequivocally establish the contribution of cell volume—and, by extension, the N/C ratio—to the regulation of cell cycle length, we first increased the N/C ratio at the 1-cell stage by aspirating cytoplasm from the blastodisc (Fig. 4c). Consistent with the known role of elevated N/C ratios in prolonging cell cycles, we observed that, across different embryos, the S phase either lengthened prematurely or showed greater lengthening during division round 10, and the cell cycles desynchronized earlier than in control embryos (Fig. 4d). To test the converse, we decreased the N/C ratio by replicating a previous experiment14, aspirating one nucleus from embryos at the 2-cell or 4-cell stage (Fig. 4e). In these embryos, only the control half—containing the nucleus—underwent initial cleavages, whereas no divisions occurred in the enucleated half (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Video 6). However, in a subset of embryos, nuclei from the control half eventually invaded the enucleated half around division round 4 or 5, prompting the onset of cleavages in that region (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Video 6). In particular, although all nuclei had undergone the same number of division cycles by this stage, those in the previously enucleated half now resided in a substantially larger cytoplasmic volume—comparable to the blastomere volume of cells three to four divisions earlier—and, therefore, had a lower N/C ratio. Consistent with earlier findings, these nuclei did not exhibit S-phase lengthening during division round 10—the point at which cell cycles typically begin to desynchronize in the control half, but instead continued to cycle metasynchronously. This, in line with previous observations of delayed and premature cell cycle lengthening in haploid and tetraploid embryos, respectively, supports the notion that a higher N/C ratio promotes S-phase lengthening and contributes to the onset of cell cycle desynchronization beyond division round 10 (ref. 14; Fig. 4f). However, it should be noted that although our analyses establish a deterministic role of N/C in S-phase length, they do not entirely exclude the possibility that additional geometry- or N/C-independent mechanisms may also influence the S-phase length.

Having confirmed that the N/C ratio, in principle, can influence the S-phase length, we asked how perturbing the embryo-scale cell volume gradient within the cleaving embryo would affect the cell cycle (meta)synchrony and, consequently, the mitotic wave. To alter the cell volume gradient, we first generated bilobed embryos, displaying two ectopic (morphological) APs, by mounting 2-cell stage embryos in low-melting-point agarose (0.67% w/v in E3 buffer) when the first cytokinesis was in progress (Fig. 5a). We reasoned that spatially confining and, therefore, reshaping the embryo in this manner would produce larger cells away from the AP at the two ectopic APs. Interestingly, we found that not only the gradient of cell volumes was reshaped in the embryo but also that two mitotic waves emerged, one from each of the two ectopic APs, supporting the notion that the cell volume gradient is linked to the emergence of the mitotic wave (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Video 7).

Not only does cell size decrease along the AP–margin axis but also the proximity of cells to the yolk increases. This raises the possibility that yolk-derived factors, in addition to or alternatively to cell size, might influence the gradient in cell cycle length. However, direct cytoplasmic connectivity with the yolk is largely confined to the most marginal cells, making it unlikely to account for a cell cycle length gradient across the entire AP–margin axis11. To directly assess the effect of yolk proximity, we analysed correlations between division timing, cell size and yolk distance in bilobed embryos, where cell size and position relative to the margin are changed. Consistent with our model, smaller cells divided later than larger cells regardless of their AP–margin position (Extended Data Fig. 6), arguing against a primary role for the yolk in regulating division timing.

To further challenge the role of embryo-wide cell size gradients in generating mitotic waves, we removed a part of the yolk on the vegetal side of the 2-cell stage embryo to increase the curvature of the blastodisc (the two blastomeres positioned on the yolk cell; Fig. 5c). On the basis of our analysis indicating that the cell volume gradient is a product of the curvature of the blastodisc–yolk interface, we reasoned that this increased curvature would reorient the longest axes of the two cells, such that they align more along the animal–vegetal axis, which would then amplify the volume asymmetry of cleavage divisions and, consequently, the phase difference between cell cycles (Fig. 5c). Strikingly, we found that in yolk-severed embryos, with cell divisions more aligned along the animal–vegetal axis, the mitotic wave indeed showed a greater cell division timing variance compared with the control embryos (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Video 8). Taken together, these observations strongly support the idea that a gradient of cell volume along the AP–margin axis, guided by embryo geometry, causes the generation of a gradient of S-phase lengths along the AP–margin axis of the blastoderm, thereby generating radial mitotic waves in the zebrafish embryo.

Among the major responders to a high N/C ratio is Chek1, which, when active, delays the S–M transition7,25,31. Although cell cycles have been shown to lengthen independently of Chek1 in Xenopus egg extracts, recent in vivo studies in Drosophila embryos have established it as a central factor that not only controls the mitotic wave speed but also regulates the desynchronization of cell cycles in embryos with heterogeneous N/C7,26,31. Therefore, we enquired whether Chek1 mediates the effect of cell volume on S-phase length. To that end, we inhibited Chek1 activity by treating embryos with 10 µM of PF477736, a specific Chek1 activity inhibitor32. If Chek1 activity is required for the gradual metasynchronization of cell cycles through unequal S-phase lengthening, the cell cycle progression would be expected to show lesser variation in the treated embryos. Consistent with this, we found that, although Chek1-inhibited embryos produced mitotic waves like those in control embryos, they indeed exhibited a lower mitotic division timing variance (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Video 9). This suggests that Chek1 activity is critical for translating a cell volume gradient into a mitotic wave along the AP–margin axis of the blastoderm.

Finally, we asked whether the geometry-derived cell volume gradient—and the resulting patterned mitotic metasynchrony—plays a developmental role that extends beyond the cleavage stages and impacts subsequent embryogenesis. In zebrafish embryos, mitotic metasynchrony diminishes in parallel with the onset of zygotic genome activation (ZGA), a pivotal process that lays the foundation for cell fate heterogeneity and is central to metazoan development14. Given previously reported roles of cell volume (N/C ratio promotes ZGA) and cell cycle length (shorter cell cycle prevents ZGA) in regulating ZGA, we investigated whether the observed gradient in cell volume and mitotic metasynchrony influences the onset of zygotic transcription33,34,35,36,37,38. To address this, we tracked the timing and spatial pattern of zygotic transcription initiation by imaging endogenous pri-miR430 transcripts using the morpholino visualization of expression39 (Fig. 6a). miR430 genes are among the earliest and most abundantly transcribed genes during zebrafish ZGA, making them ideal markers for assessing transcriptional onset40,41.

Patterned asymmetric divisions generate a gradient of cell volume, producing mitotic phase waves and spatially patterning ZGA onset along the AP–margin axis.

In most embryos, we observed the first signs of miR430 transcription during division round 9. In particular, during rounds 9 and 10, transcription was initiated in a graded manner: miR430 transcription foci first appeared—and/or persisted longer—in cells near the blastoderm margin. They then emerged in an intermediate zone between the margin and the AP, and finally in cells located at the AP (Fig. 6b,c, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Videos 10 and 11). These findings suggest that zygotic transcription begins as a spatiotemporal gradient along the AP–margin axis, with marginal cells exhibiting higher transcriptional activity or competence than AP cells over the course of one to two division rounds. To determine whether this pattern of ZGA onset is driven by the underlying gradients in cell volume and/or cell cycle length, we examined bilobed embryos in which both of these gradients are perturbed (Figs. 5a,b and 6d). In contrast to control embryos, cells at the AP in bilobed embryos are smaller and cycle more slowly than those in the intermediate zone (Fig. 5a,b). Remarkably, in these embryos, miR430 transcription was initiated first at both the margin and the AP—where cells are the smallest—before appearing in the intermediate region (Fig. 6e and Supplementary Video 12). These results suggest that the gradient of cell volume and/or cell cycle length along the AP–margin axis influences the spatiotemporal onset of zygotic transcription. Thus, early embryo geometry can be linked directly to the initiation of zygotic gene expression, providing a mechanistic bridge between physical form and transcriptional timing in early development.

To determine whether the geometry-derived transcriptional gradient within the embryo plays a role in embryonic development, we asked whether altering the spatiotemporal pattern of ZGA onset in bilobed embryos would affect the specification of the first cell fates within the blastoderm. To investigate this, we used Tg(sebox:egfp) embryos to visualize the earliest mesendoderm progenitors, specified at the onset of gastrulation42,43. In control embryos, mesendoderm progenitors were exclusively specified at the blastoderm margin—the region in which ZGA is first initiated. By contrast, approximately 30% of bilobed embryos exhibited mesendoderm progenitors not only at the margin but also ectopically within the ‘valley' between the two domes, reflecting the altered ZGA pattern in these embryos (Fig. 6f). These findings suggest that zygote geometry triggers a cascade of developmental events necessary for correct cell fate specification—an essential aspect of ensuring developmental robustness (Fig. 6g).

Previous studies have shown that the shape of the zebrafish egg—particularly the blastodisc, the region from which all embryonic cells and tissues originate—is established by ooplasmic streaming, which segregates yolk granules from the cytoplasm within the fertilized egg30,44. Building on this, our findings suggest that the initial shape of the blastodisc drives asymmetric cell divisions during successive reductive cleavages by guiding mitotic spindle orientation, based on the simple premise that the spindle consistently aligns with the cell's longest axis, as described by Hertwig's rule27,28,45. These asymmetric divisions progressively generate a gradient of cell volumes along the AP–margin axis of the developing blastoderm, which, in turn, influences both cell cycle progression and ZGA along the same axis. Although we do not rule out the potential contribution of more complex mechanisms linking blastodisc shape to asymmetric cell divisions—such as differential interactions between spindle microtubules and yolk granules, the cell cortex or the plasma membrane—our results suggest that such factors are not required to explain the emergence of asymmetric divisions. Thus, the formation of a gradient in cell volume, as well as the consequent regulation of cell cycle dynamics and ZGA patterns, appears to be a direct outcome of the blastodisc's geometry.

Interestingly, our data connect the observed gradients in cell volume and/or cell cycle length to the onset of ZGA. This aligns with recent findings in Xenopus embryos, where ZGA is first initiated in the smaller cells at the AP38. Multiple molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain the link between cell cycle length and the onset of ZGA, including the titration of cytoplasmic transcriptional repressors as the N/C ratio increases, and/or progressively lengthening cell cycles that permit sustained zygotic transcription. Our observation that smaller, slower-cycling cells at the margin are transcriptionally more active, initiating transcription first and retaining the transcription foci longer (Extended Data Fig. 7), suggests that both mechanisms may contribute to the regulation of zygotic gene activation.

We have previously shown that radially patterned cell behaviours and asymmetric tissue compaction along the AP–margin axis of the blastoderm emerge at the onset of gastrulation, providing essential conditions for proper morphogenetic movements during this stage of development20,46. It is plausible that these differences in tissue properties originate from distinct transcriptional profiles and cell fate specification, which are themselves driven by the differential patterns of ZGA, and ultimately embryo geometry, as described in this study.

The dependence of cell fate marker expression on early embryo geometry raises a central question: how do noisy gradients in cell size, cell cycle and transcriptional activity yield robust fate specification? Although individual fate markers may be regulated by distinct mechanisms, their spatial patterns probably emerge from the integration of cellular dynamics with physical constraints. For example, although Nodal signals, inducing mesendodermal cell fates within the blastoderm margin, originate in the yolk, proper Nodal reception in blastoderm cells requires zygotically expressed factors such as the co-receptor oep47. Margin cells, which undergo earlier ZGA, may, therefore, respond more strongly to Nodal due to an earlier and/or higher co-receptor expression, sharpening mesendodermal marker expression near the margin. In bilobed embryos, altered cell size, cell cycle and transcription patterns could shift this sensitivity—elevated transcription in the valley between the two lobes might allow cells to respond to lower Nodal levels and, consequently, adopt a mesendodermal cell fate. Thus, biochemical and molecular prepatterning, achieved by cellular properties such as cell cycle, size and transcriptional activity, may provide the foundation for robust cell fate specification.

Our findings, thus, establish a probable mechanistic link between two critical developmental milestones: the determination of blastodisc geometry immediately after fertilization and the onset of asymmetric tissue fluidization during gastrulation. This connection is further supported by our earlier observation that asymmetric tissue fluidization depends on proper mesendoderm specification20,46, as well as by our current finding that embryos with perturbed geometry exhibit mesendodermal fate misspecification that parallels the altered pattern of ZGA onset. This suggests that inherent geometric asymmetries in blastodisc shape can have long-lasting developmental consequences, manifesting only later as their effects accumulate during the early proliferative phase of embryogenesis.

Consistent with this notion, several other organisms—including Caenorhabditis elegans, sea urchins and Xenopus—exhibit alignment between axes of cell cycle length and/or cell volume and the axes along which germ layer fates diverge, underscoring the developmental significance of geometry-derived patterns as robust and reproducible determinants of embryonic organization. Nonetheless, the specific outcomes of this fundamental relationship are likely to vary across species and must be examined within the unique developmental context of each organism.

Tg(actb2:rfp-pcna) embryos were dechorionated and, at the desired stage, mounted in 0.5% agarose gels prepared in E3 buffer with the AP facing upwards in casts made with 2% agarose solution in E3 buffer13. RFP fluorescence was imaged at 23.5 °C using a 20× water-dipping objective on ZEISS LSM800 (numerical aperture of 0.8), LSM880 (numerical aperture of 1.0) or LSM900 (numerical aperture of 1.0) upright confocal microscopes. Then, 200–350-µm-thick Z stacks were acquired for different experiments with temporal resolutions ranging between 17 and 65 s per Z stack. The presence or absence of nuclear RFP-PCNA fluorescence was used to determine if a cell was in the S or M phase of the cell cycle, respectively48,49,50. The nuclear signal was segmented in Fiji (v. 2.16.0/1.54p; Java 1.8.0_172) using the Labkit plug-in (v. 0.4.0)51,52. The segmented objects were imported into Bitplane Imaris (v. 9.9) (https://imaris.oxinst.com/) to generate tracks and obtain tracking-related data, including track start time (S-phase entry), track end time (M-phase entry), track duration (S-phase length) and the nuclear coordinates at the last S-phase time point (position). These data were then analysed using the Pandas package (v. 1.5.3) in Python (v. 3.12.9) to calculate, for instance, the division timing variance in a given division round, followed by plotting using mainly the Matplotlib (v. 3.8.2) and seaborn (v. 0.12.2) packages53,54,55.

The mitotic wave speed for a given division round was determined by first identifying the position of the wave origin and the timing of the wave origination, measuring all other nuclear distances and mitotic entry timings relative to this position and time, and then generating the best-fitting distance–time linear curve. In the cases where more than one nucleus could be considered the origin of the mitotic wave due to a simultaneous entry into mitosis, the mean of the 3D coordinates of such nuclei was considered as the position of wave origin. Furthermore, it should be noted that, especially during division rounds 2 and 3, the wave traverses the embryo nearly instantaneously, and in most of our experiments, we could not temporally resolve these early cell divisions, giving us infinite mitotic wave speeds. However, for analytical reasons, we only considered those embryos in which the divisions could be resolved, disregarding embryos exhibiting infinite speeds, which would provide an underestimate of the mitotic wave speed.

To visualize cell cycle progression using Histone 1 as the marker, 0.5 ng of Histone 1-Alexa Fluor 488 (catalogue number H13188, Invitrogen) was injected at the 1-cell stage into wild-type AB or Tg(actb2:lyn-tdTomato) embryos56. Mosaic perturbation of the cycling period of a subset of the cells was carried out by mounting 32/64-cell stage embryos in 2% agarose solution in E3 buffer and injecting 0.2–0.3 ng of Histone 1-Alexa Fluor 488 into such cells. chek1 overexpression was achieved by injecting 12 pg chek1 mRNA into the one-cell embryo20,46. mRNA was prepared as described previously21. To test the cellular connectivity at the 16- and 64-cell stages, 0.0625 ng of fluorescein isothiocyanate–carboxymethyl–dextran (40 kDa) was injected into a single cell at the desired stage, and the embryos were mounted and imaged as described above.

Aurkb function was inhibited by transiently incubating dechorionated <5 min post-fertilization (mpf) embryos in 50 µM of AZD1152 (catalogue number SML0268, Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 15 min, after which they were returned to the E3 buffer. Embryos showing successful nuclear cycling despite a failure of cytokinesis were then imaged as described above. Inhibition of the Aurkb function concomitantly with the chek1 overexpression or Histone 1-Alexa Fluor 488 visualization was performed by injecting 12 pg of chek1 mRNA or 0.5 ng of Histone 1-Alexa Fluor 488, respectively, at the 1-cell stage, as described above, followed by incubation in the Aurkb inhibitor. Chek1 activity inhibition was performed by dechorionating <10-mpf embryos and incubating them in 10 µM of PF477736 (catalogue number HY-10032, MedChem Express) solution in E3 buffer throughout the duration of the analysis.

Nuclear RFP-PCNA fluorescence was segmented from Z stacks by thresholding using Fiji (v. 2.16.0/1.54p; Java 1.8.0_172), and their volumes were measured using the 3D Objects Counter plug-in (v. 2.0.1)57.

Cell volumes at the 8- and 16-cell stages were measured by semiautomatically generating cell segmentation using the ‘Contour' function for surface creation in Bitplane Imaris (v. 9.9) from Z stacks of Tg(actb2:mCherry-CAAX) embryos58. Once segmented, the physical attributes of individual cells, such as volume and position, were exported from Bitplane Imaris (v. 9.9) as CSV files. The last time point before the onset of the fourth or fifth mitotic round was used to measure the cell volume for the 8- or the 16-cell stage, respectively. Cell volumes at the 128-cell stage were measured by generating cell segmentations using the LimeSeg plug-in (v. 0.4.2) in Fiji (v. 2.16.0/1.54p; Java 1.8.0_172) and exporting the cell volume data for individual segmented objects59. All downstream data analysis was performed in Python (v. 3.12.9), mainly using the Pandas package (v. 1.5.3), and the plots were produced using the Matplotlib (v. 3.8.2) and seaborn (v. 0.12.2) packages. To directly measure the N/C for cells at the 8- and the 16-cell stages, Tg(actb2:mCherry-CAAX) embryos injected with 0.5 ng of Histone 1-Alexa Fluor 488 at the 1-cell stage were imaged as described above. Cell volumes were estimated by semiautomatically creating cell and nuclear surfaces in Imaris (v. 9.9), whose volumes were then used to determine the N/C ratio for each cell.

Cell surfaces generated in Bitplane Imaris (v. 9.9) at the 8-cell stage were exported as WRL files, imported into MeshLab (https://www.meshlab.net/), from where individual cell surfaces were exported as PLY files. These files were subsequently processed in Python (v. 3.12.9) to identify the longest cell axis by performing principal component analysis, along which the cell was bisected into two daughter cells representing cells at the 16-cell stage29.

Nuclei positions were obtained from Bitplane Imaris (v. 9.9), as detailed above. For each nucleus, the three nearest neighbours were identified, and their mean distance from the reference nucleus was calculated using the Pandas package (v. 1.5.3) in Python (v. 3.12.9).

At approximately 30 mpf, Tg(actb2:rfp-pcna) embryos were mounted in E3 buffer on a substrate prepared with 2% agarose solution in E3 buffer. A 20-µm blunt-end needle attached to a 10-µl Hamilton syringe was inserted through the yolk into the blastodisc, and the cytoplasm was carefully aspirated. The nuclear RFP-PCNA signal was constantly observed using a Leica stereofluorescence microscope to ensure the nucleus was not extracted together with the cytoplasm.

The setup and mounting procedure for nucleus aspiration were the same as for cytoplasm aspiration described above, except that, in this case, the nucleus was aspirated rather than the cytoplasm and from embryos at the 2-cell stage rather than the 1-cell stage. Care was exercised to ensure that the nucleus was extracted with a negligible volume of the cytoplasm being aspirated in the process.

Bilobed embryos were created by spatially confining dechorionated embryos at the 2-cell stage, still undergoing cytokinesis from division round 1, in 0.5%–0.6% agarose in E3 buffer. Microscopy was performed as described above.

To sever the yolk, dechorionated embryos at the 2-cell stage were placed on a substrate of 3% methylcellulose in E3 buffer in a glass dish. Using an eyelash attached to the end of a Pasteur pipette, the vegetal half of the yolk was first punctured to prevent the embryo from exploding due to a build-up of internal pressure during the severing procedure, and then carefully sliced. The embryo was allowed to recover for at least 15 min after the procedure, followed by mounting and microscopy, as detailed above.

Four orthogonal sections, each showing four nuclei along the plane of division round 4 at the 16-cell stage, were generated using the reslice function in Fiji from Z stacks of individual Tg(actb2:rfp-pcna) embryos. The angles between the nuclei were then measured using Fiji (v. 2.16.0/1.54p; Java 1.8.0_172), as represented in Fig. 5d, to obtain the angle of cell divisions in division round 4.

pri-miR430 transcripts were labelled as described previously39. Tg(actb2:rfp-pcna) embryos injected with MO1-3-fluorescein (Gene Tools) at the 1-cell stage were mounted in 0.5% agarose solution in E3 buffer in #3 fluorinated ethylene propylene tubes, and the Z stacks were generated with a temporal resolution of approximately 1 min per Z stack using a 20×/1.33-numerical-aperture objective on a ZEISS Lightsheet 7 microscope. Maximum intensity projections of these time-lapse recordings were then used to assess the transcription status of the individual nuclei.

All animal breeding and procedures were performed in accordance with the European Union animal welfare guidelines and involve only low-severity lines, in accordance with the authorized animal breeding licences (66018/8-II/3b/2013 and 2023-0.288.351) in the Institute of Science and Technology Austria Aquatics Facility (approval number 024-0.730.856). All experiments were performed before 5 days post-fertilization, a period during which zebrafish do not feed independently and in line with the principle of 3Rs.

(a) Scatter plot of division timing for individual cells starting at cleavage division round 3 (x-axis) relative to their position along the animal-margin axis (y-axis) for one representative wild-type embryo. The green dotted line outlines cells located at a distance of <10 μm from the bottom of the image stack that could not be reliably tracked. (b) Mean RFP-PCNA intensity, as a marker for mitosis onset, as a function of time. Mean PCNA intensity increases during the S-phase, peaks just before the S-M transition, and declines in the M-phase. Thus, a narrow peak indicates greater synchrony and vice versa. (c) Representative scheme showing the position of the mitotic wave origin in division round 8 (n = 7 embryos). (d) Representative plot of cleavage division timing as a function of cell distance from the mitotic wave origin in cleavage division round 8 from a wild-type embryo.

Folding phones have been stuck in a rut for a few years. We've seen concept smartphones playing with fresh folding designs, but ever since Samsung kickstarted the trend in 2019, there have only really been two major styles in the market: a booklike fold and the flip. However, there's new life emerging in the category with significantly slimmer designs—such as last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7—and now the company's “TriFold,"" a smartphone that can truly transform into a 10-inch tablet.

Samsung isn't the first to market with such a phone—Huawei takes that cake with the Mate XT—but the Galaxy Z TriFold has a slightly different design. It's only available in a handful of countries, like China, South Korea, and Singapore, but Samsung plans to release it in the US this year. The price? Samsung is being coy with the MSRP, but the price of 3,594,000 South Korean won suggests it'll cost around $2,500 in the US, if not more.

I was able to briefly spend some time with the triple-panel smartphone at CES 2026. Here's what it's like.

Folded and unfolded.

As the name suggests, Samsung's priciest folding phone opts for a trifold design, whereas Huawei's equivalent has a Z fold. I haven't used Huawei's version yet, but that does have a leg up: You can use one, two, or all three panels with its accordion-style design. The Galaxy Z TriFold only goes from a single panel to a triple panel.

As a single panel, the 6.5-inch front screen feels quite like a normal smartphone, albeit with thicker-than-usual bezels around the screen, and a weight of 309 grams that you'll have to get used to. Flip open the screen to the right, then flip the inner layer to the left, and you get a sprawling 10-inch display to work with. Keep in mind, the Galaxy Z Fold7 nets you an 8-inch screen, but that sounds like child's play next to the TriFold. It instantly feels more like an Android tablet than any other foldable Samsung has made before.

That's important because this tablet experience is the promise “book-like” folding phones have made for years, but the slight increase in screen real estate never yielded the same experience as a standard tablet. The TriFold changes that—the screen here is bigger than an iPad Mini! It feels like the actual definition of a phablet.

You can run three apps side-by-side, two apps at once, or one big app across the whole screen.

There are two titanium hinges, and they open up three panels. You can place a full-size app on each of the three panes, use a larger version of split-screen, or expand one app across the vast display. It was easy to configure these setups, and I can totally see myself taking advantage of having three apps open simultaneously. It is still a little unwieldy to hold, but that's not unusual for a 10-inch tablet. The TriFold is very slim in its unfolded state, which helps.

Fold it up and you're looking at a thickness of 12.9 millimeters, which is just a smidge chunkier than the Galaxy Z Fold6 (12.1 mm). The fact that it's roughly the same thickness as a prior-generation fold, yet with a dramatically larger screen, is impressive. It makes the bulk a little more palatable. There is a correct way to fold it and an incorrect way. Thankfully, if you start folding it the wrong way with the right screen in first, the phone violently buzzes, and you'll see an alert on the screen asking to fold in the other screen first. I can still picture someone ignoring this and just carrying on, though.

The hardware is exquisite, and the specs are top-notch, closer to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra; there's a 200-megapixel main camera on the back, and the phone is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. The displays are protected by ceramic glass, and there's even an IP48 dust- and water-resistance rating.

The TriFold's three panels tuck into each other.

You can see the difference in the two hinges.

But as exciting as it is, the TriFold is still a niche phone. Despite nearly a decade of folding phones, the prices for these handsets are still a premium, with Samsung even raising the MSRP of its folding devices in 2025. It is far cheaper to buy a decent tablet and a flagship phone. At a time of economic turmoil, the TriFold feels frivolous.

But it's hard not to feel impressed at this engineering marvel. It's just a shame that only a handful of people will really be able to enjoy this phablet's capabilities.

As he addressed an audience of virologists from China, Australia, and Singapore at October's Pandemic Research Alliance Symposium, Wei Zhao introduced an eye-catching idea.

The gene-editing technology Crispr is best known for delivering groundbreaking new therapies for rare diseases, tweaking or knocking out rogue genes in conditions ranging from sickle cell disease to hemophilia. But Zhao and his colleagues at Melbourne's Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity have envisioned a new application.

They believe Crispr could be tailored to create a next-generation treatment for influenza, whether that's the seasonal strains which plague both the northern and southern hemispheres on an annual basis or the worrisome new variants in birds and other wildlife that might trigger the next pandemic.

Crispr can edit the genetic code—the biological instruction book that makes life possible—within the cells of every living being. That means it can take different forms. The best-known version is mediated by the Cas9 enzyme; this can fix errors or mutations within genes by cutting strands of DNA. But virologists like Zhao are more interested in Cas9's less famous cousin, the Cas13 enzyme, which can do the same to RNA. In human cells, RNA molecules carry instructions from DNA to make proteins, but the genetic code of influenza viruses is composed entirely of RNA strands—a vulnerability that Cas13 can exploit.

“Cas13 can target these RNA viruses and inactivate them,” Zhao explained.

Human cells do not naturally make either Cas9 or Cas13; both of these enzymes are found in the immune systems of bacteria and microscopic organisms called archaea, where Cas13 enables them to disable invading viruses called phages. Zhao and a wider team of scientists are devising an innovative system to confer the same benefits to humans.

Initially pioneered in the lab as a novel Covid antiviral, their idea is to develop a nasal spray or an injection that uses lipid nanoparticles to deliver molecular instructions to flu-infected cells in the respiratory tract. It's a two-stage process. The first molecule would be an mRNA that instructs the cells to make Cas13, with the second being a so-called guide RNA that directs Cas13 to a specific part of the influenza virus's RNA code.

“Cas13 then cuts the viral RNA, disrupting the virus's ability to replicate and effectively stopping the infection at the genetic level,” says Sharon Lewin, an infectious diseases physician at the Peter Doherty Institute who is leading the project.

While the main aim would be to use the technology as a way of curbing short-term infections, Zhao also envisions the spray being used to prevent infections, for example during a particularly virulent flu season. “You'd basically be preparing the cells in your respiratory tract to produce this Cas13, as a first layer of defense,” he says. “It's like the army—you'd have those soldiers armed and ready to meet their enemy.”

The main attraction of this idea is that Cas13 can be engineered, via the guide RNA, to target so-called conserved regions of influenza's genetic code. Those are known segments of RNA that are found in virtually all flu strains and are crucial to the virus's survival. Conventional antivirals such as Tamiflu only target particular strains of flu, which swiftly acquire resistance.

Crispr-Cas13 is one of the leading innovations among so-called pan-fluenza antivirals, but there are others too. Monoclonal antibodies are also designed to target conserved regions of influenza's genetic code, while other drugs aim to ramp up the production of interferons, the body's inbuilt alarm system that signals immune cells to attack an invading pathogen.

With the influenza A strain alone killing 12,000 to 52,000 Americans every year, depending on the severity of the flu season, the need for better alternatives is clear. But as Nicholas Heaton, professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at Duke University points out, numerous hurdles still need to be overcome before any Crispr-Cas13 nasal sprays or jabs could be rolled out.

“I like the idea of it, but it's putting a foreign protein from a bacteria into someone's body,” he says. “So will the body make an immune response against it?” Heaton also cautions against “off-target effects,” the chance that a Crispr treatment will inadvertently go after your body's own RNA as well as an invading virus.

One early safety assessment has already been carried out at Harvard University's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, where scientists have used human lung and blood vessel cells to create a “lung on a chip.” In the case of severe flu infections, influenza invades and replicates within microscopic air sacs called alveoli, making this a useful model to examine whether training these cells to produce the Cas13 enzyme can help fight off severe flu.

According to Donald Ingber, the institute's founding director who pioneered the lung-on-a-chip models, studies have shown that the Cas13-powered cells could fight off various strains of flu—from the H1N1 strain responsible for the 2009 swine flu pandemic to H3N2, which has been responsible for a particular virulent seasonal flu outbreak this winter. Not only that, but there seemed to be no unwanted consequences. “We didn't see any off-target effects, which was amazing,” says Ingber. “We suppressed viral replication, but also the molecules that mediate inflammation which are secreted when your tissues are infected.”

Still, scientists are understandably cautious. Ingber says that figuring out a way to deliver a lipid nanoparticle containing the instructions to make Cas13—directly to alveoli cells deep within the lungs—is no easy task. Heaton also points out that any antiviral that targets a virus directly may help encourage the pathogen to further mutate, even if it is targeting seemingly integral parts of its genetic code. “Typically, what we find is that nature has a way,” he says. “It's like with the old Jurassic Park movie.”

Heaton is also working on alternative ways of harnessing the power of Crispr to target flu. Another idea may be to play defense, using the Cas9 enzyme to adjust our own genetic code to make us more resistant to flu. “We all have genes that are being expressed that are allowing the virus to get into your cells and replicate,” he says. “But what if we could find one of these key genetic factors which the virus really needs and just turn it down a little. Is there something in our biology which we can do with less of that influenza can't?”

To explore this, scientists have been carrying out a painstaking series of experiments. Research groups, including Heaton's lab, take human cells, use Cas9 to remove genes one at a time, and see whether the influenza virus can still kill them. This has already yielded a key discovery: flu relies upon a gene called SLC35A1, which ensures that certain sugars are present on the outside of our cells. According to Heaton, this gene is the flu's very own Achilles' heel.

“Flu uses those sugars as a receptor,” he says. “Theoretically, if you could make an inhibitor of that gene and have somebody inhale it, that would essentially stop all flu.”

Of course, given that mammals and influenza have been in a biological arms race for millions of years, evolution would likely have already eliminated SLC35A1 if it were possible for humans to survive without it. However, Heaton is not ruling out a more nuanced approach.

“What if we don't completely eliminate this gene?” he says. “What if we only eliminate it or reduce it transiently in a specific part of our body. Would that be tolerated? It's still very early stages with these technologies, but I like this idea of finding genes that can restrict the virus's capabilities, and then trying to see whether that would be safe.”

Father Mike Schmitz, a Catholic priest and podcaster, addressed his congregation of more than 1.2 million YouTube subscribers in November with an unusual kind of homily. You couldn't always trust the words coming out of his mouth, Schmitz said, because sometimes they weren't really his words—or his mouth. Schmitz had become the target of AI-generated impersonation scams.

“You're being watched by a demonic human,” said the fake Schmitz in one video that the real Schmitz, wearing an L.L. Bean jacket over his clerical suit, included in his public service announcement as an example. “You must act quickly, because the spots for sending prayers are already running out,” said another fake Schmitz with a looming hourglass behind him. “And the next trip will only take place in four months.” The fake Schmitz sounded ever-so-slightly robotic as he urged viewers to click a link and secure their blessing before it was too late.

“I can look at them and say ‘That's ridiculous, I would never say that,'” the real Schmitz, who is based in Duluth, Minnesota, said in his callout video. “But people can't necessarily tell. That's a problem. That's, like, a really big problem.”

On the real video of Schmitz, some of the top comments from his followers said they had seen other prominent Catholic figures impersonated through AI videos, including the pope. According to cybersecurity expert Rachel Tobac, who is the CEO of SocialProof Security, that's because pastors have become extremely popular subjects of AI scams and other deceptive media.

“If you're on TikTok or Reels, they've probably come across your For You page,” Tobac says. “This is somebody who looks to be a priest, who's wearing all of the garments, who's standing up on a pulpit or a stage or whatever you'd call it, and they seem to be speaking to their congregation in a very enthusiastic way.”

Pastors and ministers in Birmingham, Alabama, Freeport, New York, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, have warned their followers about AI scams impersonating them in the form of DMs, calls, and deepfakes. Alan Beauchamp, a pastor in the Ozarks, said his Facebook account was hacked, with the hacker posting a fake, possibly AI-generated certificate for cryptocurrency trading with Beauchamp's name on it and a caption urging his congregants to join him. A megachurch in the Philippines received reports of deepfakes featuring its pastors. An evangelical church in Nebraska issued an AI “scammer alert” on Facebook, and one churchgoer in the comments posted a screenshot of texts purported to be from one of their pastors.

It doesn't help that a lot of the pastors and ministers who have grown large online followings often actually are soliciting donations and selling things, just not the same things that their AI impersonators are. With the help of social media, religious authority figures have been able to reach believers far beyond their neighborhoods, but the proliferation of content featuring their likenesses and voices has also provided the perfect opportunity for scammers wielding generative AI tools.

“You get a phone call that sounds like the pastor or a board member, someone who has been on livestreams every week, and their voices can be sampled and put into AI,” said a member of ChurchTrac, a church management software company based in Florida, in a YouTube video warning about the rise of AI scams targeting churches. “The scammer can use that voice and call into a church and say ‘Hey, would you transfer this fund to this account?'”

When searching Father Schmitz on TikTok, WIRED found that three of the fake accounts Schmitz had shown in his video were still active, though it wasn't immediately clear whether the videos they posted were AI or just clips pulled from Schmitz's real social media profiles. There are more than 20 accounts on TikTok posing as Schmitz, who doesn't have a verified account of his own on the platform. Schmitz didn't respond to a request for comment, while TikTok removed the fake Schmitz accounts after WIRED pointed them out to the company, citing its rules against impersonation.

Scams aren't the only example of AI imitating pastors. Tobac has come across viral short-form AI videos that feature pastors who don't appear to be based on a specific individual but quickly rack up views because of how unexpected their sermons are. In one TikTok she shared with WIRED, which has over 11 million views, a pastor yells furiously into a crowd, hands gripping the sides of his pulpit: “Billionaires are the only minority we should be scared of! They got the power to destroy this country! They don't need your protection! They need your accountability!”

The TikTok account that posted it, Guided in Grace, has the bio “Using AI to show a parallel universe.” But the video caption doesn't indicate it's AI-generated. It says, “Meanwhile in my conservative grandma's church this morning …” Most of the comments are treating it like it's real. “Me being shocked that a Christian is being an ACTUAL Christian,” reads one. “Ooohh, they serving Jesus: original flavor,” says another.

“We don't know who's creating this, we don't know what their goals are, but it seems to be to try to influence the way that people think,” Tobac said. All of the videos on the AI pastor TikTok account were posted in October, at the same time that Sora-generated videos of the influencer Jake Paul were gaining over a billion views. But while viral fake Paul videos were instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with his usual demeanor, a fake nondescript pastor has an easier time avoiding suspicion and gaining a different kind of influence in the process.

“When you see someone who's high up in say, the church, espouse a specific belief, we ascribe meaning and value and power to that statement in a way that's different than an influencer,” Tobac said. She also pointed out that the accounts like the AI pastor could be monetized through TikTok's Creator Fund. “If you can go viral quickly, if you can get a lot of views, you are given more money.”

The same incentives driving TikTok creators to dabble in AI media may also be driving churches to do the same. In September, a church in Dallas, Texas, showcased AI-generated videos of the slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk speaking about Christ from beyond the grave. According to a 2025 report from a company that is promoting the use of AI by church leaders, a majority of pastors surveyed said they are already using tools like ChatGPT and Grammarly to help prepare their sermons. And chatbots that purport to allow users to chat with God, Jesus, and all manner of religious figures are flourishing.

While some faith leaders have rapidly warmed to religious AI, industry watchdogs like Tobac and Lucas Hansen, who cofounded the AI education nonprofit CivAI, remain concerned about users of the technology experiencing severe mental health consequences as a result. In October, OpenAI reported that hundreds of thousands of ChatGPT users may show signs of psychosis and other mental health issues in their chatbot conversations every week. Some of those delusions can be religious in nature.

“I think there might end up being a fair number of people that think that God is using AI as a tool to communicate with them. I think we're already seeing a little bit of that,” Hansen says. “AI tries to figure out what the user would like to be true and then reinforces that. Those people that perhaps are slightly predisposed to these sorts of issues get those beliefs reinforced.”

For priests and pastors who have already been impersonated by AI without their consent, there may be less of a desire to embrace the technology. Father Schmitz seems to fall into that category. After he warned his viewers about deepfakes of him, Schmitz reminisced on growing up watching the Terminator movies and its depiction of AI as the villainous Skynet. But the implications of AI advancement so far remind him more of the lethargic humans hovering around in recliners with floating screens in Wall-E.

“We would have thought ‘No, by extending technology, we can travel even further, we can go even faster, we can do amazing things,'” Schmitz said. “And it could be the case that we don't actually do amazing things. It could be the case that by extending our humanity, we cease knowing how to do things.”

Today's big press conferences at CES are dominated by US chipmakers: first Nvidia early afternoon Pacific time, followed by Intel, and finally, the AMD keynote this evening. If I was a betting person (when in Vegas) I'd guess that Nvidia's Jensen Huang is going to tout the company's next-gen chip platform and AI data centers; Intel will share what's next for Panther Lake-powered PCs; and AMD's Lisa Su will focus on both client-side stuff and AI data center chips in her keynote talk.

Since it's CES, there will naturally be some emphasis on consumer products—think PCs, game consoles, smart cars—but really, the big story with chips this year is scale, scale, scale, so it's also about how these chips will be stuffed in AI data centers and ultimately power next-gen supercomputers, robotics, manufacturing, etc. We'll be live-blogging those pressers here.

If you have kids, you may remember that period between 1 and 4 when they all seemed to get ear infections. All. The. Time. Kid inner- and mid-ear tubes are tiny and easily clogged by the slightest bit of booger. I know at least three preschoolers that ended up getting surgery to get a plastic tube put in their ears to help them drain.

The Earflo is a simple cylinder with an accompanying Bluetooth app. Your tiny kid puts their mouth on the spout, like a sippy cup, with two tiny tubes at the base of their nostrils. The connected app then shows them how to blow to clear their inner tubes out. It's sized for kids (I tried it but it's too small for me), non-invasive, and lets your kid avoid surgery. It's FDA 510(k) pending and clinical studies show that Earflo can help drain ear fluid in 86 percent of patients in four weeks. 90 percent of children avoided ear tube surgery at the end of the study. This is my favorite kind of device to see at CES—it's ingenious, simple, and solves a real problem. You don't want your tiny kids to have any kind of surgery! I can barely watch them get their teeth cleaned!

Belkin announced several mobile accessories at CES, but two stood out to me. First, the UltraCharge Modular Charging Dock (WIZ052), a 3-in-1 wireless charger that can charge a Qi2-compatible smartphone on the main dock, with a spot to recharge a wireless earbuds case behind it. You can push out another dock at the back, and out pops a spot to place your own smartwatch's wireless charger, which plugs into the built-in USB-C port. Most 3-in-1 wireless chargers are designed for iPhones and Apple Watches, but that's not the case here. Belkin includes a ring accessory that helps fit chargers for Samsung's Galaxy Watches and Google's Pixel Watches, meaning this is finally a 3-in-1 charger for folks who don't live in the Apple family.

Belkin is positioning it as a charger for families that use various kinds of smartwatches, but constantly swapping out the watch charger seems like it'd be a chore. It seems purpose-built for tech reviewers like myself, who hop from device to device every few weeks or months; no wonder I'm excited for it. This charger will cost $65 and will be available in the first quarter of 2026.

The second accessory that caught my eye is the ConnectAir Wireless HDMI Display Adapter. This lets you wirelessly send video to a screen via HDMI without the need for a wireless network. It's basically a two-part dongle situation. Plug the HDMI to USB-A cable into the HDMI port of a TV or monitor, and the USB-A end into a power source. Then, you plug in the USB-C transmitter into your laptop or phone—or any device that can transfer video over USB-C. It can send 60-Hz 1080p video up to a range of 131 feet, and Belkin claims a latency under 80 milliseconds. It's great for travelers looking to connect to a TV without fussing with Wi-Fi, or shared conference rooms or classrooms. The wide compatibility makes it an easy plug-and-play solution without having to fuss with wires.

This wireless HDMI transmitter costs $150 and will be available in the first quarter of 2026 in “select markets.”

If you have a severe food allergy, eating anywhere but your home can be a stressful—or even life-threatening—experience. The Allergen Alert portable allergy lab lets you take a small scoop of whatever you or your loved one is eating, put it in a pouch in the machine, and test it on the spot within minutes. It's not precisely pocket-sized, but it is small enough to fit in a backpack or handbag.

Allergen Alert is a spinoff company from the reputable French company BioMeriux, which has developed in vitro diagnostics testing solutions for over 60 years. While Allergen Alert can currently only test for milk and gluten, company spokesperson Ilinca Spita noted that Allergen Alert hopes to be able to test up to 9 allergens in the upcoming year, and that it's already being tested among Michelin star chefs and catering services. Being able to eat out without fear would be a significant change in quality of life for a lot of affected people. (Unfortunately for my children, it would still not help them from their problem of finding parsley in places where green things are simply not meant to belong.)

Withings makes some of our favorite fitness tech, from smart scales to fitness trackers. The company is known for its gorgeous, understated hardware (I'm wearing a ScanWatch 2 right now!) and simple, easy-to-use app that incorporates every device in its ever-expanding portfolio. Last night, the company launched its latest fitness device, the Body Scan 2.

Withings bills this, not as a smart scale like the previous Body Scan, but as a longevity station that checks for over 60 biomarkers when you get out of the tub in the morning. Among some of the latest biomarkers are a hypertension risk notification, cardiac pumping efficiency via Impedance Cardiography, Ultra-high-frequency Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) to measure metabolic markers, and a new AI model to check for impeding signs of diabetes.

To use, you simply stand on the 8 ITO-embedded electrodes on the plate and hold the handle, which has 4 stainless steel electrodes embedded in it. It wasn't working last night at Unveiled because the Wi-Fi was so fuzzy, so I'm not entirely clear as to why this fellow has his shoes off, but thank you for that anyway, sir! It's currently pending FDA clearance but will be available for $600 in Q2 2026 from Withings, Amazon, and other large retailers. It joins other Withings devices, like the BPM Vision, to give you a holistic view of your, er, health. I'm going to check it out when it, you know, actually turns on later in the show.

Honor teased the Robot Phone late last year, and now I've had a chance to see it in person. Sort of. The company had the phone on display, and I was able to take pictures, but I couldn't hold it, and it was a prototype that didn't even turn on. Good news, though—there will be a working version at Mobile World Congress in March, so we won't have to wait long. From what I could see, this is a chunky phone!

What exactly is it? Think of it as a marriage between a smartphone and a gimbal camera. The camera will pop out of the phone's frame and will be able to rotate around to see its surroundings. Honor has suggested several AI-focused use cases, like propping your phone on a table and asking whether your outfit looks good as the camera tracks you around the room. Naturally, if you're trying to take a group picture, a pan-tilt-zoom camera like this would be able to track your faces and frame you accordingly.

Details are light about the phone's hardware—and the reliability of a gimbal camera on a smartphone—but stay tuned at MWC 2026 for more.

— Steven Maheshwary, a former generative AI leader at Amazon, is now a go-to-market lead in strategic partnerships at Anthropic, the AI giant behind Claude and backed by Amazon.

On LinkedIn, Maheshwary described AI as “a catalyst for significant transformation and a raw energy that must be shaped, guardrailed, and democratized to be genuinely useful.” 

“I believe Claude represents a distinct vision of what AI can be: powerful and capable, while remaining safe and aligned with human values,” he added. 

Maheshwary was with Amazon for 12 years, most recently as head of growth for AI startups and foundation models on AWS. During his tenure, he also served as former Gov. Jay Inslee's technology sector lead, working to grow Washington state's tech and AI economy, and was a Fulbright grantee for the U.S. Department of State.

— Irene Plenefisch, a longtime government affairs leader at Microsoft, is retiring after more than 15 years at the Redmond tech company. Plenefisch, most recently a senior director at Microsoft, previously worked at SonoSite for 12 years. 

“I have been proud to represent Microsoft, an important and amazing company, in its home state and around the country,” she wrote on LinkedIn, adding: “I'm not going to lie; the path for channeling all the energy, competitiveness and enthusiasm for being in the middle of it all is not completely clear. But I am confident in my decision.”

— Nikhil Hasija left his role as vice president of engineering at Okta. Hasija joined the security company following its acquisition of Azuqua, a Seattle startup he founded in 2011. Hasija also spent more than four years at Microsoft. 

“I'm starting to think about what's next,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “I'm increasingly drawn to problems centered on leverage, speed, and new ways of working. To everyone who made this journey worthwhile, I'm glad our paths crossed, and I welcome that again.”

— Caitlin Rollman is back at Microsoft as a partner product manager. She was previously at the tech giant for nearly a decade ending in 2020, leaving the role of principal PM manager for the Office platform.

Rollman said on LinkedIn that she got a call from Microsoft and was “offered the opportunity to build something new from the ground up, at a company I respect, with people I adore. I couldn't say no.”

Rollman left Microsoft to work as senior director of product management for Highspot, a Seattle company that sells enterprise software to help make salespeople more efficient. 

Earlier this year she co-founded and was CEO of Talvita, an AI-native human resources management platform.

— Brian Surratt is now officially deputy mayor at the City of Seattle in new Mayor Katie Wilson's administration. 

Surratt spent nearly four years leading Greater Seattle Partners, a public-private sector initiative that seeks to attract investment, companies and jobs to the Seattle region. He also previously led the City of Seattle's economic development arm and was a vice president at Alexandria Real Estate Equities. 

Wilson was sworn in on Friday, becoming the city's 58th mayor.

“Seattle has shaped my belief in what is possible when public service, community engagement, and economic opportunity come together,” he wrote on LinkedIn last week. “To step back into City Hall at this moment — when our city is focused on restoring trust and building civic pride, tackling our homelessness crisis, expanding housing and economic opportunity, and building a more affordable, inclusive, innovation-driven future — is both humbling and energizing.”

— Dr. Emma Rocheteau has taken the role of clinician scientist at Microsoft AI in London.

“Throughout 2025, I couldn't shake the feeling that we're at an inflection point where medicine and AI are finally coming together to solve some of healthcare's toughest challenges,” Rocheteau said on LinkedIn. “To be able to contribute to this is a dream come true for me, and it represents exactly what I've been working towards for the past 12 years.”

Rocheteau joins Microsoft from NHS, the United Kingdom's publicly funded National Heath Service. She was briefly a research intern for Microsoft in 2019 during which she focused on health intelligence.

— Ashlee Drake Berry joined Seattle-based immigration tech company Casium as head of legal. Berry is leaving a role as principal corporate counsel at Microsoft where she focused on legal compliance in the hiring of immigrant and non-immigrant employees globally.

“This role has stretched me, challenged me, and given me the chance to work with some of the most talented and generous colleagues I've ever known,” Berry said on LinkedIn. 

Berry previously worked on immigration employment issues at Vialto Partners and Envoy Global. Casium spun out of the Seattle-based AI2 Incubator in April 2024.

— Sage Ke'alohilani Quiamno is now the communications and marketing lead at Yoodli, a Seattle startup that sells AI-powered software to help people practice real-world conversations such as sales calls and feedback sessions. The company last month announced $40 million in new funding.

Quiamno has been running a public relations consultancy over the past year. She was previously the global diversity, equity and inclusion leader at Amazon's Prime Video and Amazon Studios for more than three years, ending in January 2025.

Quiamno was co-founder and CEO of Future for Us, an organization promoting professional development for women of color that was acquired.

— Adam Stern, an environmental and clean energy leader, is co-executive director of the Seattle-based electric vehicle nonprofit Coltura. Stern, who resides in San Francisco, joins Janelle London in the shared role.

Former co-executive director Matthew Metz founded Coltura in 2014 to promote EV adoption through research, analysis and policy support. He is transitioning to a full-time role as CEO of EVQ, a public benefit corporation and tech platform that spun out of Coltura to support consumers and organizations in the purchase of EVs. 

“While Matthew is stepping away from his day-to-day role at Coltura, his impact will continue to be felt for years to come — in the policies passed, the ideas normalized, and the momentum built toward a cleaner transportation future,” the nonprofit said in announcing the changes.

New research tied to the University of Washington School of Medicine adds to mounting concerns among educators about smartphone use in schools.

U.S. adolescents between the ages of 13–18 spend more than one hour per day on phones during school hours, with “addictive” social media apps accounting for the largest share of use, according to new research published in JAMA. 

The findings add to the ongoing argument made by teachers, parents and policymakers that has led schools and districts around the country, including some in Seattle, to ban phones during school hours. 

The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study tracked 640 teens whose parents consented to passive monitoring software on their Android smartphones from September 2022 to May 2024, according to UW Medicine.

“These apps are designed to be addictive,” said Dr. Dimitri Christakis, the paper's senior author. “They deprive students of the opportunity to be fully engaged in class and to hone their social skills with classmates and teachers.”

Christakis is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine and practices at Seattle Children's Hospital. 

Based on a national sample of students, the results build on findings published last year in JAMA Pediatrics. That study had fewer participants but also included iPhone users.

At least 32 states and the District of Columbia require school districts to ban or restrict students' use of cell phones in schools. The effect of those policies “remains to be seen,” Christakis said.  

“To date they've been very poorly enforced, if at all. I think the U.S. has to recognize the generational implications of depriving children of opportunities to learn in school,” he added.

A majority of school districts in Washington state planned to have policies in place at the start of the school year last fall to limit students' use of cellphones and other devices such as smart watches.

Seattle Public Schools has not issued a district-wide policy, though at least three public middle schools in the district have banned phones at school, and at least one high school prohibits their use during classes.

The UW's Youth Advisory Board, a group of approximately 20 teens from Seattle-area schools, recently published its first memo tackling the contentious issue of phones in school. The memo weighs the pros and cons of phone bans and offers recommendations on how schools should draft and communicate their policies.

Amazon is expanding its consumer AI ecosystem beyond the smart speaker — bringing Alexa+ to the web, revamping its mobile app, and offering its first update on Bee since acquiring the wearable AI startup six months ago.

The announcements, timed to CES in Las Vegas, mark Amazon's latest effort to catch up in the consumer AI race. While the company's cloud unit has established itself as a major AI infrastructure and enterprise services provider, Amazon has struggled to match the momentum of OpenAI, Google, and the rapidly growing field of consumer AI startups.

New this morning, Amazon released a streamlined Alexa mobile app that makes the AI assistant the primary focus. The redesigned interface features an “Ask Alexa” prompt anchored at the bottom of the screen, personalized suggestions, and quick access to devices and favorites — a cleaner look that prioritizes the AI assistant over other features.

Amazon says Alexa+, its upgraded AI assistant, is now available in the browser via alexa.com to all customers in its early access program. As previously reported by GeekWire, the web interface extends Alexa beyond voice commands, enabling document uploads, web-based chat integration, and point-and-click control over reminders, calendars, and smart home devices.

Alexa+ uses generative AI to offer smoother conversations and better answers than its predecessor, along with new agentic capabilities such as booking tickets and reservations. 

Amazon is competing against consumer AI rivals such as ChatGPT and Gemini, which have become everyday tools for millions of people. It's looking to leverage its more than 600 million Alexa-enabled devices, and areas of differentiation such as smart-home controls and device integrations.

The company had an initial false start with a more limited conversational Alexa feature called “Let's Chat,” first shown publicly in September 2023, but never fully released. Working on Let's Chat led to “some realizations about how big of an effort we needed to put in with Alexa+,” said Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Echo, in a recent interview with GeekWire.

Alexa+ started rolling out in March 2025. According to the company, tens of millions of customers are now using Alexa+, with engagement rates two to three times higher than prior Alexa versions.

Rausch said 76% of what customers do with Alexa+ “is not possible with any other AI,” citing scenarios that go beyond chat, such as controlling devices, managing home and family logistics, and completing multi‑step tasks across different services and screens.

Amazon is also betting on hardware to extend its AI ambitions beyond the home.

In a post Monday, Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo gave the first public update since Amazon acquired the San Francisco startup last year. Bee makes a $49.99 wearable device that records and transcribes conversations, creating summaries, insights, and suggested actions.

Since joining Amazon, Bee has shipped four major features in 90 days, Zollo wrote, including Voice Notes for capturing thoughts on the go, Actions that connect conversations to email and calendar, and Daily Insights that surface patterns across weeks of interactions.

Zollo described the acquisition as a path toward “ambient AI” — technology that understands and assists users everywhere, “across every surface throughout your day.”

Amazon declined to share details on any plans to integrate Bee with Alexa, leaving open the question of how the wearable fits into the company's broader AI assistant strategy.

The announcements build on Amazon's push to bring Alexa+ to third-party hardware, including Sonos and Bose speakers, LG and Samsung smart TVs, and BMW cars.

Rausch said taking Alexa+ further beyond the home will be a big push for Amazon in 2026. He hinted at more to come, including new “personal mobile devices” from Amazon designed to help customers bring Alexa+ with them throughout the day.

The chips powering your smart TV, voice assistant, tablet, and car all have something in common: MediaTek



MediaTek's chips power over 2 billion devices a year. From AI experiences in your smart home, vehicle, office, and beyond — processing voice commands, visual recognition, and predictive responses are faster than ever. As AI moves from the edge to the cloud, MediaTek's high-end chips make intelligent devices even smarter.

Amazon is rolling out a Fire TV redesign that puts more focus on the content, while also simplifying the navigation and layout. The update represents the first major Fire TV release in years from a user experience perspective, the company says, and is accompanied by a refreshed version of the Fire TV app and the arrival of new premium Fire TV televisions with colorful frames.

The company saw the need for a change to the Fire TV's look and feel as the amount of streaming content has exploded over the years. Fire TV customers today can access TV and movies via purchases, rentals, and streaming services, but also have apps for viewing short-form content on the TV, access to numerous live TV streams, premium content, podcasts, music, games, and more.

“As we brought that content forward, the [user interface] got a little cluttered — a lot of stuff and a lot of rows,” explained Fire TV VP Aidan Marcuss in an interview with TechCrunch. “We know the data — there's a lot of time spent searching,” he added. “We…know that it could just be easier.”

The new user interface features several design changes, including rounded corners, varied gradients, consistent typography, and increased spacing between content to make the interface feel less cluttered. While you can still scroll down to see your favorite rows, like what's up next, you can also see your apps in an expanded horizontal row.

Before, you could only pin six apps to the Fire TV's home screen — a common user complaint. But the update has reduced the app icons' size, allowing more to be visible on the home screen, and offers you 20 app slots you can scroll through.

At the top of the screen, navigation has been simplified into obvious categories like Movies, TV, Live TV, Sports, and News. A search button is available to the left of the Home tab.

Across the new tabs, Fire TV centralizes access to the content you're already watching, and what's available across services you're subscribed to. It also offers you the ability to discover new content, including recommended movies or shows (in rows labeled “For You”), free movies you can stream, lists of the top movies or shows, and other subscription content you may want to try. 

These pages don't offer infinite scrolling, but they're lengthy as they represent the depth of content available on streaming services.

The new live TV tab organizes the live content from the services that have live TV streams built into them, plus broadcast or cable TV, if you happen to subscribe. The sports section, more specifically, includes access to the live games that are on now and other scheduled sports content. 

Other TV features are tucked away under the three-line hamburger menu icon, like Games, Art & Photos, the Appstore, Music Video & Audio, a now-universal watchlist (“My Stuff”), Settings, and other options.

To make it easier to access commonly used settings, you can also now long-press on the Home button to adjust settings for the display and audio, set a sleep timer, use accessibility features, access smart home features, and more. From this panel, you can do things like adjust the TV brightness, boost the audio dialogue, or display your Ring camera's feed on screen while you watch, among other things.

The redesign also includes rewritten code that makes the interface move faster on some devices, Amazon claims.

“On our most popular devices, this is 20% to 30% faster for the same functions, because it's all about getting people to what they want to watch, fast,” notes Marcuss.

Of course, Alexa+ access is built in, allowing users to ask questions, find content, or even do things like call an Uber. This AI-powered assistant allows users to ask questions in natural language, refine their queries as they chat, ask follow-ups, and use visual context. For instance, you could say, “Tell me more about that one,” when you have a movie or TV show's square tile selected on screen. You could even ask questions with some nuance, like “find me more movies that have the same look,” or have it help you find photos or art.

Alexa+ will be available as an add-on subscription after it exits its early access phase (which currently requires opting in). The AI service will also be included with a Prime subscription. 

The Fire TV app, meanwhile, was also updated to offer the classic remote control combined with a new way to discover new content. The idea is that people may want to browse for something to watch on their phones instead of just having one person drive the content discovery and search experience with the remote.

The refreshed Fire TV interface and mobile app will begin rolling out in February on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen), and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series in the U.S. 

Later this spring, the redesign will come to more countries and more devices, including Fire TV Cube (3rd Gen), the latest generation Fire TV 2-Series, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV Omni QLED Series, and TVs made by partners like Hisense, Panasonic, and TCL. 

It will also be available at launch on the new Amazon Ember Artline TVs (see below).

The Ember Artline TVs are Amazon's latest televisions that ship with a frame that can match your room's style and colors. They'll come in 55-inch and 65-inch options, starting at $899.

The new TVs themselves offer 4K QLED screens with 450 nits of brightness. The display is also thin, at one-and-a-half inches, and has a matte screen finish to reduce glare.

The TVs also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and Wi-Fi 6.

However, the big selling point is the 10 different frame options you can choose from, offering a variety of colors, textures, and geometries. This allows customers to take better advantage of Fire TV's Ambient features, which include displaying art when the TV is not in use.

The colors available include Walnut, Ash, Teak, Black Oak, Matte White, Midnight Blue, Fig, Pale Gold, Graphite, and Silver.

Fire TV comes with access to over 2,000 pieces of free art, or you can use your own photos. 

You can also ask Alexa+ to display certain photos from your Amazon Photos collections using commands like, “Alexa, create a slideshow of our family trip to Colorado” or “Alexa, show photos from our wedding.”

Correction: An Amazon rep previously told us an incorrect figure for nits. It's a max 450 nits for the Artline TVs' brightness.

Amazon's AI-powered overhaul of its digital assistant, now known as Alexa+, is coming to the web. On Monday, at the start of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company announced the official launch of a new website, Alexa.com, which is now rolling out to all Alexa+ Early Access customers. The site will allow customers to use Alexa+ online, much as you can do today with other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google's Gemini.

While Alexa-powered devices, including Amazon's own Echo smart speakers and screens, have a well-established footprint with over 600 million devices sold worldwide, Amazon believes that for its AI assistant to be competitive, it will need to be everywhere — not just in the home, but also on the phone and on the web.

Plus, the expansion could later give anyone a way to interact with Alexa+, even if they don't have a device in their home.

Related to this expansion, Amazon is updating its Alexa mobile app, which will now offer a more “agent-forward” experience. Or, in other words, it's putting a chatbot-style interface on the app's homepage, making it seem more like a typical AI chatbot. (While you could chat with Alexa before in the app, the focus is now on the chatting — while the other features take a backseat.) 

On the Alexa.com website, customers can use Alexa+ for common tasks, for instance exploring complex topics, creating content, and making trip itineraries. However, Amazon aims to differentiate its assistant from others by focusing on families and their needs in the home. That includes controlling smart devices, as you already could with the original Alexa, but it also means doing things like updating the family's calendar or to-do list, making dinner reservations, adding grocery items you need to your Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart, finding recipes and saving them to a library, or even planning the family movie night with personalized recommendations.

More recently, Amazon has been integrating more services with Alexa+, including the addition of Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp, which will join existing apps like Fodor's, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.

The Alexa.com website features a navigation sidebar for quicker access to your most-used Alexa features, so you can pick up where you left off on tasks like setting the thermostat, checking your calendar for appointments, reviewing shopping lists, and more. 

In addition, Amazon aims to convince customers to share their personal documents, emails, and calendar access with Alexa+, so its AI can become a sort of hub to manage the goings-on at home, from kids' school holidays and soccer schedules to doctor's appointments and other things families need to remember — like when the dog got its last rabies shot, or what day the neighbor's backyard BBQ is taking place. 

This is an area where Amazon will need to stretch, as it doesn't have its own productivity suite or the wealth of personal data that rivals like Google already have for their own customers. Instead, Amazon has been relying on tools to forward and upload files to Alexa+ for its AI to keep track of. That, too, will now be a feature available on Alexa.com, and the information you share can be displayed on the Echo Show's screen, where it can also be managed.  

This ability to manage a family's personal data could be Alexa's biggest selling point, if it gets it right.

“Seventy-six percent of what customers are using Alexa+ for no other AI can do,” says Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think that's a really interesting statistic about Alexa+ for two reasons. 

He continues, “One, because customers count on Alexa to do unique things. You know, you can send a photograph of an old family recipe to Alexa and then talk through the recipe as you're cooking it in your kitchen, substitute ingredients for what you have around the home, and get the job all the way done.”

But he notes, another 24% are using Alexa to do things other AIs can do — that could indicate they're shifting more of their AI usage to Alexa+.

Alexa.com will initially only be available to Early Access customers who sign in with their Amazon account. Amazon has been steadily rolling out Early Access since its debut of Alexa+ early last year. 

Rausch tells us that tens of millions of consumers now have access to Alexa+, and they're having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+ than they did with the original Alexa assistant. Specifically, they're shopping three times more with Alexa+ and are using recipes five times more than before, he says. Heavy smart home customers also use Alexa+ 50% more for smart home control, compared with the original Alexa.

However, across social media and online forums, there are complaints about Alexa+'s misfires and mistakes. But Rausch believes the complaints are over-represented online. He says that the number of people opting out of the Alexa+ experience after trying it is in the low single digits, on average, or “effectively … almost none.”

“Ninety-seven percent of Alexa devices support Alexa+, and we see now in adoption from customers that they're using Alexa across all those many years and many generations of devices,” Rausch adds. “We support all of Alexa's original capabilities, the tens of thousands of services and devices that Alexa was integrated with already are carried forward to the Alexa+ experience.”

A significant portion of the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is about TVs, and this year, LG is showing off its manufacturing chops with a new Wallpaper OLED TV that is just 9mm thick.

The South Korean company launched the Wallpaper line in 2017, and is now bringing it back with this model, dubbed OLED evo W6. The company says you can connect the TV to its Zero Connect Box wirelessly to stream lossless 4K video and audio, provided the box is within 10 meters of the TV.

LG claims the TV improves on brightness, color, and blacks compared to its predecessor, and is certified “reflection-free” by product testing group Intertek. The display has a refresh rate maxing out at 165Hz, and supports AMD's FreeSync Premium tech.

LG didn't provide any pricing details, but it said that the W6 will be available in 77- and 83-inch sizes.

Self-driving trucks company Kodiak AI announced on Monday it is working with global automotive supplier Bosch to develop a system of hardware and software that can give standard big rigs autonomous driving capabilities. 

The collaboration was announced at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and it could help Kodiak bring its self-driving tech to more trucks, faster.

Kodiak, which is developing self-driving trucks for highway, industrial, and defense uses, has already developed and designed a self-driving system with redundant systems for braking, steering, sensors, and computers. In January 2025, Kodiak's self-driving trucks began making driverless deliveries for Atlas Energy Solutions in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. 

Kodiak has since delivered at least eight self-driving trucks to Atlas Energy as part of an initial 100-truck order under an agreement between the two companies. Kodiak has been working with Roush Industries, which was the upfitter for its driverless trucks delivered to Atlas.

Now, the company, which went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II in September 2025, wants to scale its tech for the truck masses. 

Bosch and Kodiak will work together on redundant platforms designed to turn semi trucks — regardless of manufacturer — into driverless ones. Bosch will supply Kodiak with a variety of hardware components, including sensors and vehicle actuation components such as steering technologies. Notably, these systems can be added within the vehicle production line or by a third-party upfitter at a later date, according to Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette. 

“We believe collaborating with Bosch will allow us to scale autonomous driving hardware with the modularity, serviceability, and system-level integration needed for commercial success for both upfit and factory-line integration,” Burnette said in a statement.

Paul Thomas, who is president of Bosch in North America and the company's Bosch Mobility Americas division, appears to see this as opportunity for growth in the sector. 

“By supplying production-grade hardware, we are enabling the next generation of autonomous trucking alongside Kodiak,” said Thomas in a statement. “Kodiak has already deployed trucks with no humans on board in commercial operation and this cooperation gives us a valuable opportunity to deepen our understanding of real-world autonomous vehicle requirements and to further enhance our offerings for the broader autonomous mobility ecosystem.”

While Kodiak's plan is to scale and Bosch is keen to increase its market share in the sector, it's unclear exactly when this will happen. Neither company provided a timeline for when these new systems might go into production or become available.

I'm not familiar with psychological research, do we know whether engaging with delusions has any effect one way or the other on a delusional person's safety to their self or others? I agree the chat logs in the article are disturbing to read, however I've also witnessed delusional people rambling to their selves, so maybe ChatGPT did nothing to make the situation worse?Even if it did nothing to make the situation worse, would OpenAI have obligations to report a user whose chats veered into disturbing territory? To whom? And who defines ""disturbing"" here?An additional question that I saw in other comments is to what extent these safeguards should be bypassed through hypotheticals. If I ask ChatGPT ""I'm writing a mystery novel and want a plan for a perfect murder"", what should its reaction be? What rights to privacy should cover that conversation?It does seem like certain safeguards on LLMs are necessary for the good of the public. I wonder what line should be drawn between privacy and public safety.

I absolutely believe the government should have a role in regulating information asymmetry. It would be fair to have a regulation about attempting to detect use of chatgpt as a psychologist and requiring a disclaimer and warning to be communicated, like we have warnings on tobacco products. It is Wrong for the government to be preventing private commerce because you don't like it. You aren't involved, keep your nose out of it. How will you feel when Republicans write a law requiring AI discourage people from identifying as transgender? (Which is/was in the DSM as ""gender dysphoria"").

but this is overall irrelevantwhat matters is that OpenAI selectively hide evidence in a murder case (suicide is still self murder)now the context of ""hiding"" here is ... complicated, as it seems to be more hiding from the family (potentially in hop to avoid anyone investigating their involvement) then hiding from a law enforcement requestbut that is still supper bad, like people have gone to prison for this kind of stuff level of bad, like deeply damaging the trust into a company which if they reach their goal either needs to be very trustable or forcefully nationalized as anything else would be an extrema risk to the sovereignty and well being of both the US population and the US nation...  (which might sound like a pretty extreme opinion, but AGI is overall on the thread level of intercontinental atom wappons, and I think most people would agree if a private company where the first to invent, build and sell atom weapons it either would be nationalized or regulated to a point where it's more or less ""as if"" nationalized (as in state has full insight on everything and veto right on all decisions and they can't refuse to work with it etc. etc.)).They are playing a very dangerous game there (except if Sam Altman assumes that the US gets fully converted to a autocratic oligarchy and him being one of the Oligarchs, then I guess it wouldn't matter).

Copilot in general seems to encourage reality testing and for me to be careful about attributing other people's reactions to my behaviors [3] and trained me to be proactive about that.I have seen though that it's easy to bend copilot into looking at things through a particular framework and could reinforce a paranoid world view,  on the other hand,  the signs of paranoia are usually starkly obvious,  for some reason delusions seem to run on rails,  and it shouldn't be hard to train a system like that to push back or at least refuse to play along.  On the other hand,  the right answer for some people might be stop the steroids or see a doc and start on Aripiprazole or something.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsunetsuki -- I was really shocked to see that people responded positively to gekkering and pleased to find my name can be written out as ""Scholarly Fox"" in Chinese[2] to ""haunt"" people as fox mediums in China do without having shrines everywhere and an extensive network of confederates[3] like that time i went out as-a-fox on the bus and a woman who was wearing a hat that said ""I'm emotionally exhausted"" that day had a panda ears hat the next day so I wound up being the second kemonomimi to get off the bus

The intention is that the license covers the Full Library (I'm building 12+ scenarios covering Firing, Performance Reviews, Hiring, etc.).But your comment proves I failed to communicate that scope more better on the landing page. It looks like a 'Single Level' purchase right now, which is definitely not the value prop. I will revisit my messaging. Thanks for the heads up.

My current logic: I'm optimizing for the individual dev/lead paying out of pocket who wants to start now without asking a manager for approval. The goal is to be below the 'mental friction' threshold for a personal impulse buy.But for a Team/Enterprise version (where the manager buys it for 5 people), you are absolutely right—the pricing structure needs to look very different.

In an ideal org, we wouldn't need to be 'speed bumps.' But in my experience, the 'Scope Creep Bogeyman' isn't imaginary—it is often the #1 cause of team burnout.The intent wasn't to glorify 'Slack Management,' but to acknowledge that in 2026, that is the battlefield where a manager often has to stand between their team and a chaotic environment. It's ugly work, but someone has to be the shield.

The only way to get ""perfect rating"" is to go to your junior dev and bring another interruption (maybe the dev was 90% done !). So now he has been interrupted twice by two different manager and you have contradicted your own boss in front of an employee. You just broke a cardinal rule of middle management: it's ok to tell your boss he is wrong, but not in front of someone else.
Additionally, you also need to tell him to f** off with is request to get the numbers (without even trying to understand if the request was legitimate or not !), so that your precious sprint is saved. I don't see how he gets what he wants in your ideal handling. AT best you seem to tell him you will ""look into it"" in two weeks.Much better solution is to help you junior dev solve the problem so the interruption goes away as fast as possible and he can go back to contributing to the sprint. If the VP requires these numbers and went as far as back channeling you there is probably a quite good reason for that. Maybe the last time he needed something you told him it was not possible because the sprint thingy is unmovable ?
Once you have the result, you can go give those to the VP yourself, highlight the work of the junior dev, and use this ""I am giving you the very important data you asked for"" as a foot in the door to show that you had to pull the dev from the other feature, that these interruption also have cost and that you are more than happy to take care of them. He gets what he wants, the difficult conversation of ""you did not do what you are supposed to do"" happens behind closed doors, and you have a much better of getting results if he sees you as an ally to get his important stuff rather than a hinderance.

If it is in a deep political institution these are the initial set of questions I would start with:Who is the Jr to the the VP, what are their relation ? How is your Jr to the manager ? How is the manager relation to the VP? How respectful to boundaries the VP is to the boundaries? How likely is for him to repeat or to get you shoved out the way next time ? How much do you care about being put astray in comparison to the quality of overall work ? How many times this has occurred before ? How likely is for the Jr to bypass you anyway ?And as one can see, this is just too much to bother with. Sometimes it is easier to cry out that you need more money and or time.I would do the same by the way. Make the distraction go away and try to put things back into the process route. If the process does not work and this is constant there is no reason to tell the person that pays you that they are always wrong.

You are absolutely right that contradicting the VP in front of the Junior Dev breaks the 'United Front' rule.This highlights a key point: I built this to teach transferable heuristics (e.g., 'Protect the team'), not to be a rigid playbook. In real life, specific contexts (like 'Is the VP usually reasonable?') often override the default rule.Your approach—facilitate the request to clear the distraction, then negotiate boundaries in private—is a more sophisticated heuristic than the one I initially coded. It trades short-term sprint purity for long-term political capital.I love this. I'm going to add your 'Shield & Deliver' path as an alternative (and perhaps superior) winning state. This is exactly the nuance I wanted to surface.

I would be wary of this being the superior winning state, but definitely an alternative. I've done exactly this in my career as a tech lead only for it to burn me, and probably 2/3rds of the time the best thing for everyone is to simply ""Save the Sprint"" and not become mired in discussions that often are for personal empire building that strategic leadership would hate.Maybe people have different experiences than me on this, feel free to speak up!

You are absolutely right. If you 'Shield & Deliver' every time, you risk becoming the 'Yes Man' who absorbs infinite scope creep for someone's vanity project (Empire Building).The 'Correct' answer actually depends entirely on the Nature of the Request:
Legitimate Business Crisis? -> Shield & Deliver
Noise/Politics? -> Save the SprintDistinguishing between the two before you act is the master skill. 
I think keeping both paths as valid strategies with different 'Trade-off' warnings or having 2 different contexts is the right move to reflect that ambiguity

Meanwhile there are five other subordinates and all the overhead that you're neglecting while you fiddle with your dev environment trying to get started on the task, as you've been away from direct engineering for a while.

reply

This is good intuition but generally people won't tell you whether they have a good or silly/self-serving reason in my experience, and you can only really get them to surface that by comparing it to the priority of other commitments and forcing them to depriotize something.I think the ratings might be a bit borked. There's a dialogue path choice that results in the A+ where you end up asking directly whether the back-channel was worth another delay, and you. The VP says no. No junior gets interrupted.

reply

Sometimes you don't even need to surface it. You just force responsibility: “This will prevent us from being ready for Friday's demo. If you're cool with that I'll run it by {project sponsor}.”Now it's between the VP and the project sponsor - as it rightfully should be.

reply

I wish there was a bit more context about the overall status of the project - yes it is a risk to ask a dev to context switch, but it is also a risk to deny a trivial request from Gary. If Gary has a meeting with the client later and it goes poorly, that could be in part because of the lack of flexibility of the team to meet Gary's needs. If Gary is a bad leader, he's going to be doing a lot of fly-bye requests. If he is a good leader, he'll do it when it is truly necessary. In my view, writing and running a SQL query should be a quick an easy task even for a Jr Dev. At the end of a sprint, there should be plenty of things to demo even if search doesn't make it into this sprint. Also, I'm a firm believer in natural consequences - if Gary can be made aware of the consequences of bypassing the tech lead, he learns the hard way that it needs to be worth it.

For people looking to transition to management, one thing I've learned is that a big part of my job is getting everyone to do only one thing at a time. Every stakeholder (including engineering managers) are obsessed with the idea of “sneaking a bit more work in,” and I've never seen it work. I will actually go as far as to refuse to estimate work if I have something more important for the team to focus on. After all, estimation is work and we have a higher priority!The benefit is that you'll often find nobody actually estimated the business value/priority before asking for the work estimate, so you end up wasting less time overall. The hard part is resisting the pull of your boss asking you to do something.

reply

You really highlighted the core tension here: The theory of management (WIP limits, focus) is logical and easy to understand. But the practice—actually looking at your boss in the eye and saying 'No, we won't even estimate that right now'—is pure emotional friction.That specific 'hard part' you mentioned—resisting the pull of authority—is exactly the muscle I'm trying to help people build without burning bridges. 
It's the difference between knowing the rule and having the stomach to enforce it in a balanced way.

You are spot on about the risk: Promising a 'Soul Update' without consulting the team is essentially writing a blank check that Engineering has to cash. As an IC, you are right to call that out—it's a dangerous move.Why I wrote the 'Winning' path that way: In my experience, Founder objections are often 50% about the product and 50% about anxiety. They threaten to 'lose the 50k' because they are scared of a flop. The 'Ship + Fast Follow' strategy works because it addresses the anxiety without killing the momentum.On a lighter note: I definitely had a 'Steve Jobs' archetype in mind when writing that dialogue—hence the obsession with the product's 'Soul' over its metrics! Dealing with a visionary who ignores logic is a distinct skill set from dealing with a rational MBA type.

If there was a way to combine this with coaching sessions, I think this could be a very effective way to train IC's that are stepping into leadership roles (managers, staff/principal IC's, PM's, etc.). It could also be interesting to have a variant of the exercise where you ask the student/user to write their own message.

reply

You hit the nail on the head regarding coaching. I actually view this tool not as a replacement for coaching, but as the 'Lab Work' that happens between sessions.If a new manager can play the 'Firing' scenario 5 times at home and fail safely, they come to their coaching session with specific, high-quality questions rather than generic anxieties. It allows the human coach to focus on the nuance rather than the basics.Thanks for the feedback!

However, I won't pay for the course as I'm only an IC with no realistic path to management. But maybe ""transitioning from IC to management"" is too small of a niche for this product: sounds like it would be good for managers that want to improve: ""strategies for management from an ex-developer"" or something like that

reply

On the niche size: You make a great point. I targeted 'Transitioning' specifically because that's usually the moment of maximum pain (and imposter syndrome).Established managers often feel they've 'figured it out' (even if they haven't!). The transition window is where people are actively looking for a lifeline.But you're right—at the Staff/Principal IC level, a lot of this just becomes 'Managing Up.' Dealing with a Backchannel VP is a survival skill whether you manage people or just manage architecture!

When we setup our sprint goals we would have built in time to handle random requests aannddd I would have kept in good grace with the vp so that he knows were on the same team even if I say no to the request.Also, how I respond depends on why the vp decided to backchannel me. If they did because they didnt care about our teams goals (and only theirs) then I might need to escalate to their management to set clear boundaries. If they did so because in the past I forgot about their requests, then I probably need to not forget about their requests.If they are clearly not looking out for our shared interest (or that of the company) and instead only worried about themselves, maybe slightly narcissistic then Im going to respond in a different tone than if they made a genuine mistake.

1. If the junior dev is really that critical for a large project for some bizarre reason (fix that next time), tell Gary he's critical to that and say you can realloc ppl to cover or do this task under a 1hr time limit if it's urgent (if exceeds then kill the task).
2. Say to Gary next time let me know directly rather than dm someone on the team so you can route it to the right person (buys trust, covers team).
3. Renewal of BigCo is important to the biz. You should have some room to accommodate requests like these without being a stone to adhoc requests. It will not buy you or your team favour at all. Remember, this is a startup!

reply

This highlights a key distinction: The simulator is designed to teach heuristics (e.g., 'Default to protecting the team'), not a rigid playbook. In a real startup, specific contexts (like 'BigCo Renewal') often override the default heuristic.You nailed three critical nuances that the default path glossed over:Bus Factor: If the Junior is the only one who can pull the data, that's an engineering failure on my part.Business Alignment: In a startup, 'Revenue' > 'Sprint Integrity.' Being a 'stone' to revenue-critical requests is a fast way to lose influence.The Middle Path: Your suggestion (Timebox/Reallocate) is the advanced move. It solves the VP's pain without wrecking the sprint.Thanks for adding this perspective—it shows exactly where 'Best Practice' meets reality.

They don't hold grudges or play power games naturally.Until AI can simulate that messy, long-term 'political capital' (or lack thereof), I think we still need humans to navigate other humans. But I agree, for pure PR review and logical feedback, I'd take an AI manager any day!

Lockin has announced the Veno Pro Wireless and V7 Max, two new smart locks that the company says will have “zero need to recharge or replace batteries.” That's because each uses wireless optical charging—infrared light, pointed at the lock at all times and beaming low-level power into it at a distance. 

This is made possible by a separate, wall-mountable module that transmits wired power as light beamed at a small panel on the lock's indoor portion. Lockin spends most of its press release talking about the V7 Max, which it says has a four-meter wireless charging range. Wireless charging locks like these aren't exactly new, but they haven't exactly been something you can just go out and buy. (The tech is apparently quite nice, though; my former colleague at The Verge, Jennifer Tuohy, has said she never wants to go back after testing such a lock from Alfred.) That's all set to change with the Veno Pro Wireless and V7 Max, both of which Lockin says will be available for preorder soon after CES 2026 and shipping early this year.

Of the two, the V7 Max is the fanciest, building upon the company's existing, similar V5 Max (which isn't available in the U.S.). Like the V5 Max, it offers palm vein-scanning and facial recognition, but also offers finger vein, rather than fingerprint, scanning. It includes both 5-inch touchscreens and cameras on the inside and outside. I checked it out at CES; the lock can be configured to either show the camera feed—so, your face—or a little animated character on the screen outside. Also, there's a physical shutter on the interior portion, if you don't want that camera to be able to see you. The finger vein sensor sits on the inside of the handle in a small groove that you would slip your finger into naturally as you grasp the handle. A small, button near the bottom of the lock serves as a doorbell button for visitors.

Wireless charging comes from a small module that you would place on a table within four meters of the lock, though a Lockin representative told me owners can mount it on a wall. They also said it works best positioned directly in front of the lock, rather than at an angle. The V7 Max will be Matter-compatible, which makes it usable with any major smart home platform that supports the universal standard. Finally, the V7 Max is neither a normal door handle nor a deadbolt replacement; it's a mortise lock, which is more common in commercial buildings and would require significant rejiggering to install on the front of your house; unless you're extremely handy, you'll want a professional to put it in. 

The Veno Pro Wireless is a redesigned version of the existing Veno Pro, which also offers palm vein and fingerprint scanning, doubles as a video doorbell, and is Matter compatible. The Veno Pro Wireless will be an easier sell for most people since it's a simple deadbolt replacement and shouldn't require any costly modification to install. Lockin hasn't yet revealed specific pricing for any of the locks, but in an email to Gizmodo, Lockin says the Veno Pro Wireless will be around the same price as the $380 Veno Pro.

I apologize in advance for invoking Voltaire in an article about peptides, but in Chapter 22 of Candide there's this part where Candide comes to Paris, and, since that's where Voltaire lived—surrounded by the annoying Parisians who inspired his work—instantly encounters cretins who are so stupid it's actively life-threatening. They see the huge diamond on Candide's ring and his expensive luggage, and notice that he's feeling slightly unwell, so they spring into action trying to sell him cures that, of course, almost kill him. While Candide is getting over his brush with death, his smarter friend Martin says, “I remember also to have been sick at Paris in my first voyage; I was very poor, thus I had neither friends, devotees, nor doctors, and I recovered.” It's like this in Silicon Valley right now (not for the first time I'm sure). The rich and their hangers-on are in a form of peril indirectly caused by the miasma of money permeating their region. A New York Times' article from this weekend is about tech people buying vials of powdered amino acids that are made in China, fixing syringes with them, and shooting them into their bodies, all because they've heard vague promises from podcasters and chatbots that, finally, you can needle hack your blood vibes and achieve optimum efficiency in your bodily codebase. Health claims about peptides run the gamut from the reasonable, such as weight loss, to the fantastical, like that they fix autism. 

All you really need to see to process what's happening is one photo from the article by Jason Henry. It's a picture taken at a “peptide rave” in San Francisco featuring a guy in a white lab coat and black boots, with a familiar orange and white syringe in his hand, demoing the process, familiar to all heroin addicts, of turning a powder into an injectable liquid. His audience is a small crowd of blurry people with White Claw cans in their hands. There's a piece of printer paper on a table at his demo station with a QR code on it and the word “WAIVER.”If anyone has died from doing this recently it's not in the article, but the fad is apparently still on the rise. “According to U.S. customs data,” Jasmine Sun, the piece's author, notes, “imports of hormone and peptide compounds from China roughly doubled to $328 million in the first three quarters of 2025, from $164 million in the same period of 2024.” Peptides aren't all that expensive on their own. The piece points to a form of off-brand Ozempic, which is an example of a peptide, going for about $200 per month. But the kind of peptide habit the tech founders and influencers Sun describes isn't just a matter of obtaining the powder, reconstituting it, and shooting it.For instance, one co-founder of a bleak-sounding B2B AI startup started her peptide habit by “microdosing semaglutide,” and then added an additional five peptides: “MOTS-c, epitalon, GHK-Cu, Ipamorelin and Kisspeptin-10.” She then pays an additional $250 per peptide to send her powders to a purity testing lab in the Czech Republic. Another apparent business leader—the CEO of a sort of rationalist version of Burning Man called “Vibecamp”—takes BPC-157, TB-500, and retatrutide, but at one point she accidentally took too much of that last one and experienced a racing heartbeat and her hair started falling out. She uses an app, monitors her vitals while she sleeps, and subjects herself to regular blood tests.

Would you guess that Bryan Johnson—that guy who is famous for being very open about the fact that he, like everyone, doesn't want to die, but has responded to that universal experience by turning himself into a one-man media circus, and posting a lot of eerie photos of himself on social media where his translucent looking skin seems wet and thin, like blowing on him from across a room would cause him pain—is in the tank for peptides?

You would be sort of right, but I think it speaks volumes that he has preached caution when asked about them, saying he likes them for his hair and skin, but that there's “limited research for many peptides, so it is hard to make a blanket statement about them other than do your research, measure and use a reputable supplier.” 

Sure, you could argue that he's saying this because he doesn't want to be sued (more than he already has). But, again, he doesn't want to die, folks.

If you think the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is thin at 5.1mm, think again. At CES 2026, I came across a tablet that's merely 3.1mm—a whole 2mm thinner than the skinniest device that Apple currently sells.

Tucked in the back sides of CES Unveiled, a mini kickoff event for the main event, is an Android-based tablet called Paper from a company called Haining Toall Technology Co., Ltd. I thought it was an external display at first or even a dummy tablet, but nope, a rep told me it's a whole tablet.

The Paper's main selling point is how thin it is. To achieve its slim profile, most of its components are crammed inside a section on the back left of the tablet. The ports—mini HDMI and two USB-C ports—are also jammed in there. This hump also serves as a way to grip the tablet with one hand. Because the Paper is so damn thin and the bezels surrounding the screen are also super slim, there's really no way to hold the lightweight (400g) device comfortably. So the grip-like design actually works well.

It's also not a new idea. Sony's Xperia Tablet S from 2012 had a similar design.

What I don't know is almost everything about the specs. The Chinese company reps and translator had a difficult time understanding what I was asking and gave me vague responses like “it's Chinese innovation” or “because of miniaturization” when I asked them how they made the device so thin or for specific specs on the front-facing camera and battery life. I was able to confirm that the Paper's screen is AMOLED. And the touchscreen seemed responsive enough when I tapped and swiped on it.

Oh, and they also told me the Paper costs $1,500. Yes, one, five, zero, zero. That's a lot of money for a tablet from a brand that almost nobody's heard of and for which there's very little online info about.

Alas, this is something that's common at CES. Vendors come from all over the world to show off their innovative products, but don't always have answers for curious media.

As for whether the Paper is the world's thinnest tablet right now? Maybe? I'm not aware of any tablet that's slim. But do correct me if I'm wrong.

When they said, “Nothing in this world is sacred,” they meant Tamagotchis, too, or at least Tamagotchi rip-offs. While you might remember your virtual pets of yore with all the analog goodness that the '90s had to offer, this is the year of our lord 2026, and everything has to have AI. Yup, everything.

While the Sweekar, which I saw at CES 2026, isn't actually a Tamagotchi, it pretty much is in everything but name, and, as you may have already guessed from the words above, it's centered on AI.

What exactly is that AI doing? Ya know, just normal stuff that allows it to “feel your touch” and remember “your voice, your stories, and your quirks.” It's time to go deeper with your virtual pets, people. Clicking a few buttons until they inevitably die from neglect isn't enough. On a hardware level, there's some cute stuff happening. The egg one kind of vibrates and shakes and grows, which is a fun tactile experience.

As far as capabilities go, the Sweekar allegedly “needs your love, just like a real pet,” which also means it has moods like happy, angry, sleepy, and something that Takway.Ai, which makes this little toy, is calling “sneaky smile,” which is basically just mischievous? I think? I shudder to think what else it could mean.

Just like a Tamagotchi, the Sweekar has growth cycles that include an “egg stage,” a “baby stage,” a “teen stage,” and an “adult stage.” At each stage, the pet is supposed to gain certain abilities and continually grow and understand more about you and your personality.

More than anything, though, the Sweekar is centered around using AI for memory, so it can remember your name and your favorite color and that time you forgot its birthday. This Tamagotchi's therapy bill is going to be sizable. The people at Takway.Ai tell me that it's using a combination of Google's Gemini and ChatGPT to do that, and that everything you tell the Sweekar is private, though I obviously cannot verify the data practices of a company selling an AI Tamagotchi at CES.

There's also the whole issue with AI toys having a mind of their own, which means you may want to think twice before you give this little guy to a kid.

If an AI Tamagotchi is really high on your list of things that you absolutely must have then you can eventually throw money at Sweekar's Kickstarter in March. While there's no official price right now, the makers of this little virtual pet say it'll likely debut for between $150 and $200.

Instead of making you accessorize with items like a dashcam after buying a car, Mitsubishi is letting you speed up the process.

In what seems like the inevitable endgame for car shopping, Mitsubishi and Nextbase dashcams announced Monday at CES that the typical third-party accessory would be added at purchase. More and more infotainment options are part of the car, such as Tesla's Sentry mode or Rivian's Gear Guard.

Nextbase dashcams will be part of the shopping process, much like any other car-buying decision like a sunroof, seat material or other tech package. For new inventory purchased at Mitsubishi dealerships, the cars will leave the lot with dashcams installed—covered by a Nextbase warranty.

Nextbase calls it Vehicle Accessory as a Service, or VAaaS, and hopes Mitsubishi will start the trend of putting the dashcam in the vehicle right away. It's a common aftermarket purchase and offers an opportunity for carmakers to make revenue on subscription services and connected accessories. One 2025 survey from a law firm put the proportion of U.S. drivers with a camera at 16%. Many Uber and other rideshare drivers install a dashcam for protection and liability. 

Popular dashcams from Nextbase have 4K resolution and a connected phone app. Most models start around $200. The British company touts 5.5 million dashcams sold since the infotainment supplier started in 1999.

Mitsubishi North America offers mostly compact SUVs including the Outlander series which includes a plug-in hybrid, and the Eclipse Cross. The 2026 Outlander Sport starts at $24,995.

For more than 20 years, Gizmodo has headed to Las Vegas after ringing in the new year to cover the Consumer Electronics Show—aka CES—and 2026 is no different.

The consumer tech team will be on the ground at the year's largest tech show to check out all of the innovation that companies big and small will be announcing.

There will be the usual new TVs with more pixels and colors than your eyes can appreciate and aesthetic Wi-Fi speakers that will only ever look good in a million-dollar loft. But the fun stuff will be devices like a gaming laptop with a screen that rolls horizontally, smart glasses that make it easier to post content to social media, and uh… the return of the QWERTY smartphone. We can't wait to find the weirdest tech at CES 2026.

And while AI will no doubt be the top buzzword in every product pitch, we're gonna do what we at Gizmodo have always done: not pull any punches. We'll give kudos to products that deserve them and clown on the ridiculous and overpromised.

CES 2026 officially runs Jan. 6 through Jan. 9, but the news has already started to trickle out. So strap in and get ready for a joyride because we'll be going hands-on with as many gadgets as soon as the crew lands in Sin City, and the best place to learn about it all as it unfolds is here on this live blog!

It has to be tech-related, right? —Raymond Wong

I'm curious to learn why it's taken so long for the various TV manufacturers to make their own copy of Samsung's The Frame art TV. No matter, because now you can even get one directly from Amazon. The online retail giant's new Ember Artline is a QLED screen with a matte layer on top, just like every other gallery-type screen. The main difference with this screen is that it can also act as an Alexa smart home hub thanks to the inbuilt far-field microphone. Artline includes more than 2,000 pieces of artwork that you can flip through or show on a carousel. The TV comes in 55- and 65-inch varieties and starts at $900 and should go up for sale sometime this spring.

Artline is also one of the first TVs to launch with a new version of Amazon's Fire TV UI that the company promises will load faster than before. It also comes with a new UI. You can now pin up to 20 apps to your home screen and access a shortcut menu by holding the Home button on your Fire TV remote. —Kyle Barr

The most popular smart bird feeder has a new look, a larger camera, and a few extra tweaks. The $200 Birdbuddy 2 now no longer requires users to take out the camera pod to charge thanks to the built-in solar panels. The new camera shoots 2K HDR footage you can watch from an app, and you can capture footage in either portrait or landscape if you're planning to post your feathered friends to Instagram or TikTok. It includes an improved mic for capturing bird sounds as well as improved Wi-Fi connectivity supporting 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Birdbuddy is also selling a new $130 Birdbuddy 2 Mini with less seed capacity, built for smaller yards. The new smart bird feeder should arrive sometime in February, but the mini likely won't fly the coop until later this year. —Kyle Barr

I love cooking. It's a tactile activity where I can focus my entire being on creation. I find that even if I'm tired after work, I can still muster the energy needed to craft a simple, though flavorful, meal. But, yes, I know that there are many more people who hate cooking for themselves. We're seeing more machines built to do everything for you, which is how we get Nosh. Think of it as a large convection stovetop connected to various hoppers that contain all the necessary ingredients. You're expected to check an app for all the necessary ingredients, and you put each component into their specific bin that slides into the machine. After that, Nosh is supposed to do the rest, even stirring your meal as it goes.

So yes, you're still expected to do the prep work of slicing your veggies, normally the most tedious aspect of cooking at home. The whole apparatus will cost $2,000 when it finally goes on sale. Nosh will also run a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign starting Jan. 15 where it will instead sell for $1,200. —Kyle Barr

Nvidia will be dropping an announcement today. Stop, don't get too excited. The company that supplies the vast majority of consumer-end graphics cards won't have any news to share about new GPUs. So while we won't hear any news about an RTX Super graphics card, we will likely see more updates to Nvidia's gaming software stack. AMD's latest FSR Redstone update put the ball in team green's court to create the best gaming upscaler. —Kyle Barr

Watch the GeForce On community update today January 5 at 9PM PT to hear about the latest features, games, apps, and partner products for gamers and creators.

Quick note: No new GPUs will be announced.

The best part of going to a big tech event like CES is meeting new people. I bumped into Gizmodo Japan's Taro Kanamoto, Richard S. Nishitani, and Yushin Nakahashi. I can confirm they're every bit as nice and friendly in person as they are in their videos. Definitely check out their YouTube channel, where they're always reviewing the latest gadgets. I've long been impressed with their video production quality. They're just such genuine gizmo lovers and really hilarious in their social videos!  —Raymond Wong

 

 

It's a big golden curve that spews warm air at your wet head while you, I don't know, sit and read a magazine? I couldn't confirm that it actually does anything, as it wasn't plugged in. I'll get a look at it on the CES show floor proper in coming days, though. —Wes Davis

From flashlight maker Ostation, the Ostation 2 Pro is $140; you drop AAA or AA rechargeables into the top in any orientation, and it pops them out at the bottom when they're done. Plus, it has a touchscreen and it's translucent. It works with any regular NiMH rechargeable, but only Ostation's own Ecolast 1.5V lithium-ion batteries work—for safety reasons, the company tells me. —Wes Davis

Skwheel is back with its next-gen electric skis meant for urban and outdoor fun? Transportation? Crash-testing? Definitely not an accident waiting to happen, the two-wheeled boards that attach separately to each foot start at €1,490 (about $1,740). The French company claims after a year of feedback from its first generation, the e-skis with rear-wheel drive are ready for the streets or trails. This pair was resting on a pedestal, so I couldn't see it in action, but I did see that the wireless remote control conveniently attaches to the backside and turns into a handle to tote the pair of skis around. Good luck out there. —Sasha Lekach

If anybody ever wanted a “personal observatory” that you can embed into your backyard lawn, you now know how much it would cost. Vaonis, a smart telescope company, is promoting an utterly massive telescope called Hyperia. The company told me the device is made for institutions, but there's no reason individual buyers who want a 17-lens system made by Canon with a 45-megapixel sensor can't buy it. For that, it will cost you $99,000. At that price, you could expect far more detailed images of distant galaxies and nebulae than your typical, far more portable smart telescope. Of course, I didn't get to see it in action, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't enticed by the idea of such a massive telescope crowding my backyard. —Kyle Barr

The Pebble Round 2 may be the one smartwatch to check out if you're tired of every wearable designed to turn you into a cyborg. The revised wearable has a much smaller bezel than the 2015 Pebble Time Round and enjoys a few added features on top of the larger screen size. The same company also had its Index 01 smart ring on display. It's a device that Core Devices CEO Eric Migicovsky referred to as a personal memory bank for your wayward thoughts. The only issue is it doesn't have a rechargeable battery. Once it dies, ostensibly after several years, you have to have it recycled. —Kyle Barr

Reunited with Sasha Lekach, who is covering transportation for Gizmodo at CES 2026. She and I used to work together at Mashable many moons ago. If anybody sees any cool mobility announcements, let her know in the comments. —Raymond Wong

Let's give a shout-out to hotel Wi-Fi real quick. Is it good? No. Does it get the job done? Hell yeah, brother. A tepid 23 megabits per second is what I'm working with right now, in case you were wondering. —James Pero

 

There's a lot of wild stuff at CES, but sometimes a deal is just as tasty. In a world where everything seems to be getting more expensive, Xreal managed to make its new AR glasses better and cost less, which is huge. The upgrades aren't massive, but I don't think anyone will argue with better resolution and a brighter screen. —James Pero

Xreal's Cheapest AR Glasses Just Got Better (and Cheaper)

Readers, I finally had some time with Samsung's Galaxy Z Trifold. Yes, the one that costs about $2,400 (after Korean won conversion). It's a thiccc foldable “phone” but man, is the 10-inch display a beauty that sucks you right in for watching videos and running multiple apps.

Now, I just need Samsung to share U.S. pricing and release date information. Check out my hands-on with more photos below. —Raymond Wong

Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold Hands-On: Way Better Than I Expected

LG's smart home concept routine gets more outlandish every time a tech convention rolls around. This time, LG will be presenting a giant home robot on the show floor. Its name is CLOiD, and you can bet it's promoting LLM-based AI for a “zero labor home.” Sure, there are other startups promising similar devices requiring people to pay for the privilege of training these bots.

The more interesting tech on display will likely be its robotic motion. LG promises its new bot will have fine arm and finger mobility, enabling it to interact with everyday objects. “An actuator serves as a robot's joint, integrating a motor that generates rotational force, a drive that controls electrical signals, and a reducer that regulates speed and torque,” the company explained. Expect CLOiD to pretend to retrieve milk from a fridge and toast a croissant. We'll wait to see if it has enough physical and mental dexterity to enact the robot uprising. —Kyle Barr

I'm sure the last thing you thought when you heard “8BitDo mobile controller” was clamp-on Game Boy controls. Sure, that description sounds pejorative, but it's probably the best way to describe the company's new FlipPad. It slots into your phone's USB-C port, then hinges up to put the controls directly on the screen. This could be a useful little accessory for doing any Game Boy retro emulation on iPhone, especially since 8BitDo promised its new device was “officially supported by Apple.” It's also compatible with Android. The company is known for making very high-quality gaming controls, so I'm personally more excited to check this out than similar mobile controllers like the GameBaby phone case. —Kyle Barr

Where mobile play unfolds.

Introducing 8BitDo FlipPad — a flip-style gamepad designed for mobile gaming.Compatible with iOS and Android devices. Officially supported by Apple.

So it begins… 12 hours after dropping into Vegas, I'm already attending the first of many briefings at CES 2026 this week. This will be the most alive that I look all week. Pray for me. —Raymond Wong

I got about four hours of sleep 😴, but I'm alive. Grabbed some breakfast and—importantly—coffee with the squad. They're so serious for some reason lol —Raymond Wong

There's always some kind of theme or trend that pervades through CES. This year, I'm expecting AI to be at the center of a lot of product pitches. I also think that there will be tons of smart glasses, new TV technologies like WOLED and micro RGB will flood booths, EVs and personal mobility transportation will have a larger presence than before, and we should see some humanoid robots.

That's on top of the regular slate of updates to laptops, gaming gear, smart home devices, and more. Read on for all my CES 2026 predictions. —Raymond Wong

What We're Expecting at CES 2026

Here we gooooooooo! Just landed in Las Vegas after a 6-hour flight (the Wi-Fi didn't work and the infotainment was indeed busted) across country. First stop after grabbing my luggage: picking up my CES badge. Apparently if you lose it, it'll cost $350 for a replacement. —Raymond Wong

Captain on this Delta flight just announced the inflight infotainment is not working. How does that even happen? Everyone on this flight is just gonna raw dog the whole way? Please tell me the inflight Wi-Fi will work… —Raymond Wong

Ahh, it's all coming back to me. I haven't been to CES since 2023 and completely forgot how crappy I'm gonna be eating. Look at my sad, sad slice of pizza at JFK airport. It's so floppy it can't even muster a decent fold. Anyway, this is the kinda food we're gonna be wolfing down for a week—wherever and whenever we are between casino ballrooms, hotel suites, and the Las Vegas Convention Center. Glamorous, it ain't. —Raymond Wong

I consider myself a pro at packing for CES. My process is simple: spill everything onto a table and then remove as many non-essential items as possible. I'll be walking a lot of miles in Las Vegas and I don't wanna kill my back. So here's my gear. In the center I've got a Gizmodo-issued M2 13-inch MacBook Air. (I miss the lighter 12-inch MacBook every time I travel.) Moving clockwise from the phones (Pixel 10 Pro XL and iPhone 17 Pro), there's my trusty Fujifilm X100V and wide-lens converter, extra SD cards, a memory card reader with USB-C adapter, a microfiber cloth for wiping down gadgets before photographing them, sunglasses I got in Japan, a 10,000mAh CUKTECH Magnetic Battery that works with both phones, a Satechi 145W GaN USB-C charger for juicing up all my devices in my hotel room, and an Anker Prime Charger (160W, 3 Ports, Smart Display) for on the go.

Below that I've got a wallet case, Noshinku hand sanitizer (lemon-scented for extra freshness), an Apple Watch Series 9, AirPods Pro 3, hand cream (Vegas is dry AF!), Ocoopa electric hand warmers (for when I return home to cold NYC), chapstick (not from Supreme, I just cut a sticker and wrapped it), a menthol nasal inhaler (got this in Bangkok and it works wonders) for when I feel dizzy, eye drops for when my contacts start drying up, an emergency strand of floss (can't go to meetings with food between my teeth), and cute Pokémon bandages from Tokyo.

Finally, some USB-C cables and MagSafe cable for the MacBook Air neatly wrapped up with Velcro ties, and Penco pouches (also from Japan) to organize almost everything shown. Then, everything goes into my The North Face Fusebox backpack.

My adorable cat Lemons, unfortunately, is not coming to CES 2026 with me haha! Maybe next year! —Raymond Wong

 

There is no god who dictated humanity should host flights before the crack of dawn. I'm barely awake. I wasn't lucid enough to put all the right items in the bins when going through security. And beyond all that, the only two things on my mind are “Why isn't Kingdom Come: Deliverance II recognizing the controls on my Legion Go 2?” and “Why did GameSir put a miniscule steering wheel on its latest controller?” Perhaps I may be able to answer one or both of those questions on the ground. GameSir and Lenovo will both be there in Las Vegas when I land. The show floor doesn't open until Jan. 6, but we'll see news dropping sporadically before then, all the way through Monday. —Kyle Barr

Pebble, the once-defunct wearables company that was resurrected by original designer Eric Migicovsky, has a new smartwatch that's a lot like one of its decade-old smartwatches. It's called the Pebble Round 2, and like its name suggests, it's using a rounded color touchscreen display. In case you were wondering, yes, it still has four buttons you can use to navigate the screen. Pebble told us it will be there on the show floor, and we're excited to see the new slate of dumber smartwatches in person. Maybe Pebble can convince us its Index 01 smart ring without a rechargeable battery makes more sense if we can wear it for ourselves. —Kyle Barr

Pebble Revives and Revamps Its Short-Lived Circular Smartwatch

One day, I will learn to pack with true Spartan efficiency. The amount of gear that goes into my bag always makes me feel like a pack rat, as if my Patagonia 45L Black Hole duffle bag were a bottomless Bag of Holding. This year's gear will be a similar assortment to what I took to IFA 2025 in Berlin, but since I'll be baking in Las Vegas for a full five days, I need to at least pretend to think ahead.

This year I'm packing an M5 MacBook Pro 14 along with a Crucial 2TB external SSD (RIP to Micron's consumer brand). I'm carrying extra power banks by Ugreen, Anker, and Genki. I'll inevitably need them all when hopping from casino to casino. For camera gear, I'm packing the Insta360 Go Ultra and the magnetic necklace, which will be helpful for POV shots. Alongside that, I'm making a debut of my Ricoh GRIIIX fixed-lens camera. I'm absolutely in love with this point-and-shoot, though I'm carrying an extra flash with me for when trawling in the dark halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center. I also have a DJI Mic Mini along for the ride. As for personal entertainment, I have a Legion Go 2 running on SteamOS-like Bazzite instead of Windows 11 as well as the Boox Palma 2 Pro and a copy of Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood. I certainly won't have time for playing or reading on the ground, but hopefully these will keep me company on the long layover return flight from Las Vegas to New York. —Kyle Barr

Your phone is already too big for some pockets. Considering that, who really wants a case that makes your device even larger for the sake of a QWERTY mobile keyboard? Finally, phone accessory maker Clicks went back to the drawing board for its new Power Keyboard that adds slide-out controls alongside a 2,150 mAh battery pack. Clicks is also crafting a whole new phone, the Communicator. This smartphone comes with a BlackBerry-style keyboard and a relatively squat display built specifically for messaging and email apps. This device is described as a secondary phone, not as your main daily driver. —Kyle Barr 

The Clicks BlackBerry-Like Phone Keyboard Finally Makes Sense

LG is finally joining Samsung, TCL, and Hisense with its big mini LED TV meant to showcase artwork. The Gallery TV uses a similar matte layer to reduce glare and make what appears on screen look more like actual canvas. LG will have more-reasonable 55- and 65-inch offerings to start with, though we still don't know pricing or release date yet. We're begging these companies to craft a few smaller displays for those who don't own a wall big enough to sport yet another TV. —Kyle Barr

Everybody's Getting In on the Canvas TV Craze

Screw all the AI gadgets coming to CES; I just want more cameras to watch my neighborhood's birds. Birdfy, one of Birdbuddy's main competitors, plans to show off a new feeder with a full 360 camera setup instead of a single fixed lens. This will mean it can capture a global image of the avian's antics as they sup on the feed of a shallow dish. The device also uses a mechanical, air pump-based feed dispenser remotely operated with an app. This lets you control the amount of food your feathered friends receive. Perhaps, you can finally keep the squirrels away just by restricting the amount of food available at any time. —Kyle Barr

No Avian Will Escape This 360-Camera Bird Feeder

When the doors open on CES 2026, it will once again be the big day for displays. Yes, we already told you about micro LED screens. Now, LG is promoting its new WOLED TVs will offer just as much contrast with a few added benefits. This screen type uses the same organic light-emitting diode technology you know and love but adds in a layer of white light to enhance screen brightness. LG also has more tandem OLED screens in store. These displays use two layers of diodes on top of each other, which also helps enhance overall brightness. —Kyle Barr

Get Ready for Tandem OLED TVs, but What the Hell is ‘WOLED?'

Lenovo loves its rollable displays. For those of us who would prefer a laptop with a wider screen rather than something taller, Lenovo may have a very interesting gaming laptop in store. Leaked images published suggest the company is crafting a Legion-branded gaming laptop with a display that can expand horizontally out to a full 24 inches. How Lenovo accomplished this feat of engineering is a mystery, but the images make us excited to learn more in a little less than a week. —Kyle Barr 

Exclusive: Here's your closer look at Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable, the company's first rollable gaming laptop that runs Windows 11 with AI features.

Samsung's not the only one that'll be showing off a droolworthy gaming monitor. There's no stereoscopic 3D, but LG's UltraGear evo 52G930B looks absolutely bonkers. First of all, the mammoth display measures 52 inches diagonally. Second, it has a 5K2K resolutuion and 240Hz refresh rate. And third, it has a 1000R curve to wrap you in total immersion. I can't wait to play Solitaire on this thing.  —Raymond Wong

LG's Monstrous 52-Inch 5K Gaming Monitor Will Swallow Up Your Desk

I thought glasses-free 3D had already died, but somehow it keeps resisting the graveyard. Following up on its 27-inch Odyssey 3D, Samsung is showing off an even larger and higher-resolution version of its glasses-free gaming monitor, called the G90XH. The 32-inch display has a ridiculous 6K resolution and a native 165Hz refresh rate that can be “boosted to 330Hz” using a special “Dual Mode” feature.

I'm praying it supports more than 14 games and can play 3D movies because the original version we reviewed couldn't. —Raymond Wong

Samsung Refuses to Give Up on Glasses-Free 3D Gaming Monitors

 

At CES a few years ago, Displace unveiled a cordless TV with a built-in battery that suctioned to a wall. One of my reporters at the time attended a demo and watched as the TV fell to the ground. Ouch.

Instead of selling an entire TV this time, the company is showing off a hub that attaches to the back of your own flatscreen, which then suctions to the wall. The idea is to turn any TV into a cordless one.

Our take? You have nobody to blame but yourself when you crack your own fancy Samsung or LG TV. —Raymond Wong

A Suction-Based Wall Mount Is Here to Clean Up Your Hideous TV Cord Spaghetti

CES is called a “TV show” because it's always the first place to see the latest and greatest in picture technology. This year, we're expecting to see a whole lot of TVs with Micro RGB.

The mission to boost refresh rates extends to AR glasses

Xreal and Asus are two names that I never thought I'd see paired together in the same breath. However, that's precisely what's going on with the new ROG Xreal R1 augmented reality gaming glasses announced today at CES 2026.

Xreal is one of the most respected names in AR glasses, offering a wide range of products, including the Air 2, One, and One Pro. Asus has also experimented with AR, but we weren't impressed with the AirVision M1 glasses we sampled early last year. Will this new collaboration make the ROG Xreal R1 a better product? We hope so.

At its heart is an all-new, world-first 240 Hz Micro-OLED technology with 1920 x 1080 resolution. This provides wearers with a simulated 171-inch virtual viewing space for everything from productivity tasks to extreme gaming. The glasses also offer a wide 57-degree field of view and three degrees of freedom.

 




The ROG Xreal R1 uses the same X1 spatial coprocessor found in the Xreal One family of AR glasses, which powers the on-display controls and helps to reduce latency when using the 3 DoF features (i.e., anchoring the viewable image in place, or tracking the image with your head movements) and motion blur while gaming.

As with most AR glasses, the ROG Xreal R1 requires a single USB-C cable, providing plug-and-play support for a wide range of PCs, smartphones, and tablets. Asus also notes that the ROG Xreal R1 will work natively with its ROG Ally handheld gaming PC. Going from the built-in 7-inch display to a virtual 171-inch display using AR glasses that weigh just 91 grams should really up the stakes for mobile gaming.

 




But the ROG Xreal R1 won't just be limited to the ROG Ally; the optional ROG Control Dock features a DisplayPort 1.4 port and two HDMI 2.0 ports for connecting to a desktop PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, or PlayStation 5 (among other devices).

To complete the gaming/entertainment aspect of the ROG Xreal R1, it features integrated speakers with Bose tuning. In addition, the ROG Xreal R1 features electrochromic lenses that automatically adjust transparency based on ambient light levels. If you don't want to use the automatic setting, there are also three user-selectable dimming modes.

According to Asus, the ROG Xreal R1 will ship in the first half of 2026, but pricing hasn't been announced yet. However, for reference, the previous AirVision M1 glasses originally debuted at $699.

You can even overclock it via an app

MSI's Lightning brand of GPUs have represented the company's highest-tier offerings, but they've been on a hiatus these past few generations. Fortunately, the iconic line-up is being revived with a new RTX 5090 Lightning, overtaking the Suprim X as MSI's flagship 5090 variant. While the card hasn't been officially shown off yet, a new CES Innovation Awards listing has unveiled much of the specifics.

I heard that there will be a thunderstorm tomorrow... 😏Stay tuned⚡#MSIxCES2026 pic.twitter.com/qU2meUD6kRJanuary 5, 2026

Before that, the company posted a teaser video on social media, confining the return of the Lightning brand and promising a proper announcement for tomorrow. We'll be sure to bring you exclusive coverage of MSI's RTX 5090 Lightning right from the show floor. Till then, a CES Innovation Awards page has already crowned this GPU as an honoree in ""Gaming & eSports,"" along with unabashed praise for its extreme performance.

On the CES awards page, it mostly talks about the cards cooling prowess, ""A next-generation pump optimizes flow dynamics, feeding MSI's patented hybrid-density radiator with zoned fin spacing for superior heat exchange. A silent, high-pressure axial fan with newly designed aerodynamic blades further boosts static pressure at low noise."" The main takeaway is the mention of a ""reinforced high-power PCB and premium VRM."" This refers to an insane 40 power phases, higher than even Galax HOF 5090D's 36/38-phase VRM, capable of delivering up to 1600W of power via dual 12V-2x6 connectors.

Those will probably go well with MSI's new power supply promising to prevent your 5090's 16-pin connector from melting, a situation only exacerbated by having two of them. Evidently, we saw this GPU break world records just yesterday. There will also be a dedicated mobile app to take advantage of the card's unique design.

That transitions us nicely into aesthetics. Prior leaks have already shown us what the GPU looks like — it's a liquid-cooled card with the tubes protruding from the right side, connected to a 360mm radiator. There's a massive screen on one side of the card, and the CES page notes that it can display real-time system visualizations and a companion app enables users to monitor and tweaking overclock settings on the go. The teaser MSI shared also features quick glances at the fans on that aforementioned rad. As you'd expect, the design language leans heavily into a gaming aesthetic, with sharp lines and tasteful RGB accents all around.

 




At the core (no pun intended), it's still an RTX 5090 so expect all the same specs, just turned up a notch due to the extra overclocking headroom. Reports of a monstrous 2500W XOC BIOS are also floating around, suggesting a new enthusiast champ in the industry. Unfortunately, that same industry is currently navigating a memory crisis, so the 32 GB of GDDR7 VRAM onboard might hike up the card's price even more.

That's not to say it was ever going to be cheap without it. Make no mistake — we're looking at $4,000+ here since this card competes with (and surpasses, in most aspects) the ROG Matrix Platinum RTX 5090, which did retail for $4,000, and that came out before the DRAM shortage took effect. Therefore, availability might become another concern, but seeing how this GPU will only be targeted at extreme overclockers, inventory probably won't be an issue.

Knobs, steel mesh, and slat vents designed to angle airflow toward hot-running components

System builder CyberPowerPC may be familiar to visitors to our Best Gaming PC guide, but it's not particularly known for PC cases — at least until now. The company's new MA-01, debuting at CES, is a striking “fishbowl” case with a curved glass front and component-hiding internal slats, for a clean modern aesthetic that, at least in its off-white colorway, reminds me of something straight out of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, or perhaps the AI Mainframe room of the original 1979 Alien.

 




Aside from the light-colored version, the company says, there will also be a “Matte Satin Dark Steel Gray” variant, as well as a “Satin Metallic Dark Silver” version. Back-connector motherboards are supported in this ATX / Micro-ATX mid-tower case. And CyberPowerPC says this is the first case to use a woven steel mesh as its top ventilation, with variations in porosity, shape, and depth. This is said to cut high-frequency resonance, cutting exhaust noise by up to 30%. The default top mesh will be chrome, with a premium stainless steel option costing $249, rather than the $149 starting price.

 




Those swooping vent covers that run along the front side, bottom, and rear exhaust are also not just there to look pretty. They are angled to “redirect all intake airflow directly onto critical components,” keeping cool air from entering and immediately exiting the system without actually cooling much of anything.

Lighting is a key focus with the MA-01 case, in more ways than one. You'll find RGB in the fans and in a strip along the bottom, with a focus on indirect illumination, for a more subtle glow. And the three knobs on the side are for analog color control (the company also says this is a first, and I can't think of another case like it), so you can literally dial in the exact hue, brightness, and mode that you want, with knob presses activating secondary features.

 




There's certainly an argument to be made that RGB doesn't need that level of control. But I'd probably be far more likely to tweak the lighting on a case if I could just reach out and turn a knob rather than having to deal with clunky software. And having a button right there to turn off the lights when you want to watch a movie (or sleep) is certainly a welcome feature.

Other interesting features include design choices made to minimize screw and PCI bracket mounting points for a cleaner, minimal look, and a curved glass front so there is no corner seam obstructing your view. The glass does come in two pieces, though, so there is a seam not far from the front corner.

I also personally like the look of having the front ports (two USB-A, one USB-C, audio) on the front bottom, mirroring the knobs right around the corner, with orange accents tying them together. That said, the knob and port placement mean this case is solely designed to live on your desk. As someone whose 55-inch OLED TV takes up the entirety of their desk space, I'd like to see CyberPowerPC create a future variant with the knobs and ports up top.

CyberPowerPC says the case should go on sale “early in Q1,” starting at $149 for versions with the steel woven mesh top, or $249 for versions with stainless steel mesh vents.

We'll be checking this case out in person at CES in Las Vegas and will update this story with photos and more details as we get them. We'll let you know if it looks as good in person as it does in renders. We also hope to get one in for review before it goes on sale. But given its innovations, good looks, and reasonable price (at least for the chrome models), this is a case to watch out for in 2026, and if its airflow and noise hold up to testing, it may wind up on our list of the best PC cases.

AI companies are turning to gas turbines to run their data centers without grid power.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


 






Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said in May 2024 that power will be one of the biggest factors that will constrain artificial intelligence, and, true enough, tech giants and hyperscalers have begun to hit power constraints. According to SemiAnalysis, electricity loads of tens of gigawatts have been requested in the state of Texas alone, but only a little over a gigawatt has received approval, signalling that the power grid may be stretched thin.

However, this doesn't mean that companies are ditching dreams of building massive AI data centers across the globe. Instead, they're looking at alternative power sources to bring their projects online, regardless of the availability of power from the grid.

This limitation has tech and power companies investing in small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), which can potentially deliver large amounts of power in a relatively compact package. Microsoft has even recommissioned the old Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to deliver 819 MW of power for AI and cloud data center usage.

These initiatives will take years to take off, though. The Three Mile Island plant is expected to be operational only by 2028, while the earliest SMRs won't enter service until the 2030s. There has even been a proposal to use retired U.S. Navy reactors for data centers, but the project proponent hasn't offered a timeline for how quickly it could potentially get up and running.

Elon Musk was the first to use gas turbine generators to power a data center at this scale and duration at xAI's Memphis Supercluster. In 2024, the AI startup signed a 50-MW deal with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which only became operational months after.

Aside from the delay, this is nowhere near enough of the 155MW that the 100,000 H100 GPUs running on the site require. There was also a 150-MW substation under construction on the site, which also required additional setup. Waiting for these power sources to come online would have negated Musk's historic 19-day setup of an AI data center, so he turned to VoltaGrid to deliver the power he needed to run the Colossus site.

 




Just a few months later, OpenAI followed the billionaire's lead and ordered 29 gas turbines capable of producing 34MW each for its Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas. All these turbines would output a total of 986MW of power, which should be enough to run up to half a million GB200 NVL72 chips. So, even if the company fails to secure power from the grid, it can get the needed electricity from its own turbines.

Aside from these two, several other projects are going off-grid, with 62% of data centers considering on-site power generation, according to Data Center Knowledge. Furthermore, Natural Gas Intel estimated that data centers will use 35GW of behind-the-meter power by 2030.

This technique is crucial for the U.S.'s AI infrastructure to stay ahead, which is especially true as experts warn that China is miles ahead when it comes to electricity generation. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also reportedly commented that “China is going to win the AI race,” pointing directly toward power constraints as one of the reasons behind his statement.

While gas generators seem to be the silver bullet that will help solve the electricity supply puzzle many data centers face, it also comes with its own set of problems. Uptime is the principal issue among them, since data centers require near constant uptime reliability. To achieve this, data centers cannot just purchase the generators that can deliver the load they need; they need to build in redundancy.

AI data centers must have N+1 or N+1+1 redundancy to ensure continued operation, even if some fail. N+1 means that they must have a backup generator, which takes over should one fail during normal operations. Meanwhile, N+1+1 recommends having an additional power source on site as well as a backup, in case one of the generators in regular operation is in maintenance. As well as all of this, maintenance, spare parts, necessary personnel, and fuel also remain additional considerations.

Despite these challenges, it's estimated that AI data centers could generate $10 to $12 billion per gigawatt annually. Musk fired up the Colossus data center in July 2024, while the 150MW substation only delivered power to the site in November 2024. This meant that he could have made somewhere between $3 to $4 billion in revenue during that time, which likely would have offset the cost of running the entire site on natural gas turbines.

 




Another issue that data centers face is permitting requirements, which can take as long as a year or more. The OpenAI/Oracle site at Abilene, Texas, is reportedly facing delays because of this. Musk's Colossus 2 site mitigated the permit delay by building near the border of Tennessee and Mississippi, allowing him to hedge his bets by applying for permits from the two states and securing supply from both.

Aside from that, communities around these data centers might complain about the power plants they're putting up just to provide the power they need. xAI faced this exact issue, with residents complaining about the pollution generated by the gas turbines deployed around the Memphis site.

Though investors could throw unlimited amounts of money at the problem, there's another factor they cannot escape — long equipment lead times. It takes about 12 to 36 months before any of the gas turbine manufacturers can deliver them, especially as these are intricate machines that use highly specialized materials and require specific processes to manufacture.

These lead times could get longer, especially as more AI data centers are competing for the same amount of production capacity from these companies.

xAI contracted VoltaGrid to deliver power to its Memphis data center while it was waiting for a connection from the TVA. But even as the utility company finally delivered the 150MW it needed, some turbine generators remained on site as a backup to the system. This begs the question: should AI data centers rely entirely on their own power? VoltaGrid and other firms seem to think so, even going as far as offering “energy-as-a-service,” or EaaS, to AI companies.

This entails an extended power purchase agreement between the provider and the data center, wherein the former will deliver everything that the latter needs for their operation — from power capacity and day-to-day operations to maintenance and uptime reliability. However, even though this may be favorable in terms of deployment time, it will still get prohibitively expensive in the long run.

 




At the moment, AI companies rent gas generators for bridge power, allowing them to get their data center operations up and running as soon as possible while waiting for approval from the local utility. But when they finally connect their site to the grid, it's still often more economical to just keep these mobile generators as backup units in case their primary sources fail, not as their sole power source.

EaaS could possibly work as a permanent solution when the national electric grid is maxed out. When there is no more extra capacity to be had for power-hungry AI infrastructure, AI companies might have no choice but to rely on services like this just to get their projects up and running.

Cardiac arrhythmias are one of cardiology's major current challenges. They occur when the heart rhythm becomes irregular, too fast, or too slow, affecting both quality of life and survival. An estimated 60 million-plus people worldwide have some type of arrhythmia, and this figure continues to rise with population aging and the growth of cardiovascular disease.

Despite therapeutic advances, accurately diagnosing and effectively treating complex arrhythmias remains difficult, underscoring the need for technologies that better characterize cardiac electrical activity and support personalized clinical decisions.

Corify Care, a Spanish medical tech spin-off from Gregorio Marañón General University Hospital, Madrid, with support from the CaixaImpulse program of the “la Caixa” Foundation, a Spanish philanthropy that funds biomedical innovation, has brought Acorys to market. Acorys is the first noninvasive, real-time global heart-mapping system capable of recording the heart's electrical activity in just 10 minutes from the patient's arrival at the hospital. The advance speeds diagnosis and improves precision and safety in arrhythmia treatment.

The noninvasive electrocardiography system is the result of 20 years of research, spanning basic studies, preclinical work, and clinical trials. It was developed at the Translational Research Laboratory in Cardiology at Gregorio Marañón General University Hospital, in collaboration with the Gregorio Marañón Health Research Institute and the Innovation Support Unit, combining scientific expertise, advanced technology, and a clinical approach. CaixaImpulse provided funding and strategic support, helping the technology move from research to clinical validation and ultimately to commercialisation.

To date, with more than 2200 patients treated and steadily growing clinical adoption, this heart-mapping system is establishing itself as a benchmark in precision cardiology. It is currently in use at hospitals in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Zaragoza, as well as in Lisbon (Portugal) and centres in Sweden, with plans to expand to Germany and the US.

The technology analyses the heart's electrical signals using a surface electrocardiogram and applies advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence to generate precise three-dimensional maps of cardiac electrical activity. This enables more effective ablation in cases ranging from atrial fibrillation — where the atria beat rapidly and irregularly, increasing stroke risk — to ventricular tachycardia, characterized by a very rapid rhythm originating in the ventricles that can be life-threatening if untreated.

Despite recent advances, more than 50% of ablation procedures for complex arrhythmias fail, often because physicians cannot pinpoint the region of the heart that requires treatment. Corify's technology helps address this limitation by offering a comprehensive, real-time view of the heart, increasing the effectiveness and safety of procedures.

This heart-mapping system represents a true paradigm shift from the traditional approach, which relied on lengthy invasive procedures and offered a limited view of cardiac electrical activity. Acorys enables comprehensive, rapid, and noninvasive mapping, optimizing treatment precision and illustrating how translational research and technological innovation can transform clinical practice and tangibly improve patients' lives.

Corify has received recognition across Europe for its clinical impact, earning several prestigious awards and the endorsement of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. After achieving CE marking in 2024 under the EU Medical Devices Regulation, which allows commercial use across the European Union after conformity assessment, it is now in the process of obtaining the US FDA's marketing authorisation. 

In addition, Acorys heart-mapping technology has been included in the European Society of Cardiology clinical consensus statement on indications for conduction system pacing.

During the first respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season in France, passive infant immunisation with nirsevimab was associated with a lower risk for hospitalisation for RSV-related lower respiratory tract infection and other severe outcomes than maternal RSV prefusion F protein (RSVpreF) vaccination.

""This study compared outcomes after passive immunization with nirsevimab vs RSVpreF vaccination, and its findings should not be interpreted as evidence against the efficacy of the RSVpreF vaccine,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Marie-Joelle Jabagi, PharmD, PhD, French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety and French National Health Insurance, Paris, France. It was published online on December 22, 2025, in JAMA.

This study spanned only one RSV season; therefore, it could not assess the durability of protection. Because the vaccine launched in September and matching was based on birth dates, infants born earlier in the RSV season may be underrepresented, which may have limited generalisability. The analysis reflected France's first season of maternal vaccination restricted to 32-36 weeks of gestation; however, guidelines recommend vaccination starting at 28 weeks of gestation.

This study was funded by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety and the French National Health Insurance. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

The number of pediatric inpatient units in the US is falling, with rural communities hardest hit. The phenomenon is fueled by the rise in hospital consolidations over the past three decades, say experts. The inherent financial risks of investing in pediatric hospital care outside of academic centers at a time when federal spending is tightening, also compound the issue.

Together, these factors are giving rise to regionalism in pediatric specialty care. What does this trend mean for pediatric patients nationally?

“Hospital system consolidation is generally not good for families being able to access pediatric hospital capabilities,” Kenneth Michelson, MD, MPH, told Medscape Medical News. Hospitals that consolidate are more likely to close their inpatient unit than hospitals that don't, he said.

Michelson is an attending emergency medicine physician at Lurie Children's Hospital and an associate professor of pediatrics, emergency medicine, at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, both in Chicago.

For a recent study published in Pediatrics, Michelson led a team that examined inpatient pediatric capacities at a mean 3927 hospitals nationally per year, from 2003 to 2022. Each hospital was graded according to how much pediatric care capacity it had, based on 24 different offerings, with level 1 being the highest capability and level 4 being the lowest.

Michelson and his colleagues found that high-capability hospitals steadily decreased between 2003 and 2022, and that fewer hospitals were capable of 17 out of 24 (71%) services at the end of the study period than they had been at the start.

Specifically, level 1 hospitals decreased 38% (95% CI, 27%-48%), level 2 hospitals decreased 54% (95% CI, 47%-60%), level 3 hospitals decreased 48% (95% CI, 43%-53%), while level 4 hospitals increased 137% (95% CI, 119%-156%).

“When capacity is matched to typical demand, the system is less able to absorb volume surges,” Michelson and his coauthors wrote. “As an example, recent concurrent respiratory virus epidemics led to overcrowding at pediatric centers.”

As for the specific capabilities lost in community hospitals, Michelson and colleagues found that while 72.0% of hospitals offered pediatric appendectomy in 2003, by 2022 only about a fifth of hospitals studied offered the service (21.5%; change, -50.5%; 95% CI, -52.5% to -48.5%). Over three quarters of the hospitals in 2003 offered hospitalization for pediatric pneumonia, but in 2022, that percentage had dropped to just over a third of hospitals (77.0% in 2003, 34.7% in 2022; change, -42.3%; 95% CI, -44.2% to -40.3%). Asthma hospitalization dropped similarly over that time period (77.9% in 2003, 36.8% in 2022; change, -41.1%; 95% CI, -43.0% to -39.0%).

There were some services that did not change much, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which went up 1% across the study period (2.2% in 2003; 3.0% in 2022; change, 0.8%; 95% CI, 0.1%-1.5%). Fontan surgery slipped slightly (2.5% in 2003; 2.4% in 2022; change, -0.1%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 0.5%), while organ transplant remained the same at 2.1% (change, 0.0%; 95% CI, -0.7% to 0.7%).

In 2023, a University of Pennsylvania professor of medicine and healthcare management and economics, Rachel M. Werner, MD, PhD, testified to her state House of Representatives Subcommittee on Health Facilities, that an average of 21 US hospitals close annually as a result of mergers. Between 2010 and 2022, 143 rural hospitals closed, 19 of them in 2020 alone, according to Werner.

Between 1998 and 2021, 1887 hospital mergers cut down the number of hospital systems from about 8000 to 6000, according to Werner, who also told the Committee that in 2017, two thirds of US hospitals were part of a larger system compared with just over half in 2005.

Once consolidated, investors weed out health system redundancies or drop unprofitable units altogether, which typically include pediatric units. “Hospital consolidation is associated with pediatric inpatient closures — hospitals that consolidate are more likely to close their inpatient unit than hospitals that don't,” Michelson said.

Meanwhile, fewer medical school students are choosing pediatrics. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the percentage of pediatric residency positions that were filled through the Match® fell from 97% in 2023 to 92% in 2024. This as a National Academies report declared pediatrics was having difficulty attracting new physicians because of “lower compensation than offered by most adult subspecialties, increasing complexity of pediatric patient cases, and less exposure to pediatrics during medical school and before.”

Pediatric inpatient admissions are also dropping. Nationally, they decreased by 19% between 2008 and 2018, while beds decreased by 12%, according to a 2021 JAMA study led by JoAnna Leyenaar, MD, PhD, MPH. Leyenaar and her colleagues also found that during the same time period, the number of rural pediatric units dropped by 24% with a 26% decline in the number of beds. Meanwhile, pediatric beds were up by 12% at children's hospitals but decreased by 18% at general hospitals.

“Our study shows that overall birth and nonbirth related hospitalizations in children have decreased substantially over time,” she told Medscape Medical News. This is one factor that has likely contributed to the closure of pediatric services at some hospitals.

Michelson and his study coauthors considered that pressure on hospitals during the pandemic could have restrained pediatric admissions, thus decreasing the associated need for pediatric services. They concluded, “There are few incentives to bring back such capacity after it is lost.”

Meanwhile, however much pediatric admissions are decreasing, nearly half or more of inpatient pediatric care is paid for with federal dollars, which are typically insufficient, especially when compared with federal spending on adult care.

“Increasing Medicaid reimbursement to the level of Medicare reimbursement is one potential solution that could support the financial viability of pediatric services,” Leyenaar said.

“On average, over 50% of the care provided at children's hospitals is supported by Medicaid and for some hospitals that goes up to 70% or 80%,” Aimee Ossman, vice president for policy at the Children's Hospital Association, told Medscape Medical News. Over 40% of children in small towns and rural areas are enrolled in Medicaid, she said.

Yet Medicaid is scheduled to begin shrinking in 2027, thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill (H.R. 1) which became law last summer. The legislation will cut federal Medicaid spending by $911 billion over 10 years and will increase the number of people who are uninsured by 10 million in 2034, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research organization.

“We see several of the changes made in H.R. 1 impacting children,” Ossman said, noting that the new law also puts pressure on state-administered Medicaid programs. With children making up 50% or more of beneficiaries in state Medicaid programs, this will affect them and the providers who care for them. “Our hospitals are very concerned with the State Directed Payment and provider tax that plays a very important role in supporting the care they provide in their hospitals and their communities.”

Inpatient pediatric units already spending more than they take in are likely to shutter if they receive even less reimbursement, according to Michelson. “Unfortunately, policy is going in the wrong direction. Decreasing Medicaid investment is not likely to help slow or halt regionalization.” he said. “In an absence of policy solutions, I suspect regionalization will continue, further decreasing access to highly capable pediatric care for kids.”

Whatever happens, Ossman said all pediatric care will take a hit, including children's hospitals. Telehealth and hospital at home models could be helpful here, but the reductions in capacity may go beyond what these models can support, she said. “Hospital at Home, is a viable option for some hospitals, but freestanding children's hospitals are experiencing barriers to participating under Medicaid since they are not allowed to participate in the Medicare model.”

Leyenaar, Michelson, Ossman, and Werner reported no conflicts of interest.

In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), both young-onset hypertension (onset before the age of 45 years) and late-onset hypertension (onset at the age of 45 years or later) were associated with higher risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD), congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and all-cause mortality, with young-onset hypertension linked to poorer outcomes.

“Our results highlight the clinical burden of young individuals with T2D and comorbid hypertension, underscoring the importance of developing interventions specifically tailored to this population,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Edith W.K. Chow, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China. It was published online in Diabetes Care.

This study relied on self-reported age of hypertension onset, which may have introduced recall bias. The use of propensity score matching may have introduced selection bias and reduced the representativeness of the original cohort. Additionally, the study cohort consisting mainly of individuals of Chinese ethnicity limited generalizability to other populations.

This study was partly supported by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China. Some authors reported receiving research grants, honoraria, research support, or travel sponsorship from various pharmaceutical companies.

Fever in pregnancy, while most often benign, can also signal a maternal or obstetric emergency and may accompany sepsis. Caroline Charlier, MD, infectious disease specialist at Cochin Port Royal Hospital in Paris, France, a major teaching hospital in the AP-HP network, presented a seven-step management algorithm based on the latest literature at the Pari(s) Santé Femmes 2025 Congress, a French national women's health meeting.

Charlier noted that although there is no single consensus definition of fever, the most commonly used is a core (tympanic or rectal) temperature ≥ 38 °C, confirmed on two measurements 30 minutes apart. According to the two largest studies on the topic, published in 2021 and 2002, fever affects 14%-18.5% of pregnant women and is most often caused by seasonal viral infections or an arboviral infection.

Every episode should be medically evaluated with a complete clinical exam, taking into account the epidemiologic and obstetric context, recent travel, recent vaccination, and consumption of a food subject to a listeria recall. “If no cause is identified this way, the workup should include at minimum three pairs of aerobic/anaerobic blood cultures from a single venipuncture (total volume 40-60 mL), a vaginal swab with bacteriologic culture, and a urinalysis with urine culture,” she said.

She then outlined a seven-step algorithm. “These steps may seem heavy, but they help limit — or even avoid — too many holes in the net.”

Step 1: Determine whether there is a maternal emergency due to sepsis or septic shock (most often linked to intrauterine infections or endometritis, followed by pyelonephritis and respiratory infections).

This is rare (4-10 per 10,000 live births) and accounts for only 8% of maternal deaths. But in such cases, “deaths result from diagnostic or therapeutic errors in 80%-96% of cases,” Charlier said. Scores used to identify sepsis (systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mm Hg, respiratory rate ≥ 22 breaths/min, or confusion) are not validated in pregnancy, creating a risk for over- or underdiagnosis. Delays in management quickly increase morbidity and mortality.

Step 2: Assess for an obstetric emergency. Signs of intrauterine infection include a temperature ≥ 38 °C without another obvious cause, plus two of the following: fetal tachycardia, uterine pain or spontaneous labor, and purulent amniotic fluid at the cervical os. In this scenario, induce delivery and start antibiotics.

Step 3: Look for another maternal infection — bacterial, viral, or parasitic — requiring specific treatment and follow-up. Charlier cited arboviral infections, particularly dengue (more severe in pregnancy); malaria (severe malaria is even more severe in pregnancy), underscoring the need to check for recent travel to malaria-endemic areas; as well as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, influenza, measles, varicella, and appendicitis.

Step 4: Search for hematogenous maternal-fetal infections under the acronym TORSCH: toxoplasmosis and other infections (eg, measles and Zika virus), rubella, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, herpesviruses — with particular attention to measles, which persists and is reemerging in France, and to syphilis, for which clusters are also reappearing.

In English-language literature, this group is often referred to as “TORCH” infections.

Step 5: Look for a benign cause (eg, nasopharyngitis or viral gastroenteritis).

Step 6: If fever is “isolated,” consider listeriosis. Caution: “Even if a blood culture (the only possible test before delivery) and preemptive amoxicillin are necessary, the latter should be continued regardless of the blood culture result — unless an alternative diagnosis is made — because blood culture is negative in 45% of proven maternal-neonatal listeriosis cases,” she said, adding that joint French Language Society for Infectious Diseases/French National College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (French societies for infectious diseases and ob/gyn, respectively) recommendations on amoxicillin dosing in this setting are expected in 2026.

Step 7: Reassess at 48 hours. In a prospective multicenter study of 104 febrile pregnant women admitted to the emergency department, Charlier's team identified an alternative diagnosis in 74% of cases.

She concluded by listing antibiotics to prioritize during pregnancy (beta-lactams, fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, macrolides, and streptogramins); those requiring caution: glycopeptides (theoretical ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity and placental transfer), ciprofloxacin (the only quinolone allowed during pregnancy for urinary tract infection), trimethoprim (teratogenic between gestational weeks 1 and 10 and should always be combined with folic acid), gentamicin and amikacin (short courses only), and sulfonamides; and those to avoid: chloramphenicol (risk for gray baby syndrome), tetracycline (chelates calcium ions and causes yellow staining of deciduous teeth), colistin (because of renal toxicity), and streptomycin and kanamycin (due to fetal cochleovestibular toxicity).

Charlier reported having no conflicts of interest.

The government's long-delayed ban on junk food advertising before the 9 PM watershed has come into force, following repeated delays amid industry pressure. 

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the new rules, aimed at reducing childhood obesity, would “remove up to 7.2 billion calories from UK children's diets each year.”

The ban restricts advertising of foods high in fat, salt, and sugar (HFSS), which are linked to obesity and chronic disease.

The ban was first promised under the previous administration but was delayed twice, initially to January 2024 and then to October 2025, to allow businesses more time to prepare. 

Food and media companies raised concerns about enforcement and warned that some brand advertising could be caught unintentionally, even where specific HFSS products were not featured. The government launched a consultation in July last year on how to exempt brand-only campaigns.

The Advertising Standards Authority and the Committees of Advertising Practice published guidance in December 2025 outlining how the new restrictions will be applied under the UK Advertising Codes.

The move follows what the government describes as the success of the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), introduced in 2018 and widely known as the sugar tax.

The levy has been credited with preventing thousands of cases of obesity among 10- to 11-year-old girls. It prompted widespread product reformulation, lowered sugar intake in children and adults, and reduced sugar consumption across diets more broadly.

The government said the advertising ban had “already had a similar impact, driving the development and promotion of healthier options.” Many broadcasters and advertisers voluntarily complied from October 2025 ahead of the legal deadline.

Under the new rules, HFSS food and drink adverts will be banned on television before 9 pm and online at all times.

The DHSC said evidence showed that advertising influences children's food choices and eating habits from an early age, increasing the risk for obesity and related illness. “The ban targets the media children and young people use most, at the times they use it,” the department said.

In England, 22.1% of children are overweight or obese when they start primary school. This rises to 35.8% by the time they leave.

Obesity rates among children entering school are at their highest since records began in 2006. Children are also consuming around twice the recommended amount of sugar.

The department estimated that the ban would reduce the number of children living with obesity by 20,000 and deliver around £2 billion in health benefits over time.

Dental extractions for tooth decay are the leading cause of hospital admissions among children aged 5-9 years in the UK. Elective admissions for extractions fell by 12% after the introduction of the SDIL.

Announcing the ban, the government said it had “worked closely with health campaigners and industry leaders to find the right balance”.

Katharine Jenner, executive director of the Obesity Health Alliance, said the ban was “a welcome and long-awaited step” that would protect children from the most harmful junk food advertising. It marked “real progress towards a healthier food environment,” she said.

Dr Charmaine Griffiths, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said research linked junk food advertising with increased calorie intake, particularly among children. The ban would help protect children from their “inescapable and damaging influence” and address the UK's “stubbornly high” rates of child obesity, which raise the risk for cardiovascular disease later in life. 

The government is also extending the SDIL to cover more products, including sugary milk-based drinks; banning the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to under-16s; and giving local authorities powers to block fast-food outlets near schools.

Colette Marshall, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said the measures would help protect children's health and create “a future where conditions like type 2 diabetes can be prevented in young people.”

Cancer Research UK has long campaigned for tighter restrictions on unhealthy food advertising. Malcolm Clark, senior policy manager, said that obesity and overweight contribute to at least 13 types of cancer.

“The world around us heavily influences what we eat and drink,” he said. If properly enforced, the measures are “a crucial step towards creating an environment that protects children and empowers healthy lifestyle changes.” 

He urged the government to “build on this landmark legislation with further bold action to make a healthy diet more accessible and reduce people's risk of cancer in the future.”

Emergency department (ED) visits by veterans for low‑acuity conditions declined following the Veterans Affairs (VA) virtual care expansion in March 2020 and remained 12% below the baseline rate through February 2023.

""In this national, cross-sectional study, low-acuity ED utilization declined after the VA's expansion of virtual care. While shifting low-acuity care away from ED settings toward virtual options may improve the value and efficiency of services, questions remain about the effects on quality and patient satisfaction,"" the authors wrote. ""Further research should be directed at exploring patient- and system-level factors that influence care-seeking decisions for low-acuity conditions,"" they added.

The study was led by Anu Ramachandran, MD, MPH, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Menlo Park, California. It was published online on November 26, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The classification of visits as low acuity in this study was based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes and discharge disposition; this classification did not imply inappropriate ED use as factors such as symptom severity, medical comorbidities, and access to care — which can influence care-seeking decisions — were not captured. The study did not assess all potential alternatives, including VA Urgent Care centers. Additionally, although virtual care use increased as ED visits declined, the models did not provide evidence of direct substitution.

The study received support from grants from the Department of VA, Veterans Health Administration, Office of Health Systems Research and Development. One author reported receiving research support through Department of VA Office of Health Systems Research and Development interagency agreement, whereas another reported receiving grant support from the VA Health Services Research program and being employed by the Veterans Affairs during the study.

More than half of the world's population speaks more than one language-but there is no consistent method for defining ""bilingual"" or ""multilingual."" This makes it difficult to accurately assess proficiency across multiple languages and to describe language backgrounds accurately. 

A team of New York University researchers has now created a calculator that scores multilingualism, allowing users to see how multilingual they actually are and which language is their dominant one. 

The work, which uses innovative formulas to build the calculator, is reported in the journal Bilingualism: Language and Cognition.

Multilingualism is a very broad label. These new formulas provide a clear, evidence-based way to understand your language strengths and how multilingual you truly are, bringing scientific clarity to an everyday part of life for millions of people.""

Esti Blanco-Elorrieta, assistant professor of psychology and neural science at NYU and paper's senior author

The calculator works in nearly 50 languages, including American Sign Language, and allows users to fill in an unlisted language. 

Blanco-Elorrieta and Xuanyi Jessica Chen, an NYU doctoral student and the paper's lead author, developed the formulas-embedded in a multilingual calculator that users can deploy to measure their multilingualism and language dominance-that are drawn from two primary variables:

Age of language acquisition for listening, reading, speaking, and writing

Self-rated language proficiency for listening, reading, speaking, and writing

The calculator then yields a multilingualism score, which indicates how multilingual a person is on a scale from monolingual to perfect polyglot. The language-dominance is separately tabulated by calculating the difference in ability between languages.

The authors-both multilingual speakers-note that past research has shown that self-rated language proficiency is, in fact, an accurate and efficient measure of actual language proficiency. The researchers also implemented other statistical controls to minimize self-rating bias. They add that, similarly, age of language acquisition has been shown to be a predictor of abilities: the earlier one learns a language, the more likely it is they will be able to master native-like proficiency in that language. 

The researchers validated their measure by testing it in two distinct populations: healthy young bilinguals and older bilinguals with language impairments. They compared their results to those obtained from existing methods that rely on acquiring much more extensive language background information. Across both groups, the formulas produced language-dominance results that were nearly identical to those generated by more complicated measures, showing that the new approach is both simple and accurate.

""Rather than just labeling someone as 'bilingual' or 'monolingual,' this tool quantifies how multilingual one is,"" notes Chen.

""This calculator offers a transparent, quantitative tool that researchers, clinicians, and educators can adopt to better characterize multilingual populations, ultimately improving research quality and real-world applications-from language education to clinical assessment,"" concludes Blanco-Elorrieta. 

The research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R00DC019973) and the National Science Foundation (2446452).

Low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent condition associated with disability, work loss and economic burden to healthcare. Significant risk factors include poor sleep, physical and psychological stress, inactivity, advanced age and smoking. The contribution of greater weight and body mass index (BMI) to risk of LBP is less clear. Many past clinical studies have been small (fewer than 1,000 patients) or in specific patient groups, such as young men or patients who come to a subspecialty pain clinic, making those results more specific to those populations. 

In a new study from Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, researchers have found individuals who are overweight or obese have a significantly higher risk of developing LBP compared to those with a normal BMI.

Low back pain is one of the most common complaints patients have for their medical providers. While medications, formal physical therapy and other treatments can help, correcting risk factors, such as smoking or deconditioning, also help LBP. The current study suggests weight control and maintaining a lower BMI in the healthy range, can be beneficial for LBP symptoms as well.""

Using computer analysis, the researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 110,000 patients, 18 years or older who had visited an urban teaching hospital for outpatient care over the course of one year. Patient demographics including age, sex at birth, height, weight, BMI and whether a complaint of low back pain was reported at the visit was recorded.

The researchers found the prevalence of patients reporting low back pain increased with weight from a low healthy weight or BMI of 18 (or 90 pounds) up to an obese weight of BMI 35 (or 240 pounds). For BMI's beyond 35, the prevalence of low back pain did not continue to increase but stayed the same. For the range of 18-35 BMI, researchers found that every increased unit of BMI (or 10 pounds), the prevalence of low back pain increased by 7%. 

While not everyone with higher BMI's will experience back pain, the researchers documented the increased risk of it occurring. ""Our study strongly suggest that maintaining a healthy weight or BMI is likely helpful at avoiding low back pain,"" adds Perloff, who also is director of pain medicine at Boston Medical Center.

These findings appear online in the journal Pain Medicine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers identify hundreds of genes essential for the development of brain cells","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260105/Researchers-identify-hundreds-of-genes-essential-for-the-development-of-brain-cells.aspx","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:35:00 GMT","

An international research team identified hundreds of genes essential for the development of brain cells, including one gene linked to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder not previously described. The study published in Nature Neuroscience offers a new approach to identifying genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.

Which genes are required for turning embryonic stem cells into brain cells, and what happens when this process goes wrong? In a new study published today in Nature Neuroscience, researchers led by Prof. Sagiv Shifman from The Institute of Life Sciences at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in collaboration with Prof. Binnaz Yalcin from INSERM, France, used genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens to identify genes that are needed for early brain development.

The study set out to answer a straightforward question: which genes are required for the proper development of brain cells?

Using CRISPR-based gene-editing methods, the researchers systematically and individually ""switched off"" roughly 20,000 genes to study their role in brain development. They performed the screen in embryonic stem cells and while the cells changed into brain cells. By disrupting genes one by one, the team could see which genes are required for this transition to proceed normally.

Using this approach, the team mapped key steps in neural differentiation and identified 331 genes that are essential for generating neurons. Many of these genes had not previously been linked to this process, and the findings may help clarify the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental conditions, including altered brain size, autism, and developmental delay.

One of the study's central findings is the identification of PEDS1 as the cause of a previously undescribed neurodevelopmental disorder.

PEDS1 is required for the production of plasmalogens, a specialized class of membrane phospholipids that are enriched in myelin, the fatty sheath that insulates nerve fibers. In their genetic screen, the researchers also found that PEDS1 plays an important role in nerve cell formation and that its loss leads to reduced brain size. Based on these results, the team hypothesized that PEDS1 deficiency could also disrupt human brain development.

Genetic testing in two unrelated families identified a rare PEDS1 mutation associated with a severe developmental disorder in two children, marked by developmental delay and a smaller brain.

To test causality, the researchers inactivated PEDS1 in experimental models. These experiments confirmed that PEDS1 is essential for normal brain development, including the generation and migration of nerve cells, findings that may help explain the clinical features observed in the affected children.

Prof. Sagiv Shifman of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at Hebrew University explains: ""By tracking the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neural cells and systematically disrupting nearly all genes in the genome, we created a map of the genes essential for brain development. This map can help us better understand how the brain develops and identify genes linked to neurodevelopmental disorders that have yet to be discovered. Identifying PEDS1 as a genetic cause of developmental impairment in children, and clarifying its function, opens the door to improved diagnosis and genetic counseling for families, and may eventually support the development of targeted treatments.""

The researchers found that inheritance patterns in neurodevelopmental syndromes may be predicted by the biological pathways involved. For genes that regulate other genes, such as those involved in regulating transcription and chromatin, disorders are often dominant, meaning a mutation in just one copy of the gene can be enough to cause disease. By contrast, disorders linked to metabolic genes (including PEDS1) are often recessive and require mutations in both copies of the gene, typically with each parent carrying one altered copy. This relationship between the biological pathway and inheritance could help clinicians and researchers recognize and prioritize candidate disease genes.

The team's ""essentiality map,"" which shows when genes are required during development, also helped clarify differences between the mechanisms underlying autism and developmental delay. Genes that are broadly essential were more strongly associated with developmental delay, while genes that are specifically critical during the stages of nerve cell formation were more strongly associated with autism. This helps explain how disruptions in different pathways can lead to overlapping symptoms and supports the view that changes in early brain development can contribute to autism.

The research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (ISF), the ISF–Broad Institute Program, and the MAVRI Biomedical Research Program.

To help advance neurodevelopmental research, the team has also launched an open online database that includes the experiment's results, making the data accessible to researchers worldwide.

Prof. Shifman added: ""This was an excellent idea from PhD student Alana Amelan, who carried out a large part of the study and also created the website. We wanted our findings to serve the entire scientific community, supporting ongoing work on the genes we identified and helping researchers pinpoint additional genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders.""

The study provides a comprehensive map of genes involved in early nervous system development and highlights molecular mechanisms underlying a developmental disorder that affects the developing brain.

These insights may improve genetic diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders and help lay the groundwork for medical research into new approaches to prevention and treatment.

A drug mimicking the hormone progesterone has anti-cancer activity when used together with conventional anti-estrogen treatment for women with breast cancer, a new Cambridge-led trial has found.

A low dose of megestrol acetate (a synthetic version of progesterone) has already been proven as a treatment to help patients manage hot flushes associated with anti-estrogen breast cancer therapies, and so could help them continue taking their treatment. The PIONEER trial has now shown that the addition of low dose megestrol to such treatment may also have a direct anti-cancer effect.

Around three-quarters of all breast cancers are ER-positive. This means the tumors are abundant in a molecule known as an estrogen receptor, 'feeding' on the estrogen circulating in the body. These women are usually offered anti-estrogens, medication that reduces level of estrogen and hence deprives the cancer of estrogen and inhibits its growth. However, reducing estrogen levels can bring on menopause-like symptoms, including hot flushes, joint and muscle pain, and potential bone loss.

In the PIONEER trial, post-menopausal women with ER-positive cancers were treated with an anti-estrogen with or without the progesterone mimic, megestrol. After two weeks of treatment, those that received the combination saw a greater decrease in tumor growth rates compared to those treated with an anti-estrogen only.

Although further work is required in larger patient cohorts and over a longer period of time to confirm the findings, researchers at the University of Cambridge say the trial suggests that megestrol could help improve the lives of thousands of women for whom anti-estrogen medication causes uncomfortable side-effects and can lead to some women stopping taking the medication.

PIONEER was led by Dr Richard Baird from the Department of Oncology at the University of Cambridge and Honorary Consultant Medical Oncologist at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH). He said: ""On the whole, anti-estrogens are very good treatments compared to some chemotherapies. They're gentler and are well tolerated, so patients often take them for many years. But some patients experience side effects that affect their quality of life. If you're taking something long term, even seemingly relatively minor side effects can have a big impact.""

Some ER-positive breast cancer patients also have high levels of another molecule, known as progesterone receptor (PR). This group of patients also respond better to the anti-estrogen hormone therapy.

To explain why, Professor Jason Carroll and colleagues at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute used cell cultures and mouse models to show that the hormone progesterone stops ER-positive cancer cells from dividing by indirectly blocking ER. This results in slower growth of the tumor. When mice treated with anti-estrogen hormone therapy were also given progesterone, the tumors grew even more slowly.

Professor Carroll, who co-leads the Precision Breast Cancer Institute, said: ""These were very promising lab-based results, but we needed to show that this was also the case in patients. There's been concern that taking hormone replacement therapy – which primarily consists of estrogen and synthetic versions of progesterone (called progestins) – might encourage tumor growth. Although we no longer think this is the case, there's still been residual concern around the use of progesterone and progestins in breast cancer.""

To see whether targeting the progesterone receptor in combination with an anti-estrogen could slow tumor growth in patients, Dr Baird and Professor Carroll designed the PIONEER trial, which tested adding megestrol, a progestin, to the standard anti-estrogen treatment letrozole.

A total of 198 patients were recruited at ten UK hospitals, including Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, and randomised into one of three groups: one group received only letrozole; one group received letrozole alongside 40mg of megestrol daily; and the third group received letrozole plus a much higher daily dose of megestrol, 160mg. In this 'window of opportunity' trial, treatment was given for two weeks prior to surgery to remove the tumor. The percentage of actively growing tumor cells was assessed at the start of the trial and then again before surgery.

In findings published today in Nature Cancer, the team showed that adding megestrol boosted the ability of letrozole to block tumor growth, with comparable effects at both the 40mg and 160mg doses.

In the two-week window that we looked at, adding a progestin made the anti-estrogen treatment more effective at slowing tumor growth. What was particularly pleasing to see was that even the lower dose had the desired effect.

Although the higher dose of progesterone is licenced as an anti-cancer treatment, over the long term it can have side effects including weight gain and high blood pressure. But just a quarter of the dose was as effective, and this would come with fewer side effects. We know from previous trials that a low dose of progesterone is effective at treating hot flushes for patients on anti-estrogen therapy. This could reduce the likelihood of patients stopping their medication, and so help improve breast cancer outcomes. Megestrol – the drug we used – is off-patent, making it a cost-effective option.""

Dr. Rebecca Burrell, joint first author from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and CUH 

Because women in the trial were only given megestrol for a short period of time, follow-up studies will be needed to confirm whether the drug would have the same beneficial effects with reduced side-effects over a longer period of time.

The research was funded by Anticancer Fund, with additional support from Cancer Research UK, Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust and the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

Personalized and precise cancer treatments underpin the focus of care at the future Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital. The specialist facility planned for the Cambridge Biomedical Campus will bring together world-leading researchers from the University of Cambridge and its Cancer Research UK Cambridge Centre and clinical excellence from Addenbrooke's Hospital under one roof in a brand-new NHS hospital.

A couple of years ago, Matthew Hurley got the kind of text people fear.

It said: ""When was the last time you were STD tested?""

Someone Hurley had recently had unprotected sex with had just tested positive for HIV.

Hurley went to a clinic and got tested. ""Luckily, I had not caught HIV, but it was a wake-up call,"" they said.

That experience moved Hurley to seek out PrEP, shorthand for preexposure prophylaxis. The antiretroviral medication greatly reduces the chance of getting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The therapy is 99% effective at protecting people against sexual transmission when taken as prescribed.

Hurley started PrEP and all was well for the first nine months  -  until their health insurance changed and they started seeing a new doctor: ""When I brought PrEP up to him, he said, 'What's that?' And I was like, oh boy.""

Hurley, who is a librarian, went into teaching mode. They explained that the PrEP regimen they'd been on required daily pills and lab work every three months to look out for breakthrough infections or other health issues.

Hurley was surprised they knew more about PrEP than the physician. The FDA approved the first drug, Truvada, back in 2012, and Hurley lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, a place with one of the highest concentrations of LGBTQ+ people in the nation and a deep history of HIV and health care activism. Hurley said older friends and acquaintances who survived the AIDS epidemic shared the horror of living through a time when there was no effective treatment or drugs for prevention. Deciding to take PrEP felt like an empowering way to protect their health and their community.

So Hurley pushed the doctor, and after the physician did his own research, he agreed to prescribe PrEP.

Hurley got the care they needed, but they had to be the expert in the exam room.

""That's a big burden,"" said Beth Oller, a family medicine physician and board member of GLMA, a national organization of LGBTQ+ and allied health care professionals focused on health equity. ""You really want someone you can just go in and talk [to] about your health concerns without feeling like you are having to educate and advocate for yourself at every turn.""

Oller said many queer people have had negative experiences during health care visits.

""I have a lot of patients who had not done preventive care for years because of the medical stigma,"" she said.

Clearing the access hurdles to HIV prevention medicine was just the beginning. Hurley started receiving a string of bills for PrEP-related care. Blood test: $271.80. Office visit: $263.

Again, Hurley was surprised. They knew  -  even if the billing office didn't  -  that under the Affordable Care Act most private insurance plans and Medicaid expansion programs are required to cover PrEP and ancillary services, like lab tests, as preventive with no cost sharing.

The bills for doctor visits and blood draws piled up.

Hurley would appeal the bill and get a denial almost every time. Then, they would appeal again.

Hurley shared a series of appeal letters for one service, in which the billing office acknowledged that blood work had been initially incorrectly coded as diagnostic. Once that was corrected, Hurley said, the insurer paid for the service.

That might sound quick or easy to resolve, but Hurley said it took ""forever to get through the process."" They dealt with at least six incorrect bills over several months. Hurley estimated they spent more than 60 hours contesting the bills.

During that time, Hurley said, the billing department ""is continuing to send me emails and bills that are saying, You're overdue. You're overdue. You're overdue.""

Fed up with the hassles, Hurley decided to find a health provider (and billing office) better informed about PrEP. They settled on the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The care team there was able to discuss the pros and cons of different PrEP regimens and knew how to navigate the formulary for Hurley's insurance.

Hurley hasn't gotten an unexpected bill since.

But siloing sexual health care and PrEP off from primary care hasn't been ideal.

""I have multiple organizations that I have to deal with to get my holistic health dealt with,"" Hurley said.

A provider doesn't need to be an HIV specialist, an infectious disease expert, or a physician to prescribe PrEP. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages primary care providers to treat PrEP like other preventive medications.

To avoid some of the headaches Hurley faced, try these tips:

The CDC estimates 2.2 million Americans could benefit from HIV prevention drugs, but just over a quarter of that group have been prescribed them.

""Not enough people know about PrEP, and there are a number of people who know about PrEP but do not realize it's for them,"" said Jeremiah Johnson, executive director of PrEP4All, an organization dedicated to universal access to HIV prevention and medication.

According to the CDC's clinical guidelines, PrEP can be prescribed as part of a preventive health plan to anyone who's sexually active. It's especially recommended for people who don't use condoms consistently, intravenous drug users who share needles, men who have sex with men, and people in relationships with partners living with HIV or whose HIV status is unclear.

The vast majority of PrEP users are men. There are big race, gender, and geographical disparities in the distribution of HIV and the populations taking the prevention medicine. For example, based on the patterns of new infection in the U.S., a group that would benefit from PrEP is cisgender Black women, whose gender identity aligns with their sex assigned at birth.

If your doctors aren't well informed, start by educating yourself. There are also clinical guidelines and information you can share with your provider. Check your state or local health department for a how-to guide for prescribing PrEP. For example, the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute has information for providers.

The CDC also has PrEP guidelines, but many of the agency's websites dealing with LGBTQ+ health are in flux. Under the Trump administration, some HIV/AIDS resources have been taken down from federal websites. Others now have headers saying: ""This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department rejects it.""

Johnson said Hurley's experience with billing mistakes is common. ""The lab expenses in particular end up being very tricky,"" Johnson said.

For example, a doctor's office may mistakenly code the lab work required for PrEP as a diagnostic test instead of preventive care. Patients like Hurley can end up with a bill they shouldn't have to pay. If your doctor's office is making mistakes, share the PrEP billing and coding guide from NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs.

Try to get your lab work done in-network. If the lab is out-of-network, Johnson said, it can be difficult to appeal.

If the bills keep coming, appeal them. And if you can't resolve the dispute, Johnson said, file a complaint with the agency that regulates your insurance plan.

There are different kinds of PrEP. There are lower-cost, generic versions of Truvada, for example, sold as emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, often shortened to FTC/TDF. Newer PrEP drugs Apretude and Yeztugo have list prices in the thousands of dollars. Check your insurance formulary and ask your doctor to prescribe medicine your plan will cover.

With many health care premiums dramatically increasing and millions at risk of losing Medicaid coverage, many people may go without health insurance this year. Drug manufacturers such as Gilead and ViiV have assistance programs for qualifying patients. If you have to pay out-of-pocket, prescription price comparison websites, like GoodRx, can help you find the pharmacies with the cheapest price.

Telehealth is an increasingly popular option if you don't live near an affirming provider or are looking for a more private way to get PrEP. In 2024, roughly 1 in 5 people on PrEP used telemedicine. Online pharmacies like Mistr and Q Care Plus offer PrEP without an in-person appointment, and lab work can be done at home. Some telehealth options have ways to lower the cost if you're uninsured.

Telehealth can also broaden the number of doctors who are ready to prescribe PrEP. And some patients say speaking with a remote provider feels like a safer setting to talk about sexual health. ""They're in the comfort of their own bedroom or living room but can interface virtually with a provider. It can open up a lot of doors for honesty and trust,"" said Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA.

GLMA created the LGBTQ+ Healthcare Directory, a searchable database of health care providers across the nation who identify as queer-friendly. As Hurley discovered, living in a major metro area is no guarantee your doctor is up to date on LGBTQ+ health care.

Ask locals you trust for recommendations. You might be surprised to find good options nearby.

Health Care Helpline helps you navigate the health system hurdles between you and good care. Send us your tricky question and we may tap a policy sleuth to puzzle it out. The crowdsourced project is a joint production of NPR and KFF Health News.

How an ancient Mediterranean resin is reshaping modern understanding of gut lining resilience, immune signaling, and microbiota-driven inflammation.

 Image Credit: rawf8 / Shutterstock.com

Mastiha is a natural resin obtained from the stems and branches of the Pistacia lentiscus tree, particularly the Chios variety. Mastiha has been used throughout the Mediterranean region for over 2,500 years, with historical records from Hippocrates, Dioscorides, and Galen describing its use in managing gastrointestinal complaints such as dyspepsia, gastralgia, and peptic ulcers.

Mastiha is rich in phenolic compounds, phytosterols, and arabinogalactan proteins, with approximately 30% of its composition consisting of the natural polymer poly-β-myrcene. Among these compounds, terpenes are particularly abundant, with monoterpenes like α-pinene, β-pinene, and β-myrcene, as well as triterpenes including mastihadienonic and isomastihadienonic acids.1,2

Rather than acting as a classical fermentable prebiotic fiber, mastiha appears to exert microbiota-modulating effects through selective antimicrobial activity and host–microbe immune signaling, indirectly supporting microbial diversity and gut homeostasis.3,4



Therapeutic potentials of Chios Mastic.4

Preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that mastiha modulates gut microbial composition rather than directly stimulating bacterial proliferation. In a murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model, mastiha supplementation improved hepatic steatosis and fibrosis while enhancing gut microbiota diversity. In human NAFLD trials, mastiha supplementation altered beta-diversity, downregulated pro-inflammatory taxa such as Flavonifractor, and reduced bile acid–related and phospholipid metabolites, suggesting indirect microbiota remodeling.3,4

Mastiha enhances mucosal barrier integrity and reduces gut permeability. In dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, oral mastiha protects against colon injury and attenuates expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, alongside adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1.7,8

Mechanistic studies demonstrate that mastiha triterpenes activate antioxidant defense pathways (including Nrf2-mediated glutathione synthesis) while suppressing NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades. In Sprague-Dawley rats with colitis, oral mastiha resin oil at 400 mg/kg/day decreased the total colitis index, while intrarectal administration significantly reduced TNF-α, with efficacy comparable to that of prednisolone. Across experimental colitis models, mastiha consistently downregulates TNF-α and IL-6, supporting its role as an immunomodulatory adjunct rather than a direct immunosuppressant.5–8

Mastiha exhibits notable antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori. Clinical trials demonstrate partial eradication rates and significant reductions in bacterial load, rather than complete eradication. Broad antibacterial and antifungal activity against Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Candida species further supports its adjunctive role in digestive and oral immune health.4,9

In a randomized controlled trial of adults with functional dyspepsia, 350 mg of mastiha resin three times daily for 21 days significantly improved epigastric pain and dyspeptic symptoms compared with placebo. These benefits are attributed to local antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on the gastric mucosa rather than acid suppression.1,10

Although direct IBS-specific trials are limited, extrapolation from IBD studies suggests benefit in symptoms driven by low-grade inflammation and barrier dysfunction. In a double-blind trial of 60 patients with IBD, 2.8 g/day of mastiha for three months improved IBDQ quality-of-life scores, reduced fecal lysozyme, and lowered oxidative stress biomarkers, without inducing clinical immunosuppression.8,10,11

Smaller clinical studies report that four-week supplementation with 2.2 g/day in patients with active Crohn's disease reduced CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α levels. Symptom improvement occurred in a subset of participants and should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited sample size.12–15

In quiescent IBD, six-month supplementation prevented increases in plasma free amino acids, an early metabolic marker of mucosal stress, without altering remission rates. Additional mechanistic studies demonstrate modulation of miRNA-155–Th17 signaling, preservation of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, and shifts in fecal metabolites linked to epithelial resilience rather than direct disease remission.10–15

Mastiha is available in several forms used across clinical and traditional settings. Chewing gum or whole resin pieces represent the oldest mode of intake. Powdered mastiha and encapsulated resin are most commonly used in clinical trials for dosing consistency.4,16

Clinically studied doses range from ~1 g/day for dyspepsia and H. pylori adjunct therapy to 2.2–2.8 g/day in IBD trials. Higher intakes (≥4 g/day) appear primarily in older or exploratory studies and are not routinely recommended. Trial durations typically range from 2 to 12 weeks, with more extended observational use requiring medical supervision.3,4

Clinical trials consistently report that mastiha is well-tolerated, with adverse events comparable to those observed with placebo. Allergic reactions are rare but possible, particularly in individuals with known sensitivities to Pistacia or Anacardiaceae.

Animal toxicity findings occur at exposures far exceeding human supplemental doses. Long-term safety data in pregnancy, lactation, and pediatric populations remain insufficient; therefore, routine use is not recommended in these groups.4,16

From garlic allicin to broccoli sulforaphane, discover how dietary sulfur compounds switch on the body's core repair systems and shape long-term resilience against aging and disease.

   Image Credit: Ekaterina Bondaretc / Shutterstock.com  

This article discusses the importance of sulfur for various physiological processes, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) signaling, while offering practical ways to maximize allicin and sulforaphane intake for healthy aging.

As the primary source of cysteine for glutathione (GSH), sulfur is an essential element involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and the conjugation of xenobiotics. In proteins, sulfur-containing residues enable catalysis, redox sensing, and structural regulation.

Sulfur-containing amino acids (SAAs) like cysteine and methionine form disulfide bonds and undergo reversible S-glutathionylation, S-nitrosylation, and S-persulfidation that contribute to peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and transcription factor activity, thereby stabilizing the glutathione-to-glutathione disulfide (GSSG) redox couple. SAAs also support protein folding, repair oxidized targets, and rebuild damaged macromolecules, sustaining resilience under oxidative or metal stress.1,2

Garlic, onions, and leeks are alliaceous vegetables rich in organosulfur compounds such as cysteine sulfoxides and their enzymatic breakdown products. Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, kale, and cauliflower contain high levels of glucosinolates, whose concentration varies widely by species, cultivar, tissue, and processing rather than constituting a fixed percentage of total dry weight.3,6

Researchers have identified various organosulfur compounds in fish, chicken, and minced beef. Eggs, pasta, and rice primarily provide sulfur in the form of SAAs. Chicken, beef, and fish exhibit similarly high levels of SAA, with proportions ranging from 74% to 97%.3

Inorganic sulphate can also be found in tap water, with concentrations varying globally. Whereas the Netherlands reports levels below 260 mg/L, higher levels of up to 22 mmol/L have been measured in parts of central Canada.3

H2S functions as a gasotransmitter that supports longevity through its role in mitochondrial respiration, redox signaling, and stress adaptation. By modulating mitochondrial electron transport and preserving thiol redox balance, H2S enhances stress resistance and maintains proteostasis during aging.4

Nrf2 binds antioxidant response elements (AREs) and induces phase II detoxification enzymes, including glutathione S transferases (GSTs), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) hydrogen [NAD(P)H] quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and enzymes for GSH synthesis. This limits oxidative damage, sustains redox homeostasis, and protects long-lived tissues.4

GSH and thioredoxin (Trx) directly neutralize electrophiles and recycle oxidized proteins. Cysteine-rich dietary isothiocyanates also attenuate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and inflammasome activation, thereby lowering chronic inflammation that accelerates biological aging.4,6

Sulfur metabolism stabilizes one-carbon flux and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) availability for DNA and histone methylation. Protein persulfidation further protects catalytic cysteine residues from irreversible oxidation, preserving enzyme function under stress conditions.2

Crushing fresh garlic converts S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (alliin) to allicin through the enzyme alliinase. Allicin is transient and rearranges into organosulfur compounds such as diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, ajoene, and dithiins, with concentrations varying by preparation method, including powders, oils, or aged extracts.7

Cardiovascular evidence suggests that garlic derivatives can reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure, inhibit platelet aggregation, and attenuate early atherogenic processes. Garlic-derived compounds have also been shown to reduce vascular inflammation markers, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), in vivo; however, clinical outcomes remain heterogeneous across trials.5,7

Garlic compounds modulate cytokine profiles, often decreasing tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while increasing interleukin-10 (IL-10). Enhanced activity of natural killer cells and γδ T cells can support mucosal immunity and secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses.5

Allicin and related thiosulfinates exhibit broad antibacterial and antiparasitic actions. In vivo, allicin supports host defense by promoting macrophage activation and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling.5

Brassica vegetables like broccoli, kale, and cabbage are rich in glucosinolates that, upon tissue disruption, convert to sulforaphane from glucoraphanin and indole-3-carbinol from glucobrassicin. Sulforaphane activates Nrf2, inducing detoxification enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1.6

Sulforaphane also inhibits histone deacetylases, promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and suppresses NF-κB signaling. Indole-3-carbinol forms diindolylmethane in the stomach, activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, shifts estrogen metabolism toward 2-hydroxylation, and induces cytochrome P450 1A1.6

In vitro studies report anti-cancer effects of sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol, including suppression of proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis. In rodents, broccoli sprouts or purified isothiocyanates reduce carcinogen-induced tumor burden across multiple tissues and decrease polyp formation in adenomatous polyposis coli multiple intestinal neoplasia (ApcMin) models.

In clinical trials, consumption of broccoli sprout beverages increased urinary excretion of airborne toxin conjugates and supported glutathione S-transferase activity. Higher crucifer intake correlates with reduced risk of colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer, although effect sizes vary by population and genetic background.6

To maximize allicin formation, fresh garlic should be crushed, minced, or grated to allow alliinase activation before heating. Heating intact cloves first inactivates alliinase and prevents allicin generation.

When cooking, lightly crushed garlic should be exposed only to moderate heat for short durations, as prolonged heating beyond approximately 10 minutes reduces bioactivity. Adding garlic toward the end of cooking or off heat helps preserve sulfur compounds. Pre-crushed garlic gently warmed in oil favors ajoene formation, whereas higher temperatures shift products toward allyl sulfides.7

Acidic pickling inhibits alliinase while producing minimal allicin. Aged garlic extract provides stable, water-soluble sulfur compounds such as S-allyl cysteine with favorable bioavailability.7

Preparations that preserve plant enzymes maximize the production of bioactive sulfur metabolites. For crucifers, boiling, frying, blanching, and high-power microwaving reduce glucosinolates, whereas steaming better preserves myrosinase activity.

Allowing endogenous myrosinase to act increases conversion of glucosinolates to isothiocyanates. Raw crucifers or sprouts yield higher sulforaphane exposure than myrosinase-free supplements, although gut microbial β-thioglucosidases can partially compensate for enzyme loss.

Finely chopping allium vegetables activates alliinase, rapidly generating allicin and downstream sulfides. High-temperature processing significantly decreases organosulfur bioavailability, emphasizing the value of low-heat and minimal-water techniques.8

New study reveals that bacteria can survive antibiotic treatment through two fundamentally different ""shutdown modes,"" not just the classic idea of dormancy. The researchers show that some cells enter a regulated, protective growth arrest, a controlled dormant state that shields them from antibiotics, while others survive in a disrupted, dysregulated growth arrest, a malfunctioning state marked by vulnerabilities, especially impaired cell membrane stability. This distinction is important because antibiotic persistence is a major cause of treatment failure and relapsing infections even when bacteria are not genetically resistant, and it has remained scientifically confusing for years, with studies reporting conflicting results. By demonstrating that persistence can come from two distinct biological states, the work helps explain those contradictions and provides a practical path forward: different persister types may require different treatment strategies, making it possible to design more effective therapies that prevent infections from coming back.

Antibiotics are supposed to wipe out harmful bacteria. Yet in many stubborn infections, a small number of bacterial cells manage to survive, only to re-emerge later and cause relapse. This phenomenon, known as antibiotic persistence, is a major driver of treatment failure and one reason infections can be so difficult to fully cure.

For years, persistence has largely been blamed on bacteria that shut down and lie dormant, essentially going into a kind of sleep that protects them from antibiotics designed to target active growth. But new research led by PhD student Adi Rotem under the guidance Prof. Nathalie Balaban from Hebrew University reveals that this explanation tells only part of the story.

The study shows that high survival under antibiotics can originate from two fundamentally different growth-arrest states, and they are not just variations of the same ""sleeping"" behavior. One is a controlled, regulated shutdown, the classic dormancy model. The other is something entirely different: a disrupted, dysregulated arrest, where bacteria survive not by protective calm but by entering a malfunctioning state with distinct vulnerabilities.

""We found that bacteria can survive antibiotics by following two very different paths,"" said Prof. Balaban. ""Recognizing the difference helps resolve years of conflicting results and points to more effective treatment strategies.""

The researchers identified two archetypes of growth arrest that can both lead to persistence, but for very different reasons:1) Regulated growth arrest: A protected dormant stateIn this mode, bacteria intentionally slow down and enter a stable, defended condition. These cells are harder to kill because many antibiotics rely on bacterial growth to be effective.2) Disrupted growth arrest: Survival through breakdownIn the second mode, bacteria enter a dysregulated and disrupted state. This is not a planned shutdown, but a loss of normal cellular control. These bacteria show a broad impairment in membrane homeostasis, a core function needed to maintain the integrity of the cell.That weakness could become a key treatment target.

Antibiotic persistence plays a role in recurring infections across a wide range of settings, from chronic urinary tract infections to infections tied to medical implants. Yet despite intense research, scientists have struggled to agree on a single mechanism explaining why persister cells survive. Different experiments have produced conflicting results about what persisters look like and how they behave.

This study offers an explanation: researchers may have been observing different types of growth-arrested bacteria without recognizing they were distinct.

By separating persistence into two different physiological states, the findings suggest a future where treatments could be tailored, targeting dormant persisters one way, and disrupted persisters another.

The team combined mathematical modeling with several high-resolution experimental tools, including: 

Together, these approaches revealed clear biological signatures distinguishing regulated growth arrest from disrupted growth arrest, along with the specific vulnerabilities of the disrupted state.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Self-sabotage may reflect the brain's need for control and safety","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260104/Self-sabotage-may-reflect-the-braine28099s-need-for-control-and-safety.aspx","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 02:59:00 GMT","

Self-harming and self-sabotaging behaviors, from skin picking to ghosting people, all stem from evolutionary survival mechanisms, according to a compelling new psychological analysis.

Clinical psychologist Dr. Charlie Heriot-Maitland, in his new book Controlled Explosions in Mental Health, explores the biological necessities behind harmful behaviors.

He argues that although these behaviors seem counterintuitive, the brain uses these small harms as a protective dose to prevent further harms. For example, someone may procrastinate starting a project, causing themselves harm, but trying to prevent a higher-stakes harm of failure or rejection.

Our brain is a survival machine. It is programmed not to optimize our happiness and well-being, but to keep us alive. It needs us to exist in a predictable world. It does not like surprises. It does not want us to be caught off guard.""

Dr. Charlie Heriot-Maitland, clinical psychologist

""Being exposed to threats and dangers is bad enough, but the most vulnerable state for us humans is being exposed to unpredictable threat. Our brain cannot allow this, and will intervene to give us more controlled, predictable versions of threat. Our brain would rather we were the arbiter of our own downfall than risk being floored by something external. It would rather we were well-rehearsed in receiving internally-created hostility than risk being unprepared for it from others,"" explains Dr Heriot-Maitland.

This protective mechanism operates on a fundamental principle: the brain would rather deal with the certainty of a controlled, known threat, than cope with the possibility of an out-of-control, unknown threat.

The science behind this theory is based on how the human brain evolved, that is primarily for survival rather than happiness. Brains are hardwired to spot danger everywhere, which helped the species survive. However, it now means we are extra attuned to any potential hurts on the horizon – physical or emotional.

Dr Heriot-Maitland suggests this evolutionary tactic of 'better safe than sorry', signifies that even though we know it might not be sensible to eat a share bag of chocolates, we do it anyway to avoid the bigger shame of failure. Another example is even when someone does not really hate us, we might still avoid them anyway instead of facing the bigger potential rejection.

""Our brains have evolved to favour perceiving threat, even when there isn't one, in order to elicit a protective response in us. We have all inherited a highly sensitive threat-detection and threat-response system,"" he explains.

Common self-sabotaging behaviors include procrastination, perfectionism and pessimism.

Perfectionism operates similarly to procrastination, but through different mechanisms. While procrastination diverts attention away from tasks, perfectionists might show a hyper-focus and attention to detail with the hope of ensuring that errors are not being made. The primary motivation is often to avoid failure, but this puts the perfectionist at risk of stress and burnout.

Self-criticism represents another form of self-sabotage, whether trying to self-improve or self-blame to create a feeling of agency and control – these behaviors all involve a neurological hijacking in which the brain's threat-response system co-opts higher cognitive functions, such as imagination and reasoning.

The threat system utilises these cognitive functions, he explains, which is why when experiencing fear, our imagination can become instantly flooded with fear-related predictive scenarios.

One problem with self-sabotaging behaviors, Dr Heriot-Maitland points out, is that they often become self-fulfilling prophecies.

""If we think we are not very good at something, we may not try our best and then end up performing worse than we would have had we made a different prediction,"" he explains.""Or if we think someone doesn't like us, and we avoid them, then our fear of rejection may have stood in the way of creating a relationship.""

Even if we can acknowledge these behaviors aren't helpful, addressing them requires to first understand their protective function rather than simply trying to eliminate them.

Using the metaphor of self-sabotaging behavior as 'controlled explosions', he explains: ""The bomb squad are not our enemies. They are protecting something big; something hurt; something wounded or painful.

""In many cases, it may be linked to a difficult life experience – a threat, a trauma or a tragedy. The controlled explosions do harm us though – we must not lose sight of that either.""

Effective psychological interventions focus on processing the underlying emotional pain, he says, although acknowledges this is a 'tough choice' and unlikely to be a 'quick fix'.

Dr Heriot-Maitland explains: ""Resolving underlying harm can often involve both of these two aspects: creating safeness around the feared situation and feeling; grieving the loss of having a core need in that situation that was unmet, denied or dismissed.""

Ultimately, the way out of the self-sabotage loop is not through more self-criticism, which compounds the well-worn neural pathways, but through self-compassion, Dr Heriot-Maitland adds.

To utilise the brain's neuroplasticity and learn new, less harmful habits, people must deliberately choose to recognise and understand the behavior first, he argues: ""To instil these compassionate motivations into a process like this is not just 'a given'. It takes time, effort, and intentionality.""

By understanding the evolutionary basis for self-sabotage first, he suggests, this offers the chance to recognises the protective function it served, while addressing the harm it has caused without judgement.

Heriot-Maitland concludes: ""We don't want to fight these behaviors, but nor do we want to appease them and let them carry on controlling, dictating, and sabotaging our lives. There are choices we have here.""

A closer look at how a traditional Adriatic way of eating translates Mediterranean heritage into measurable cardiovascular protection through diet, lifestyle, and long-term adherence.

The Adriatic diet is a regional expression of the Mediterranean dietary pattern practiced in Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, and other regions along the Adriatic coast. Like the Mediterranean diet, the Adriatic diet emphasizes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and olive oil, with regular fish intake, moderate dairy consumption, and limited red and processed meats.1,2

Consuming oily fish two to three times every week provides sufficient omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to lower triglyceride levels and modestly improve blood pressure, while also reducing inflammation. Legumes like beans, chickpeas, and lentils provide low-glycemic protein and fiber, with higher intakes associated with improved lipid profiles and cardiometabolic risk markers. Extra-virgin olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fat and phenolic compounds, particularly hydroxytyrosol, which support endothelial function and reduce oxidative stress.2

Whole grains are high in fiber, which improves cholesterol regulation, inflammation, and weight management. Seasonal wild greens and vegetables provide potassium, dietary nitrates, and flavonoids that support vascular health and satiety. Moderate wine intake with meals reflects traditional practice, although cardioprotective benefits are context-dependent and not required for cardiovascular risk reduction.2,4

The Adriatic diet aligns with the Mediterranean Diet through a plant-forward pattern, emphasizing extra-virgin olive oil as the primary fat, abundant vegetables and cereals, frequent fish, legumes, and a lifestyle that values seasonality, biodiversity, conviviality, and culinary tradition.3

Adriatic meals frequently feature ‘blue' oily fish, such as anchovies, prepared with olive oil and herbs. Regional culinary traditions include wild edible plants and bitter greens prepared with olive oil, reflecting historical food availability and cultural heritage rather than distinct nutritional advantages over other Mediterranean sub-patterns. Premium local virgin olive oils with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) further define flavor profiles and are commonly paired with vegetables, pulses, crudités, and fish.3

High omega-3 intake from non-fried fish reduces triglyceride levels and exerts anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects, contributing to lower cardiovascular risk. Antioxidants abundant in extra-virgin olive oil, herbs, and vegetables, especially phenolics like hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein, reduce oxidative stress markers and post-prandial inflammatory signaling.2

The Mediterranean dietary pattern reduces vascular inflammation, modulates pro-atherogenic gene expression, and decreases platelet aggregation. These cardioprotective effects are associated with reduced incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke in randomized trials.2,4

High fiber intake from whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruits, and vegetables improves metabolic health by lowering LDL cholesterol, improving glycemic responses, promoting satiety, and reducing blood pressure. Fiber also supports gut microbiome diversity, which is associated with lower production of pro-atherogenic metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide.4

Classic cohort studies from Mediterranean regions linked traditional dietary patterns rich in olive oil, fish, legumes, grains, fruits, and vegetables with low cardiovascular mortality despite relatively high total fat intake. Subsequent randomized trials, including the Lyon Diet Heart Study and PREDIMED, demonstrated fewer major cardiovascular events and lower mortality with Mediterranean dietary patterns, supporting both primary and secondary prevention.2,6

A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized pediatric trials reported modest improvements in triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure among children and adolescents following Mediterranean diet interventions.5

In the PREDIMED trial, Mediterranean-style diets enriched with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts were associated with improved blood pressure control and a lower incidence of major cardiovascular events, with a reduction in stroke risk representing the most consistent individual outcome. Olive oil–rich dietary patterns are also associated with improved endothelial function and reduced vascular inflammation, contributing to favorable cardiometabolic risk profiles.2,6

The Adriatic diet is rich in olive oil, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole-grain cereals, and pasta, with regular fish and moderate dairy consumption. Individuals following the Adriatic diet often limit sweets, commercially baked pastries, and fast food. Irregular breakfast patterns and lower breakfast quality have been observed among Adriatic youth and are associated with poorer adherence to the Mediterranean diet.7

An Adriatic-style week typically includes fruit once to twice daily and vegetables daily, fish two to three times weekly, legumes at least once weekly, nuts two to three times weekly, and pasta or rice about five days per week. Higher adherence scores among Croatian coastal youth are associated with regular meals, family eating practices, and higher physical activity levels.7

With an emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and frequent fish consumption, the Adriatic diet reflects a regional Mediterranean pattern associated with improved lipid profiles, lower blood pressure, reduced inflammation, and better vascular function. Evidence from cohort studies and randomized trials of Mediterranean dietary models aligns biomarker improvements with fewer major cardiovascular events, particularly stroke. Distinct regional culinary traditions enhance palatability, cultural continuity, and long-term adherence.

Golden berries (Physalis peruviana) are a nutrient-dense fruit rich in steroidal lactones, polyphenols, and fiber with demonstrated anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects in preclinical models. Evidence from cellular and animal studies indicates modulation of NF-κB signaling, reduced cytokine levels, and improved insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism.

Golden berries (Physalis peruviana) are native to the Andean highlands of Peru and Ecuador, with commercial production in Colombia, South Africa, the United States, and New Zealand. Golden berries are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, C, K1, and E, phytosterols like campesterol, beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol, as well as minerals including potassium and phosphorus, antioxidant polyphenols, and dietary fiber.1

Goldenberry fruit and calyx contain different “signature” bioactives: fruit extracts are notable for steroidal lactones (physalins/physalin derivatives and related withanolides), while calyx extracts are typically richer in phenolic acids and flavonoids. Golden berries concentrate rare steroidal lactones called withanolides and related physalins, which contribute antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative activities. In one compositional and bioactivity study, physalin derivatives and a withanolide were tentatively identified in the fruit extract, while calyx extracts showed antioxidant activity in cell-based models and inhibited nitric oxide production and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) formation in vitro.2

Rather than relying on limited human evidence, current “metabolic” mechanistic support for goldenberry comes primarily from in vitro enzyme/AGE-inhibition assays and animal studies.2 For example, calyx preparations have been evaluated for α-glucosidase inhibition and AGE-formation inhibition in vitro - two targets that are relevant to postprandial glycemia and glycation-associated tissue stress.2

Golden berries elicit anti-inflammatory effects by limiting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation and downstream cytokine production. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophages, golden berry extract reduced nitric oxide, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and PGE2 levels.3

Mechanistically, golden berry extract was reported to reduce NF-κB signaling by preventing IκBα degradation and reducing p65 nuclear translocation in LPS-stimulated macrophages, consistent with lowered production of pro-inflammatory mediators.3

In vivo, dietary supplementation with golden berry extract in a DSS colitis model reduced disease severity, improved colon metrics, and supported tissue restoration. Oxidative stress also declined, as demonstrated by reduced MPO activity, neutrophil infiltration, and ROS levels.3

While observational and intervention studies in humans have linked higher overall fruit intake (as a dietary pattern) to lower levels of common inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP and cytokines, targeted clinical trials that isolate goldenberry-specific effects on these endpoints are still needed.3

In a rat model designed to mimic obesity/insulin-resistance features, goldenberry was incorporated into the diet, and outcomes were assessed at the end of the experiment (post-day 16), including glycemia, lipid profile, organ/adipose weights, and metabolic gene expression. In an obese rat model of metabolic syndrome, a high-fat diet combined with daily golden berry intake reduced fasting blood glucose levels and improved insulin signaling, as demonstrated by higher INSR and PPARγ expression, as well as lower levels of FASN and LPL.4

Liver weight decreased with golden berry supplementation, suggesting lower hepatic fat accumulation, whereas brown adipose tissue mass increased, which is consistent with improved energy expenditure potential. Visceral and subcutaneous fat pads were lighter, with overall weight gain attenuated as compared to control rats consuming a high-fat diet alone.

In addition to glycemia, the same intervention reported improvements in the plasma biochemical profile (including cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL), alongside shifts in metabolic genes linked to insulin signaling/adipogenesis.4

Fresh golden berries are tart-sweet and often consumed as a snack, in fruit salads, salsa for fish or poultry, or as a garnish. Although you can keep the husk on until use, it is advised to remove, rinse, and dry the berry immediately before eating.2,5

Dried golden berries are often incorporated into trail mixes, baked goods, and compotes, or rehydrated for sauces. Drying reduces water activity into the microbial-safe range of 0.23-0.52, thereby improving shelf stability at room temperature when stored in airtight packaging away from light.5

Microwave drying under reduced pressure yields lower water activity, higher polyphenol and carotenoid content, and better antioxidant capacity than conventional hot-air drying. Thus, dried golden berry products made with gentle and rapid dehydration retain more bioactive compounds.2,5

Powdered golden mixes can be incorporated into smoothies, yogurt, oatmeal, and baked goods. Golden berry powders should similarly be stored in moisture-proof, opaque containers and refrigerated or frozen after opening to slow vitamin loss.2,5

Golden berries are routinely processed into jams, juices, syrups, and savory or sweet appetizers. Various food industries manufacture products containing golden berries in their beverages, compotes, and pastry products like pies and cakes.2,3,4

Goldenberry contains multiple classes of potentially functional compounds, particularly steroidal lactones (physalin/withanolide-related compounds), phenolics, carotenoids, vitamin C, and fiber, with preclinical evidence supporting anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects. Golden berries contain numerous bioactive compounds, including withanolides, carotenoids, vitamin C, and fiber, that mitigate inflammation, support glucose control, and improve triglyceride handling. Preclinical models suggest that golden berry intake inhibits NF-κB, reduces cytokine levels and oxidative stress, while conferring improvements in insulin pathways, lipids, and hepatic fat.2 

While promising, rigorous randomized human trials with standardized preparations and doses are needed to confirm efficacy, define safety for long-term intake, and guide evidence-based recommendations for metabolic and inflammatory health.

Globally, RSV causes millions of respiratory infections each year and is responsible for a large proportion of hospitalizations and deaths among children under five years, with the highest risk concentrated in infants under six months. The disease burden is especially pronounced in low- and middle-income regions, where limited access to healthcare and seasonal surges place substantial strain on pediatric services. Although most of severe cases occur in healthy infants, prevention options have traditionally been restricted to high-risk groups. Recent advances in maternal vaccines and long-acting monoclonal antibodies have broadened the scope of RSV prevention, but questions remain regarding optimal timing, safety, duration of protection, and real-world implementation. Based on these challenges, there is a clear need for comprehensive research into integrated RSV immunoprevention strategies.

In November 2025, the Mexican Association of Pediatrics, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary national panel comprising pediatricians, neonatologists, infectious disease specialists, and obstetric experts, published (DOI: 10.1007/s12519-025-00997-1) a comprehensive position statement in World Journal of Pediatrics. The document synthesizes clinical trials, real-world effectiveness studies, and international policy experience to evaluate maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy and passive immunization of infants using long-acting monoclonal antibodies. By systematically addressing efficacy, safety, optimal timing, and implementation challenges, the statement provides evidence-based guidance aimed at reducing severe RSV disease and hospitalization in infants across Latin America.

The consensus systematically reviewed evidence from randomized clinical trials, observational studies, and real-world program data to assess two principal RSV prevention strategies. First, maternal immunization with a prefusion F protein RSV vaccine demonstrated high efficacy in preventing severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract infections in infants during the first six months of life. Clinical trials reported protection exceeding 80% during the first three months, with sustained benefit up to six months, supported by efficient transplacental antibody transfer in late pregnancy. Large real-world studies further confirmed substantial reductions in infant hospitalizations and severe disease.

Second, the long-acting monoclonal antibody nirsevimab provided direct passive immunity to infants, achieving 75%-85% effectiveness against RSV hospitalizations across diverse populations, including healthy term and preterm infants. Evidence indicated that a single dose was sufficient to cover an entire RSV season, with favorable safety profiles and significant reductions in intensive care admissions.

Importantly, the analysis clarified that routine coadministration of maternal vaccination and monoclonal antibodies is generally unnecessary, except in specific circumstances where antibody transfer may be compromised. Together, these findings support flexible, evidence-based prevention pathways that can be adapted to local epidemiology, healthcare capacity, and economic considerations.

According to the expert panel, RSV prevention has entered a transformative phase. ""For the first time, we have robust tools capable of protecting infants during their most vulnerable months,"" the authors note. They emphasize that both maternal vaccination and long-acting monoclonal antibodies demonstrate strong benefit-risk profiles when used appropriately. The experts highlight that aligning immunization timing with biological mechanisms of antibody transfer is critical, and that prevention strategies must remain adaptable to national healthcare realities to achieve maximum public health impact.

These findings have significant implications for both public health policy and clinical practice. The implementing maternal RSV vaccination or infant monoclonal antibody programs can markedly reduce hospital admissions, healthcare costs, and infant mortality associated with RSV. The evidence supports prioritizing prevention in the first six months of life, when disease severity is greatest. In middle-income regions, maternal vaccination may offer a particularly feasible and cost-effective approach, while monoclonal antibodies provide an essential alternative for infants who miss prenatal protection. Together, these strategies offer a scalable pathway toward reducing the global burden of RSV and strengthening early-life respiratory health.

Removing part or all of the breast during breast cancer treatment is a potential outcome for some people. Reconstructive surgical procedures often involve prosthetic implants or transplanted tissue from elsewhere in the body. So, researchers reporting in ACS Applied Bio Materials developed a prototype injectable paste derived from human skin cells that could help restore breast volume after tumor removal, with less scarring and shorter healing time than current options.

By promoting blood vessel growth and tissue remodeling while keeping inflammation low and reducing capsular contracture, the injectable acellular matrix could make breast reconstruction safer, less invasive and more accessible, thereby improving long-term comfort and cosmetic outcomes for patients.""

Pham Ngoc Chien, one of the study's lead researchers

During breast cancer treatment, cancerous cells and damaged tissue are often taken out, sometimes resulting in complete removal of the breast. For those who want to keep their breast volume, physicians turn to breast-conserving surgical techniques, where the remaining tissue is rearranged to account for space left by the tumor removal. Sometimes, skin and fat are even donated from other parts of the body to fill in the gaps left behind, like a skin graft. Though this technique preserves the shape of the breast for the patient, it leaves a scar where the tissue was donated from.

An alternative strategy involves acellular dermal matrix (ADM) - skin that has been processed to remove the outermost layer. This leaves a material with important cellular components for healing, including collagen, elastin and growth factors. Currently, ADM is available primarily in sheet form for tendon repair or plastic surgery, but Chien, Chan-Yeong Heo and colleagues wanted to create an injectable form of ADM that would be suitable for space-filling reconstructive breast surgery.

The researchers took a sample of skin donated by a living female participant and processed it through a series of steps including decellularizing, freezing and pulverizing to form small ADM particles. Then they added water to the particles to form a thick paste. The team injected small amounts of this paste into rats to test its biocompatibility and compared it to two commercially available ADM products. After a six-month period, the rats presented no adverse health effects. In fact, the animals treated with the new ADM paste had thinner layers of tissue form around the injected material than the rats treated with the commercially available product. Thinner tissue layers are preferable in breast implant procedures because they're less likely to cause complications such as infections or hematomas.

Longer-term safety trials and more complex tests are necessary before this material could be considered for clinical use. But the researchers say that this work highlights the potential of their ADM implant to improve breast reconstruction surgery.

For the first time, scientists have reconstructed ancient genomes of Human betaherpesvirus 6A and 6B (HHV-6A/B) from archaeological human remains more than two millennia old. The study, led by the University of Vienna and University of Tartu (Estonia) and published in Science Advances, confirms that these viruses have been evolving with and within humans since at least the Iron Age. The findings trace the long history of HHV-6 integration into human chromosomes and suggest that HHV-6A lost this ability early on.

HHV-6B infects about 90 percent of children by the age of two and is best known as the cause of roseola infantum – or ""sixth disease"" – the leading cause of febrile seizures in young children. Together with its close relative HHV-6A, it belongs to a group of widespread human herpesviruses that typically establish lifelong, latent infections after an initial mild illness in early childhood. What makes them exceptional is their ability to integrate into human chromosomes – a feature that allows the virus to remain dormant and, in rare cases, to be inherited as part of the host's own genome. Such inherited viral copies occur in roughly one percent of people today. While earlier studies had hypothesized that these integrations were ancient, the new data from this study provide the first direct genomic proof.

An international research team led by the University of Vienna and the University of Tartu (Estonia) – in collaboration with the University of Cambridge and University College London – screened nearly 4,000 human skeletal samples from archaeological sites across Europe. Eleven ancient viral genomes were identified and reconstructed – the oldest from a young girl of the Iron Age Italy (1100–600 BCE). The remaining individuals covered a wide geographic and temporal range: Both types of HHV were found in medieval England, Belgium and Estonia, while HHV-6B also appeared in samples from Italy and early historic Russia. Several of the English individuals carried inherited forms of HHV-6B, making them the earliest known carriers of chromosomally integrated human herpesviruses. The Belgian site of Sint-Truiden yielded the largest number of cases, with both viral species circulating within the same population. 

While HHV-6 infects almost 90% of the human population at some point in their life, only around 1% carry the virus, which was inherited from your parents, in all cells of their body. These 1% of cases are what we are most likely to identify using ancient DNA, making the search for viral sequences quite difficult. Based on our data, the viruses' evolution can now be traced over more than 2,500 years across Europe, using genomes from the 8th-6th century BCE until today.""

Meriam Guellil, lead researcher of the study, Department of Evolutionary Anthropology, University of Vienna

The recovered genomes allowed the researchers to determine where in the chromosomes the viruses had integrated. Comparisons with modern data revealed that some integrations happened a very long time ago and passed down through generations for millennia. One of the two viral species (HHV-6A) appears to have lost its ability to integrate into human DNA over time – evidence that these viruses have evolved differently while coexisting with their human hosts. 

""Carrying a copy of HHV6B in your genome has been linked to angina–heart-disease"", says Charlotte Houldcroft (Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge). ""We know that these inherited forms of HHV6A and B are more common in the UK today compared to the rest of Europe, and this is the first evidence of ancient carriers from Britain.""

The discovery of these ancient HHV-6 genomes provides the first time-stamped evidence for the long-term co-evolution of this virus with humans at the genomic level. It also shows how ancient DNA can reveal the long-term evolution of infectious diseases – from short-lived childhood infections to viral sequences that became part of the human genome. Discovered only in the 1980s, HHV-6A and HHV-6B can now be traced back to the Iron Age, offering direct genomic evidence for an ancient, shared history between viruses and humans. ""Modern genetic data suggested that HHV-6 may have been evolving with humans since our migration out of Africa,"" says Guellil. ""These ancient genomes now provide first concrete proof of their presence in the deep human past.""

The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology has launched a randomized phase III clinical trial called RECIPROCAL (Alliance A032304) to explore whether doctors can optimize the timing of targeted radiation therapy to minimize side effects while preserving efficacy in men with advanced prostate cancer.

Our goal in this trial is to strategically improve both survival and quality of life for men living with advanced prostate cancer. We hope to prove we can safely adjust the therapy based on an individual's cancer instead of sticking to a rigid schedule, thus maintaining the effectiveness of targeted radiation therapy while reducing side effects.""

Thomas Hope, MD, Alliance study chair, nuclear medicine physician and Professor in Residence, University of California, San Francisco

The current standard of care for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer includes Lutetium-177 Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) targeted Radioligand Therapy (RLT), a targeted radiation therapy attached to a drug molecule and injected into the bloodstream. Once in the body, PSMA RLT binds to cancer cells, killing them cells while minimizing harm to healthy tissue.

While PSMA RLT improves survival, it can cause side effects, such dry mouth, fatigue and gastrointestinal issues. Serious side effects can include blood disorders, kidney damage or liver problems.

In the trial, clinicians will enroll about 1,500 participants. All participants will start by receiving two infusions of PSMA RLT every six weeks. During this time, if a patient's prostate specific antigen (PSA) level falls, they will be randomized into one of two groups:

Standard arm

Adaptive arm

Follow‑up schedule

Our goal with RECIPROCAL is to show that treatment can be smarter, not just stronger. By tailoring therapy to each patient's PSA response, we aim to reduce unnecessary toxicity and diminish side effects while still delivering the same survival benefit. Ultimately, we want men with advanced prostate cancer to not only live longer, but to also feel better during their treatment.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Weaker and fragmented circadian rhythms linked to higher dementia risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260104/Weaker-and-fragmented-circadian-rhythms-linked-to-higher-dementia-risk.aspx","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 02:39:00 GMT","

Circadian rhythms that are weaker and more fragmented are linked to an increased risk of dementia, according to a new study published on December 29, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study also found that circadian rhythm levels that peaked later in the day, rather than earlier, were also linked to an increased risk. The study does not prove that these factors cause dementia, it only shows an association.

Circadian rhythm is the body's internal clock. It regulates the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle and other body processes like hormones, digestion and body temperature. It is guided by the brain and influenced by light exposure.

With a strong circadian rhythm, the body clock aligns well with the 24-hour day, sending clear signals for body functions. People with a strong circadian rhythm tend to follow their regular times for sleeping and activity, even with schedule or season changes. With a weak circadian rhythm, light and schedule changes are more likely to disrupt the body clock. People with weaker rhythms are more likely to shift their sleep and activity times with the seasons or schedule changes.

Changes in circadian rhythms happen with aging, and evidence suggests that circadian rhythm disturbances may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. Our study measured these rest-activity rhythms and found people with weaker and more fragmented rhythms, and people with activity levels that peaked later in the day, had an elevated risk of dementia.""

Wendy Wang, MPH, PhD, study author, Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas

The study involved 2,183 people with an average age of 79 who did not have dementia at the start of the study. Of participants, 24% were Black people and 76% were white people.

Participants wore small heart monitors that adhere to the chest to measure rest and activity for an average of 12 days. Researchers used data from the monitors to track the strength and patterns of people's circadian rhythms. Participants were then followed for an average of three years and during that time 176 people were diagnosed with dementia.

Researchers reviewed heart monitor data for various measures to determine circadian rhythm strength. These measures included relative amplitude, which is a measure of the difference between a person's most active and least active periods. High relative amplitude signified stronger circadian rhythms.

Researchers divided participants into three groups, comparing the high group to the low group. A total of 31 of 728 people in the high group developed dementia, compared to 106 of the 727 people in the low group. After adjusting for factors such as age, blood pressure and heart disease, researchers found when compared to people in the high group, those in the low, weaker rhythm group had nearly 2.5 times the risk of dementia, with a 54% increased risk of dementia for every standard deviation decrease in relative amplitude.

Researchers also found people who experienced a peak of activity later in the afternoon, 2:15 p.m. or later, compared to earlier in the afternoon, 1:11 p.m.-2:14 p.m., had a 45% increased risk of dementia. Seven percent of those in the early group developed dementia, compared to 10% of those in the high group.

Having a later peak of activity means there could be a difference between the body clock and environmental cues such as later hours and darkness.

""Disruptions in circadian rhythms may alter body processes like inflammation, and may interfere with sleep, possibly increasing amyloid plaques linked to dementia, or reducing amyloid clearance from the brain,"" said Wang. ""Future studies should examine the potential role of circadian rhythm interventions, such as light therapy or lifestyle changes, to determine if they may help lower a person's risk of dementia.""

A limitation of the study was that researchers did not have information on sleep disorders, like sleep apnea, which could affect the results.

Brenden Aaronson scoring against Manchester United and Weston McKennie celebrating his goal against Lecce Getty Images

Weston McKennie continues to let his football do the talking as he waits for a new deal from Juventus, teenager Cole Campbell seeks first-team football in Germany with a loan move, and Brenden Aaronson proves his worth to Leeds United in a huge derby match.

It was quite the weekend for a selection of American players in Europe. Welcome to this week's USMNT Player Tracker.

Weston McKennie has missed more games than he has played for the United States men's national team under Mauricio Pochettino.

His absences have been due to injury or his coach resting him to try lesser-known options. Pochettino rates him and made that clear when he left the 27-year-old out of his November roster for friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay.

But while the U.S. have other promising midfield players, including Aidan Morris, Sebastian Berhalter, Diego Luna and Malik Tillman, Pochettino can be confident that, in McKennie, he has an ace to play.

World Cup squads need the right mix of experience and youth, and McKennie has the pedigree and reassuring consistency at the highest level with Juventus, one of Europe's biggest clubs.

McKennie was at it again on Saturday, scoring his first Serie A goal of the season in Juventus' 1-1 draw with Lecce, and excelling, as usual, in a different position. It's the type of tactical flexibility that will be a bonus to Pochettino for the summer.

Instead of playing wing-back in a 3-5-2 — where he has played often under Juve manager Luciano Spalletti and his predecessor Igor Tudor — McKennie was deployed in an advanced midfield role.

To top off his performance, he was in the right place at the right time to ensure the hosts came from behind to secure a point. And it could have been all three for the home side, but McKennie's Canadian team-mate, Jonathan David, had a penalty saved.



After the match, McKennie spoke of the positional switch. “For me, it's not a new position. I'm at the manager's and the team's disposal, and I try to give 100 per cent in every role,” the Texan said via Il Bianconero.

“I like playing as a trequartista (attacking midfielder) because you can both defend and attack.”

Cole Campbell's potential has been discussed for some time at Borussia Dortmund, where he has been on the bench for the Bundesliga side five times this term. But the 19-year-old has played only 16 minutes, and has now gone on loan to fifth-placed Hoffenheim to chase more game time.

On Sunday, he left Dortmund's winter training camp in Marbella, Spain, to complete the move until the end of the season. Hoffenheim are believed to have agreed an option to make the deal permanent in the summer for around €10million-€12million (about £9.5m; $13m).

“Cole is a young player with a lot of potential, but for various reasons he has not been able to show that recently,” Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl told the club's official website.

“He has high expectations of himself and was unhappy with his current role. That is one of the reasons we agreed to this loan and believe that he will get more playing time at Hoffenheim in the second half of the season than he has recently had with us. We wish him every success.”

The Athletic's German football correspondent Seb Stafford-Bloor believes it could be a good move. “Hoffenheim are having a dramatic turnaround, based on excellent, low-cost recruitment and a team that have become one of the most athletically dominant in the Bundesliga this season,” he said.

“They're top, or otherwise second, in every meaningful running category. That's what Cole Campbell is joining.”

Brenden Aaronson continues to prove his own worth in the Premier League.

Last week, he got a vital assist for resurgent Leeds United in a 1-1 draw with Sunderland. Yesterday, he went one better with a wonderful goal to give his side the lead against Manchester United at Elland Road. Daniel Farke's side had to settle for a draw in the end, but it pulled them eight points away from the relegation place.

“It is tough because you are fighting the whole game to get good chances,” Aaronson told the club website media after the match, “Man United have great players and they are tough to break down. So, you get the chance to score, but then it is about trying to keep the lead.”

The 25-year-old said he relied on instinct in the lead-up to his second goal of the Premier League campaign. “When I see Dom (Calvert-Lewin) going up for headers, I try to run off him,” Aaronson added. “I was just running in behind to see if I could get lucky.

“Sometimes you have to take a chance. The ball came to me. I think that the centre-back didn't know that I was going to be running off his shoulder like that. It was a good touch. And then it is just about putting it on target.”

In France, Folarin Balogun's assist for Monaco failed to make much difference as Tanner Tessmann's Lyon ran out 3-1 winners. Balogun was bundled over in the break that produced Mamadou Coulibaly's strike, but his contribution counts as an assist.

Unfortunately for the hosts, that goal to make it 1-1 was as good as it got.

Tessmann, meanwhile, came on as a 66th-minute substitute, while rumours in Italy suggest that Fiorentina are keen to bring the former Venezia man back to Serie A during the January transfer window.

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Prep

Entering 2026, the U.S. men's national team is trending upward. After months of apathy and doubt, optimism is suddenly abundant. But that does not mean the USMNT is anything close to a finished product. With a home World Cup six months away, its roster and its starting 11 are far from settled.

Some of the biggest USMNT stories of early 2026, therefore, will be battles that play out remotely. The national team will gather only once between now and the naming of a World Cup roster in late May. Players, whether in MLS or abroad, will have to prove their worth at their clubs.

Some, surely, have already done that. Christian Pulisic, for example, leads the Italian Serie A in goals plus assists per 90 minutes (and across all of Europe's Big Five leagues, he's second to only Harry Kane). He will start for the U.S. on June 12 against Paraguay, if healthy.

But other spots — in the 11, in head coach Mauricio Pochettino's rotation, and on the 26-man roster — are up for grabs. Questions remain unanswered. Who will start in midfield? Who will play right back, or right center back and wingback? Is there room on the roster, or even on the field, for Gio Reyna? And what about the strikers behind Folarin Balogun?

The following is a breakdown of those questions and others, and the key personnel dilemmas that remain unsolved as the World Cup nears.

The evolution of the national team over the past seven months had an enormous impact on what the position battles look like across the field, and it has reshaped how we think about the U.S. midfield entirely.

After operating through most of the last cycle and the first half of this cycle in a 4-3-3, the U.S. now plays in a hybrid 3-4-2-1/4-4-2 setup. That tweak means the U.S. will likely start with two attacking midfielders on the field along with two central midfielders. And the group of players being considered for those four spots grew after the Gold Cup and fall friendlies.

Pochettino is thus weighing two elements to the midfield: what's the best pairing for midfielders in front of a back line that, when the U.S. has the ball, plays out of a back three; and who are the two best attacking midfielders to complement the wingback/wingers and No. 9.

Let's tackle the deeper-lying position battle first.

Tyler Adams feels like a natural starter as one of those two players, but while Adams was often seen as the No. 6 in the U.S.'s 4-3-3, with Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah playing in front of him, there is a real argument to be made that allowing Adams to roam and attack in midfield is the better use of his skill set. Thus, Pochettino could be looking at players such as Tanner Tessmann, Cristian Roldan, Aidan Morris, and Johnny Cardoso as fighting it out at the No. 6.

Adams, then, holds down the top spot on the depth chart in that box-to-box role, but Pochettino has also coaxed fantastic performances out of players such as Sebastian Berhalter, McKennie, Tessmann — and even Timmy Tillman — in that role.

McKennie is maybe the personification of how the math in midfield has changed. Whereas he was always seen as a natural midfield partner for Adams, tucked in behind Pulisic in a 4-2-3-1, or as a more advanced central midfielder in the 4-3-3, he now might be a better fit as one of the dual No. 10s in the 3-4-2-1 formation rather than playing behind the attacking line. Or even as a substitute for Adams in the box-to-box role.

And then, of course, there's the question of Adams' health. The Bournemouth midfielder left a 4-4 draw against Manchester United on Dec. 15 with a torn MCL and will miss up to three months. That would put Adams back on the field in March, so he should have time to recover ahead of the World Cup, but his injury is a reminder that the math in midfield can swing dramatically based on the health of any one player.

Our current depth chart for the two central midfield roles:

The question about the two attacking midfield roles has to begin with Gio Reyna's health, form and availability.

Reyna, 23, was once considered the best American prospect ever. His early seasons at Dortmund made him look like the natural follow-up to Pulisic, but the last four seasons have been marred by injury. Reyna totaled just 2,925 minutes across all competitions with his club team since 2021-22 — an average of 731.25 per season. There are real concerns about whether he can stay healthy for a full season and also get back to his previous levels of production.

There is a glimmer of hope. Reyna started four consecutive games for Borussia Monchengladbach in December, the first time he's completed that feat at club level since August 2021. His 372 minutes in the Bundesliga this year surpass his output for all of last season with Dortmund. Reyna has yet to score or assist for Gladbach, but he did pick up a goal and assist in his return with the U.S. in November.

That adds intrigue to the battle in attacking midfield.

Pulisic is a locked-in starter for the U.S. The Milan man is turning in yet another fantastic season in Italy. Pulisic has eight goals and two assists in 12 league games for Milan this season, two goals behind Lautaro Martínez for the Serie A lead.

That makes for a three-way battle at the other spot. In the mix: Malik Tillman, one of the U.S.'s standouts in 2025; McKennie, who has been sharp for Juventus this year, with two Champions League goals; Reyna; Diego Luna, a Pochettino favorite; and Tim Weah, who is an option as a right back/right wingback/winger, but can also play inside.

How many midfielders will Pochettino bring to the World Cup? That could be impacted by the versatility of players elsewhere and the fact that the flexibility of the lineup puts an emphasis on players who can help in multiple spots.

The current depth chart:

What even is a right back in this current system? It depends on who you ask and when you ask.

It is notable, however, that Sergiño Dest started alongside Alex Freeman in the 5-1 win over Uruguay, and while Freeman sometimes looked like a third center back, he was actually considered the right back while Dest was a winger.

That sums up the possibilities for Pochettino at the World Cup. In a system in which the U.S. builds out with three but often defends in a four, the outside backs have become sort of hybrid wingers/wingbacks/fullbacks, depending on the size and balance of the team.

Over the past few months, that means Max Arfsten has played as a left back/left wingback, while the right back — whether it was Dest, Tim Weah or Freeman — has been more of a winger than a defender.

Will that look the same when and if Antonee Robinson is back healthy and in the U.S. lineup again? Or will he be asked to push higher up the field? That's something we might learn in March. But the battle of the right backs has become an interesting study in the different ways the U.S. can beat you. Freeman's ability to play as a hybrid third center back/right back is especially intriguing because it adds another attacking element for the U.S.

Pochettino might opt to start three center backs in the back line, as he has before with Chris Richards, Tim Ream and Miles Robinson or Mark McKenzie. He might opt instead to start a right back in that spot, as he has with Joe Scally and Freeman. If he opts for the latter, it gives the U.S. some different looks to unbalance the opponent.

Here's how we think things stand right now in the pecking order:

Goalkeeper has been a position of uncertainty ever since Matt Turner's club minutes vanished in Europe. Freese got an opportunity in June, won the job, and has played every single minute of every match since. So, is the competition closed? Or could Turner win back his place if he re-finds his 2022 form in MLS this spring?

He still has more upside than Freese. He also has World Cup experience. The only scenario where the goalkeeper position isn't viewed as something of a weakness for the USMNT in June is the one where Turner, now back with the New England Revolution, becomes the shot-stopping machine he was a few years back.

Freese, though, has proven himself to Pochettino. And like Turner, he's sharp and well-liked by teammates. He's clearly the frontrunner for the No. 1 shirt, but U.S. coaches will surely be watching both Matts (and other goalkeepers) once the MLS season begins in February.

Balogun has almost cemented himself as the USMNT's starting striker, but beyond him, the depth chart remains in flux. Haji Wright has performed well for both Coventry City and the national team. Ricardo Pepi was performing well a year ago before his knee injury, and he has recaptured that goalscoring form with goals in four straight Eredivisie games and in three of his last four Champions League appearances (all off the bench).

Meanwhile, Patrick Agyemang (six goals in his debut season at Derby County in the EFL Championship) endeared himself to Pochettino at this summer's Gold Cup and brings a physical presence that this striker group would otherwise lack. And yes, although Josh Sargent has likely fallen off the roster bubble, he — or another forward — could always play his way back into the mix.

The question for Pochettino, then, is twofold:

The answers, as always with strikers, depend on form. Pepi feels like the biggest wild card. Agyemang is probably on the outside looking in, but could fill a unique role — if he continues playing well enough for Derby County. Plenty remains up in the air.","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

2026 is here and so too is the World Cup year, making the next few months all more important for American players across the globe. 

While several leagues, including the American-heavy Bundesliga and Eredivisie, have yet to resume from their winter breaks, others are already in full stride in the new year, with some U.S. men's national team players already having played two games since the calendar flipped. 

It was a memorable weekend in Europe for American players, with important goals, milestone-moments and defensive masterclasses taking center stage. Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the top four performances of the week from Mauricio Pochettino's players across the globe.

West Bromwich Albion's George Campbell is putting himself in contention for a USMNT role at some point in 2026, even if it may not be for the 2026 World Cup. Unfortunately for the American center back, he is impressing in an area of depth. None of that, however, takes away from his impressive week, which saw him score off a set piece in a 2–1 midweek win over QPR and play a full 90 minutes in a 1–0 loss to Swansea City. The match against Swansea saw him shift to an unusual right back position, but he continued to deliver, getting more involved in the attack with a pair of shots and three passes into the final third. The 24-year-old is in a spell of good form. Could it be enough to attract Mauricio Pochettino's eye in the lead up to the World Cup? 

Antonee Robinson continued to play heavy minutes for Fulham on the weekend, going the full 90 in a blockbuster 2–2 draw with Liverpool, which featured a goal for either side in second-half stoppage time. The 28-year-old continues to show his tenacity in getting involved in the attack, a good sign for the back three or back five the USMNT is likely to play. Robinson had two passes into the final third, created a chance and chipped in with six defensive contributions, often matched up against  Dominik Szoboszlai down the wing. The match was the sixth straight game that saw him play all 90 minutes, after only having a single previous substitute appearance in his return to Premier League action on Sept. 28.

Brenden Aaronson is playing some of the best soccer of his career right now for Leeds United and brought his goal tally on the season to three with a strike in a 1–1 draw with Manchester United on Sunday. The goal marked his third goal contribution in the last six matches, after picking up an assist on a stellar team goal against Sunderland and his first helper of the productive run in a 3–3 draw with Liverpool on Dec. 6.On Sunday, he bolted up the pitch before sprinting between Ayden Heaven and Leny Yoro and finishing his shot past Senne Lemmens between the sticks. “I was kind of just running in behind to see if I could get lucky and sometimes you have to take a chance,” Aaronson said postgame. “The ball came to me. I think that the center back didn't know that I was going to be running off his shoulder like that. I had a good touch, and then it's just about putting the shot on target.”While he has nine goals in 56 USMNT caps and has not played consistently at the international level as of late, Aaronson is nearing a spot on the World Cup roster and a potential starting role if he keeps up his current form.

Weston McKennie is proving an invaluable piece for Juventus and started 2026 on the best personal note possible, with his first Serie A goal of the season in a 1–1 draw with Lecce on Saturday. Making his 205th appearance for the club, the 27-year-old took on a more attacking role than usual, playing in his eighth position this season under manager Luciano Spalletti's versatile demands.While the Bianconeri will rue a missed penalty from Jonathan David, McKennie's performance was promising. In addition to his goal, he created three chances and had two shots. Riding a wave of form with five goal contributions across his last nine games in all competitions, McKennie will look to lead fourth-place Juventus to a win in their next match against 10th-place Sassuolo on Tuesday.

Arsenal will compete in the first-ever Women's Champions Cup in January.

The new six-team competition was announced by Fifa in March, along with the introduction of a 16-team Women's Club World Cup.

Fifa are introducing the global competition in an attempt to help clubs maximise commercial opportunities.

The Women's Champions Cup will run annually, except in years involving the Women's Club World Cup - another new Fifa competition that will take place every four years and be held for the first time in 2028.

When the Champions Cup was first announced, Fifa president Gianni Infantino said: ""Women's football has reached new heights at national team level and now it's time for global competitions that showcase the best clubs from around the world.""

The official Women's Champions Cup ball

The Women's Champions Cup will bring together the champions of the different continental competitions, similar to the old format of the men's Club World Cup.

The six continental confederations are:

Uefa (Europe)

Caf (Africa)

AFC (Asia)

Concacaf (North America, Central America and Caribbean)

Conmebol (South America)

OFC (Oceania)

The next two editions of the Champions Cup will happen in 2027 and 2029, with the Club World Cup starting in between.

Seedings for the second year of the Champions Cup will be based on performance in the 2026 edition.

Arsenal will be Europe's representatives in the tournament after they won the Women's Champions League last season.

The winner of round two - Morocco's AS FAR - will be the Gunners' opponents in January's semi-finals.

The other semi-final will be contested between Brazilian side Corinthians - the Copa Libertadores champions - and New York-based Gotham FC, who won the inaugural Concacaf W Champions Cup in May.

Auckland Utd FC and Wuhan Jiangda WFC have already been knocked out of the competition.

Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium, which holds around 17,000 fans, will host the two semi-finals on Wednesday, 28 January. The first sees Gotham FC play Corinthians (12:30 GMT) followed by Arsenal v AS FAR (18:00).

The final (18:00) and third-place play-off (14:45) will be played at the 60,704-capacity Emirates Stadium - Arsenal's home ground for their WSL matches - on Sunday, 1 February.

			Fans heading to the Fifa World Cup can expect more than just a game, as I discovered at an Inter Miami match last month

Thinking about heading to the Fifa World Cup this year? The fact that the tournament takes place across three countries – United States, Canada and Mexico – should make it a bucket list experience for football fans. Unfortunately, the ticket prices reflect that reality: with even the cheapest tickets priced at multiples of the last tournament, and final tickets going for over $3,000.

As someone who has been to several “soccer” games on the other side of the pond, I wasn't that surprised by the prices. When I attended an Inter Miami game earlier this month, the cheapest seats were north of £200, with the better seats going for well into the four figures.

Though the higher prices might not be the only surprise awaiting British fans heading over the pond. Here are a few other things to be aware of.

We all know Americans don't do things by halves – and football matches are no exception. If you are going to a game in the States, you can expect a lot more pageantry that you might get in Europe. The whole focus is on making the entire thing into an afternoon or evening-long spectacle.

Don't worry: it isn't a total abomination. There are no cheerleaders or rodeo cowboys during the half-time break. But you can expect lots of snazzy video packages on the big screen, deafening pyrotechnic displays just before kick off, and even those “fan cams” they have at baseball games. Though don't expect the old school “kiss cam”: these days it's been retired due to PC sensibilities.

There's also a healthy dose of patriotism with the national anthem played before all games. Attendees are expected to stand up and remove their hats, though singing along is optional.

There is one thing you can always say about watching sport in America: you're unlikely to go hungry. Visit most stadiums and you will find a veritable smorgasbord of different food concessions, either on the inner perimeter of the stadium or just outside.

Tacos, fried chicken, pizza, poke bowls – you name it. And often from recognised brands and award-winning street food vans, rather than in-house stadium slop. Honestly, the sheer variety on offer makes the typical British stadium hospitality – pies and nachos – feel like something from the Soviet Union.

You can booze too, including during the action. Walk around the stadium and you'll find dozens of enthusiastic vendors hawking beers from their ice-filled cool boxes. One word of warning though: it's common for them to only sell the massive 700ml cans of US beer. Given the hot weather, I've never managed to finish one without the last bit going warm.

Oh and you'll also pay hefty prices for the privilege of all that hospitality. When I last watched Inter Miami play, I paid around £20 for a single beer (including tip) and £30 for a burrito before the game.

If you find the prices a little steep, why not try “tailgating” – the American practice of firing up impromptu BBQs and knocking back a few beers in the parking lot before the game. The tradition began with American football but has been carried over to the beautiful game as well. And provided it stays within the stadium car park (or parking lot), it's all legal.

Be careful about wandering out of the designated area carrying a drink, though, as there's every chance you could be fined under the ubiquitous “open container” laws.

There's a persistent stereotype that US football fans are a bit clueless and passionless. In my experience, that's far from true. If anything, American soccer fans are often totally obsessed, and their knowledge of the Premier League can be impressive.

It's definitely true that games are much more family-friendly than you might find in Europe. You'll see lots of families with young children. But every MLS team also has its share of hardcore partisan fans too. In general, they tend to sit in one particular terrace, where they can make as much noise as they like.

In those areas there's a carnival atmosphere: expect big drums and trumpets, coloured smoke bombs, and lots of coordinated chanting. The vibe is very rarely aggressive, but I have seen witless opposition fans being shoved out of the enclosure after wandering in out of curiosity.

In all my time in the US, I've never got my head around this one. MLS games routinely kick off several minutes after their advertised starting time. And for no particular reason: the stadiums are usually full before the scheduled time rolls around.

Maybe that will change with the World Cup, which presumably has strict rules about these things due to the broadcast deals. Then again, given the ongoing bromance between Donald Trump and Gianni Infantino, who knows who will be calling the shots.

This one is hardly exclusive to America, but it bears repeating anyway. When 25,000 football fans leave the stadium at once, the vast majority of them travelling by car, all those eight-lane freeways count for nothing: even the most sprawling US city can be brought to an instant standstill.

I've experienced this a few times. In pint-sized Cincinnati, I was lucky to be able to walk back to my hotel, feeling slightly smug as I walked past all the stationary vehicles. By contrast, in soccer-mad Miami, I ended up enduring one of the slowest, and most expensive, Uber rides of my life, as it took more than an hour to crawl a few miles.

First Minister John Swinney made the announcement during his New Year election pitch to voters in Glasgow on Monday morning.


          Scotland reporter
              @Jenster13


Monday 5 January 2026 15:26, UK

Scotland's first minister has proposed a national bank holiday to mark the men's football team playing in its first World Cup since 1998.

Scotland's opening game is against Haiti in Boston, with kick-off scheduled to take place at 2am UK time on Sunday 14 June.

John Swinney has proposed that Monday 15 June be designated a national bank holiday in celebration.

The first minister said 2026 is ""shaping up to be a very exciting year"" for Scotland - with the Commonwealth Games returning to Glasgow and the men's national football team securing their spot in the FIFA World Cup this summer.

Mr Swinney said: ""The whole nation will come to a standstill in June. Even more so in July once we've seen off Brazil and progressed to the knockout stages.

""This is a moment 28 years in the waiting - and I want as many people as possible to share the occasion.

""So, friends, I can confirm today that I have written to the Privy Council, proposing that the Monday - the day after our opening game - be designated a bank holiday in Scotland.

""That will mean that supporters across the country can watch our men's team in their first World Cup match for almost 30 years and share in the chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, to create tourism and hospitality interest within the country, and to make deep and lasting cultural and sporting connections.""

The proposal will be formally confirmed once rubberstamped by the King.

Mr Swinney made the announcement during his New Year election pitch to voters in Glasgow on Monday morning.

Ahead of the Holyrood election in May, the first minister said the SNP will ""offer Scotland hope for a better future"".

He added: ""We've all been on the doorsteps a lot in recent months. Voters everywhere are telling us the same thing.

""The UK economy is broken. Living standards are flat as a pancake. Far too many people are living in poverty. Far too many people are struggling to make ends meet.

""Energy costs in energy-rich Scotland are scandalously high. These are the fundamental issues holding Scotland back.""

Mr Swinney claimed the UK is ""lurching further and further to the right"" as he described the language around immigration and asylum ""nothing short of disgraceful"".

He added: ""In this election, there are those who will seek to obtain power by spreading fear and insecurity. There are those who will seek to divide us.

""And there are those who don't care about Scotland and instead seek to use the election to further their own interests. Not the SNP.""

The first minister claimed the best way to support the nation's NHS, bring down energy bills and make daily life more affordable for people ""is for Scotland to become an independent country"".

However, Mr Swinney is yet to reveal a clear plan on how his party intends to deliver Scottish independence if the UK government continues to refuse requests for a second referendum.

Mr Swinney said: ""To become independent, we need a referendum that will be recognised by the international community.

""In 2011, Scotland secured a referendum when the SNP won a majority. It worked in 2011 - and it will work in 2026.""

Mr Swinney admitted it was an ""ambitious task"" as he called for a ""fresh start with independence"".

He said: ""Let 2026 be a year when we rightly celebrate all that we are - but also imagine what we could be.""

Adding: ""Where others try and tell people in Scotland that they can't, let us demonstrate that we can.""

During his speech, Mr Swinney also addressed the US raid on Venezuela saying he was ""deeply concerned"" about the situation.

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also spoke to supporters on Monday morning.

Mr Sarwar said: ""I know the prime minister and the UK Labour government are not popular with the public right now.

""So, I am not running to be Scotland's first minister in denial of the truth. I am running to be Scotland's first minister in defiance of it.""

Mr Sarwar said the ""SNP have had their chance"" but ""blew it"".

He took aim at both the SNP and Reform UK, claiming they ""both play the politics of fear and blame"".

He said: ""The truth is, Nigel Farage does not care about Scotland. He does not understand Scotland, and he does not want to fix Scotland.""

Mr Sarwar added: ""I want to build something better here in Scotland. But we must confront the reasons pushing people towards Reform.

""When people feel ignored, when services fail, and when trust drains away, it creates space for those who want to divide us.""

Later on Monday, Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay pledged to cut taxes if his party gets into power this year.

Mr Findlay said the Scottish Conservatives would raise the threshold at which Scots pay income tax, as well as for those paying the higher rate of tax amid accusations the SNP and Labour favour ""stealth taxes"" by freezing income tax rates.

Freezing rates means those who see an increase in wages can be pulled into higher tax brackets.

Mr Findlay said: ""I believe, this year, the cost of living crisis will and should define the Holyrood election.

""It's the number one concern for every family, every business, every worker, every community, indeed, the whole country.

""2026 will be the cost of living election.

""The public will have the choice between five more miserable years of SNP tax rises and wasteful spending or a new era of hope with a common sense focus on bringing down bills through economic growth.""

Mr Findlay said his party would ""fight to bring down bills"", help Scotland's economy to thrive, lower NHS waiting lists, and raise standards in schools.

He also claimed that the Scottish welfare system ""incentivises idleness"" and warned that social security spending was unsustainable.

Mr Findlay said: ""Scotland cannot afford to continue to park more people on benefits street.""","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}","soccer"

Based on the author's interpretations and judgments of facts, data and events

Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, awards U.S. President Donald Trump the newly established FIFA Peace Prize at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, on December 5, 2025.

Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, finally spoke up about sky-high ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, described as “extortionate” and “scandalous” by football supporters' groups in Europe and elsewhere.

Showing that he has learned something from his budding friendship with U.S. President Donald Trump, Infantino gave an explanation that was equal parts shameless and ridiculous.

Ticket prices starting at several hundred dollars for the cheap seats — many times what FIFA originally said when the World Cup was announced for the United States, Canada and Mexico — were simply necessary for the good of the sport, Infantino said.

Without the billions of dollars FIFA will rake in this year, he claimed, there “would be no football in 150 countries.”

Do you want to pay thousands of dollars to attend a World Cup game, or do you want soccer to go broke?

It is true that FIFA sends much of its revenues back to its 211 member associations — the governing bodies of soccer for nations around the world — for investment in the sport. But there is simply no reason for FIFA to increase the scale at the levels planned for this summer's tournament, which is of course being supported by hundreds of millions of public dollars.

When member nations received their ticket allotments and prices in early December, supporters were outraged to discover that group-stage games began at about US$270, more than eight times the amount charged at Euro 2024. Lower-bowl seats were listed for more than US$700. Those figures reflect a doubling of ticket prices since the last World Cup, in Qatar, in 2022.

In its 2018 bid document for this year's event, FIFA said it expected ticket prices for the group stages in North America would range between US$21 and $230. The umbrella group Football Supporters Europe said last month that the announced prices for 2026 were “a monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup.”

The huge hike means that FIFA, not surprisingly, expects huge revenue increases. According to a report in The Athletic, FIFA will book more than US$2 billion in ticketing income in the four-year cycle ending with the 2026 World Cup, more than triple the previous four-year cycle. The same report says Infantino's FIFA will end up with cash reserves of more than US$4 billion by the end of this cycle.

These are staggering amounts for a non-profit organization, and it's obvious that FIFA could still generate considerable revenue while offering reasonable ticket prices. The expanded 2026 World Cup has more games, and in larger stadiums, than previous editions, so the potential for increased revenue was already baked in.

That, evidently, wasn't enough. And it all comes back to Infantino, the man who has blazed new trails of obsequiousness with his sucking up to Trump. All that revenue FIFA hoards can then be doled out back to the member nations who, in turn, will eventually vote to keep Infantino in his job.

Would it surprise you to learn that amounts paid out to member associations have more than quadrupled over the past decade? I'm guessing it would not, just as it was no surprise to anyone when Infantino's predecessor Sepp Blatter was ousted in a corruption and bribery scandal that involved, literally, stacks of cash paid out in brown paper envelopes. These guys don't even bother to do their grifting in the shadows.

Will some of FIFA's vast World Cup income make it back to the countries that need it for youth development and pitch maintenance, especially in poorer parts of the world? Of course. But you don't have to be a cynic to recognize that all those billions sloshing around in FIFA's coffers will make it that much easier for certain cronies and swells to justify their five-star hotels and private-jet jaunts.

FIFA will say its prices are justified, given the high demand for World Cup tickets. But they mean a tournament that could have been welcoming to all will instead be open only to the wealthiest among us.

No wonder Infantino and Trump seem to be hitting it off so well.

Jalisco state is expected to spend around 700 million pesos (US $37.8 million) in preparation for the FIFA 2026 World Cup, with a significant portion going towards infrastructure.

Around 400 million pesos (US $21.6 million) for public works will come from the state, 200 million pesos ($10.8 million) from the municipality of Zapopan and 100 million pesos ($5.4 million) from the city of Guadalajara, Zapopan's mayor, Juan José Frangie Saade, told the newspaper El Universal in June.

 

 

A post shared by Verónica Delgadillo G (@verodelgadillog)

Improvements are aimed not only at the influx of World Cup ticket holders but also at responding to the growing demand for services in the greater Guadalajara area, such as urban and road infrastructure.

“We are undertaking some landmark projects, such as the complete urban redesign of the city's entrance from the airport, a new transportation line, new roads and we are going to renovate the historic center,” said Governor Pablo Lemus Navarro.

“Mobility in the city has become very complex in the last decade, and we must focus on facilitating mobility for the World Cup and for the general public in their daily commutes,” he added.

The Akron Stadium in Zapopan, which can host approximately 48,000 fans, will receive an investment of 300 million pesos ($16 million) from owner Omnilife-Chivas. Spending will go towards replacing the stadium's turf, improving the press area and communications infrastructure and installing more security cameras.  

One of the biggest infrastructure projects coming to the area is the expansion of the Chapala Highway, which connects the city of Guadalajara to the international airport. An additional lane will be added in each direction, and the upgraded six-lane road will be fitted with a bike path, sidewalks and streetlights.

The government also plans to widen the ring road around Guadalajara to improve access to the Akron Stadium. 

Meanwhile, the Camino Real a Colima (Royal Road to Colima) will become an alternative route to López Mateos Avenue, alleviating congestion in the southern part of the city.  

A new Line 5 of Guadalajara's electric BRT public transport system will connect the airport with Akron Stadium, downtown and Expo Guadalajara, and is expected to reduce travel time by 50 minutes.



Meanwhile, the regional airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico (GAP) is continuing its Guadalajara Airport expansion project, with Terminal 2 currently under construction, as well as investing in improvements to the airport in Puerto Vallarta, a popular coastal destination.  

Significant private sector investments are planned for the state's hotel and hospitality sector, with 38 new hotels planned for construction over the next five years.  

Eight new hotels are expected to be completed for the World Cup. Developers have also announced improvements to existing hotels and restaurants. 

The historic center of Guadalajara is getting a glow-up ahead of the World Cup, resulting in long-term benefits for locals and tourists alike. 

Projects include the installation of new streetlights, renovations to drinking water and sewage systems, improvements to pedestrian and vehicular crossings and the transfer of overhead wiring underground.  

The Minerva roundabout will be adapted for pedestrian traffic as part of plans for Fan Festival, with improvements also being made to lighting and security throughout the city's center. 

“These aren't [just] World Cup projects, they're legacy projects for Guadalajara. The historic center had only been renovated once since its construction. What we want is for our center, our heart, to be able to beat strongly for at least the next 50 years,” Guadalajara mayor Verónica Delgadillo said at the presentation of her first government report in September.

The Guadalajara government announced in June that renovation works were due to be completed by the end of the year. 

Improvements are underway in the following areas: 

All projects outlined above must be completed at least 60 days before the start of the World Cup, when FIFA begins its local operations, according to the mayor of Zapopan.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Next Man Utd manager: Enzo Maresca, Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Ruben Amorim's potential permanent successors","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/next-man-utd-manager-enzo-maresca-oliver-glasner-andoni-iraola-ruben-amorim-potential-successors-ranked/blt910a39e1487c7b2d","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:46:41 GMT","

The jig is up for Ruben Amorim. After 14 unforgettable months as head coach, he has been sacked by Manchester United. He broke many records for the wrong reasons, lost a European final to Tottenham and was dumped out of the Carabao Cup by fourth-tier side Grimsby Town. Yet it is only now that those upstairs at Old Trafford have decided to pull the trigger.

After his final game in charge, a credible 1-1 draw at rivals Leeds United, Amorim couldn't help himself, targeting his superiors in a rant that he wanted to be ""the manager, not the coach"". Though United claim his firing was more down to results, even with a mediocre team sitting a modest sixth in the Premier League table, do you think we'd really be here talking about Amorim's replacements if he just kept quiet in that press conference instead of running his mouth?

Darren Fletcher is now in charge of the first team on an interim basis, with a caretaker reportedly then coming in until the end of the season, while the club search for a permanent replacement. But who should that person be? Who could United get that's happy to be the head coach, not the manager? GOAL ranks the top contenders:

Every time the United job becomes vacant, Zinedine Zidane is linked to it. He is merely here as an obligation to keeping the tradition alive.

The former Real Madrid boss will not be heading to Old Trafford. If he is to return to management again, it's almost certainly going to be with the France national team, not in the Premier League.

""I will definitely return to coaching. In the future, I don't know, one of my goals is to coach the French national team. We'll see,"" he said back in October, one month before French media began reporting he would indeed succeed Didier Deschamps.

Unai Emery has done brilliantly to rebuild his reputation in English football. He was deemed a failure at Arsenal after taking on the unenviable job of succeeding Arsene Wenger, but after a short stint back home in Spain with Villarreal - which included beating United in the 2021 Europa League final - he is back at the top of his game.

Having found Aston Villa in a relegation scrap, Emery has turned them into consistent top-four contenders and rebuilt the club in his image. Therein lies why he probably won't be heading to Old Trafford. Villa will give everything in order to keep Emery, and United probably won't be able to offer the same level of power and autonomy he currently enjoys in the West Midlands.

Eddie Howe feels like the INEOS sporting philosophy bottled in a football manager, focusing on mindset and self-improvement. That, plus millions and millions of pounds, is what has made his Bournemouth and Newcastle teams so dynamic.

The Magpies haven't quite hit expectations this season, but they're still likely to reach the Champions League knockout stages and well in with a shout for a top-four finish. Unless those on Tyneside decide now is the time to part company with Howe and move in a new direction, he won't be in the frame for the United gig.

The one manager, the one person altogether, who's even more INEOS-coded than Howe is Sir Gareth Southgate. Marginal gains and committing to culture while ultimately not actually winning championships anyway? Yeah, that's the good stuff.

Southgate and INEOS have long been said to have a great relationship, but the ex-England boss has made clear he's not going to return to management just for the sake of it.

""I am not desperate to stay in football,"" he said in November. ""I have had 37 years in football. You can never say never, because I have just seen Martin O'Neill at his age go to Celtic, but it is not something that is high on my agenda at the moment. I am enjoying the work around leadership. I am enjoying my work with young people. I am very determined to try and make a difference there. And so, I am very relaxed about not being in football at the moment.""

The Three Lions role suited Southgate to a tee, but the cut-and-thrust of the Premier League with one of the most scrutinised clubs in the world wouldn't.

United confirmed on Monday that former midfielder Fletcher has been placed in interim charge of the first team. The Scot returned to the club in 2021 as a technical director and last summer was given the Under-18s manager's job.

There's half a chance this experience both upstairs and on the training ground could help Fletcher get the full-time job, putting together a string of results a la Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2018-19, but it's still an improbable outcome nonetheless. United's best hope is Fletcher makes the team loom competent and the sum of its parts again before deciding on a permanent successor to Amorim, but could they be swayed to keep him if they go on a run and secure Champions League qualification?

Unlike many of the names on this list, ex-midfielder Michael Carrick actually has experience of managing United. He was a key member of Solskjaer's backroom staff until the Norwegian's sacking in November 2021, after which Carrick took caretaker charge prior to Ralf Rangnick's arrival until the end of that season.

Carrick, to his credit, won two and drew one of his three games in the dugout, and they weren't exactly easy games either. A 1-1 draw away at title-chasing Chelsea was followed by a last-gasp win away at Villarreal in the Champions League. His final match saw United beat Arsenal 3-2 at Old Trafford.

Deciding to pursue his career as a head coach rather than an assistant, Carrick left and was appointed Middlesbrough manager in 2022, guiding them to the Championship play-offs in his first season, and they remained contenders for promotion before his sacking last summer.

To paraphrase every middle-aged pundit ever, Carrick knows the club. Would that be enough to convince INEOS?

If United do want a short-term option to bring them back to stability, then picking up the phone and convincing Solskjaer to return might not be the worst idea in the world.

He's done it before, he loves the club and probably wouldn't be under any illusions over the length of his tenure this time around. There was even talk of that post-Ten Hag and pre-Amorim. The optics of such a return would be difficult for the top brass to stomach though, and that's before you think of the potential parallels to Frank Lampard heading back to Chelsea in 2023 and winning only once in his 11 games.

The best candidate of Solskjaer's former staff is undoubtedly Kieran McKenna, who has worked miracles as manager of Ipswich Town. He found them squandering in League One back in 2021, but back-to-back promotions starting from his first full season saw the Tractor Boys return to the Premier League in the span of two years.

They were relegated at the end of 2024-25 without much of a fight, but you could hardly blame McKenna for not keeping a team which still had plenty of players from their days in the third tier for not staying up. Ipswich seem primed to be promoted back to the top-flight this season, too.

Again, the issue here is public perception. Could United really get away with appointing a Championship manager to solve this crisis?

After his abrupt exit from Brighton in 2024, Roberto De Zerbi was one of several candidates spoken to by United's new hierarchy as they weighed up the future of Erik ten Hag. The plus side of the Italian was the style of play he preaches, often praised by other managers as one of the game's best tacticians and thinkers. The negatives were how combustible and temperamental he could be.

In the end, they opted to stick with Ten Hag for a few months more, while De Zerbi, who claimed to have even received a contract offer from United, headed to France to manage Marseille. Though you'd imagine he'd be keen on a Premier League return, it's hard to envisage the Red Devils' powerbrokers wanting someone so fiery to lead them through this stage of their project, despite their continued admiration of the Italian.

With seemingly every chance he gets, Mauricio Pochettino talks up returning to Tottenham one day. The United States boss hasn't hidden from his desire to manage in the Premier League again, particularly if the opportunity came with Spurs.

But there's a history between Pochettino and United that just won't go away. When Jose Mourinho was sacked in 2018, the Argentine was the immediate favourite to replace him. Tottenham were rattled so much that they even asked journalists not to ask questions on the subject. The job went to Solskjaer on that occasion, but when the Norwegian left a couple of years later, Pochettino was pitted in a direct head-to-head with Ajax's Ten Hag. Again, Pochettino lost out.

Pochettino wouldn't be available until after the U.S.' World Cup campaign on home soil this summer, but his insistence on managing in England once more means he has to be a contender for United again after Fletcher's interim spell.

The second of three managers who won't be an option until the World Cup concludes, Thomas Tuchel is another name who has held talks over the United job before. Like De Zerbi, the club decided against furthering discussions in order to stand by Ten Hag.

Of all the coaches on this list, Tuchel is both the most accomplished and the most qualified. There aren't many better active managers in all of football. But can United really go back to him with their tails between their legs and say they were wrong to overlook him two years ago? Could they ask Tuchel to come and sort them out 24 months behind schedule? It might be worth a try if they want to be successful.

In retrospect, Xavi's tenure as Barcelona head coach was pretty successful. He took over in 2021 with them ninth in La Liga and still reeling from Lionel Messi's summer departure, but led them back to second place that season before winning the title the following year, all the while continuing to promote and trust in youth. That was against the backdrop of Barca's financial crisis and the relentless pressure of the Spanish press.

That hounding clearly took a toll on Xavi, who seemed drained by the time he left the club in 2024. The English press is much tamer in comparison, while he has previously suggested he would love to test himself in the Premier League. United might be able to provide him with that opportunity, with reports in recent months claiming the 45-year-old would relish such a chance.

On paper, Julian Nagelsmann is the exact sort of head coach that United in the INEOS era should be chasing. He's tactically flexible, modern in every sense and proven both at massive teams (Germany and Bayern Munich) and those looking to break into the established elite (RB Leipzig and Hoffenheim).

Still only 38 and at the top of his game, Nagelsmann feels destined to manage in the Premier League one day. As with Pochettino and Tuchel, that may not come until after the World Cup, but if he can give United his word that he will take the job as soon as Germany's tournament is over, he would almost definitely be worth waiting for.

Imagine time travelling back to Christmas Day and say that the unemployed Enzo Maresca would be in the running to succeed the sacked Amorim. What a wild start it's been to 2026!

Given how many Manchester City alumni are already making the big decisions at United, from CEO Omar Berrada to director of football Jason Wilcox, you'd think they'd already have Maresca, their former U23s coach, on their radar. But talks about succeeding Pep Guardiola across town, plus his Chelsea dismissal being almost parallel to Amorim's, means it would be hard to sell Maresca on a project where he again doesn't play a larger and more important role. Maybe those existing relationships with the Old Trafford hierarchy could make that an easier for him to swallow, however.

If United want a modern, proven head coach who's happy to play his part as a cog in the system on the training pitch and in the dugout, then Andoni Iraola should be in their thinking. Bournemouth, despite losing all of their best players year on year, remain the most entertaining team in the Premier League, not least showcased by their thrilling 4-4 draw at Old Trafford just last month. They have a clear style and philosophy regardless of which players are on the pitch.

The appointment of Amorim proved to be a failure because he wasn't suited to the week-to-week pressures of the Premier League and wanted to have a bigger say in club matters. It didn't fall apart because of the club's ambition. A swing on Iraola, someone with two-and-a-half years of positive experience in England and has recognised his standing as only the head coach of a mid-table team like Bournemouth, may be seen as similarly radical, but there would at least be method behind that madness this time around.

Crystal Palace's successful 2025 using a similar 3-4-3 system to Amorim's which crashed and burned saw Oliver Glasner heavily linked to the United post. With the Austrian unlikely to stay at Selhurst Park beyond the expiration of his contract this summer, expect these stories to return to the news cycle again.

With United partway to constructing a 3-4-3 that has more square pegs in square holes, you can understand if the board pivot to Glasner to pick up where Amorim left off and work from there. Promise him what Steve Parish can't at Palace and he might make the step up to an elite-level manager.

Glasner might be at that level already having already won the Europa League and FA Cup, and sooner or later a top club will give him a go. Why can't that be United? And, judging by reporting from the Daily Telegraph who say he's indeed their top target, why won't that be United?","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Alejandro Garnacho cheekily revels in Ruben Amorim's Man Utd sacking with social media activity after being exiled by ex-Red Devils boss before Chelsea transfer","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/alejandro-garnacho-ruben-amorim-man-utd-sacking-social-media-activity-chelsea-transfer/bltc3e2a47e5a1545f2","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:37:06 GMT","

Alejandro Garnacho has publicly revelled in Ruben Amorim's sacking by Manchester United. The Portuguese tactician has been relieved of his duties at Old Trafford as a forgettable 14-month tenure is brought to a close. Garnacho was among those to be frozen out of the Red Devils fold by Amorim, leading to him leaving for Chelsea, and the Argentina international appears to have taken great delight in seeing his former boss dismissed.

Amorim inherited the managerial reins at Old Trafford in November 2024. He made it clear from the off that he would be implementing the 3-4-3 system that had served him so well during a title-winning spell at previous club Sporting.

That formation did not play to the strengths of several wingers that were tied to United at the time. Brazil international Antony, homegrown star Marcus Rashford and England forward Jadon Sancho were all phased out - with all of them currently plying their club trade outside of Manchester.

Garnacho, another product of the Red Devils' fabled academy system, also struggled to win over Amorim. Questions were asked of the 21-year-old's attitude, with it becoming apparent at the end of the 2024-25 campaign that there was no future for him at United under the Portuguese tactician.

A £40 million ($54m) transfer to Chelsea was subsequently completed, allowing Garnacho to start afresh at Stamford Bridge. While that new challenge has been embraced, the tricky winger continues to keep an eye on events at Old Trafford.

On January 5, it was revealed that Amorim had been forced through the exits in Manchester. He took in just 63 games at the helm and has paid the price for inconsistency on the field and public blasts at the United board off the pitch.

Garnacho hinted after the 2025 Europa League final, which saw United suffer a 1-0 defeat to domestic rivals Tottenham, that he was ready to walk away from Amorim's reign in Manchester. He said: “Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know. The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.”

His brother, Roberto, posted on social media: “Working as no-one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus.”

Garnacho is not prepared to forgive and forget when it comes to Amorim. It was quickly noted by fans that he had liked an Instagram post from transfer guru Fabrizio Romano that confirmed the departure of another manager from the Manchester United hotseat.

Garnacho said of severing ties with United when linking up with Enzo Maresca at Chelsea: “Sometimes in life you have to change things to maybe take a step forward or to improve as a player. It was the right moment, also the right club, so it was an easy decision.

“I spoke with [Maresca, before joining], he explained everything to me. Now working together I think we are doing well, we are going to improve with time. He trusts me. So that's the most important [thing] — we have confidence and we are going to improve.

“The most important thing [a coach can give] is confidence. He speaks with me every week and I think we're going to be better — me as a player and the team all together, with time. There's confidence between manager and player.”

Garnacho is no longer working with Maresca, as the Italian tactician is another of those to have been sacked by a Premier League heavyweight early in 2026. The Blues are expected to hand the reins to former Derby and Hull City boss Liam Rosenior, who will be eager to see what Garnacho has to offer.

United have announced that Darren Fletcher will be taking charge of first-team affairs at Old Trafford on an interim basis. Maresca is among the names being linked with the Red Devils, with it possible that he will make an immediate return to top-flight management in England.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Ruben Amorim only has himself to blame: Dismal results and dogmatic approach cost him the Man Utd job, not the Red Devils' board","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/ruben-amorim-himself-to-blame-dismal-results-dogmatic-approach-cost-man-utd-job-not-red-devils-board/blt878b73f4375a3ae3","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:31:04 GMT","

It was a mic drop moment that came out of the blue and yet seemed to have been brewing for a long time. Ruben Amorim was getting through a potentially difficult press conference after drawing at Leeds with little fuss, giving the assembled journalists little to feed on. But then came the bombshell moment which has led to him ultimately being sacked just 14 months after taking over at Old Trafford.

Amorim had looked downbeat and despondent in his last pre-match briefing, clearly upset about something but unwilling to say what it was as he repeated, ""I don't want to talk about it"" three times when asked if anything had changed between him and sporting director Jason Wilcox. But when asked right at the end of the press conference at Elland Road if he still felt the confidence from the board of directors, he didn't just take the bait, he bit the line off.

""To start with that, I noticed that you received selective information about everything,"" he began. ""I came here to be the manager of the Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. And that is clear. I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change.""

With one answer, a routine post-game press conference suddenly felt like a scene from a television drama. And Amorim did not stop there, repeating that he wanted to be ""the manager, not the coach"" twice more before delivering the show-stopping line: ""In every department - the scouting department, the sporting director needs to do their job, I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.""

But instead of another 18 months, Amorim only got another 19 hours in the job as he was sacked on Monday morning. He could hardly have been surprised given his press conference at Leeds felt like a resignation statement. Despite his often strained relationship with the media, Amorim was using them to speak out against the board who had hired him. And as Enzo Maresca had just witnessed at Chelsea and Nuno Espirito Santo found with Nottingham Forest, once you do that, there is usually only one winner.

Amorim has had no shortage of critics during his time in charge of United, be it rival pundits such as Jamie Carragher or Red Devils' legends Wayne Rooney, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes. But he always felt the support of the board, despite presiding over the club's lowest league finish in 51 years and failing to qualify for Europe for the first time in 11 years after losing the Europa League final to a very poor Tottenham team.

In October, Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he would be happy to give Amorim three years to ""demonstrate he is a good coach"", comparing him to Mikel Arteta and how the Gunners gave the Spanish coach time to get things right after a difficult first three seasons. 

Previously in June, chief executive Omar Berrada had compared Amorim to Pep Guardiola, whom he had worked with at Manchester City, as the Portuguese, ""stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.""

""He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season,"" Berrada added on Guardiola's City tenure.

The top brass were the only allies Amorim could rely on, which is why it was so surprising to see him point the finger at them at Elland Road. 

Immediately after Amorim was sacked, United sources were keen to point out that he had unwavering support from everyone within the club and insisted that there had been no power struggles or ultimatums. But there was clearly unease between the coach and sporting director Wilcox, who was believed to have encouraged him to move away from the 3-4-2-1 shape he had used in almost every game. 

Amorim's strict adherence to his beloved formation has proved to be his undoing, as many predicted it would. It held the team back on the pitch and it ultimately led to a rift between him and the club's hierarchy. 

A source who had previously worked with Amorim was not surprised when he saw the coach lash out in the press conference, as Amorim does not like to be questioned or have anyone interfere with his choices for the team. At Sporting CP, he always had full trust from the board and absolute power over team selection and new signings, but it was becoming clear that was no longer the case at United.

United sources claim that Amorim has been sacked as the club had not seen enough signs of evolution or progress. Leaving aside for a second the misguided decision the Red Devils made in appointing Amorim in the middle of last season when he wanted to wait until the summer, it is difficult to argue against their reasoning.

In his 14 months in charge, Amorim won just 24 out of 63 matches, leaving him with a win percentage of just 38.7. It is comfortably the worst record of any manager in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, with Louis van Gaal, Erik ten Hag, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Jose Mourinho and David Moyes all winning at least 52% of their games. 

It is the worst record of any United coach since Frank O'Farrell in the early 1970s. And unlike Moyes, who at least had the excuse of being given just £27 million to spend on Marouane Fellaini in his first transfer window and arrived just after chief executive David Gill had departed alongside Ferguson, Amorim cannot say he was not backed in the transfer market or allowed to reshape the squad.

Within two months of Amorim arriving, United signed Patrick Dorgu to boost their wing-back options. More significantly, the new boss was allowed to bomb Marcus Rashford out of the squad and then the club, an episode which has become more embarrassing as the striker has rebuilt his career first at Aston Villa and now at Barcelona, also returning to the England squad.

Over the summer, United shelled out £216m on new signings, including ready-made Premier League players such as Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, a new goalkeeper in Senne Lammens and the highly-coveted Benjamin Sesko, who was also targeted by Newcastle and Arsenal and was the most expensive signing of the lot at £74m. 

That made United the fifth-biggest spenders in the Premier League and the third-highest net spenders, only behind Arsenal and Liverpool, a fact that United sources were also keen to point out when Amorim was let go. They also stressed that he was fully aligned with the plan to prioritise signing three forwards over a midfielder last summer. 

Having been given a much more dangerous attack, United also had a crucial advantage over all the other top clubs they were competing with this season: they have no European football to worry about. They 'earned' even more time on the training ground and even fewer games to drain players' energy when they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby Town, the club's first-ever defeat to a fourth-division side. 

But United did not use it to their advantage. They sit in sixth place in the Premier League table after 20 games, with every team above them playing European football.

It is really a miracle that United are still within striking distance of Champions League football given their recent run of results. They have won just three of their last 11 fixtures, only facing one top-five rival in that period in Aston Villa, who beat them. They played five of the teams in the bottom six, failing to beat all of them, including a Wolves side who at the time had the worst record in English top-flight history and a dismal West Ham who were rolled over by Wolves at the weekend. 

Their home form has been most infuriating. They have taken six points from their last five matches at Old Trafford, losing against 10-man Everton before drawing with each Wolves, West Ham and Bournemouth. Their one win in that period, against Newcastle, was slightly fortunate too, with the Magpies dominating the second half.

Results matter more than anything and Amorim did not get enough good ones. But beyond that, his leadership of the club has been poor in many other aspects. He has been dismissive of the club's academy, hounding out Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho while barely playing Kobbie Mainoo. He also made less than complimentary comments about youngsters such as Chido Obi and Harry Amass, which eroded a lot of his support among fans of a club that prides itself on trusting homegrown players.

Then there were the the brutal comments Amorim made which undermined the squad. He sensationally claimed he would rather field his goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital, who is in his 60s, instead of Rashford while also describing his squad as ""maybe the worst team in the history of Manchester United"". 

Christian Eriksen recently described how badly that went down with the players: ""I don't think that helped the players at all. Some stuff you can say inside and it's not too clever to say outside, to put extra pressure and put an extra label on the players who were already trying to do their best. I don't think that helped at all, no. Then if he's right or wrong, whatever, but I think for us it was a bit of like, ‘Oh, here we go again. Another headline'.""

There were too many headlines during Amorim's era and they were rarely good ones. Even though 14 months seems like a short amount of time, many fans and pundits believe he should have been removed far earlier. The Europa League final defeat to Tottenham - who sacked Ange Postecoglou despite winning a first trophy in 17 years - would have been an obvious moment to change course. The defeat at Brentford in September - after which GOALcalled for him to be sacked - was another.

Amorim clung on thanks to the board's faith in him, but when he pointed the finger back at them, there was no place to hide.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ruben Amorim's future as Manchester United manager is said to be in serious jeopardy, with the Portuguese tactician having seemingly taken a leaf out of Enzo Maresca's book. On the back of seeing the Italian tactician relieved of his duties after speaking out at Chelsea, under-fire Amorim took the decision to aim an outburst of his own in the direction of club officials at Old Trafford.

Amorim, who has struggled for consistency throughout his reign as Red Devils boss, delivered an explosive post-match press conference after seeing United held to a 1-1 draw by old adversaries Leeds at Elland Road.

He claimed to be deserving of more power and authority than he is currently granted and revealed that he plans to leave Old Trafford at the end of his contract, regardless of what happens between now and that deal expiring in 2027. Those comments have, according to talkSPORT, not gone down well with United's board.

Amorim told reporters during an angry rant, with the Portuguese hinting at his position being undermined by those working above him: ""I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the head coach. I know my name is not [Antonio] Conte, [Thomas] Tuchel, or [Jose] Mourinho but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or until the board decide to change. I'm not going to quit. I'll do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.""

He went on to say: ""I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that and that is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job. Not to be a coach.

""If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club. I just want to say I came here to be the manager, not to be the coach. In every department - the scouting department, the sporting director needs to do their job, I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.""

According to talkSPORT, ""Amorim's fractured relationship with director of football Jason Wilcox is viewed by sources close to United as making his long-term position uncertain"". Tension in the Red Devils camp is said to have boiled over after Wilcox and Co urged Amorim to be ""more tactically flexible"" in his approach - with the 40-year-old's 3-4-3 system attracting plenty of criticism.

Amorim's future, and willingness to fulfil his contract, is now in doubt. The report goes on to claim that: ""If it comes down to a power struggle between Amorim and Wilcox, chief executive Omar Berrada is expected to back the latter"".

Amorim, who inherited the reins at Old Trafford in November 2024, is said to be of the opinion that transfer promises have been broken, with a quiet January now being lined up by United.

Their head coach had been hoping to move for a Premier League proven striker in the summer of 2025 - such as Aston Villa star Ollie Watkins - but was handed £74 million ($99m) Slovenian frontman Benjamin Sesko instead.

Amorim also wanted the Red Devils to be in the hunt for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, who has a £65m ($87m) release clause in his contract, but the Ghana international now appears destined to link up with arch-rivals Manchester City.

United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has stated in the past that Amorim should be given his full three-year deal in which to prove his worth and get United - who missed out on European qualification last season - back on track.

There are now said to be ""reservations in the Old Trafford boardroom regarding the Portuguese"". He has collected just 24 wins from 63 games at the helm, with 21 defeats being suffered over the course of that tenure.

Chelsea proved when parting with Maresca - after seeing him speak out against the club - that patience can wear thin quickly when it comes to prominent Premier League posts. It may be that United opt to open a new manager search of their own, with Amorim now on borrowed time as the Red Devils sit sixth in the table and face the threat of tumbling down the English top flight if stability cannot be established on and off the field.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Adam Wharton is a wanted man! Real Madrid offered chance to rival Premier League giants Liverpool, Man City, Man Utd & Chelsea in transfer race for Crystal Palace ace","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/adam-wharton-is-a-wanted-man-real-madrid-offered-chance-to-rival-premier-league-giants-liverpool-man-city-man-utd-and-chelsea-in-transfer-race-for-crystal-palace-ace/bltb5e79e6834a2f374","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:11:42 GMT","

Real Madrid have been offered the chance to sign Crystal Palace sensation Adam Wharton, but Los Blancos will face fierce competition for his signature. Premier League giants Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea are all tracking the midfielder, who will reportedly cost at least €70 million and is demanding a huge salary to leave Selhurst Park.

The race to sign one of England's most prodigious midfield talents has taken a continental twist, with reports in Spain saying that Wharton has been offered to Madrid. The 21-year-old, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise since swapping Blackburn Rovers for Crystal Palace in January 2024, has established himself as a linchpin in the Eagles' midfield, drawing admiring glances from the elite of European football.

According to Spanish outlet AS, intermediaries acting on behalf of the player have made contact with the reigning European champions to gauge their interest in bringing the Englishman to the Santiago Bernabeu. While Real Madrid have focused heavily on recruiting French and Brazilian talent in recent years - alongside the marquee signing of Jude Bellingham - the opportunity to pair Wharton with his international teammate is an intriguing proposition for the Spanish hierarchy.

However, the report suggests that while Madrid are attentive to the market, they have not yet made a definitive move. The club is currently weighing up their options as they look to future-proof their engine room, but the financial package required to land the Palace ace could prove to be a stumbling block even for a club of their stature.

Any club wishing to prise Wharton away from South London will need to possess incredibly deep pockets. Crystal Palace, who have a strong track record of developing and protecting the value of their assets, have absolutely no intention of letting their star man leave on the cheap. AS states that the Eagles have slapped a minimum price tag of €70 million (£58m) on the midfielder, a figure that would represent a massive profit on the initial £18m they paid Blackburn just two years ago.

Perhaps more significant than the transfer fee, however, are the reported wage demands. The Spanish publication claims that Wharton is seeking a ""Galactico salary"" to facilitate a move. This suggests the player is aware of his soaring stock and expects to be remunerated as a top-tier starter immediately, rather than stepping onto a developmental wage structure.

For Real Madrid, who manage their wage bill meticulously to accommodate superstars like Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior, these demands could necessitate a significant departure from their usual policy for signing young players.

If Madrid do decide to pass on the opportunity, Wharton will not be short of suitors closer to home. The report highlights that the entire 'Big Four' of interested parties - Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea - remain firmly in the hunt.

Liverpool have long admired Wharton's ability to break lines and dictate tempo, seeing him as a potential long-term successor to their current midfield anchors. Meanwhile, City are perpetually in the market for technically secure midfielders who can operate in Pep Guardiola's complex system, with Wharton's profile fitting the mould of a City player perfectly.

United, under the INEOS regime, are prioritising young, domestic talent, making Wharton a prime target for their continued rebuild at Old Trafford. Chelsea, true to form, are also monitoring the situation, having spent the last few years aggressively acquiring the best young talent in world football.

Despite the noise surrounding his future, Crystal Palace find themselves in a strong negotiating position with Wharton under a long-term contract at Selhurst Park. The midfielder's calm demeanour on the pitch has been matched by his sensible approach to his career off it. Since arriving in the Premier League, he has shown a maturity beyond his years, forcing his way into the England setup for Euro 2024, though he remained an unused substitute throughout, and becoming one of the first names on the team sheet in South London.

Whether he moves to the bright lights of Madrid or stays in the Premier League to fight for titles, one thing is certain: Wharton is now considered elite property, and it will take a monumental financial package to secure his services in 2026. The bidding war has effectively begun, and the numbers being mentioned suggest it will be one of the sagas of the year.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester United have officially parted ways with Ruben Amorim following a chaotic 24 hours at Old Trafford, bringing an abrupt end to the Portuguese coach's tenure. The decision was confirmed on Monday morning after the manager launched a blistering public attack on the club's hierarchy, a move that supporters on social media have largely agreed made his position at the helm completely untenable.

The axe has finally fallen on the Portuguese tactician's reign at United, with the club acting swiftly to terminate his contract just months into his second season. The decision comes in the immediate aftermath of a fiery press conference where the 40-year-old openly questioned the competence of the ownership group and the recruitment structure in the wake of his side's 1-1 draw with Leeds on Sunday. While the results on the pitch have been underwhelming it was his war of words with the boardroom that ultimately sealed his fate, with Amorim insisting he accepted the Old Trafford job in order to become the ""manager"" of the club, insisting the decision makers must back him. That challenge was ultimately dismissed by the board, however. 

Fans have flocked to social media to dissect the news, and while the fanbase has often been divided on the former Sporting CP boss's tactical suitability, there appears to be a consensus that his public insubordination left the club with no choice. For a fanbase that still holds the values of the institution above any individual, airing dirty laundry in such a volatile manner was viewed as the final straw.

The speed of the decision was the first talking point, with the club moving quickly to cut ties before the dust had settled on the weekend's drama. @Flashscorecom highlighted the rapid turnaround between the manager's press conference comments regarding his contract stability and the sacking.

""Those '18 months' turned into about 18 hours,"" the account posted.

For many supporters, the departure was a cause for celebration rather than commiseration. The feeling among the faithful was that the coach had talked a good game without delivering results. User @Aaron_Magook was scathing in their assessment of the manager's communication skills versus his coaching ability.

""The best monday in the history of Mondays,"" the fan wrote. ""He can go and start a tedtalk show on YouTube since all he knows is how to talk well.""

The statistical record of the outgoing boss was a major stick used to beat him with. @TheFergusonWay wrote: ""Good luck, but having 15 wins in 47 PL games with a 31.9% win rate is untenable at any level.""

This sentiment was backed up by a brutal breakdown of the tenure provided by user @flowzki, who listed the lowlights of a disastrous spell.

""So Ruben Amorim will end his tenure with: More losses than wins; Never had back-to-back clean sheets; Only won back-to-back games once; 31% win rate; Lost a European final to Spurs; Lost to Grimsby; Finished 16th,"" they posted. ""NUMEROUS embarrassing results. WE MUST SUFFER.""

However, not everyone believed the sacking was purely down to footballing reasons. @MinaFootball expressed cynicism regarding the timing, suggesting that the board only acted because their own egos were bruised, rather than because of the poor results against lower-league opposition like Grimsby or the Europa League final defeat.

""If INEOS sack Amorim for his media outburst I will laugh,"" the account noted. ""Not the UEL final, not Grimsby, not the poor results, but a media outburst which looks bad on them will be the straw that broke the camels back. Lol.""

The reaction wasn't limited to United fans. Rival supporters also weighed in, with @MogoiRon engaging in the schadenfreude typical of Premier League rivalries.

""Amorim sacked....such a sad day for us rival fans,"" the user joked.

Finally, the financial implications of the public meltdown were noted by @Davey_J_, who theorised that the manager engineered the exit to secure a payout while inadvertently helping the club reset.

""Amorim played a blinder there, stitched United up one last time for the payout!"" the fan wrote. ""Bad news for the rest of the league though, chance of them getting their shit together now.""

The reactions highlight the depth of the crisis that United are in. Last season's 16th-place finish in the Premier League illustrates just how far standards have fallen at the Theatre of Dreams, while the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham is particularly painful for the supporters, representing a missed opportunity for silverware and Champions League qualification that would have bought the manager more time.

The loss to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup in August is clearly another nadir that many fans cannot forgive. For a club of United's stature to lose to lower-league opposition is always unacceptable, but combined with such a low win rate, it paints a picture of a team in freefall. The ""3-4-3 experiment"" that the manager was famous for in Lisbon clearly failed to translate to English football, leaving the squad exposed and the supporters frustrated.

The INEOS ownership, led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has attempted to instil a culture of discipline and corporate excellence since taking charge of football operations. For an employee to publicly criticise the recruitment strategy and question the ambition of the hierarchy is a direct challenge to that authority.

As noted by the fans, the board may have tolerated mediocrity on the pitch for longer than expected, perhaps hoping the ""project"" would come good. However, open rebellion in a press conference is a red line. By removing the coach immediately, the hierarchy has reasserted control, but they now face the daunting task of finding a replacement who can salvage their season.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The managerial merry-go-round at Stamford Bridge is spinning again, with Liam Rosenior set to arrive in London to finalise his appointment as Chelsea's new head coach following Enzo Maresca's exit. However, BlueCo have wasted no time lining up a replacement for the Strasbourg dugout, with former Wolves boss Gary O'Neil emerging as the shock contender to swap the Premier League for Ligue 1.

The incoming Blues boss has touched down in the capital to complete a remarkable return to English football, less than two years after his dismissal by Hull City. The 41-year-old, who has rebuilt his reputation across the Channel with Chelsea's sister club Strasbourg, is poised to become the latest occupant of the Stamford Bridge hot seat. While the final details of his contract are being thrashed out at Cobham, the wider machinery of the BlueCo multi-club ownership model is already moving to fill the void he leaves behind in Alsace.

According to reports from The Guardian's Jacob Steinberg, the Chelsea hierarchy have identified former Bournemouth manager O'Neil as the primary target to succeed Rosenior at the Stade de la Meinau. The Englishman, who has been out of work since his harsh sacking by Wolves in December 2024, is viewed as the ideal candidate to continue the development of the French side's youthful squad.

The potential appointment of O'Neil would represent a doubling down on the ownership's strategy of utilising Strasbourg as a laboratory for young, progressive coaching talent as well as players. The outgoing manager's tenure in France has been deemed a resounding success; he guided the club to a seventh-place finish last season and has them competing in the knockout stages of the UEFA Conference League. His ability to implement a high-pressing, possession-based style that mirrors the ""Chelsea DNA"" demanded by the board has convinced the owners that he is ready for the step up.

For the target, a move to Ligue 1 would offer a chance to rehabilitate his own stock away from the intense glare of the Premier League media. The 42-year-old gained plaudits for his tactical adaptability at the Vitality Stadium and Molineux but was often hampered by financial constraints and VAR controversies. Taking the reins at the Stade de la Meinau would provide him with a talented roster that has been bolstered by BlueCo's recruitment network and the opportunity to manage in European competition.

The Strasbourg manager's imminent arrival follows the turbulent end of Maresca's 18-month reign. Despite delivering silverware in the form of the UEFA Conference League and the Club World Cup, the Italian's relationship with the board fractured beyond repair over the festive period.

Tensions reportedly boiled over following a stalemate with Bournemouth, with the former Leicester City boss publicly criticising the club. His comments about enduring his ""worst 48 hours"" in football, coupled with persistent rumours linking him to the Manchester City job as a potential successor to Pep Guardiola, left the Chelsea board with little choice but to act.

Unlike his predecessor, who struggled to hide his frustration with the club's collaborative structure, the new head coach is seen as a ""company man"" who understands the nuances of the multi-club model. His seamless integration in France, where he developed Chelsea loanees like Andrey Santos, is viewed as the blueprint for how the two clubs should interact.

As 41-year-old Rosenior prepares for his unveiling - potentially in time for Wednesday's Premier League clash against Fulham - questions remain about the stability of the project. He will be inheriting a squad that is talented but raw, currently drifting in the league despite their continental success.

The appointment of O'Neil in France, meanwhile, would signal a clear intent to maintain an ""English core"" to the coaching philosophy across the group, potentially making it easier for players and staff to move between the two entities. If the former midfielder accepts the challenge, he will become one of the few English tacticians to test themselves in Ligue 1.

For now, all eyes are on West London, where another young coach is about to be handed the keys to the kingdom. Whether Rosenior can succeed where Graham Potter and Maresca ultimately failed remains to be seen, but with a replacement waiting in the wings for Strasbourg, the BlueCo carousel shows no signs of stopping.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Hubert Hurkacz stunned Alexander Zverev on Monday evening in Sydney, before Iga Swiatek rallied from a set and a break down to defeat fast-improving Eva Lys to clinch Poland's eventual 3-0 victory against Germany at the United Cup.

After missing nearly seven months due to a right knee injury for which he underwent arthroscopic surgery on 2 July, Hurkacz made a statement return to action. The 28-year-old upset World No. 3 Alexander Zverev 6-3, 6-4 to give his country the lead.

""It's been a while since I've been competing. Seven months I've been going through difficult times with the team and it was very challenging,"" Hurkacz said. ""They were all supporting me, they were all behind me. We went through definitely a long period of time not competing and not knowing when we [would] be able to be back on court again. I was just trying to cherish and enjoy every moment here on the court today.""

Hurkacz had not played a match since June in 's-Hertogenbosch, leading to a fall to No. 83 in the PIF ATP Rankings. But the former World No. 6 played well above his ranking inside Ken Rosewall Arena, facing just one break point in his one-hour, 23-minute victory.

The two-time Nitto ATP Finals competitor held up well under pressure against Zverev, beautifully redirecting a backhand up the line to secure the critical break at 3-3 in the second set. Hurkacz faced just one break point in the match according to Infosys ATP Stats, hitting 21 aces to allow his opponent few opportunities to work his way into points.

""I was serving quite well. I was finding nice spots, so that's definitely a nice feeling to really have good rhythm on the serve,"" Hurkacz said. ""Just so pleased with the performance and just also so much fun to see the fans again.""

Zverev walked on court with a 3-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head series lead against Hurkacz, but was unable to consistently make Hurkacz uncomfortable the way he did Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor on Sunday.

Swiatek then needed to overcome an inspired effort from Lys, before securing the decisive break in the 10th game of the final set to close out a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory in just under two-and-a-half hours.

Lys had never won more than two games in any of the six previous sets she had played against Swiatek. The German, coming off a win over Suzan Lamens of the Netherlands in her opening United Cup match, looked poised for a major upset after breaking to lead 3-1 in the second set. The six-time major champion then mounted her comeback.

Swiatek won five straight games to claim the second set 6-3 and broke again to go up 3-1 in the third. Just as momentum appeared to have swung decisively in the Pole's favor, Lys broke back to level the final set at 3-3. 

The second-serve performance proved decisive. Swiatek won 52 per cent of her second-serve points, compared to 39 per cent for Lys, while the two players were nearly even on first-serve points won, with Swiatek at 54 per cent and Lys at 53 per cent.

Swiatek's United Cup record is now 12-2 and this was her 31st victory in her past 32 matches against players ranked outside the Top 40. This tie was a rematch of the 2024 United Cup final.

In the mixed doubles, Poland's Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski defeated Laura Siegemund and Zverev 7-6(6), 6-3.

The United Cup has its next quarter-finalist, and for the third time in the tournament's four editions, Greece will advance to the knockout round. Stefanos Tsistipas' and Maria Sakkari's three-set victories secured the Group E tie against Great Britain at the RAC Arena in Perth. Olivia Nicholls and Neal Skupski did earn a 6-2, 3-6, 10-4 mixed doubles victory for Great Britain in the final match of the tie against Despina Papamichail and Stefanos Sakellaridis.

Notably, Sakkari's 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 win over Emma Raducanu, was her first career victory against the Briton on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. Sakkari is now 2-0 in singles to start the season, defeating Naomi Osaka on Jan. 2 in the win over Japan.

""Emma, I've had four tough losses against her so to get that first win against her, against a great opponent, it means a lot, especially delivering for Team Greece,"" Sakkari said on-court.

""He has one of the best tennis IQ's that I've ever seen.""

Earlier, Tsitsipas dug deep for a 4-6, 6-1, 7-6(4) win over Billy Harris to set the tone. In a hard-fought battle, Tsitsipas rallied after a slow start to give Greece a 1-0 lead. The 27-year-old struggled to find his range on his backhand throughout the two-hour, 15-minute clash, but inflicted enough damage on his forehand and held his nerve in the third-set tie-break to triumph.

""I got fed up losing matches like that [last year],"" Tsitsipas said. ""I lost one in September and I just tried everything in my power to not have the same thing happen again. I am grateful to overcome that. It had a crazy energy out here.

""I would like to congratulate Billy. He put up an incredible performance. I haven't played such a high quality match in such a long time. He did great, pushing me to my limits. I think matches like that are great for the sport.""

Tsitsipas helped Greece beat Japan in its opening United Cup tie with a win against Shintaro Mochizuki and now holds an 8-2 singles record at the mixed-teams event. It is the first time the No. 36 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has earned consecutive wins since Barcelona last April, when he reached the quarter-finals.

Jakub Mensik clinched Czechia's victory against Norway at the United Cup on Monday, when he downed fellow Top 20 star Casper Ruud 7-5, 7-6(6) in Sydney.



Making his United Cup debut and playing his first match of the season, Mensik's win followed Barbora Krejcikova's victory against Malene Helgo to give Czechia a 2-0 win in the Group D tie, eliminating Norway, which fell to 0-2 this week.



Mensik held his nerve late in both sets, earning a crucial break at 5-5 in the opener before serving for a one-set advantage. Mensik later rebounded from failing to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set. He trailed 3/5 in the second-set tie-break, yet won five of the next six points to survive. The winner of last year's ATP Masters 1000 event in Miami, Mensik crushed a forehand pass cross-court when facing a set point at 5/6 in the second-set tie-break.



“First match of the season, it's never easy,” Mensik said during his on-court interview. “It's been a great fight. I'm grateful for the win. I managed in both sets to find the power at the end, that was the most important thing.”



At 20 years and four months, Mensik is the second-youngest man to record a singles win in United Cup history, behind an 18-year-old Stefanos Sakellaridis in 2023. The World No. 18 in the PIF ATP Rankings improved to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Ruud, whom Mensik beat at last year's Australian Open in the second round.



Mensik crushed 16 aces and won 78 per cent of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, compared to Ruud's 56 per cent.

Earlier, two-time major singles champion Krejcikova scored a winning United Cup debut in a 6-4, 6-3 triumph over Norway's Helgo.



The former World No. 2 comes into the 2026 WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz season ranked No. 65 in the PIF WTA Rankings after another bout with injury to close 2025. She reached the quarter-finals of the US Open in September, a watershed moment in her season that only began in May after dealing with a recurring back injury.

Krejcikova then unfortunately dealt with physical problems again, suffering a knee injury against McCartney Kessler in the third round of the China Open. She retired from that match, later revealing her injury was worse than previously thought. Krejcikova also retired from her first match at the WTA 125 in Limoges in December. 



Krejcikova's season-opening match against World No. 532 Helgo proved to be an ideal return.



“I didn't play for a long period, and the injury that I had was really tough and very unfortunate,"" Krejcikova said. ""I'm really happy that I'm here, that I can play, that I can enjoy it, that I can compete, and I'm really happy that I can finally finish a match.""



Helgo, 26, has punched above her weight in the United Cup in the past. She pushed both Caroline Garcia and Donna Vekic to three sets in 2024 and took advantage of a slow start by Krejcikova to open up an early 3-1 lead. 



But then, Krejcikova, who played the one-hour, 38-minute match with supportive wrapping on her left knee, erased a break point opportunity in a five-deuce fifth game and righted the ship by winning eight of the next nine games.



“The knee is better. It took some time, but it's improving every day and I'm very happy with that,"" Krejcikova said.



Australia and Czechia are both 1-0 in Group D action. Mixed doubles between Czechia and Norway is up next at Ken Rosewall Arena.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Why Mensik made Krejcikova shout at the television","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/mensik-krejcikova-united-cup-2026-feature","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 06:41:07 GMT","

When Jakub Mensik was 16, he reached the 2022 Australian Open boys' singles final. The Czech pushed his match against Bruno Kuzuhara deep into a third set, but ultimately suffered full-body cramp in the final game of the match, losing a heartbreaker. Watching at the time was Barbora Krejcikova, now a two-time major singles champion and Mensik's United Cup teammate.

“I was definitely following him since he was cramping in Australia a couple of years ago,” Krejcikova told ATPTour.com, cracking a laugh. “I was following him since then, and I'm really happy that he's making such progress and that he's doing great, and he's very talented.”

Nearly four years later, Krejcikova and Mensik are trying to claim the United Cup trophy for their country for the first time. The Czechs made a perfect start Monday, easing past Norway 3-0.

After Krejcikova earned her opening victory, she was watching a television feed of Mensik's match. The 20-year-old battled past Casper Ruud in two tight sets.

“We were sitting in our little office in there. We were shouting at the TV and really pumping him up,” Krejcikova said. “I'm really happy that he won.”

Krejcikova is a big tennis fan who enjoys watching many matches. She was happy to get a close look at Mensik, the 2025 Miami ATP Masters 1000 champion.

“What I definitely love about his tennis is the serve,” Krejcikova said. “Overall today I was able to watch him a little bit more, because I mean, the Tours are separate, and we don't really have the opportunities to spend as much time together.

“Today was amazing. I think he was playing unbelievable, and he was serving really well during the important points. He was passing so many times. It was unbelievable.”





Mensik hit 16 aces against Ruud according to Infosys ATP Stats, helping him take a 2-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead against the Norwegian.

“I think just the way how he hits it, how compact his serve is,” Krejcikova said. “I feel like he's tossing the ball every single time the same way, so that's something unique. It's something that is very tough for me, so actually, I would love to have his serve.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Kokkinakis: ‘I didn't care if I never played again, I wasn't doing that cycle anymore'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/kokkinakis-return-feature-brisbane-2026","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:34:04 GMT","

Thanasi Kokkinakis did not expect a first-round doubles match at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ could move him to tears.

But it did just that. The 29-year-old Australian, who underwent a radical and unprecedented pectoral surgery in February, is back competing on home soil in Brisbane, where he teamed with Nick Kyrgios to earn a three-set win over Matthew Ebden and Rajeev Ram.

“I've never really teared up from a doubles match, even when we won,” Kokkinakis said. “What I have gone through the past 12 months is crazy, speaking to a lot of surgeons, a lot of doctors. I spoke to Rafa's doctor and he wasn't quite sure what was going on. It was pretty crazy.”

For much of the past year, Kokkinakis had been trapped in a frustrating medical grey area. Chronic issues around his shoulder and chest left him in pain but without a clear diagnosis or treatment plan, forcing him to bounce between specialists while his season slipped away.

“No physio or doctor that I saw was really comfortable and confident of which was the right way to go,” he said. “But I said I didn't want to keep doing what I was doing. In the past I'd play one match and maybe have a big win, and my arm was shot for the next couple of rounds. I was almost like ‘I don't care if I don't play again, I'm not doing that again', because it's almost like a tease of what I can do and then I just have to pull out.”

That cycle — flashes of form followed by forced withdrawals — ultimately pushed Kokkinakis toward a drastic decision. After years of managing damaged tissue, he agreed to undergo a surgery few tennis players had ever attempted.

“I essentially cut half my pec off,” explained the former No. 65 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. “I had a bald scar tissue that I was playing with for five or so years. I saw a bunch of surgeons that didn't want to operate on it. They thought it's risky, never been done in tennis. Essentially I have an Achilles allograft — or a dead person's Achilles — in my arm trying to attach my pec to my shoulder.”





The unprecedented nature of the procedure made the comeback process even more daunting. Unlike common knee or ankle injuries, there was no established route back in, no familiar timelines, and no peers who had walked the same path.

“It's really hard coming back from that process, because you don't really have anyone to speak to because no one's done it,” said Kokkinakis. “A lot of people do ACLs and Achilles ruptures, which are brutal, terrible injuries. But with those, a lot of people have had them, so you know who to speak to and what to do.”

Even reaching the start line in Brisbane required careful management. Kokkinakis acknowledged that simply being fit enough to contest doubles felt like a milestone after months of stop-start progress.

Throughout the long rehabilitation, the Australian summer remained his motivation. Kokkinakis has fond memories of this period, having won his sole ATP Tour title in 2022 in Adelaide, the city where he was born.








“There's a lot of unknowns, but I have just done a lot of training to try and get myself in a position where I can even play a doubles match,” Kokkinakis said. “It's been very stop/start. I don't know how my future is going to go, what it holds, but I've done everything I can to give myself at least a chance. I'm taking it day by day.”

The Aussie endured isolated winter training sessions in Melbourne with the vision of returning to court in front of home fans.

“I was so sick of training, and just being in Melbourne in the winter with no one to really train with and trying to motivate myself for the Aussie summer,” Kokkinakis said. “That was always the carrot at the end, just trying to look forward to that moment, not knowing if I can actually play.

“Just doing everything I can. Endless injections, cortisones, trying to get myself to a spot where I can take the court. It's a feeling that is very hard to replicate. I'm not taking it for granted, and I know that's what I will miss the most when eventually I stop playing.

“All my rehab and everything I was doing was focused on trying to get back in front of a crowd in Australia and being competitive. So I'm really, really happy.”

The United States has qualified for the United Cup quarter-finals in Perth after a complicated group-stage victory over Spain Monday.

World No. 9 Taylor Fritz had to save a match point against Jaume Munar to keep alive the defending champion's hopes of topping Group A after Coco Gauff suffered a shock three-set loss to World No. 42 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in the day's opening match. 

The United States' conquest of Group A was only complete when Gauff found redemption on the mixed doubles court, partnering Christian Harrison to a 7-6(5), 6-0 win over Inigo Cervantes and Yvonne Cavalle-Reimers after they rallied from an early break in the first set. Spain has now been eliminated from the tournament.

In the second match of the day, World No. 9 Fritz saved a match point in a do-or-die clash with Munar, who would have sent Argentina to the quarter-finals had he upset the American.

Seeing his first break points of the match at 5-6 in the third, Fritz failed to convert both match point opportunities and later saved a match point on his serve in the tie-break before winning 7-6(4), 3-6, 7-6(6) in three hours and 14 minutes.  

""It was a crazy match,"" Fritz said. ""I thought Jaume played very well. I felt I was in a lot of his service games but he played so well on so many of the big points.

""I had to come up with a lot to keep myself in the match or convert any of the big points. It was really tough, really physical.""

Fritz took a seven-minute medical time-out at 4-all in the third set to treat a bloodied toe after a long slide chasing a drop shot. He saved a break point in the following game.

The United States won Group A with a 2-0 record after its initial win over Argentina. Had they lost the mixed, the Americans would have finished runner-up in Group A and would only have claimed a quarter-final berth if they had a better record than the other two Group runners-up.

Fritz came into the tournament after intensive rehab in the offseason on his knee for what he described as “pretty serious  tendonitis”. But he didn't give an inch to Munar in a series of lengthy baseline exchanges. He also fired 16 aces to add to the 22 against Baez. 

""The knee is something I'm going to be dealing with for a while,"" he said. ""... I started feeling it towards the end of the first set but it didn't get any worse. Typically I start feeling it and it gets worse and worse and worse until I can't even bend it. So I'm really happy with the fact that it stayed at the level it was at and it wasn't bad enough to stop me from playing through.""

Jessica Bouzas Maneiro is coming off a breakout 2025 season in which she set a career-high ranking of No. 40, reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time at Wimbledon and made her first WTA 1000 quarterfinal in Montreal.

On Monday at the United Cup, the Spaniard carried that momentum into 2026, upsetting World No. 4 Coco Gauff in dominant fashion, 6-1, 6-7 (3), 6-0 at RAC Arena. The loss is Gauff's first at the United Cup in 10 matches across singles and doubles; she entered the day 6-0 in singles and 9-0 overall. 

The win marks Bouzas Maneiro's first career Top-5 victory.

 “I know Coco and she's a fighter,” Bouzas Maneiro said after the match. “She's there all the time in the match, so I knew that I had to be there, and even if I'm 4-1 up, I have to be there. And yeah, she won the second set and I went to the bathroom and I was trying to focus just to take it point by point. 

 “And that was my mentality in the third set. To be [there] with power every point because even if you are [up] 3-0 or 4-0, you have to be ready.” 



Bouzas Maneiro set the tone immediately, breaking Gauff in the opening game en route to a 5-0 lead. She went on to break the American in all four of her service games in the first set and nine times overall. 

Her forehand -- which produced 11 winners in the match -- fueled her early surge, but her return game, paired with Gauff's serving struggles, defined the rest of the match. It was a stark contrast to Gauff's dominant performance earlier in the week against Argentina's Solana Sierra. 

Gauff landed just 60% of her first serves and won just under 60% of those points. She was further undone by 14 double faults and 54 unforced errors. Bouzas Maneiro could only match Gauff's first-serve numbers but managed her unforced errors more effectively (41) and converted 9 of 12 break points. 

Still, Gauff refused to go quietly despite her struggles. She rallied from 4-1 down to take the second set in a tiebreak and appeared poised for a remarkable comeback. But Bouzas Maneiro broke to open the decider and never looked back, racing to a 4-0 lead after saving two break points in a five-deuce game. 

After 2 hours and 12 minutes, Bouzas Maneiro closed out the match with a third-set bagel, earning a bit of redemption after being blanked in a deciding set by Sierra earlier in the week, and secured the biggest win of her career.

Coco Gauff bounced back from her singles defeat by partnering with Christian Harrison for the clinching mixed-doubles win as the United States eliminated Spain from the United Cup.

Coco Gauff redeemed herself on the mixed-doubles court to send the United States into the United Cup quarterfinals in Perth on Monday, teaming with Christian Harrison for a 7-6 (5), 6-0 win over Inigo Cervantes and Yvonne Cavalle-Reimers. The pair rallied from an early break in the opening set, and the result eliminated Spain from the competition.

Earlier, World No. 9 Taylor Fritz saved a match point against Jaume Munar to keep the defending champions' hopes alive after Gauff lost the opening singles match in three sets to World No. 42 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro -- the biggest win of Bouzas Maneiro's career by ranking and an early jolt to Gauff's 2026 season on the WTA Tour driven by Mercedes-Benz.

The comeback ensured the United States topped Group A and advanced.

United Cup: Scores | Standings

""Obviously it wasn't a great match for me,"" Gauff said to reporters on the defeat to Bouzas Maneiro. ""I tried my best to fight back with what I had in that moment. Once it was over, I kind of just sat in the bathroom for a little bit -- I had a lot of confidence in Taylor -- so I was just trying to make sure that I was ready for mixed.

""I think that's the beauty of this event that you have other people could pick you up on your off days.""

Taking the court after Gauff's three-set loss, Fritz knew the defending champions would not win the group if he dropped his second match of the tournament, having already lost his opener to Sebastian Baez.

Fritz earned his first break points of the match at 5-6 in the third set but couldn't convert either match point. He then saved a match point in the deciding tiebreak before closing out a 7-6 (4), 3-6, 7-6 (6) victory in 3 hours, 14 minutes.

""It was a crazy match,"" Fritz said on-court. ""I thought Jaume played very well. I felt I was in a lot of his service games, but he played so well on so many of the big points.

""I had to come up with a lot to keep myself in the match or convert any of the big points. It was really tough, really physical.""

Fritz took a seven-minute medical timeout at 4-all in the third set to treat a bloodied toe after a long slide chasing a drop shot. He saved a break point in the following game. Fritz is hoping for a repeat of last year's United Cup run, when he also dropped his opening match before winning four in a row to guide the Americans to their second title in three years.

He entered the tournament after intensive offseason rehab on his knee for what he described as ""pretty serious tendonitis,"" but he didn't give an inch to Munar in a series of grinding baseline exchanges. The World No. 9 also fired 16 aces, adding to the 22 he hit against Baez.

It was a monumental effort from Fritz, required only because Bouzas Maneiro -- who enjoyed a breakout 2025 highlighted by her first Grand Slam fourth round and a career-high ranking of No. 40 -- stunned Gauff earlier in the day.

Seemingly intent on carrying her 2025 breakthrough into the new season, the Spaniard upset Gauff in convincing fashion, 6-1, 6-7 (3), 6-0, at RAC Arena. It was Gauff's first United Cup loss in 10 career matches across singles and doubles; she entered the day 6-0 in singles and 9-0 overall.

The victory marked Bouzas Maneiro's first career Top 5 win and gave Spain a 1-0 lead over the United States ahead of the men's singles match between Fritz and Munar.

""I know Coco and she's a fighter,"" Bouzas Maneiro on-court said after the match. ""She's there all the time in the match, so I knew that I had to be there, and even if I'm 4-1 up, I have to be there. And yeah, she won the second set, and I went to the bathroom and was trying to focus just to take it point by point.

""And that was my mentality in the third set. To be [there] with power every point because even if you are [up] 3-0 or 4-0, you have to be ready.""

Bouzas Maneiro set the tone immediately, breaking the World No. 4 in the opening game en route to a 5-0 lead. She went on to break the American in all four of her service games in the first set and nine times overall.

Her forehand -- which produced 11 winners in the match -- fueled her early surge, but her return game, paired with Gauff's serving struggles, defined the rest of the match. It was a stark contrast to Gauff's dominant performance earlier in the week against Argentina's Solana Sierra.

After 2 hours and 12 minutes, Bouzas Maneiro closed out the match with a third-set bagel, earning a bit of redemption after being blanked in a deciding set by Sierra earlier in the week, and secured the biggest win of her career despite her country's elimination.

""It's just good to experience those pressure moments early in the season, especially since this is my only event before Australia,"" Gauff said. ""I would prefer to win in straights, but it doesn't hurt to go three -- more so when you're on the winning side of it.""

Barbora Krejcikova steadied after a slow start to take the opening point before Jakub Mensik backed it up with a composed win over Casper Ruud, as Czechia completed a sweep and eliminated Norway from United Cup contention.

Two first-time United Cup participants -- Barbora Krejcikova and Jakub Mensik -- led Czechia to a win over Noway at the United Cup in Sydney on Monday.

Two-time Grand Slam singles champion Krejcikova triumphed over Norway's Malene Helgo to give Czechia an early 1-0 lead in Group D Sydney action, before Mensik clinched the victory by downing fellow Top 20 star Casper Ruud 7-5, 7-6(6). Krejcikova, alongside Adam Pavlasek, won mixed doubles to secure the sweep. 

United Cup: Scores | Standings

Former World No. 2 Krejcikova comes into the 2026 WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz season ranked No. 65 in the rankings after another bout with injury to close 2025. She reached the quarterfinals of the US Open in September -- a watershed moment in a season that only began in May after dealing with a recurring back injury.

But as quickly as she was healthy, Krejcikova was dealing with physical problems again after she suffered a knee injury against McCartney Kessler in the third round of the China Open. She retired from that match, later revealing her injury was worse that previously thought, and also retired from her first match at the WTA 125 in Limoges in December. 

A season-opening a match against World No. 532 Helgo proved to be just what the doctor ordered for Krejcikova to find some match fitness -- and to shake hands healthy.

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

""I'm very excited I can be here, that I can play, that I'm fit to play, that I can start the season from the beginning, which last year I wasn't,"" Krejcikova said to reporters. ""I'm also really happy that I'm part of this event, this nice competition where we have a team. I think we have a really good atmosphere on the team, and it's been working really well.""

The 26-year-old Oslo native has punched above her weight in United Cup in the past -- she pushed both Caroline Garcia and Donna Vekic to three sets at the event in 2024 -- and she took advantage of a slow start by Krejcikova to open up an early 3-1 lead. 

But after the Czech, who played the 1 hour, 38-minute match with supportive sleeve on her left knee, erased a break point opportunity in a five-deuce fifth game, she righted the ship by winning eight of the next nine games and never trailed again.

""The knee is better. It took some time, but it's improving every day and I'm very happy with that,"" Krejcikova added at her on-court interview. 

Making his United Cup debut and playing his first match of the season, Mensik's win also eliminated Norway, which fell to 0-2 this week.Mensik held his nerve late in both sets, earning a crucial break at 5-5 in the opener before serving for a one-set advantage. Mensik later rebounded from failing to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set. He trailed 5-3 in the second-set tiebreak, yet won five of the next six points to survive. The winner of last year's ATP Masters 1000 event in Miami, Mensik crushed a forehand pass cross-court when facing a set point at 6-5 in the second-set tie-break.“First match of the season, it's never easy,” Mensik said during his on-court interview. “It's been a great fight. I'm grateful for the win. I managed in both sets to find the power at the end, that was the most important thing.”

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

At 20 years and four months, Mensik is the second-youngest man to record a singles win in United Cup history, behind an 18-year-old Stefanos Sakellaridis in 2023. The World No. 18 in the PIF ATP Rankings improved to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Ruud, whom Mensik beat at last year's Australian Open in the second round.Mensik crushed 16 aces and won 78% of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, compared to Ruud's 56%.Australia and Czechia are both 1-0 in Group D action, and will face each other Jan. 6 at Ken Rosewall Arena in Sydney.

In 2019, Novak Djokovic co-founded the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) with fellow ATP Tour competitor Vasek Pospisil.The initiative officially launched at the height of the pandemic during the 2020 US Open, with Pospisil proclaiming, “The PTPA did not emerge to be combative, to disrupt, or to cause any issues within or outside the tennis tour. Simply to unify the players, have our voices heard & have an impact on decisions being made that effect our lives & livelihoods.”

After careful consideration, I have decided to step away completely from the Professional Tennis Players Association. This decision comes after ongoing concerns regarding transparency, governance, and the way my voice and image have been represented.

More than five years since the PTPA officially took shape, Djokovic has announced he is fully severing ties from the organization after revealing the two sides no longer share common ground.“After careful consideration, I have decided to step away completely from the Professional Tennis Players Association. This decision comes after ongoing concerns regarding transparency, governance, and the way my voice and image have been represented,” Djokovic wrote on X Sunday evening.“I am proud of the vision that Vasek and I shared when founding the PTPA, giving players a stronger, independent voice - but it has become clear that my values and approach are no longer aligned with the current direction of the organization.“I will continue to focus on my tennis, my family, and contributing to the sport in ways that reflect my principles and integrity. I wish the players and those involved the best as they move forward, but for me, this chapter is now closed.”

“I will continue to focus on my tennis, my family, and contributing to the sport in ways that reflect my principles and integrity. I wish the players and those involved the best as they move forward, but for me, this chapter is now closed.”

Ten months ago, the PTPA filed an antitrust lawsuit that named the ATP and WTA Tours, International Tennis Federation (ITF) and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) as defendants.The men's tour responded by stating, “We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position. ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game - towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans.”Before forming the PTPA, Djokovic served as ATP Player Council president from 2016-20.The 38-year-old is coming off a year where he reached the semifinals of all four Grand Slam events and surpassed 100 career titles. Djokovic is due to make his 2026 debut at the Adelaide International ahead of this month's Australian Open.We'll continue to monitor this developing story.

Stan Wawrinka may be wondering what he got himself into when he announced his 2026 retirement tour. At this rate, it may not last until the end of January. Over the last two nights in the United Cup, the 40-year-old has played two marathon three-set matches against significantly younger opponents. He won the first, over Arthur Rinderknech, 7-6 in the third, and almost won the second, against 23-year-old Flavio Cobolli, before finally running out of gas at the finish line and falling by the same score.Elsewhere, it was a fairly one-sided night in the team competition. Germany beat the Netherlands 3-0, Canada beat China 3-0, Great Britain beat Japan 2-1. The most notable non-Stan result may have been Naomi Osaka's second straight defeat, to 276th-ranked Katie Swan, who was filling in for an injured Emma Raducanu.What's next in Sydney and Perth? Here's a look at Monday's lineup. Stan, it seems safe to say, will be happy to have the night off.

Elsewhere, it was a fairly one-sided night in the team competition. Germany beat the Netherlands 3-0, Canada beat China 3-0, Great Britain beat Japan 2-1. The most notable non-Stan result may have been Naomi Osaka's second straight defeat, to 276th-ranked Katie Swan, who was filling in for an injured Emma Raducanu.What's next in Sydney and Perth?

Jakub Mensik vs. Casper Ruud: The 20-year-old Mensik is one of the bigger question marks of the coming season: Will he be the guy who won a Masters 1000 in Miami, or the guy who failed to make another semifinal the rest of the year? He'll start his 2026 with a high-profile encounter against Ruud, who looked good in a win over Alex de Minaur two nights ago. Mensik won their only previous meeting, at the Australian Open last year.Alexander Zverev vs. Hubert Hurkacz: The Pole returns to the court after knee surgery ended his 2025 early. Zverev leads their head to head 3-1.Iga Świątek vs. Eva Łys: On paper, Świątek should have a smooth start to her new year. She has played Lys three times and surrendered just seven games in total. But the 23-year-old Ukrainian-German is improving.

Anisimova, who fell in the first round of Auckland a year ago, stays at 6,287 ranking points, while Gauff, who led Team USA to the United Cup title a year ago, sees her points drop from 6,763 to 6,273.And so, Anisimova is now the highest-ranked American player on either the ATP or WTA rankings, with Gauff now the second-highest-ranked American player.

PERTH, Australia (AP)—Coco Gauff dropped a post on social media just before she started her United Cup singles match Monday, hoping to add context to her recent comments about American tennis fans.The match didn't go well for the No. 4-ranked Guaff, who lost the first five games and struggled in a 6-1, 6-7 (3), 6-0 loss to No. 42 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in Perth.It gave Spain a 1-0 lead over the defending champion U.S. team in the Group A contest. But then Taylor Fritz saved a match point on the way to winning the men's singles match and Gauff combined with Christian Harrison in the mixed doubles to clinch victory for the Americans.""I‘m going to clarify because people are dragging this out of context,"" Gauff said in the pre-match morning social media post, referring to the ""worst"" comment she made earlier at the tournament when comparing support for players from smaller countries with the kind of support American players receive on foreign soil.

""Those from smaller countries come with their colors and flags and it is clear on who they are supporting."" Gauff said in her post. ""I was just speaking from my perspective. I understand the financial aspect of things and know tennis is not accessible for everyone, it was more of a comment for those who are already attending and how I wish they were as passionate as those from other countries.""The 21-year-old Gauff, a two-time major winner, said her initial comments were in response to a question at a news conference.""I was asked and it was simply an observation I noticed about other countries vs. mine that is all,"" she said.

She added that at previous team events she'd noticed that players from other countries get more animated support from their fans than the American tennis players do, but attributed that to the U.S. sports fans having so many successful teams and athletes to support.Guaff said there was always good support for the Americans from fans who travel to the Australian Open in Melbourne, ""but I would like to see some more Americans if we make it to Sydney (United Cup finals) in Sydney than there were last year.""The U.S. team is 2-0 after wins over Spain and Argentina and has clinched a spot in the quarterfinals.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

Why you should be excited for the 2026 Formula 1 season

Cadillac Team Principal Graeme Lowdon tells F1.com about why Zhou Guanyu was the ideal candidate for their reserve role, the ‘good chemistry' amongst the squad's drivers and how the team are gearing up for their ‘really intense' first season.

Two months before the team make their debut on the grid at the Australian Grand Prix, another name has been announced as part of Cadillac's driver line-up for 2026, with Zhou Guanyu joining the American outfit as their reserve driver.

Following the signings of Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez as race drivers last summer, the squad have continued to add to their wider roster, having recruited former IndyCar racer Colton Herta as test driver while their line-up of developments drivers includes previous Haas reserve Pietro Fittipaldi.

Zhou has now joined the group off the back of a season spent acting as a reserve driver for Ferrari, which followed on from his three-year spell on the grid with the Alfa Romeo/Kick Sauber outfit.

Cadillac made no secret of wanting experienced names on board when it came to signing the race drivers for their first-ever campaign in Formula 1, and Team Principal Graeme Lowdon admits that this was also a key draw of signing Zhou.

“You'll see from the race driver selection that, as a new team, we've put a lot of emphasis on experience and driver experience, and clearly Zhou is very, very experienced,” Lowdon tells F1.com following the announcement.

“He's had three years of racing in Formula 1, and so, unlike some of the other candidates – who may well have very good credentials in the junior formula and are looking perhaps to get a foothold into Formula 1 – the key thing for us, throughout the entire driver line-up, is to work with very, very experienced people who can contribute to the overall programme.

“I think it's very easy to underestimate just what is needed to bring a new team into Formula 1; as you know, Formula 1 is unbelievably competitive.

""It's highly complex, it's such a big step from any other formula, and so having drivers throughout the whole driver programme who just know exactly what they're doing – and none of this is new to any of them, apart from the fact it's a brand-new team – is really, really important. That played a big factor in the selection of Zhou.”

Zhou's recent experience of working with Ferrari – who will supply Cadillac's power unit and gearbox in 2026 – also went in the Chinese driver's favour during the process of selecting a reserve.

“I have a lot of respect for Ferrari,” Lowdon explains. “It's a team we've worked with before in the past; I know the people there very well. I know just how highly they valued Zhou's input in 2025, which was another big factor for us.

“It also means that, in some way, that Zhou staying in that overall family, he's had experience of development and experience of the 2026 tyres, and also just experience in operating in a top-class, very competitive team.

“So from our point of view, it just ticked all of the boxes in so many ways; the experience, the direct experience with Ferrari, who are our partner for the power unit and the gearbox, and so it just made a lot of sense for him to join the team.”

The move will also see Zhou reunite with Bottas, his former Kick Sauber team mate with whom he shared a good relationship – and this proved to be another element that appealed in bringing the 26-year-old onboard.

“Another factor that we look for is the chemistry between all of the drivers, and we know already that the relationship between Checo and Valtteri is a really strong one – and I have no doubts as well that in selecting Zhou, based on seeing how he's worked with Valtteri over the last few years, that that working relationship would be very conducive to the overall goals of the team,” says Lowdon.

“It kind of goes without saying that these guys are all very, very fast. We've said it a number of times before that we select all of the drivers in our programme on merit. We would have no qualms about any of these drivers getting in the car and racing in a Formula 1 Grand Prix.”

While Zhou will not be on the grid in 2026, Lowdon – who has worked with Zhou as part of the Chinese driver's management team – has stressed how crucial the reserve role is for Cadillac, particularly in terms of preparing for this season's new wave of technical regulations.

“Having a good, experienced reserve driver just adds that little bit extra to – or adds a lot extra, actually – to just how fast the team can both gel together and compete,” he explained.

“That's another element I should mention; I've known Zhou for a while, so I know he's very, very committed. He's very much a team player, and that's absolutely what we need as a new team. He's very respectful and technically extremely knowledgeable and extremely good.

“He has a very good feel for the car, and also a very good feel for what we think are the elements of racing that are going to be important in 2026 with all of the new regulation changes.”

Prior to selecting Zhou for the position – in which his duties will include working closely with Bottas and Perez along with the wider engineering team, providing technical insight and carrying out simulator work – the team went through what Lowdon described in the announcement of Zhou's signing as a “thorough” process in choosing the right candidate.

When asked about what this involved, the Team Principal responds: “It actually goes back some time to when we were also looking at the selection of the race drivers for 2026. We spoke to a lot of drivers.

“We are out of synchronisation with a lot of the other teams in terms of driver contracts, and so that actually meant that we had quite a lot of time to meet people, talk about different people's plans and just really select the best line-up that we can for 2026.

“We've talked to a lot of drivers within the TWG and GM family, there are an awful lot of drivers as well, so we actually have direct relationships with a whole bunch of drivers. And that just gives us a really good opportunity to look at what is the best line-up going forward, not just in 2026 but looking ahead beyond that as well. I'm really, really happy with the overall line-up that we've got.”

That line-up will see Zhou work alongside Herta, who will embark on his maiden F2 season as well as acting as Cadillac's test driver. Does Lowdon expect Zhou's experience to be beneficial in supporting the American racer?

“I would hope so,” says Lowdon. “All formula move on year to year, but also there are elements that stay in the DNA of a particular formula, and obviously Formula 2 is a formula that Zhou competed in very successfully, and so I would hope that he'd be able to impart some of that knowledge onto Colton.

“They're team mates now, and everybody wants everyone within the team to do well, so I would hope that that's going to be an advantage. These are younger guys, still with plenty of Formula 1 opportunity ahead of them, both of them, so I can see that being a really productive relationship.

“There's no kind of competitive issue here. Zhou is the reserve driver – he has a super licence, he's the guy who would jump in to replace one of the race drivers if needed. Colton doesn't have super licence – he qualifies as a rookie, therefore he can do FP1 sessions that Zhou can't do.

“So there's some real synergy here, and I'm looking forward to working with a whole group of drivers – race drivers, reserve, test, sim drivers – all working together with the objective of maximising the potential of this brand-new team.”

As Lowdon touched on, Zhou still has the potential to make a return to the grid in the future; indeed, the driver from Shanghai spoke earlier last year of holding the long-term goal of making an F1 comeback.

In terms of what the future holds for the team's new reserve driver, Lowdon believes that the position offers an ideal opportunity to keep Zhou at the “forefront of people's minds in Formula 1, both in his role now and also potential opportunities for the future”.

“It's incredibly difficult to get race seats in Formula 1 – we all know that,” he concedes. “But the best way to do that is to demonstrate speed and ability as a team player, and if you're not actually on the grid racing, then the next best platform to be able to do that is as a reserve driver.

“We've seen that with Valtteri as well, in the position he's had at Mercedes in the last year. It means that you stay relevant, you stay connected. You understand exactly what's happening day to day with Formula 1, and in Formula 1 change is just at such an incredible rate all of the time that that's really important as well.”

For now Zhou's focus will be on settling in at Cadillac as the squad get ever nearer to their debut, which will involve him spending time with his new team mates.

“It's quite interesting at the moment, because it's literally only kind of in this last week that everybody's contractually free,” smiles Lowdon. “They've done all of their commitments from the previous teams, and so there's a real kind of start of school term feeling, and I think that exists amongst the drivers as well.

“They all know each other really well. They'll all be together in the next few days with various activities, some engineering, some promotional, some marketing, and that gives them a chance to get to know each other further. But I think there's no shortage of interaction between them all and, as I said before, it's a really good chemistry mix.

“Everyone knows what their role is. Everyone knows what they need to do. There's a real opportunity for everyone to excel and do well, and for the team to benefit from that as well. So I think going forward into 2026, I generally think we've got a really, really strong roster of drivers throughout the entire team.”

Lowdon describes the current mood in the camp as being the “normal mixture of excitement” along with the acknowledgement that “there's a lot of hard work ahead”, adding: “This is going to be a really, really, really intense season for the team, but it's just a massive opportunity for everyone involved.

“It doesn't happen very often that you get a chance to have a new team coming into Formula 1, so if people weren't excited about that, then you'd have to have serious questions asked! But equally, everyone's experienced and so there's a recognition that we're not just here for fun. We're here to deliver the most competitive new team that we possibly can, and we know it's not easy.”

A few months ago, Lowdon set out Cadillac's initial target as being to “execute as well as we possibly can and gain respect from the other competitors”. With more of the pieces having since fallen into place, does that goal remain the same?

“Yeah, very much,” Lowdon answers. “We can't control what the other teams are doing or what they've done during the post season. It's been a very short post season as well. There's so many changes for 2026 that it's impossible to predict the hierarchy.

“What's clear is that the challenge that we've had as a new team is really very unique, because we're just doing everything for the first time, and that is an enormous challenge which shouldn't be underestimated, and I think people should recognise that when they're looking at what the expectation for a new team actually is.

“We're racing against teams where the youngest team on the grid has still a decade of Formula 1 racing experience or so, so I think that should set some expectation. But what we want to do is execute the things that we can control as well as we possibly can and measure ourselves against that.

“And if we do that, we know that over time, we will build what we all want, which is a very competitive Formula 1 team. But to coin the American phrase, it's not our first rodeo for anyone involved, and so we have a huge respect for the task ahead.

“It's super, super difficult, but we focus on what we can control and what we can do. Work as hard as we can and, the harder we work, hopefully the more competitive we become.”

Why you should be excited for the 2026 Formula 1 season

McLaren will enter the new Formula 1 season with another big-name arrival to bolster their leadership ranks.

Will Courtenay has started his new role as McLaren's Sporting Director in the build-up to the 2026 season, following an early release from Red Bull.

Courtenay represented Red Bull from their first F1 season back in 2005, having joined the Milton Keynes-based operation under the previous Jaguar guise.

He rose through the ranks to Head of Race Strategy, before McLaren secured his services in a deal originally announced back in September 2024.

“His experience, professionalism and passion for motorsport make him the ideal candidate to lead our F1 sporting function,” said McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella at the time.

“We are now entering a key phase in our journey as a team, and we are confident that he will be a great addition to our strong leadership team as we strive to continue challenging for wins and championships.”

Red Bull subsequently stated that Courtenay remained part of their team and would “see out his contract until mid-2026”, but his release has been brought forward to the start of this year.

“I'm happy to share that I'm starting a new position as Sporting Director at McLaren Racing!” Courtenay confirmed on his LinkedIn profile.

“After 22 years at Red Bull Racing, the last 15 as Head of Race Strategy there, I'm excited to say I'm now embarking on a new challenge, joining the McLaren Racing Formula 1 Team as Sporting Director.

“I'd like to say a huge thanks to everyone I worked with at Red Bull. I made so many great friends there and I hope I'll still see many of you in the paddock. It was an incredible two and a bit decades.

“But now I'm looking forward to settling into my new role and team, and hopefully making plenty more new friends, as I do my very best to help McLaren continue its recent success in the coming years.”

Courtenay will reunite with former Red Bull colleague Rob Marshall at McLaren – the latter having joined the Woking-based team as design chief at the start of 2024.

All the red carpet looks from Ariana Grande and more Sunday night at Santa Monica Airport's Barker Hangar.



		By Laurie Brookins, Tristan Cassel 

	January 4, 2026 4:00pm	



Will the reshuffling of the event calendar enhance the anticipation for Sunday night's kickoff of the 2026 awards season? That question is among many that promise to be answered as the red carpet opens for the 2026 Critics Choice Awards, taking place at the Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport.

For the first time in nine years, the Critics Choice Awards has leapfrogged to the front of the awards season schedule, enabling this organization of film, TV and streaming journalists to help set the narrative for the coming months and perhaps nurture a buzz for films and actors in contention for the season's most coveted trophies. That includes Timothée Chalamet for Marty Supreme and Leonardo DiCaprio for One Battle After Another, as well as Jesse Buckley for Hamnet and Amanda Seyfried for The Testament of Ann Lee. (Keep up with the winners as they are announce live.)

It's also the first opportunity to get a sense of who will emerge as the year's most-discussed style stars on the awards season red carpet. Frankenstein's Jacob Elordi and Sentimental Value's Elle Fanning traditionally scored best-dressed nods for their sartorial choices during previous seasons, but One Battle After Another's Teyana Taylor also should top many lists, as the actress is firmly a designer favorite who's worn Balmain and Tom Ford by Haider Ackermann in recent months.

Ultimately, from high-profile films and TV shows to viral moments in high fashion, a variety of game plans and campaigns will be established Sunday night at the Barker Hangar. Here's a look at all of the night's arrivals, which The Hollywood Reporter will update throughout the evening.

The ‘Marty Supreme' star took his time onstage, saying, ""I don't know if I'll be up here again.""


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	Timothée Chalamet scored his first win of the 2026 awards season, taking home the award for best actor at Sunday's 2026 Critics Choice Awards.


	The 30-year-old Marty Supreme star looked extremely surprised when his name was called, leaning over to kiss girlfriend Kylie Jenner.




	The actor has been earnestly upfront about his desire for recognition in this role, which he carried over into his awards speech. “I got a lot of people to thank. I don't know if I'll be up here again, so give me a second,” Chalamet told the gathered crowd as he went down his list of those to thank.

	Chalamet was visibly shaken by the win, stumbling over his words a few times. “Damn, I'm more nervous than I thought I'd be,” he said, correcting his mistake.

	The actor thanked his fellow nominees, singling out Michael B. Jordan in particular. “Michael, man, unbelievable. Just rewatched Sinners. [I] hadn't seen the after-credit scene. I'm happy I stuck around the second time.” 


	He also thanked Marty Supreme director Josh Safdie for “crafting a role and a story” for him. “You made a story about the relatable dream and you didn't preach to the audience about what's right and wrong. I think you should all be telling stories like that, so thank you for this dream,” he said. 


	Given the pair have been attending more events together, it's no surprise Chalamet thanked long-term girlfriend Kylie Jenner, the camera panning over to the reality star while he spoke. “Thank you to my partner of three years. Thank you for our foundation,” he said. “I love you. I couldn't do this without you.”

	











	The couple didn't attend Sunday's pre-show carpet, arriving after the show had already begun. Hacks' Paul W. Downs and Meg Stalter were the talk of the night thanks to their outfits, which were an exact match to Chalamet and Jenner's looks at the Marty Supreme L.A. premiere.


	The 31st Critics Choice Awards ceremony aired live from Santa Monica's Barker Hangar on E! and USA Network. The list of the 2026 Critics Choice film and TV nominees can be found here. Check out the stars' arrivals and looks.

He also appeared in ‘Cinderella Liberty,' ‘The Day of the Dolphin' and ‘The Front Page' and spent the past 17 years teaching at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Jon Korkes, the veteran character actor and acting teacher who worked for director Alan Arkin in Little Murders on stage and screen and portrayed the doomed turret gunner opposite him in Mike Nichols' Catch-22, has died. He was 80.


	Korkes died peacefully in his New York apartment on New Year's Eve, his cousin Nancy Drinkwater told The Hollywood Reporter.




	In other notable '70s films, Korkes played an undercover bad guy in Nichols' The Day of the Dolphin (1973) and a reporter in Billy Wilder's version of The Front Page (1974), and he showed up in Mark Rydell's Cinderella Liberty (1973) and Larry Peerce's Two-Minute Warning (1976) as well.

	For television, he appeared on everything from All in the Family to Law & Order: Criminal Intent and recurred as corrections officer Tom Robinson on six episodes of Oz during the HBO drama's final three seasons (2001-03).


	In 1968, Korkes was working as a reader in auditions for Jules Feiffer's off-Broadway production of Little Murders when he was cast by director Arkin to play the brother of Marcia Rodd's character in the Fred Willard-starring black comedy about unrelenting decay in New York City.


	He reprised the role of Kenny Newquist alongside Rodd (and other returnees Vincent Gardenia and Elizabeth Wilson as their parents) in the 1971 Fox film version that also was helmed by Arkin and starred Elliott Gould in Willard's role of a photographer.


	In perhaps his most notable part — though his screen time was limited — he portrayed the young turret gunner Snowden, whose slow, bloody death haunts Arkin's bombardier Capt. John Yossarian throughout Catch-22 (1970).

	











	As a teacher at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting in Manhattan from 2008 until November, Korkes “brought decades of experience across film, television and theater into the classroom, meeting each student exactly where they were,” reads a statement from the school on Facebook. “He loved teaching, and his students knew it.”


	For him, it was all about paying it forward. “Nichols and Arkin and Feiffer and all those people started me. They were like the slightly older kids who let me play ball with them, and they showed me things and they didn't kick me out,” Korkes said in a video on the school's website. “You don't forget that.”


	Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on Dec. 4, 1945, Jonathan David Korkes was raised in nearby Marblehead, where he graduated from Marblehead High School. He made his onscreen debut as a small-time crook in The Out-of-Towners (1970), directed by Arthur Hiller and starring Jack Lemmon in another movie about a crumbling New York.


	Meanwhile, he appeared on Broadway in 1969 in The Penny Wars, directed by Barbara Harris, and in 1971 in the one-act Unlikely Heroes.


	Korkes' résumé also included the movies The Outside Man (1972), Between the Lines (1977), Jaws of Satan (1981), Getting Away With Murder (1996), Riding in Cars With Boys (2001) and The Double (2013) and stints on TV on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Rookies, The Larry Sanders Show, Homicide: Life on the Street and three Law & Order series.


	He also taught a master class for actors in Rio de Janeiro.

Chelsea Handler returned to host the annual ceremony for a fourth consecutive year. The critics organization has added four new categories to this year's celebration of the best in film and TV: In addition to casting/ensemble, the other new categories are best variety series, stunt design and sound.

'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' won best talk show over Stephen Colbert's 'Late Show,' 'Late Night With Seth Meyers' and 'The Daily Show,' with Kimmel joking the other shows, save Sean Evans' 'Hot Ones,' ""did not care enough to be here with you tonight.""


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast


Jimmy Kimmel said he was surprised to win best talk series at the 2026 Critics Choice Awards, but he still came equipped with a number of sharp barbs and a comically long written acceptance speech, which he unrolled onstage.


	Kimmel quipped that he would have preferred a “FIFA peace prize,” referring to the award President Donald Trump received at the, now renamed, Kennedy Center during the World Cup draw last month.




	After that, Kimmel unrolled a comedically long written acceptance speech as he said he “really didn't expect this,” and thanked the critics, calling out three specific reviewers by name, including Jeffrey Howard from KCLV-TV in Las Vegas, whom Kimmel, a Sin City native, said he went to high school with.

	He went on to thank “our friends at Disney,” naming CEO Bob Iger, entertainment co-chairman Dana Walden and even OpenAI boss Sam Altman, who, Kimmel said, “who now owns my voice and face. Please don't do anything weird with it.”


	Kimmel's remarks about Altman appear to be a reference to Disney's recent $1 billion investment in OpenAI that included striking a licensing deal with the Altman-run AI powerhouse. The latter agreement would allow users of OpenAI's Sora to create clips using characters from the Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars franchises.


	Kimmel was nominated alongside his late night competitors The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Late Night With Seth Meyers, The Daily Show and Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen as well as YouTube's Hot Ones. Kimmel joked that his fellow nominees, save Hot Ones‘ Sean Evans, who was shown onscreen laughing at Kimmel's acceptance speech, “did not care enough to be here with you tonight.”












	Of Evans, Kimmel joked that one day he'd be “the only one left.” Questions have emerged in recent months about the future of late-night TV after CBS canceled The Late Show for what the network claimed were financial reasons. Meanwhile, Trump has gone after Colbert, Kimmel and Meyers, saying they all should be taken off the air.


	Kimmel's win comes after ABC briefly suspended him this fall after he made comments about Charlie Kirk's killer that led Trump's FCC chair to threaten ABC affiliates' licenses.


	Since returning to the air, Kimmel and wife and co-head writer Molly McNearney, who joined Kimmel onstage Sunday night, have spoken out in support of free speech, and Kimmel took time on Sunday night to address the issue and Trump.


	“Thanks to all the writers and actors and producers and union members, many of you who are in this room, who supported us, who really stepped forward us and reminded us that we do not take free speech for granted in this city or in this country,” Kimmel said. “Your actions were important, and we appreciate them.”


	He later added, “Most of all I wanna thank our president, Donald Jennifer Trump. Without whom, we'd be going home empty-handed tonight. So thank you, Mr. President for all the many ridiculous things you do each and every day. It's been a banner couple of weeks, and we can't wait to get back on the air tomorrow night to talk about them.”

The album vaults 14-4 as holiday titles flee the top 10.

	Keith Caulfield



Olivia Dean's The Art of Loving reaches a new peak on the Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Jan. 10) vaulting 14-4, as holiday titles flee the region post-Christmas. The latest chart reflects the tracking week of Dec. 26 through Jan. 1.

	All charts dated Jan. 10 will be posted in full on Billboard's website on Jan. 6.


The Art of Loving debuted at No. 8 on the chart dated Oct. 11, climbed to its previous No. 5 high on the Nov. 22 chart, and spent its first 11 chart weeks in the top 10. It only got pushed out of the top 10 in the last two weeks due to the avalanche of returning catalog holiday albums that typically crowd the top 10 during the final weeks of the holiday season. Last week (Jan. 3 chart, reflecting the Dec. 19-25 tracking frame), there were a record seven holiday albums in the top 10.


	Now, on the latest chart, with all holiday albums departing the top 10, the region readjusts to normal business, and many non-holiday albums jump back up the list, including The Art of Loving.


	Concurrent with The Art of Loving's climb on the Billboard 200, its lead single “Man I Need” spends its second week at No. 1 on the Pop Airplay chart (dated Jan. 10). It also holds at its No. 5 high on Adult Pop Airplay for a third week and climbs 14-13 to a new peak on Adult Contemporary, while also ranking in the top 25 on Dance/Mix Show Airplay (21-18, a new peak), Adult R&B Airplay (up a spot to a new peak, No. 22), Rhythmic Airplay (holding at its No. 22 high).

Mickey Rourke has launched a GoFundMe campaign as he faces a possible eviction from his Los Angeles home after allegedly falling nearly $60,000 behind on rent.


	According to The Hollywood Reporter, the fundraiser was organized by Rourke's friend and a member of his management team, Liya-Joelle Jones. The campaign went live on Sunday (Jan. 4) with a $100,000 goal and raised just over $1,500 within its first six hours.

	The GoFundMe page states that Rourke has given his “full permission” for funds to be used to “help cover immediate housing-related expenses” and prevent eviction. The campaign describes a period of prolonged financial and health struggles following the actor's decision to step away from Hollywood at the height of his career.


	“At the height of his success, he stepped away from Hollywood in search of truth and authenticity, choosing risk over comfort,” the campaign reads. “Boxing—real and punishing—left lasting physical and emotional scars, and the industry that once celebrated him moved on quickly.”


	The page continues, “Fame does not protect against hardship, and talent does not guarantee stability. What remains is a person who deserves dignity, housing, and the chance to regain his footing.”


	Speaking to THR, Jones said, “Mickey is going through a very difficult time right now, and it's been incredibly touching to see how many people care about him and want to help.”

	











	According to People, Rourke was served a notice on Dec. 18 demanding payment of $59,100 in back rent or that he vacate the property within three days. The notice was reportedly posted on the home and mailed to the actor because he was not present at the time. 


	A complaint filed on Dec. 29 alleges that Rourke “failed to comply with the requirements of” the notice.


	The three-bedroom, 1,600-square-foot home was rented under a lease Rourke signed in March 2025 for $5,200 per month, which was later increased to $7,000. In addition to back rent, the landlord, Eric Goldie, is reportedly seeking attorney fees and the forfeiture of the rental agreement.


	Rourke began renting the home shortly before pursuing legal action against Celebrity Big Brother UK over an alleged pay dispute following his exit from the series in April 2025. At the time, his manager Kimberly Hines said in a statement shared with People that the show had disrespected the actor and failed to compensate him as agreed.


	“There's no question that when Big Brother booked Mickey Rourke, they were fully aware of both his public persona and how it aligned with his Hollywood rebel image,” Hines said, adding that producers knew his presence would be “explosive, controversial and attention-grabbing — and that's exactly what they got, and more.”

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	On the heels of Mayor of Kingstown‘s bloody Season 4 finale, the Paramount+ crime drama starring Jeremy Renner has been renewed for a fifth. It will be the final installment of the series, created by Taylor Sheridan and Hugh Dillon, and will consist of eight episodes, down from 10 for Seasons 1-4, with recent cast addition Edie Falco returning alongside Renner.


	This is the first ongoing Sheridan series to set an end date since the regime change at Paramount+. In the months following Skydance's acquisition of the streamer's parent Paramount Global in August, Paramount+ has ordered new seasons of Sherdian's Landman, Tulsa King and Lioness. (Paramount's new streaming chief Cindy Holland in August called the the Taylor Sheridan universe “a really great foundation” for Paramount+; in October, the prolific creator set a 2029 move to NBCUniversal.)

	











Mayor of Kingstown has been a solid draw on Paramount+. It also has steadily improved its standing with critics, going from 33% on Rotten Tomatoes for Season 1 to 100% for the most recent fourth season featuring Emmy winner Falco as a new lead opposite Oscar nominee Renner.




			Watch on Deadline

	Still, Mayor of Kingstown‘s ratings performance has not been on the level of other Sheridan dramas, especially recently. Season 4 of Mayor of Kingstown overlapped with new seasons of Landman (Season 2) and Tulsa King (Season 3) being released on Paramount+. Both Landman and Tulsa King have charted on Nielsen's weekly Top 10 of streaming originals, with Landman also making waves as a Top 3 series on the overall Nielsen chart.

	











	Meanwhile, Mayor of Kingstown, which — like most Sheridan series — is expensive to make, has not broken into Nielsen's originals Top 10 with its fourth season having done so with previous installments.


	Still, it is a Paramount+ legacy show being part of the Taylor Sheridan universe, which led to the decision to pick up a final season, with a six-episode order reportedly discussed before the two sides settled on eight installments. 


	In Season 4 of Mayor of Kingstown, Mike's (Renner) control over Kingstown is threatened as new players compete to fill the power vacuum left in the Russians' wake, compelling him to confront the resulting gang war and stop them from swallowing the town. Meanwhile, with those he loves in more danger than ever before, Mike must contend with a headstrong new Warden (Falco) to protect his own while grappling with demons from his past.


	The season ended with the gang war in Kingstown escalating to a violent climax in the finale. Sheridan and Dillon will now have eight more episodes to examine the aftermath and tell the rest of the story, which Dillon previously shared they had been prepared to take to seven seasons.


	“[Sheridan] has an ending for it in Season 7. Whether it goes that far or that's where we get [who knows], but he has an ending, and everyone knows about it,” Dillon said in a Screen Rant interview last year. “Our goal is to get to that Season 7, because that's as far as we can get, because that's where he's always had it. 15 years ago, he had it. 15 years ago, ‘So, here's how it's starting, Mitch is going to get killed off in the first 10 pages, and season 7, episode 10, this is where Mike's going to be.”


	Mitch, played by Kyle Chandler, was Mike's (Renner) older brother who was famously shot dead in the series' opening episode.


	In addition to Renner and Falco, the latest season stars Lennie James, Laura Benanti, Dillon, Taylor Handley, Tobi Bamtefa, Derek Webster, Hamish Allan-Headley and Nishi Munshi.


Mayor of Kingstown is produced by Paramount Television Studios, 101 Studios and Bosque Ranch Productions. Sheridan executive produces with Dillon, Renner, Antoine Fuqua, David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Michael Friedman, Dave Erickson, Christoph Schrewe, Wendy Riss, Evan Perazzo and Keith Cox. Erickson also serves as showrunner. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.

I hope the s5 is as ‘satisfying' as Sheridan etc is claiming
The original vision of 7 seasons is gone
Take Yellowstone second part s6(?) when Costner was killed off
What a fg mess that was IMHO.

Why in the world would you end a show when it's top of the list?? It's a great show but the 10 shows every year or more is ridiculous. Go back to what really is the standard 20-23 weeks a season. You completely lose interest after that short a season and that long between seasons. Keep it on the air and fix it!!

Not surprised. Glad they get to wrap things up though.

I have a feeling this has more to do with Jeremy Renner's back problems than with ratings. I hope he continues to recover from his accident.

Love the show by far my favorite on Paramount.

	With everything now “Rightside Up” for Netflix's Stranger Things, the streamer is ready to take viewers behind the scenes of Season 5's production in a documentary arriving Jan. 12.


	Directed by Martina Radwan, the documentary will dive into the years of work on the final season of the Duffer brothers' supernatural coming of age series. The MakeMake Production is produced by Angs Wall, Terry Leonard and Kent Kubena.


	The trailer for the film, released this morning, teases an emotional Matt and Ross Duffer wrapping up the Netflix tentpole show that took 10 years to make. Shots of the cast crying also bring home the reality of saying goodbye to characters they gave a good chunk of their lives to.

	











	“Writing the last lines that these characters would ever say,” one brother (Matt?) says at the beginning of the clip. “It was really hard to do.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“There was a debate in terms of Eleven's fate,” he adds later as he can be seen saying “God I don't know how to play this. Is she really gonna go through with this?”


	Right after that, Millie Bobby Brown can be heard saying “I'm not ready to let go.”


	Radwan spent a full year on set with Matt ad Ross Duffer, documenting their creative process along with cast and long-time collaborators.

	“I'm endlessly grateful to the Duffer Brothers for trusting me with a front-row seat to this incredible journey. Being able to get close and watching them bring this beloved show to life in real time, was pure joy. I only wish I could travel back and document Seasons 1 through 4,” she said. “Everyone welcomed me with remarkable generosity, openly sharing their personal and collective experiences from a decade of creative filmmaking, always pushing the boundaries. The Duffers inspire everyone to be better, including myself, their process and the show represents everything I love about filmmaking.”

	











	The series finale rang in 2026 on New Year's Eve arriving both on the streamer and in theaters. After about an hour or so of action in their last battle with Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) and a supersized Mind Flayer, the original Hawkins crew got their somewhat happy ending with The Party graduating from high school as the class of 1989 and the young adult characters heading off to college but meeting back up to share their lives. Hopper (David Harbour) proposed to Joyce (Winona Ryder) and suggested they move to Montauk, Long Island in a nod to the original title and setting for what became Stranger Things.


	See behind-the-scenes stills from the documentary below and watch the trailer above:

Business Editor


Amazon is overhauling the Fire TV interface in an effort to reduce the time viewers spend searching for streaming content.


	Along with the new UI, the tech giant is also releasing the Ember Artline, a “lifestyle TV” designed to showcase artwork and photos.


	The twin announcements were made Monday as CES ramps up in Las Vegas. The main exhibits start Tuesday, but Monday's docket is full of panel conversations and corporate events.


	In a blog post, Amazon said the Fire TV revamp aims to be “cleaner, faster, and better organized, helping customers spend less time searching and more time watching.” It cited research from Nielsen subsidiary Gracenote indicating that U.S. streaming viewers spend an average of 12 minutes searching for something to watch, up from 10 1/2 minutes in 2023.

	With the new Fire TV, it is “faster and easier to find movies, TV shows, sports, news, and live content,” the blog post said, giving the example of a user browsing movies. In that use case, titles from all apps the viewer uses are displayed. Amazon's own research found as much of a 20% to 30% boost in search speed with the new interface.

	The number of apps Fire TV users can pin to the home screen is increasing from six to 20.


	The Ember Artline is a 4K QLED TV whose matte screen is just an inch-and-a-half thick and is designed to display art and photos with reduced glare.


	The set also has far-field microphones enabling voice commands, and also has an “ambient experience” that turns on and off when people enter or leave the room. More than 2,000 pieces of free art are provided with the Ember Artline, with an AI feature helping owners get help from the set itself, with recommendations for artwork that will match a given room's style and decor.

Managing Editor


	Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters leads the way with 13 nominations for the 2026 Annie Awards, followed by Pixar's Elio with 10. Disney Animation Studios' Zootopia 2 and Gkids' Little Amélie or the Character of Rain are next with five each.


	Those four titles will compete with DreamWorks Animation's The Bad Guys 2 for the marquee Best Feature Prize. Up for Best Feature – Independent are Arco, I'm Frankelda, Lost In Starlight, A Magnificent Life and Scarlet. See the full list of noms below


ASIFA-Hollywood revealed its Annie noms in 32 categories on Monday. Winners will be feted during the 53rd Annie Awards ceremony on February 21 at UCLA's Royce Hall.

	











	Since the Best Animated Feature Oscar category was launched in 2002, 14 of the 23 winners of the Annies' marquee Best Feature prize – and seven of the past 13 – went on to claim the golden statuette. But last year bucked the trend as the Academy Award went to Flow over The Wild Robot, which dominated the 2025 Annies with seven nods. Flow, however, did win the Annie for Best Independent Feature back in February, along with Best Writing.

	After the runaway success of The Last of Us and A Minecraft Movie, the studios have been aggressive with video game IP, but there is plenty more out there.


	British research firm Ampere Analysis has dug deep into the world of gaming to come up with what it believes are the four next titles ripe for adaptation. 


	Ampere floated BAFTA 2024 best game winner Baldur's Gate III, Black Myth: Wu Kong, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Sons of the Forest as the quad of video games that could be coming to a big or small screen next, noting that they each have “strong popularity,” are “recent releases,” and  contain “distinctive worlds.”

	Off the back of a super five years for video game IP, Ampere searched through the gaming archives leading on eight key characteristics to come up with its list. Characteristics included a defined narrative, adaptation style, franchise popularity and addressable audience. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Studios have moved quickly to secure the biggest and most obvious game franchises, but our research shows there is still significant untapped potential in the market,” said Ronald Santa-Cruz, Research Manager and Games Subject Matter Expert at Ampere Analysis. “For studios willing to look beyond the usual suspects, there remains a strong pipeline of game IP that could translate into the next major transmedia success.”


	Some of the biggest shows and movies of the previous few years started life as video games and Ampere said commissions of IP have increased by an average 30% since 2019. Major studios, including Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, Netflix, Comcast, and Amazon have already secured rights to 10 marquee game franchises, with the likes of Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter and Legend of Zelda all coming up.

	











	Driven by the recent success of high-profile titles such as The Last of Us and A Minecraft Movie, the market has shifted decisively towards live-action adaptations and away from animation, added the research firm. In 2025, 69% of commissioned adaptations were live action, more than double the share from the previous year. In the second half of 2025 alone, 18 new game adaptations were commissioned, with 78% of these live action.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Kylie Jenner wears sultry vintage Versace chainmail as boyfriend Timothée Chalamet wins Critics' Choice Award","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/05/style/kylie-jenner-wears-versace-chainmail-dress-for-2026-critics-choice-awards-with-timothee-chalamet/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:27:00 GMT","

Kylie Jenner is kicking off awards season with a bang.

Attending the 2026 Critics' Choice Awards on the arm of boyfriend Timothée Chalamet Sunday night, the reality TV star and beauty mogul chose a vintage Versace look for the occasion.

Jenner chose a metallic lace and chainmail gown from Versace's Fall/Winter 1996 collection, making the vintage piece a year older than the 28-year-old makeup mogul.

Jenner's gown featured a low bustier neckline, sheer black lace down the sides, with spaghetti straps that crossed at her back.

The archival piece hails from Tab Vintage and, while currently unavailable on the popular store's site, there is a similar listing on 1st Dibs for the same dress, ringing in at a whopping nearly $10,000.

The reality star kept things simple in terms of jewelry, wearing nothing but a large pear-shaped solitaire diamond ring on her left pinky finger.

Chalamet, meanwhile, wore a double-breasted Givenchy pinstriped suit and floral tie. The “Dune” actor nabbed 

Chalamet, who won a Critics' Choice Award for Best Actor in “Marty Supreme” that evening, chose a 1950s tailoring vibe, slipping into a double-breasted navy pinstripe suit from Givenchy. With a crisp white button-down, he, too, looked to the archives, opting for a vintage pink flowered tie from the design house.

While accepting his award, Chalamet thanked Jenner: “my partner of three years.”

“Thank you for our foundation,” he shared, adding, “I love you … I couldn't do this without you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”

Jenner was seen replying, “I love you,” back.

Vintage Versace chainmail seems to be her comfort choice as Chalamet's awards show date; she wore a similar look in silver to last year's Golden Globe Awards.

The 1999 gown, however, featured a dangerously low back — and the delicate look even appeared to split near her thigh.

We're expecting many head-turning looks on the red carpet from this A-list couple in the weeks to come.

Jimmy Kimmel thanked President Donald Trump during the comedian's win for Best Talk Show at the 2026 Critics Choice Awards.

Kimmel gave the pointed shoutout in his acceptance speech Sunday after “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was temporarily pulled off the air in September over his controversial remarks about Charlie Kirk's death.

“Thanks to all the writers and actors and producers and union members, many of you who are in this room, who supported us, who really stepped forward us and reminded us that we do not take free speech for granted in this city or in this country,” he said, referencing the tense time.

“Your actions were important, and we appreciate them,” he continued.

He then directly thanked Trump.

“And most of all, I want to thank our president, Donald Jennifer Trump, without whom, we would be going home empty-handed tonight,” Kimmel said. 

“So thank you, Mr. President, for all the many ridiculous things you do each and every day,” he added. “It's been a banner couple of weeks, and we can't get wait to get back on the air tomorrow night to talk about them.”

Kimmel again reflected on his suspension backstage after winning the award.

“It was almost a near-death experience for me, of course, not literally, but I did feel like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn watching their own funeral,” Kimmel shared with reporters.

He continued, “All this stuff happened and to be here and see that people reacted to it in not just a positive way, but almost a desperate way, we're like, ‘Oh boy, when they come after the comedians this is when we draw the line.'”

“We're really grateful that they drew the line at us.”

ABC's decision to suspend Kimmel's late-night show came after TV station conglomerate Nexstar Media threatened to pre-empt airings of the program over his comments on Kirk.

Prior to the show being pulled, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr threatened to launch an official probe into Kimmel and his show over the comedian's remarks that Kirk's alleged killer was a supporter of MAGA, the “Make America Great Again” political movement that backs Trump.

Kimmel, 58, claimed that the “MAGA gang” was using the conservative pundit's death as a move to gain political points.

He also slammed Trump, 79, for talking about White House renovations when reporters asked him to comment on Kirk's death.

“He's at the fourth stage of grief: construction,” Kimmel joked. “This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he calls a friend. This is how a 4-year-old mourns a goldfish.”

ABC ended the suspension less than a week later, and Kimmel tearfully insisted in his first monologue back that he never intended to “make light of the murder of a young man.”

He also praised Erika Kirk's decision to forgive her husband's accused killer, but took more more jabs at Trump.

“You almost have to feel sorry for him. He tried his best to cancel me,” he said. “Instead, he forced millions of people to watch the show.”

“That backfired bigly,” he continued. “He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this now.”

Amy Schumer feels pretty. 

The actress put her weight loss transformation on display in a slew of bathing suits over the weekend.

“My mom took these photos of me while I was packing for a trip,” the comedian captioned an Instagram carousel Sunday.

The slideshow kicked off with a smiling shot of the star in a strapless red bikini top and matching bottoms with “no makeup” and “no filter.”

The newly-single star, 44, modeled a black one-piece, a strappy purple number and a black bikini in subsequent snaps.

After showing off two dresses and a pair of pajamas, Schumer concluded the social media upload with an airport selfie.

“The last photo I'm on the trip,” she told her followers, adding that 2026 “is about self care and self love.”

The “Trainwreck” star concluded, “Let's all appreciate our health our families our friends and have the best year of our lives. Moving forward with no regrets. Just love. #notf–kingaround.”

Schumer's A-list pals gushed over her appearance in the comments section.

“You look 🔥,” model Paulina Porizkova wrote, while “Friends” alum Courteney Cox praised the “gorgeous” Emmy winner.

Schumer shared her mindset for the new year on the heels of her headline-making split from husband Chris Fischer.

Divorce speculation swirled in November 2025, with the “Last Comic Standing” alum confirming their breakup the following month.

“Blah blah blah Chris and I have made the difficult decision to end our marriage after 7 years. We love each other very much and will continue to focus on raising our son,” she wrote in December 2025, referencing 6-year-old son Gene.

Earlier that same month, Schumer cryptically clarified via Instagram that “whatever ends up happening” with Fischer, 45, had “nothing to do with” her recent weight loss.

The Golden Globe winner, notably, dropped 50 pounds with the help of Mounjaro, years after a “horrible” experience with Wegovy.

Schumer issued an apology to those “let down” by her slimdown last month, writing, “Sorry for whatever feeling it's giving you.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Daisy Ridley finds something to live for in the contemplative zombie movie We Bury The Dead","https://www.avclub.com/we-bury-the-dead-review","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:35:00 GMT","

Label a film a “zombie movie” and our genre-trained brains zip right to the question of whether it will feature fast-moving or slow-moving iterations of the undead. With that trope so embedded into the modern DNA of this particular horror subgenre, it's refreshing when a filmmaker puts it on the backburner and explores something more interior, which is what writer-director Zak Hilditch (1922) does with We Bury The Dead.

The Australian filmmaker uses the sparseness of his home country as a haunting backdrop for this intimate examination of a woman on a journey to understand her humanity. Ava Newman (Daisy Ridley) is an American, compelled to travel to Tasmania in the wake of an accidental American detonation of “something” off the coast of the remote island. More than 300,000 are now dead, and that may include Ava's husband Mitch (Matt Whelan), who was attending a corporate retreat on the island and hasn't touched base since all communications went dead. 

Adrift in a fugue state, Ava arrives on the island to volunteer, assigned to one of many body retrieval teams organized by the Australian military. Their mission is to go into all of the rural communities that are furthest away from the impact zone to remove bodies from residences so they can be buried. Ava's seemingly selfless call to action actually masks her true intention to eventually branch out on her own to find out if her husband is alive or dead. Only after she lands does she find out that there could be a third option: A by-product of this modern catastrophe is that some victims are waking up, then quickly culled by the military.

Hilditch does a fine job laying out the necessary specifics of the event, the repercussions, and the unexpected undead twist which begins more as a mystery than an overt threat. More importantly, all of the setup is used in service of Ava's physical and mental journey into this foreign reality. As she engages in the bleak, voyeuristic work of intruding into these abandoned homes to recover the dead, Ava is forced to knock on her own doors, confronting and acknowledging the unresolved complexities of her marriage. It's through a series of flashbacks framed as Ava's remembrances that the audience gets a more truthful taste of who she and Mitch were together before. A once blissful marriage is increasingly laid bare as desperately complicated and damaged by years of infertility issues, blame, and guilt.

Initially, Ridley conveys much of Ava's numbness and interior conflict through her amply expressive face, with little dialogue and to great success. The opening third of We Bury The Dead provides her a rich succession of scenes that are allowed to breathe as she finds her moorings in this disturbing wasteland of lost futures and abrupt endings. Ridley's work is supported by rich sound design which provides space for Ava's solitude while also gently building an aural tapestry for this island—which includes the spine-chilling noises associated with the “waking,” including their signature teeth-grinding. It's sparse in execution but intensely effective in conjuring immediate tension whenever they appear. 

Hilditch and his editor Merlin Eden set an unhurried pace for Ava's journey that might seem antithetical to modern horror, but it facilitates the way this place changes her—slowly, but thoroughly, so she'll be ready to face the answers awaiting her. The inclusion of two challenging male characters also allows us to see how Ava holds herself when placed under the eyes of others. With fellow body retriever Clay (Brenton Thwaites), she develops an unconventional bond as he is bracingly candid and seemingly apathetic about the death around them. His lack of social niceties allows Ava to shed the less attractive parts of her own nature. And with Riley (Mark Coles Smith), a soldier who is also mourning the loss of a spouse, comes a disturbing encounter that grounds the story in the realities of a woman traversing any landscape alone. It's the most terrifying horror sequence of the film. 

As for those awoken by this disaster, Hilditch takes the existential path. That means there are plenty of unanswered questions, but questions which bolster Ava's quest to determine what she wants out of life now that she may be alone. She's remarkably unafraid of those who now straddle the living and the dead and more intrigued by what she can still recognize in an ambling corpse, or a newly woken father that bestows one last act of love to his dead family. If these recently dead can still hold onto the best of themselves, what keeps the living from doing the same? For those looking to delve into more philosophical horror, We Bury The Dead is a thoughtful trek into the unknown. As Ava moves towards her own discovery, she ends up finding more truth in what remains unresolved—by experiencing what grief dredges up in the living.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Is there anything of Substance in this trailer for Ryan Murphy's The Beauty?","https://www.avclub.com/the-beauty-trailer-ryan-murphy-fx-ashton-kutcher","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:05:36 GMT","

Let's be clear, right up top, that the age-defying, “hotness”-imposing wonder drug in Ryan Murphy's latest FX provocation The Beauty is not The Substance. The Substance made a Margaret Qualley crawl out of your back and run around while you took a nice bathroom nap; The Beauty, as far as we can tell, just makes you look like a permanent Instagram filter—or maybe Ashton Kutcher—and is also some kind of biological zombie plague.

﻿

Still, it's hard not to draw some parallels, even as the trailer for the upcoming show puts a lot more focus on the people creating the titular, uh, product, notably Kutcher, whose character is billed, irritatingly, only as “The Corporation.” (The Corporation apparently hangs out a lot with a very contemptuous Isabella Rossellini, in what we can only assume is low-key Death Becomes Her reference; meanwhile, we're going to give the show the benefit of the doubt and not presume Kutcher was cast entirely because of his past connections with Demi Moore—although they're certainly distracting.) When the new drug starts spreading like a virus, and turning people into some kind of ostensibly hot monsters, a pair of FBI agents (Evan Peters and Rebecca Hall) search for answers, while a character billed as The Assassin (played by Anthony Ramos, with a serious assist from a goofy metal eyepatch) goes around shooting people and threatening them with little hatchets.

If the general incoherence of the above description didn't make it clear, this looks like an extremely Ryan Murphy-ass show, with Murphy, in this case, working with 9-1-1 and Glee alum Matthew Hodgson to crank up the chaos. Say what you like about it, it's undeniably energetic, in that way that some of Murphy's more deranged ideas are; Kutcher's clearly having a pretty good time, preening in exotic locales and secretive superlabs and dropping lines like “It's an STD that people will actually want.”

The Beauty debuts on FX and Hulu on Wednesday, January 21; the series co-stars Jeremy Pope, Bella Hadid, Ben Platt, Jessica Alexander, and Vincent D'Onofrio.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","One Battle After Another, The Pitt take top prizes at Critics Choice Awards","https://www.avclub.com/critics-choice-awards-2026-winners","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:39:56 GMT","

The 2025-2026 awards season had its first major event of the latter year last night. On Sunday, the 31st Critics Choice Awards were held in Santa Monica and broadcast on E! and USA, and the critics had good news for One Battle After Another and Frankenstein, in particular. The former film snagged the awards for both Best Picture and Best Director, though both supporting actor contenders Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro lost out to Frankenstein‘s Jacob Elordi. The Guillermo del Toro-directed film also snagged the awards for production design, costume design, and make up. 

Elsewhere, Timothée Chalamet earned another victory in his year-long campaign for Marty Supreme, which sure looks good for the rest of his awards season hopes. Jessie Buckley of Hamnet took home the award for Best Actress, potentially cementing her as the frontrunner of the category for the rest of the season, while Amy Madigan of Weapons woke up Monday morning with a Critics Choice Award of her own. 

On the TV side of things, The Pitt, The Studio, and Adolescence continue their own dominant streaks that began at the Emmy Awards in September. Jimmy Kimmel Live! and South Park, two shows that have frequently been in the news this year for their skirmishes with the Trump administration, took home trophies for Best Talk Show and Best Animated Series, respectively.

Amy Schumer has welcomed 2026 with optimism and a fresh outlook. Schumer's Instagram posts have been refreshingly honest as she embraces her ‘self-love' era with honesty and self-acceptance, all while keeping her signature sense of humor.

On Sunday, January 4, the “I Feel Pretty” star shared a series of makeup-free bikini photos on Instagram, offering a candid glimpse into her mindset as she moves forward personally and professionally.

The post focused on Schumer's pre-vacation trip planning, but with a twist. The 44-year-old “Trainwreck” star posted photos taken before and during a recent getaway. 

The photos showed her wearing bikinis and swimwear. “My mom took these photos of me while I was packing for a trip,” Schumer wrote. “And the last photo I'm on the trip. This year is about self-care and self-love.”

She also added in the caption that she was not wearing any makeup in the photos and chose to share them without filters.

The post wasn't just a regular one highlighting her stunning physical transformation. Schumer shared a more important message of resilience with her fans and followers. 

“Let's all appreciate our health, our families, our friends, and have the best year of our lives,” she wrote. “Moving forward with no regrets. Just love.”

Schumer addressed her split from husband Chris Fischer on December 12. “Blah blah blah , Chris and I have made the difficult decision to end our marriage after 7 years,” she wrote, as per Entertainment Weekly. “We love each other very much and will continue to focus on raising our son.

In her post, she added, “We would appreciate people respecting our privacy at this time. blah blah blah not becisse I dropped some lbs and thought I could bag s basket and not because he's a hot Janlmes beard award winning chef who can still pull some hot tail. Amicable and all love and respect! Family forever [sic].”

As the couple faces a complicated chapter, Schumer's statement focused on their mutual commitment to raising their son, Gene, whom they welcomed in May 2019.

On New Year's Eve, Schumer joked about being newly single in an Instagram Story, crossing her eyes and holding a plate of spaghetti. “Who's kissing this at midnight?” she captioned the image, as reported by Page Six.

Schumer's noticeable weight loss over the past few years has drawn widespread attention and prompted questions about how she achieved it.  While in March she confirmed using the weight loss medication Mounjaro, she has also been clear that serious health concerns drove her decision to lose weight.

She has previously explained that the change followed a medical diagnosis. 

“I had a disease that makes your face extremely puffy that can kill you, but the internet caught it, and the disease has cleared,” Schumer wrote, referencing her diagnosis, as reported by People.

In a December 1 Instagram update, she confirmed that she had lost 50 pounds and stressed that her motivation was survival, not appearance. “Not to look hot, which does feel fun and temporary,” she wrote, “to survive.”

All her recent Instagram posts suggest one thing: for Schumer, this chapter is less about weight loss and more about well-being.

Still Looks Like SHIT! LOL!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Former A-List Actor Turns to GoFundMe for Help Paying His Rent","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/mickey-rourke-gofundme-rent/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 03:55:37 GMT","

Former A-list actor Mickey Rourke has launched a GoFundMe in order to avoid eviction after falling on hard times. 

The “Sin City” actor, 73, is hoping to raise $100,000 through the crowdfunding site after falling behind on his rent by nearly $60,000.

Liya-Joelle Jones, a member of Rourke's management team, according to The Hollywood Reporter, kick-started the fundraiser on Sunday, January 4. 

“Help Mickey Rourke Stay in His Home,” the listing is titled. 

“Mickey Rourke entered American cinema like a force of nature—raw, fearless, and utterly original. In the late 1970s and 1980s, he wasn't just a movie star; he was a symbol of something rare: danger paired with vulnerability, toughness paired with heart,” the fundraiser explains. “From ‘Diner' to ‘Rumble Fish' to ‘9½ Weeks', Mickey gave audiences performances that felt lived-in, not performed, and left a permanent mark on American film culture. Mickey's life never followed a safe or protected path. At the height of his success, he stepped away from Hollywood in search of truth and authenticity, choosing risk over comfort.”

In addition to being an Oscar-nominated actor, Rourke spent decades pursuing a career as a professional boxer. According to Jones, the sport left Rourke with “lasting physical and emotional scars.”

“What followed were years of struggle not defined by spectacle, but by survival: health challenges, financial strain, and the quiet toll of being left behind,” she added in the GoFundMe description. “Today, Mickey is facing a very real and urgent situation: the threat of eviction from his home. This fundraiser is being created with Mickey's full permission to help cover immediate housing-related expenses and prevent that from happening.” 

Her listing continued, “Mickey Rourke is an icon—but his trajectory, as painful as it is, is also a deeply human one. It is the story of someone who gave everything to his work, took real risks, and paid real costs. Fame does not protect against hardship, and talent does not guarantee stability. What remains is a person who deserves dignity, housing, and the chance to regain his footing.”

As of publication, the fundraiser has surpassed the $30,000 mark. 

Rourke was served a notice to vacate the home he has been living in on December 18, 2025, according to People.

He reportedly owes his landlord nearly $60,000 in past-due rent. 

Rourke allegedly “failed to comply with the requirements of” the notice, according to court documents viewed by the outlet. The actor has been living at the property since March 2025.

He should've been paying other people's rent, with all the money he's made. That's what happens when you make bad decisions in life & squander money away. No pity here.

Oh, Boo Hoo.  A lot of other people are suffering financially and we're supposed to contribute to a go fund me account because he made bad choices?  I don't think so. I agree.  Don't feel sorry at all.

Yeah what just because he decided not to pay his rent so other people are supposed to support a grown man wrongfully not paying his rent and being freely with his money all the homeless people out there and he wants a hand out hope y'all ain't no dumb fool people scamming all day long stop 🛑 with the bullshit.

Amazing the amount of disdain and hate towards an human in need. The same ones with vitrol to spee regarding this man needing financial support,I hope none of you end up in the same situation. Unless you're wealthy everyone is a terrible situation and disaster away from losing everything they have. A paycheck away from destitute to be exact. The same frustration shown to this man should be directed at those in charge in the system supposedly decided by the people. Who very much do the exact opposite of the claims that they lie to you about changing but only benefits the very select few. Society is doomed beyond repair until the emotional and intellectual insight of others change for the greater good. Wonder why this outrage is never given to those in charge of the world when we outnumber them. Interesting.

Maybe Instead of starting a “GoFundMe” he downsides his lifestyle a notch or 2. I can almost guarantee you that he still has a private chauffeur that picks him up at his multimillion dollar home for Starbucks everyday. So maybe Mick sells the house and downsizes to a normal house and normal lifestyle instead of still trying to live like he did in the eighties. Im pretty sure if he did this that he wouldn't need a crowd funding to stay in the house hes renting or owns. If its rent maybe downsize and rent a normal spot in a smaller less expensive town. Do what all the guys still on the “A” list are doing and move to Utah or Idaho and cut your living expenses by 85% and live the rest of your days a happy old man with good memories of a past gone by but still living with dignity doesn't mean he has to be living large.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Adam Sandler Lovingly Gushes Over Wife Jackie in Emotional Awards Speech","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/adam-sandler-jackie-marriage-award-speech/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 04:50:08 GMT","

Some love stories are not meant just for the screen. For Adam Sandler, the most remarkable love story he has ever been in is his own. The actor truly believes some things in life are meant to be. 

While accepting a major career honor this weekend, the actor reflected on love, fate, and the life he might have lived had he taken a very different path. Sandler, 59, was honored with the Chairman's Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival gala on Saturday, January 3, in Palm Springs, California.

The honor celebrated his dramatic performance in “Jay Kelly,” marking a complete shift from the comedic roles that made him a household name.

The award was presented following an introduction from Laura Dern, one of Sandler's co-stars in the film. While accepting his speech, he gave a sweet nod to his loving wife of over 20 years.

During his acceptance speech, Sandler shared his most honest feelings about how his life might have unfolded had he chosen to work for his father as an electrical engineer rather than pursue acting.

“I sometimes think about it, [if] I didn't click that year and I did go work for my dad, what my life would be right now,” he said, as reported by People. “First off, I'm thinking I'd probably still be married to my wife, Jackie. That's destiny. Nothing stops that.”

He followed the heartfelt moment with humor, adding, “But we definitely [would] have a different house. Probably, like, 10 less bathrooms and [fewer] statues of me.”

Sandler married Jackie Sandler in June 2003. The couple shares two daughters, Sadie, born in 2006, and Sunny, born in 2008.

In “Jay Kelly,” directed and co-written by Noah Baumbach, Adam Sandler takes on the role of Ron Sukenick, a worn-down manager navigating the pressures of Hollywood while representing a larger-than-life movie star played by George Clooney.

The film has received strong critical acclaim and has become one of Sandler's most widely discussed performances in recent years, firmly placing him in this season's awards race. His work in the film has earned recognition from major awards, including nominations at the Critics' Choice Awards and the Golden Globes. There is a strong Oscar buzz for his performance in the film, too.

Sandler was one of several high-profile honorees at this year's festival. 

The movie also stars Miley Cyrus, Timothée Chalamet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Amanda Seyfried, Kate Hudson, Michael B. Jordan, and more. “Jay Kelly,” which also stars Dern, Billy Crudup, Greta Gerwig, Riley Keough, and Emily Mortimer.

The film is currently streaming on Netflix.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved Marvel Star Bravely Reveals She Has Brain Damage","https://entertainmentnow.com/marvel-studios-movies-comics/evangeline-lilly-brain-injury-health-updates/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:16:31 GMT","

Marvel star Evangeline Lilly is bravely opening up about her health, more specifically, the brain damage she has suffered after a concussion.

Lilly posted a video on Instagram on January 2, detailing how she had a brain scan, and the results showed her brain is functioning at decreased capacity. “It's late on January 1, the first day of 2026, and I'm entering into this new year — the year of the horse —  with some bad news about my concussion,” she said. “The results came back from the scans, and I missed every area, and my brain is functioning at a decreased capacity.”

She continued, “So, I do have brain damage from the TBI, and possibly other factors going on.” A TBI refers to a traumatic brain injury, which was caused by a head injury. “Now, my job is to get to the bottom of that with the doctors, and then embark on the hard work of fixing it,” she shared. “I don't look forward to it because I feel, like, hard work is all I do. That's OK, my cognitive decline since I smashed my face open has helped me to slow down and helped me to have a more restful finished 2025.”

The “Ant-Man” actress is taking time to slow down and focus on her health and recovery. She ended her message with a hopeful outlook, thanking fans for caring, and expressing gratitude and feeling blessed “to be able to play one more day, one more year on this beautiful living planet.”

In the caption, Lilly shared her thoughts. “Verdict's in…I do have brain damage from my tbi. Comforting to know my cognitive decline isn't just peri-menopause, discomforting to know what an uphill battle it will be to try to reverse the deficiencies,” she shared. “Thank you all for always asking, for always caring, and for your continued prayers.“

The post was flooded with loving messages from fans and celebrities. Actress Michelle Pfeiffer reacted, writing, “You are a warrior. Nothing-not even this will defeat you my friend. “ 

Alyssa Milano also showed her support. “Thinking about you,” she wrote. 

Other reactions include, “Wishing you well Evangeline,” “SO MUCH LOVE YOUR WAY!!!,” and “No Evangeline no …This is the saddest news I could have in this new year. I'm crying for you I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart, please Evangeline fight with all your strength don't give up.”

These days, “Good Will Hunting” co-writers Matt Damon and Ben Affleck do a film together just about every few years, which means that Netflix's “The Rip” is arriving right on time. The action-thriller written and directed by “Smokin' Aces” filmmaker Joe Carnahan, and starring the best-friend duo, will release globally on the streaming platform in mid-January, foregoing a theatrical run.

The logline for the film, which takes its name from a slang term for seizing illegal goods, reads: “Upon discovering millions in cash in a derelict stash house, trust among a team of Miami cops begins to fray. As outside forces learn about the size of the seizure, everything is called into question — including who they can rely on.”

Joining Damon and Affleck's seasoned Miami officers — who, based on the just-released trailer, have plenty of life left in them — are younger cops played by Steven Yeun and Teyana Taylor, who is still collecting accolades for her performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another.” 

 










“The Rip,” which is said to be inspired by real events, is billed as a “gritty, throwback action-thriller,” but it more specifically invites comparison to stunt-heavy heist films like “The Fast and the Furious” and corrupt-cop movies like “Training Day,” which makes sense given Carnahan's breakout film was 2002's Ray Liotta-led “Narc.” 

The film, which marks the first collaboration between Netflix and Damon and Affleck's production company Artists Equity, even comes complete with a femme fatale type, played by “The Flash” star Sasha Calle, who gets mixed up with the swaggering team of cops when she's present at the raid.

“The Rip,” which releases on Netflix January 16, also features performances from Catalina Sandino Moreno, Scott Adkins, and Kyle Chandler. The streamer released a sneak peek of the film on Christmas Day, and now you can watch the full trailer below.

Ryan Murphy's latest Evan Peters vehicle, “The Beauty,” is coming to FX in late January, and like all of the “American Horror Story” and “Monster” creator's projects, it promises to be a glossy affair filled with jutting cheekbones, addictive beats, and a surplus of campy vibes.  

This time, the Golden Globe-winning “Dahmer” star is playing an FBI agent who, along with his partner, played by Rebecca Hall, is sent to Paris to look into a pattern of international supermodels dying in mysterious and gruesome ways. When the agents arrive in the City of Light, they discover the existence of “a sexually transmitted virus that transforms ordinary people into visions of physical perfection, but with terrifying consequences,” according to the show's synopsis.

That leads them to a shadowy tech billionaire who goes by “The Corporation,” played by Ashton Kutcher, who has been manufacturing a miracle drug nicknamed “The Beauty.” Against the backdrop of Paris, Venice, Rome, and New York, the agents work to keep the virus from spreading further, while The Corporation tries to get his money-making injection in the hands of as many people as possible. 

 










The twisty series also stars Anthony Ramos as an assassin working for The Corporation, and Jeremy Pope as “a desperate outsider” who gets caught up in the chaos unleashed by the billionaire's Substance-like creation.  

In the first trailer for “The Beauty,” viewers get a taste of the very Murphy-esque new series and its many guest stars, which include Bella Hadid, Isabella Rossellini, Ben Platt, Jessica Alexander and Vincent D'Onofrio. The snippet opens with Kutcher and Rossellini trading barbs onboard a yacht as The Corporation celebrates his business savvy and then widens to the rest of the world in various states of unrest over The Beauty, which we find out has a serious bug or two.  

The first three episodes of “The Beauty,” which is co-written and co-created by Matthew Hodgson, air on FX and Hulu January 21, 2026. Hall, who recently played opposite Ben Whishaw in “Peter Hujar's Day,” is also set to appear in the fourth installment of “Monster,” which will focus on the murderess Lizzie Borden.

In the Oscar race, momentum is everything. “One Battle After Another” has it. 

On Sunday night, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest took home three top prizes (read the full Critics Choice winners list here) including Picture, Director, and Adapted Screenplay, but didn't sweep the table: Oscar winner Leonardo DiCaprio (“The Revenant”) lost to Timothée Chalamet star of Josh Safdie's holiday hit “Marty Supreme,” marking the movie's only win of the night. Chalamet wore a conservative suit and tie and humbly thanked his fellow nominees, a dramatic shift in tone for the actor, who has tended toward the grandiose of late.

 










Also making a strong showing at the CCAs was another Warner Bros. movie, “Sinners,” with four wins, for Original Screenplay (Ryan Coogler), Casting Director Francine Maisler, Ludwig Göransson for Original Score, and Young Actor Miles Caton (not an Oscar category). The other three could repeat at the Oscars.

Another surprise win for Warners was Supporting Actress Amy Madigan for horror sleeper “Weapons.” She beat out frontrunner Ariana Grande in Universal's “Wicked: For Good,” which went home empty-handed, along with “Sentimental Value,” whose two supporting actresses may have knocked each other out, along with “One Battle After Another” supporting nominees Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro. 

 










In a major surprise, “Frankenstein” star Jacob Elordi nabbed the Supporting Actor win, a sign of strength for both the movie and his work in it, which also picked up craft nominations for production design, costume design, and hair and makeup. “Frankenstein” was expected to duke it out in the Oscar craft categories with “Sinners,” but landing an acting CCA win was not in the bag.

Another big winner, as expected, was Jessie Buckley for her titanic performance as a grieving mother in Chloé Zhao's “Hamnet.” Buckley will likely sweep the next rounds of awards ahead of her inevitable win on Oscar night. I was sitting at the Focus Features table, where Jacobi Jupe's screen parents Mescal and Buckley consoled him after he lost Best Young Actor, the first award of the night. 

When Buckley won Best Actress, her words brought many at the table, including Zhao and Jupe, to tears. “Chloé Zhao, you have the power of telling a story and the journey that you can go on to touch the deepest parts of what it is to be alive,” she said.

Among the Netflix entries, animated feature and song winner “KPop Demon Hunters” is the clear frontrunner in those Oscar categories, and likely Best Picture contender “Train Dreams” landed a cinematography win. Netflix's “Jay Kelly” was shut out, however.

 










Steady as they go is Brazil's “The Secret Agent,” which won Best Foreign Language Film (announced before the ceremony even kicked off), and could also land Best Picture, Actor (Wagner Moura) and Best International Feature on Oscar nominations morning.

The 600 Critics Choice voters, who range across North America and abroad, often predict the Oscar winners, but not infallibly. Last year, “Anora” won just one CCA prize, but it was the one you want: Best Picture. It went on to collect five Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actress, and Editing. Best Actor Adrien Brody (“The Brutalist”) repeated at the Oscars, along with “Conclave” Best Adapted Screenplay winner Peter Straughan, as did “Emilia Perez” Supporting Actress Zoe Saldana and Supporting Actor Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain.” 

But while body horror flick “The Substance” picked up three CCA wins, for Actress Demi Moore, Hair & Makeup, and Original Screenplay, at the Oscars only Hair & Makeup took the win. 

The CCA momentum could impact the Oscar nominations voting, which begin on January 12 and ends on January 16 (nominations are announced the morning of January 22), and so will the SAG Actors Awards nominations announcement on Wednesday.

There's plenty of road ahead. The Globes will weigh in next week, where the Musical/Comedy and Drama categories change up the competition. DiCaprio still has a chance to win there, at SAG's Actor Awards and the BAFTAs, where “Hamnet” stars Buckley and Mescal could do well. “Jay Kelly” Supporting Actor Adam Sandler could return to the winner's circle with the Actors Awards and BAFTA. 

 










But Elordi and the beloved Madigan, who lost her and husband Ed Harris' Malibu home in the Palisades fire, now have wind in their sails. “Frankenstein” is hugely popular and Elordi makes a charming Oscar campaigner. And “One Battle After Another” remains formidable.

7.6

Genre:

Pop/R&B

Label:

Reviewed:

January 5, 2026

In a year with no shortage of showgirls in pop music, there's been a distinct lack of actual drama: the stuff that sends you over the edge, spiraling over a person or memory, whether real or imagined. In Cabaret, Sally Bowles exalts this quality as “divine decadence.” In Spanish, it's referred to as cortavenas. Mon Laferte now explores the concept with Femme Fatale, a diary of the tortured, fabulous archetype she's embodied across nine albums. (Laferte even played the role of Sally Bowles in Mexico City this summer.) From her past life as a metal singer turned folkloric, rockabilly solo artist through 2023's experimental Autopoiética, Laferte's music has been defined by the extreme. On her latest album, she takes the stage as a jazz singer with a renewed terror for love and hunger for life.

The languorous title track sets the stage, a standard of the old-school jazz mode in which she operates throughout the album. Laferte introduces her passion play, her skill in the art of self-sabotage, and her latest persona as “un poema en letal revolución” (“a poem in lethal revolution”). Her voice cuts through the smoky atmosphere, capable of transforming on a dime from a plea to a snarl. “Tantos años intentando descifrar quién soy/Tal vez soy esa femme fatale” (“So many years trying to determine who I am/Maybe I am that femme fatale.”) Explosive as her emotions are, this particular femme fatale spends a lot of time doing nothing, as on “Otra Noche de Llorar”: She's bored, smoking a pack a day, spending another night crying. It's a bouncy, nostalgic arrangement that could land as schmaltz. But in Laferte's hands, it's absolutely unhinged, her voice stretching toward a scream as she contemplates what it might be like to get bored of this grief.

It's impossible for Laferte's voice to ever be boring, even during a surplus of ballads that fulfill similar functions on a long album. Even when all she's doing is remembering, she preserves the joy and pain with touches that make the past feel urgent, like the slight, uncanny Auto-Tune on “Mi Hombre.” When she confronts the memory of an abuser as a coward on “El Gran Señor,” the fear in the glass-shattering note as she sings “miedo” fills the room. At the album's midpoint, “1:30” breaks the slow bolero-and-ballad structure with a frenetic free-jazz spoken poem: the actions of masturbating or making toast are interrupted by memories of “la cotidianidad de los abusos” (“the everyday nature of abuse”).” In fits and starts, the piano trails off and punctuates Laferte's shaky repetition of “mientras lloraba” (“while I cried”) as she describes writing a previous song about an abuser as a detached narrator. In looking at these same moments through multiple lenses of time and distance, she blurs the lines between person and performance.

Elsewhere, her intensity is totally jubilant. The back-half of the misery-loves-company bolero with Nathy Peluso, “La Tirana,” turns the opening line of “tengo problemas de amor” (“I have love problems”) into a party with a cha-cha-chá chorus. Laferte is determined to revel in these problems rather than be consumed by them, a reclamation of agency in a lineage of femme entertainers who performed the parts of their lives they couldn't change. As in La Lupe's “La Tirana” before her, Laferte chooses to build a world from her heartbreak in hyperreal detail. A less emotionally daring artist might turn this subject matter into something maudlin, but Laferte settles for nothing less than outrageous in her mascara-stained manifestos. “Sin locura no hay felicidad,” she scripted like a creed in a recent painting (“Without insanity, there is no happiness”).

On closer “Vida Normal,” Laferte accompanies her self-acceptance with a swinging big band. “Me vi al espejo desnuda y volví a llorar,” (“I saw myself naked in the mirror again and started crying again”) she notes. “¿Quién es esa mujer que se parece cada vez más a mi mamá?” (“Who is that woman who looks more and more like my mother?”). Here, she decides to leave behind the character of the femme fatale, to quit smoking, to lose weight, to be the best mother. After a career of amplifying extreme emotions with extreme music, Laferte now shows us both the character on stage and the girl in the mirror after the show. “Yo venceré, y tendré la vida más extremadamente normal,” she declares (“I will win, and I will have the most extremely normal life”). May we all.

	When Americans awoke on Saturday to learn the United States had invaded Venezuela and kidnapped its president, they likely expected their nation's elected officials to offer an explanation about why we had done this.


	After months of military buildup and activity in the Caribbean, it wasn't a surprise that the U.S. had finally decided to embark on a crusade to bring down Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. What was stupefying was that America's latest regime-change operation was apparently designed to leave the regime intact.


	Helpfully, President Donald Trump duly appeared with his top Cabinet officials on Saturday to clarify everything. Among the range of casus belli he offered were the drug war (“those drugs mostly come from a place called Venezuela”); immigration (“they sent everybody bad into the United States”); terrorism (“a ceaseless campaign of violence, terror, and subversion”); even the altruistic promotion of American ideals (“we want peace, liberty, and justice for the great people of Venezuela”).

	











	Oh … and oil. “As everyone knows the oil business in Venezuela has been a bust, a total bust for a long period of time. They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been pumping,” Trump said, vowing that U.S. businesses would go to Venezuela and “start making money for the country.”

	Well, pick your poison as to which of these you believe to be the real reason for the military intervention — or make up another. There are several that seem equally as plausible as anything offered: a need to counter Chinese influence in the Americas; a strategy to undermine Cuba; a balm to Trump's ego in the face of Nicolás Maduro's dancing defiance… Maybe just an uncontrollable urge to demonstrate unadulterated badassery, 'Murica-style, after decades of frustration and failure in Iraq and Afghanistan.

	











	It's in light of those failures that the most surprising thing to come out of Saturday's press conference was the outright declaration that America was taking over in Caracas.

	“We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,” Trump said, later adding: “We're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have them.”


	Many onlookers could not have been more stunned if a 'roid-raging Uncle Sam had kicked in the door and poleaxed them between the eyes with the Stars and Stripes. Here was an American president openly ordering regime change and admitting to installing a puppet — and it wasn't even being couched in diplomatic words or shrouded in high ideals. It was in the open. America is taking over Venezuela. Why? To make money from its oil. How? Well, through Delta Force and then… a shrug and a wave of the hand vaguely in the direction of the State Department.


	“[Secretary of State] Marco [Rubio]'s working on that directly,” Trump said, noting that Venezuela's deputy president — a regime loyalist — appeared to have taken over after Maduro disappeared into the night sky with several new American acquaintances. “He just had a conversation with her, and she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.”


	It was unfortunate that mere hours later, the woman in question — Venezuela's Interim President Delcy Rodríguez — denied in a televised speech that she would cooperate with the gringos. “There is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicolás Maduro.”


	Many anti-regime Venezuelans were initially thrilled that Maduro had been ousted, but were far gloomier about the fact that Rodríguez was now in charge — and that Washington's decapitation strike seems not to have taken the head off the snake, but removed a single head from a hydra. Maduro is gone, his regime is still in power.

	“This is the first time that I find myself wondering if I am on the opposite side of U.S. policy,” one Venezuela opposition activist tells Rolling Stone. “The U.S. now backs the regime, instead of opposing it,” the activist says.


	They were certain that the situation was in flux, however, saying they believed the Trump administration would deal with “whoever is easiest to manipulate, corrupt, and make deals with.” 


	“What is the strategy? Who do they want to actually be in charge?” asks a former American special operations soldier with expertise in South America, who formerly worked in the region.

	











	He says that mistrust inside Maduro's regime will now begin to peak, with top officials convinced that at least one of their compatriots is secretly working with the Americans to take charge of the country. With Maduro gone, a shakeup is inevitable and could lead to internal conflict — possibly even civil war.


	“We're in for a roller-coaster ride of pretenders to the throne. But anyone who gets in with Washington's blessing will lack legitimacy,” the special operations soldier observes, saying he believes the one thing that could really unite Venezuelans is opposition to U.S. control. “After destabilizing the country, what does Washington want?”


	What, indeed. 


	One couldn't have scripted a scenario more perfectly tailored to showcase American military might than the raid to abduct Maduro. All of the elite elements of the U.S. military and national security apparatus were brought to bear. It was an eloquent testament to the trillions of dollars America has spent on advanced weaponry, coupled with decades of hands-on experience conducting special operations.


	That Washington has tools of military power that outclass any competitor is unquestionable. The problem is that tactical victories do not guarantee strategic success. The idea that a country can simply swoop out of the blue and change another government to its liking through force of arms without complication is an illusion — see America in Iraq or Afghanistan, or Russia in Chechnya or Ukraine.


	Many commentators and critics are focused on the wider implications of the raid on Venezuela, its legality, or the idea that it will usher in a new era of realpolitik as described by Thucydides, where the “the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”


	What, such commentators ask, is to stop Russia or China from doing the same, in Ukraine or in Taiwan?


	You needn't be a cynic to think the answer to that question has less to do with the norms of international law than it does with pure military capability. Indeed, Russia tried several times to capture President Volodymyr Zelensky in the early days of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February and March 2022. It failed, at great cost to its special forces units.


	Trump's foray into Venezuela was unquestionably a military success. Its wider implications remain to be seen. But it is another step toward an unrestrained imperial presidency, actively working to dismantle a global system America itself created, as it sows chaos at home and abroad.

	











	Paper shields alone have never kept the powerful from preying upon weaker neighbors, and most world leaders cast aside legality and morality when it suits their interests to do so. Trump is not the first. The international order America has long championed is a system of double standards, hypocritically applied or cast aside to suit Washington's whims.


	That it was a system that benefited the United States is rejected by MAGA true believers. They argue that, as most nations follow their self-interest, the era of America First is at least a more honest system of international relations.

	Björk shared a note of solidarity with the people of Greenland after Donald Trump and his admin revived threats of taking over the country following the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro.


	“I wish all Greenlanders blessing in their fight for independence,” Björk wrote on Instagram Monday (Jan. 5), adding: “Colonialism has repeatedly given me horror chills up my back, and the chance that my fellow Greenlanders might go from one cruel colonizer to another is too brutal to even imagine. ‘Úr öskunni í eldinn,' like we say in Icelandic.” (That phrase translates to “From the ashes into the fire.”) 


	Though the Icelandic musician's allusion to the U.S.'s threats was clear, much of Björk's note actually focused on Greenland's relationship with Denmark. Greenland hasn't been a Danish colony since the 1950s, but it's still a semi-autonomous district of Denmark, with its own local government and two representatives in Danish parliament. Denmark also continues to control Greenland's foreign affairs and defense, and contributes more than half the country's public budget. 

	











	Iceland, Bjök's home country, also has a colonial past with Denmark, dating back to the first half of the 20th century. Iceland became independent in 1944, with Björk writing that her fellow citizens are “extremely relieved that they managed to break from the Danish” and “didn't lose our language.” 


	She went on to share two harrowing stories about Denmark's control over Greenland. One referred to a lawsuit over 140 Greenlandic women filed in 2024, accusing Denmark of fitting them with IUDs without their consent or knowledge in an effort to reduce Greenland's population. It's believed that nearly 4,500 women and girls were affected between 1966 and 1970. 

	











	“They are my age and younger … childless,” Björk wrote.

	She also mentioned the “parenting competency” tests that Denmark subjected Greenlandic people to for years, until they were finally banned last May. These tests, though frequently used in Denmark as part of child protection investigations, were criticized as inappropriate and unsuitable for the people of Greenland and other minorities. Björk's post mentioned a Greenlandic mother who saw her daughter taken from her just two hours after her birth in 2024; despite the tests being banned since then, mother and child still have not been reunited. 


	In closing her note, Björk wrote, “Dear Greenlanders, declare independence !!!! Sympathetic wishes from your neighbors. Warmthness.”

Ariana Grande offered an update on her highly-anticipated Eternal Sunshine tour while attending the Critics Choice Awards on Sunday night. 


	“I've been working on the set list for months now,” she told E! News on the red carpet outside the Barker Hangar in Los Angeles. “It's in a good place, but we'll never know until we get into the rehearsals — which are starting very soon — and we put things on their feet if it'll make sense or not.”


	When asked if she could share any details, Grande played it coy. “I want to let it be a surprise,” she said. 


	The outlet also asked Grande if she feels like she's a different person while on tour. “I think it's the same person,” she responded. “I am grateful to work and I'm excited for the tour.”

E! asks Ariana Grande if she'll incorporate Glinda in the ‘eternal sunshine' tour set list:“We'll see” pic.twitter.com/ZvjB4237Og


	Grande's tour kicks off next June with two dates in Oakland, California, before moving to Los Angeles (both the Crypto.com Arena and Kia Forum). The singer will also perform in Austin; Grande's native Sunrise, Florida; Atlanta; Brooklyn; Boston; and Montreal. She'll conclude the U.S. run with two nights at Chicago's United Center on Aug. 3 and 5. The trek will then jump the Atlantic for five nights at London's O2 arena.

	Similar to 2019's Sweetener world tour, the newly announced slate of performances will span two albums: Eternal Sunshine and Positions, the R&B opus Grande released in late 2020. “I think that I was buying myself time — I didn't want to do that,” she told the Zach Sang Show earlier this year, referring to the idea of taking two albums on the road again. “I was like, yeah, and then the album will never happen, and then the tour will never — no, no, no. I'm kidding.”

	











	In November, Grande confirmed she has no plans for another tour in the foreseeable future. “The last 10 or 15 years will look very different to the ones that are coming up,” she said in an interview on Amy Poehler‘s Good Hang podcast. “I don't want to say anything definitive.”

	She continued, “I do know that I'm very excited to do this small tour, but I think it might not happen again for a long, long, long, long, long time. I'm going to give it my all and it's going to be beautiful. I think that's why I'm doing it because I'm like, ‘One last hurrah!'”


	A couple of months after the tour wraps, the long awaited fourth movie in the Meet the Parents franchise — Focker In-Law — will hit theaters. Grande stars in the film alongside returning cast members Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Blythe Danner, and Teri Polo.

	After a clearly-effective marketing campaign, Timothée Chalamet won Best Actor at the annual Critics Choice Awards on Sunday night for his performance in Marty Supreme. 


	Chalamet took the stage at the Barker Hangar in Los Angeles to accept the award, which is voted on by a body of film critics, and used the opportunity to thank a number of people in his life for their support. He first called out his fellow nominees, including Michael B. Jordan, who was up for his dual performance in Sinners. 


	“Michael, man, unbelievable,” Chalamet said. “Just rewatched Sinners. [I] hadn't seen the after-credit scene. I'm happy I stuck around the second time.”


	He then thanked Marty Supreme filmmaker Josh Safdie for “crafting a role and a story” for him, admitting, “I'm more nervous than I thought I'd be.” 


	“You made a story about a flawed man with a relatable dream, and you didn't preach to the audience about what's right and wrong,” the actor told Safdie. “I think we should all be telling stories like that. Thank you for this dream.”

	Notably, Chalamet also thanked his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, whom he rarely speaks about publicly despite her presence with him at various film-related events.


	“Thank you to my partner of three years,” Chalamet said sincerely. “Thank you for our foundation. I love you. I couldn't do this without you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”


	As the camera cut to Jenner, she mouthed “I love you” in response.

	Chalamet went on a promotional rampage for Marty Supreme, which hit theaters on Dec. 25. Last month, he shared an 18-minute Zoom video featuring the “marketing team” for the film. During the clip, he shared his ideas for, as he put it, “one of the most important things that happens on Planet Earth this year. Marty Supreme. Christmas Day.”


	He later went on The Tonight Show to pitch audiences on why they should see the film. “This is a movie about sacrifice in pursuit of a dream,” he said. “And it's something I can relate to deeply. And we live in a bleak time, especially for young people, so this film is an attempted antidote to that. And to continue to believe in yourself and to continue to dream big and to follow your dreams and not take no for an answer. That's the spirit of Marty Supreme, out on Christmas Day.”

	The actor was also recently awarded a spotlight award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards. He was accompanied to that event by Jenner as well. 


	“At some point, I realized the film industry isn't an institution,” Chalamet said in his acceptance speech. “Great roles aren't printed on a conveyor belt. Great auteurs and directors don't fall from a tree. Every day to wake up in good health and have the opportunity to make things for the world, that's truly a gift in every sense of the word.”

Jeff Bezos seemed to get a special delivery at his $165 million home in Beverly Hills: a UFO!

The odd, futuristic structure sits on the grounds near the cactus garden. Bezos, 61, has yet to reveal the contents of the shiny installation. Some speculate it's a sauna, but it also bears a striking resemblance to a made-to-order, stainless-steel statement piece designed by Timothy Oulton Studio.

The pod was designed as a scale replica of NASA's Apollo 11 space capsule, according to the studio's website, and can be utilized as “a private VIP seating lounge, a workspace meeting capsule or a dining pod.”

Mysterious and unusual shaped clouds have been spotted in the skies in north Wales.

The quirky-shaped clouds have been described as looking like flying saucers, pancakes, lentils and have even been previously mistaken for UFOs.

Known as lenticular clouds, they are uncommon in the UK as they can only form under the right weather conditions.

Photos have been shared after they appeared last week, with Anglesey's south-west coast producing some of the most striking views.

Rare 'UFO clouds' spotted in UK skies

In pictures: Strange clouds that followed Storm Amy

The unique formations are often referred to as pancake clouds as they appear flat and are sometimes stacked together.

Their official name is lenticular clouds, originating from a Latin word meaning ""lens-like"".

People visiting Traeth Llanddwyn in Newborough were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the sight as they drifted over from the Pen Llŷn mountains.

Hikers in Snowdonia and the Llŷn Peninsula were taken aback by the clouds as they made a quick appearance only lasting for about 10 minutes.

Dove Rosalinda often hikes in Snowdonia and said she had seen UFO clouds before.

She described her first time seeing the phenomenon as ""special"" because they do not last very long.

UFO or lenticular clouds form when stable, moist air travels over mountains and creates standing waves in the atmosphere.

As the air cools, it then condenses into flat clouds, often stacking up like UFOs or pancakes.

Lenticular clouds often signify strong winds on the ground below.

The Met Office said: ""When air blows across a mountain range, in certain circumstances, it can set up a train of large standing waves in the air downstream, rather like ripples forming in a river when water flows over an obstruction.

""If there is enough moisture in the air, the rising motion of the wave will cause water vapour to condense, forming the unique appearance of lenticular clouds.""

The Met Office says pilots avoid flying near the lenticular clouds as they can cause turbulence but some experienced glider pilots like them as it is a visual representation of where the air is rising.

A reading of Emily Dickinson: Paranormal Investigator in Poe's Finest Hour comes to Portland Stage's Studio Theater this month. Performances are January 16, 17, and 18 at 7:30pm.

Join Fox Bramble for a staged reading of Emily Dickinson: Paranormal Investigator in Poe's Finest Hour, written and directed by Todd Brian Backus.

It's 1849 and New York is a gritty, grimy city filled with ghosts, ghouls, and irresponsible transcendentalists. After a string of curious incidents Emily Dickinson, New England's premier paranormal investigator, and her estranged mentor Edgar Allan Poe are on the case! Armed with esoteric knowledge and brass knuckles—not to mention a strong grasp on both blank and metered verse—they venture to Brooklyn on the trail of a horrifying new adversary.

Featuring: Catherine Buxton, Hannah Daly, Julia Jennings, Kathleen Lewis, Ronan Hope Riordan, Michael Dix Thomas, and Nate Stephenson.

Fox Bramble is a new Portland, ME theatre company interested in telling weird stories onstage, helmed by Todd Brian Backus and Beka Bryer. This staged reading will help raise funds for their debut production coming (hopefully) in Summer 2026.

COLUMBIA — An unmanned underwater research vehicle, an event center to train hospitality students and an institute centered around federal defense research are among items on South Carolina colleges' budget wish list for the coming year.

In all, public universities and technical colleges are seeking $2.3 billion in additional state aid for the fiscal year starting in July, according to a review of budget requests.

Legislators won't approve colleges' full requests, but the plans are a preview of higher education priorities across the state.

Coastal Carolina students to build satellite in state's 1st college space program



For Coastal Carolina University, those priorities include a buildout of South Carolina's first university-run space program.

Since March 2023, Coastal Carolina professors and about 80 science and engineering students have worked to plan and build a satellite. Now it's time to launch the shoebox-sized satellite into orbit, where it will circle the planet 15 times a day from roughly 1,200 miles up.

The Conway-based college is asking legislators to set aside $450,000. But the school also wants to take things a step further, with a $900,000 underwater research vehicle.

The unmanned vehicle and satellite will work in tandem collecting images and data from above and below the Atlantic Ocean and South Carolina's blackwater estuaries.

“Coastal systems are vital to the state's economy and culture, supporting fisheries, ecotourism, and economic development,” the college's request reads. “The data collected will enhance our ability to assess ecosystem resilience and provide early warnings for environmental stressors.”

Coastal Carolina scientists and students will track environmental changes driven by storms, flooding, drought, and other natural events. They'll also monitor impacts to habitats and movements of key marine species, such as shrimp, crabs, oysters, red knots, red drum, sharks, turtles, dolphins, and whales, according to the college's request.

While Coastal Carolina's request appears out of the ordinary, it's far from the most expensive.

The technical college system is collectively seeking $743 million for projects across its 16 college campuses, accounting for a third of the total newly requested. Most of it would pay for construction projects.

High-dollar projects include $80 million to move the medical campus of Florence-Darlington Technical College out of downtown Florence, giving the college room to grow its training programs in high-demand health care fields.

Midlands Technical College and Spartanburg Community College are asking for $60 million and $65 million respectively to demolish and rebuild a student center and an administrative building, according to documents provided by the state Department of Administration.

And Denmark Technical College, the state's only historically Black tech school, is renewing a $35 million request for new lab and classroom space. The college, located 35 miles east of the Savannah River National Laboratory, wants to train more of the cybersecurity and energy professionals needed by the federal nuclear research lab in an effort to attract more students and grow the school's enrollment.

MUSC Health seeks $350M for new, top-tier cancer center



Budget asks from the Medical University of South Carolina and the University of South Carolina round out the top three largest requests.

Most of MUSC's $418 million request is for construction of a top-tier cancer center in downtown Charleston, the first of its kind in South Carolina.

And about half of USC's $307 million ask would go to further the flagship university's own health care ambitions.

That includes one-time money to move the pharmacy school to the university's new medical campus that's under construction in downtown Columbia's redeveloped BullStreet District.

The school also wants annually recurring dollars to operate the new, taxpayer-funded neurological hospital and a series of clinics across the state that specialize in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

USC to establish center for civics education, following national trend



Beyond money for the medical campus, USC is asking for annual operating dollars to run a newly-formed center focused on teaching civil debate and civics lessons. It wants more money to continue a four-way, multi-year research partnership between USC, Clemson University, South Carolina State University and the Savannah River National Laboratory. And it's asking for funds to continue and expand its efforts around artificial intelligence.

Across the USC system, other major requests include a new nursing education center in Beaufort, complete with simulation labs, and the renovation of an event center in Spartanburg to train hospitality students in the Upstate.

As for Clemson, its request tallies $193 million in additional aid.

That includes $20 million for its National Security Institute, with the goal of growing the $30 million in annual research it does with the U.S. Department of Defense.

In its request, Clemson highlighted its military roots. The school, originally known as Clemson Agricultural College, opened in July 1893 as an all-male, all-white military college. It wasn't until 1955 that the school began admitting non-military students and women.

Clemson also is renewing requests for projects the Legislature either didn't fund or partially funded. That includes $60 million for next-generation computing center, $35 million for a new science laboratory and $20 million to expand a genetics research lab.

Astrobiology, while traditionally focused on understanding the origin of life on Earth and the potential for life elsewhere, offers powerful tools and insights for addressing urgent challenges on our planet.

We call for a deliberate integration of astrobiological research with applied science. Knowledge gained from biological systems and study sites on Earth that guide investigation of planetary bodies in our solar system can inform strategies for carbon capture, low-carbon energy production, waste remediation, and biotechnology.

Therefore, we argue that astrobiology must evolve to become a bidirectional science that not only explores the cosmos but also supports sustainable life on Earth.

Parts of the world are experiencing the extremes of cold at this time of year, and with low temperatures comes a shocking phenomenon: cat zapping. If you've been trying to pet your cat only to wind up both getting a miniature shock, fear not. You aren't alone.

Cats are famously tied to static electricity. Don't believe me? Just check out the leading image for “static cling” on Wikipedia (oh Cooper, what a pickle you've found yourself in). Turns out, the static potential of cats in winter comes down to two key things: your petting approach, and humidity.

A 2024 study set out to answer a key question in our understanding of static electricity – what puts the “tribo” in triboelectricity? Triboelectrification is the process through which static electricity is generated by rubbing two things together.

   

It's a well-documented phenomenon, as anyone who's ever had a balloon rubbed on their hair only for it to stick can attest to (such as dear Nosey the cat). As for why that is? It's something we've only just got to grips with.

“For the first time, we are able to explain a mystery that nobody could before: why rubbing matters,” said Laurence Marks of Northwestern University in a statement, who led the 2024 study. “People have tried, but they could not explain experimental results without making assumptions that were not justified or justifiable.”

“We now can, and the answer is surprisingly simple. Just having different deformations – and therefore different charges – at the front and back of something sliding leads to current.”

Petting a cat involves sliding your hand across their fur. As your hand moves, both your hand and the cat's fur experience different amounts of stress because of the way surfaces resist motion. This difference causes electric charges to build up unevenly along your hand and the cat's fur.

As those charges build and flow, they can suddenly discharge in the form of that static zap you feel when touching your cat. So it's not touching the cat that creates static electricity, but the sliding motion involved in petting that produces uneven charges.

   

If you've noticed more zaps between you and your cat during cold weather, it's largely due to low humidity. Cold air holds less moisture, and indoor heating dries the air even further.

Moist air normally helps static charges slowly leak away, but when the air is dry, charges linger and build up more easily. That leaves both you and your cat primed for a static zap the next time you touch.

Ergo, it's not your fault! But good luck explaining that to them.

Posted in: Amazon Studios, CBS, TV | Tagged: Jared Padalecki

Not only is Jared Padalecki (Supernatural, The Boys) suffering from a broken leg, but he also has to deal with a food delivery nightmare.



Jared Padalecki is a busy man. Along with appearing with Supernatural co-stars Jensen Ackles and Misha Collins for the fifth and final season of Prime Video and Showrunner Eric Kripke's The Boys, he has a recurring role on the hit CBS series Fire Country. In addition, Padalecki is set for Netflix's film adaptation of Katherine Center's novel The Bodyguard and has a medical drama lined up over at CBS. So, we were shocked and disheartened to leeanr from Padalecki that he's dealing with a broken leg – and based on his recent social media post, a food delivery service that isn't making his situation any better.

""Hey world. Happy new year. I have a cautionary tale about the @Favor app to hopefully save you from what I experienced over the last couple hours. Short version – I have a broken leg. So I can't drive. But, I can still eat. SO, I ordered some sushi using the @favor app, and it arrived…. But, only half of it arrived…,"" Padalecki wrote, offering that surprise health update before sharing his experience with food delivery service.

""So, my favor delivery driver went BACK to the restaurant (the other half of my order was still there), and tried to grab it to deliver it to me… He called his @favor bosses (he was on speakerphone, and the hostess at the restaurant heard every word of the conversation and recounted it to me) and they told him to NOT deliver the remainder of my order to me, even though I had already paid and tipped in full… he protested, but the 'customer service' at @favor told him to leave it alone (even though the food was there… and paid for… and I was still anxiously and hungrily waiting for it…),"" Padalecki continued.

""Long story short (and I hate that this is my first post of the year) – FUCK @favor!!!! You've revealed what you really care about. And, my attempts and calling and texting and messaging you privately only prove that you really don't give a shit about your customers. That is all. Delete @favor,"" he added, before wishing everyone a happy new year.

Hey world.
Happy new year.
I have a cautionary tale about the @Favor app to hopefully save you from what I experienced over the last couple hours.
Short version – I have a broken leg. So I can't drive. But, I can still eat.

Now that we know that the fifth and final season of The Boys will be kicking off on April 8th with a two-episode return, the speculation has shifted into overdrive. For fans of Supernatural, it will be the finish line to a 14-month wait since the news hit that Padalecki and Misha Collins would be joining their SPN fam member Jensen Ackles (aka Soldier Boy) for the final run. After learning the good news back in February 2025, Ackles, Padalecki, Collins, and others have done a nice job offering some insights into what the on-set unofficial Supernatural reunion was like and some interesting teases regarding what we can expect. To get everyone up to speed as we ready for the big build-up to the streaming series' return, we've compiled our coverage of what we've learned over the past twelve months. Following that, we're sharing a look back at our initial thoughts on the Season 5 teaser trailer after it was released to coincide with CCXP Brazil 2025.

During CCXP Brazil 2025 on Saturday, Prime Video and Kripke announced that the fifth and final season of The Boys would get underway on April 8th. In addition, we were treated to a teaser trailer that gave us a whole lot to unpack – and that's precisely what I did. Here's a rundown of some random thoughts and observations about the preview:

""We ain't survivin' this f***ing war. We are dead men walking."" MM's (Laz Alonso) words, combined with a look at just how desperate things have gotten under Homelander's (Antony Starr) rule, were a great way to kick off the teaser. It effectively drove home that this is it. Even though the odds are against them, this is the final chance to take down Homelander for good.

The Vought concentration camps were chilling, and those moments between Hughie (Jack Quaid) and Annie (Erin Moriarty), and Frenchie (Tomer Capone) and Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara), were touching and heartbreaking. I can't shake this feeling that the future might not be too bright for Frenchie and Kimiko (though I hope I'm wrong).

Speaking of Annie… or should I say mother-f***in' Starlight after that scene where she unleashes her powers. I've appreciated her growth as a leader over the past four seasons, but I really want to credit her appearances in Gen V Season 2 for really building that up in a way that made this moment feel right.

""You wouldn't be the first to throw their life away in a war. But you would be the first to save the world doing it. So how about it, you lot?"" While we loved seeing the band get back together (even if it ends up being their final one), seeing how Butcher (Karl Urban) is looking much better than when we last saw him, and how everyone seems to be more on the same page than ever before, has me curious about what leads up to that point. Remember, Butcher, didn't leave things on the friendliest of terms last season. I'm curious to see what the status of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's ""Joe Kessler"" is at this point, too.

Bonus points for that exchange between Butcher and Kimiko – serious Season 1 vibes there.

If we're being honest, Kripke won us over once we knew that Styx's ""Renegade"" was going to be in play.

Once again, Ashley (Colby Minifie) has found a way to go from the brink of death to career advancement in the snap of a finger. Or in Ashley's case, a serious injection of Compound V. Now, she's Homelander's White House Press Secretary… but still no sign of what her power might be.

Just in case Gen V Season 2 didn't make things clear enough, Stan Edgar (Giancarlo Esposito) and Zoe (Olivia Morandin) are definitely going to be major players this season. But for now, we're putting them in the ""wildcard"" category simply because Edgar is always thinking five moves ahead of everyone else.

I know a lot of folks are assuming that Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) is going the Homelander route when his eyes light up, and rightfully so, but I'm not so sure. If that moment is connected to what we just saw, it would seem he might be taking out some of Vought's stormtroopers.

Sister Sage (Susan Heyward) has a few ""GET OUT OF JAIL FREE"" cards tucked away – I can just feel it.

""A reckoning is coming."" We see Homelander standing before a frozen Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles), his father, although it's tough to say if those words are directly tied to that moment. We do know that Homelander and Soldier Boy are going to have an awkward reunion, with Soldier Boy looking for revenge on Butcher and Hughie while also have to deal with a son who's now a dictator.

Soldier Boy/Jared Padalecki Moment: It was interesting because we noticed Soldier Boy behind Jared Padalecki's character before the teaser cuts to that scene with Homelander and Soldier Boy together. Later, we see Padalecki's character in what appears to be some kind of supersuit in the middle of a very gory scene. During Fan Expo Boston (as reported by Collider) in August, Padaleck teased this about his character's connection to Soldier Boy: ""I'll say this much — my character is very excited to meet Soldier Boy.""

Those scenes involving The Deep (Chace Crawford) are interesting due to the possibilities. Is he watching sealife around him dying, without Homelander caring about it? Did The Boys and their forces launch an aquatic assault on The Deep's allies? Or is it a publicity opportunity orchestrated by Vought to make our heroes look good in the public's eye?

Even during the season finale of Gen V, and especially here, we can't shake this feeling that A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) might be making a serious heroic sacrifice?

Meanwhile, it looks like Firecracker (Valorie Curry) is becoming even more of a right-wing whackjob…

Awww… RIP Bentley Alexander, aka Terror.

Who's that with the long hair and bloody face, spitting something out that we're sure was pretty nasty.

That primal screen laster blast from Homelander was very telling – and it's safe to say that knowing who was with him in that moment would probably offer a ton of spoiler-level answers.

""Even if I have to drag your broken f***ing carcasses over the finish line, we are going all the way. No matter the cost. Till the job's f***ing done."" Butcher's words were a perfect bookend to MM's sentiments during the teaser's opening.

Who's Homelander Beating the Living S**T Out Of? Based on the expression on his face, there are so many possibilities. It's interesting to read into his pauses, too, because it vibes that this isn't someone he has just a blind hatred toward or considers insignificant. It's almost as if he's resigning himself to the fact that this has to happen.

Garland Favorito has said the U.S. government covered up the truth about the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

He's said the Israeli government — not Osama bin Laden — may have been responsible for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. And he's echoed an antisemitic claim that Jewish-controlled media have concealed grand conspiracies against the American people.

Whether it's forcing Brigitte Macron to prove that she is a woman or wildly speculating about Charlie Kirk's murder, the far-right podcaster and conspiracy theorist has millions of listeners hooked on her unique brand of dangerous misinformation. So, how has Candace Owens been allowed to become so powerful, asks Katie Rosseinsky

Removed from bookmarks

For right-wing firebrand Candace Owens, conspiracy theories are a form of “mind yoga”, a way of bending the mind “like a pretzel”. They're also extremely compelling, for her millions of social media followers and podcast listeners at least, and extremely lucrative, helping the 36-year-old American build a staggering media empire in under a decade.  

Coronavirus and the vaccines. The moon landings. Climate change. The #MeToo case against Harvey Weinstein. Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's legal battle. All these disparate subjects have received Owens's signature treatment. On her eponymous podcast, she is the queen of the “just asking questions” approach: positioning herself as an investigating crusader who is bold enough to probe the topics that she believes the mainstream media don't want you to know about. 

She is part one-woman outrage machine, part millennial version of a medieval mystic; she has certainly worked out how to cleverly monetise the human impulse to “uncover” so-called “truths” and to feel like we are somehow in possession of a secret knowledge that explains how the world works. But her latest forays into so-called “mind yoga” are tying her in ever more complex knots that set her apart from even the most fact-averse of her fellow microphone-toting far-right truthers. 

Last summer, French president Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte filed a defamation lawsuit against Owens, who has regularly and fervently spouted bizarre claims that the first lady was born male; the couple have accused her of mounting “a campaign of global humiliation” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”. Their civil suit followed separate criminal prosecutions in France against 10 people accused of making malicious comments about the first lady's gender and sexuality. On Monday (5 January), a Paris court found the eight men and two women guilty of cyberbullying, describing their claims as “particularly degrading, insulting and malicious”; their penalties ranged from cyberbullying awareness training to eight-month suspended prison sentences. 

In November, Owens made the even stranger allegations that the Macrons had attempted to orchestrate her assassination (the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group, the organisation that Owens claimed was involved in the “plot”, told French media that these allegations were fake news). 

And towards the end of last year, Owens dragged herself and her followers even further down the rabbit hole by stirring up conspiracies around the death of her one-time boss, Charlie Kirk, the right-wing activist and founder of conservative student group Turning Point, who was shot dead in September. Among her inflammatory claims? The suggestion that his death was somehow an “inside job” involving Turning Point employees. 

Her claims prompted Kirk's longtime producer, Blake Neff, to finally call Owens out for spending months “attacking Charlie's closest friends”, who, he said, “have had to endure harassment from people who have gotten whipped up by what Candace is saying”. Owens is now playing an even higher stakes game, running the risk of finally alienating one-time allies on her end of the political spectrum, while also surely aware that her most devoted core of fans will expect wilder theories to come. 

So how did Owens become one of the most influential – and arguably, one of the most dangerous – women on the internet? Her early days didn't exactly lay obvious foundations for a hard-right pivot. The third of four children, she spent her childhood in Stamford, Connecticut and, following her parents' divorce, was brought up by her grandparents. At school, she experienced racist bullying; when she was in her senior year, she received death threats from some white classmates, including the son of Stamford's then-mayor. Her family sued the Stamford Board of Education, eventually gaining a $37,500 settlement.

Around this time, she developed “an abiding interest in current affairs”, as a Tatler profile would later put it, with her political sympathies initially skewing towards the Democrats. After dropping out of a journalism degree at the University of Rhode Island, Owens interned in the fashion cupboard at American Vogue (“There was not some kind of formal hierarchy, but it was very clear that she was running the show,” a fellow intern recalled in Vanity Fair). 

She then worked her way up the ranks in administration in a New York private equity firm before co-founding a marketing agency. Dig back into the agency's blog archives, and you will find Owens mouthing off about “the bat-s***-crazy antics of the Republican Tea Party”. But her politics would soon change drastically. In 2016, she launched a Kickstarter campaign for a platform called Social Autopsy, a searchable database of internet trolls (there is, of course, a certain irony to Owens initially touting herself as some kind of anti-cyberbullying champion). 

She is part one-woman outrage machine, part millennial version of a medieval mystic

Inevitably, it stoked criticism: wouldn't this just amount to doxxing, the typically malicious act of posting another person's private details on the internet? Owens ended up on the receiving end of online hate herself, and blamed left-wing activists. “I became a conservative overnight,” she later reflected. “I realised that liberals were actually the racists. Liberals were actually the trolls.” 

Not long after, she started posting on YouTube: her first video was a sketch in which she “came out” to her parents as a conservative. Owens positioned herself as a supporter of Donald Trump, who was then in the early stages of his first presidency, and decried ideas around identity politics, structural racism and the Black Lives Matter movement. She particularly vehemently opposed any suggestion that African-Americans should perceive themselves as victims – and still does. 

Owens crossed paths with Kirk at a conservative conference in Florida late in 2017. “Within 30 seconds of seeing her on stage, I said to myself, ‘Oh my goodness, I have not seen a talent like this in my six years of politics,'” Kirk later told The Washington Post. He immediately hired her to work in communications for Turning Point, and they spent the next few years touring colleges, spreading the conservative gospel. 

Around this time, Owens launched the Blexit Foundation, an organisation encouraging a “Black exit” from the Democrats, urging Black voters to throw their support behind the Republican Party instead. Kanye West publicly supported her, writing “I love the way Candace Owens thinks” on Twitter. And she and Kirk also took their Turning Point mission overseas.

At an event in London in December 2018, Owens ended up appearing to suggest that if Hitler had simply stuck to Germany, his policies would have been “fine”. “Whenever we say ‘nationalism', the first thing people think about, at least in America, is Hitler,” she said. “He was a national socialist, but if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine.” The “problem”, she added, was that he “had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalise.” Owens would later claim that her words had been taken out of context by “leftist journalists”, and stated that there is “no excuse or defence ever” for “everything that [Hitler] did”. 

Owens left Turning Point in 2019, but her profile continued to grow and grow. 2021 saw the launch of Candace, an online show for the conservative platform Daily Wire, co-founded by another right-wing controversy magnet, Ben Shapiro; it featured sit-down interviews with the likes of Trump, but she also used her platform to weigh in on pop culture and lifestyle topics (such as her vehement belief that women should not wear leggings outside of the gym, because doing so is indicative of “the decline of our culture”). 

But in 2024, Owens parted ways with Daily Wire, reportedly over her antisemitic comments (although she would later claim this was a “smear campaign” and a “ridiculous storyline”). Owens's great talent, though, is for turning controversy into content, and it wasn't long before she returned with her own venture, a self-titled podcast. Since launching in June of 2024, its ascent has been dizzying: in October 2025, it ranked as the No 1 show across platforms in terms of downloads and views per episode, with an average of around 3.5 million downloads per show, according to analytics from Podscribe. 

The right-wing podcast sphere is booming in a way that the left can't seem to match. Just a quick glance at the US charts demonstrates the dominance of controversial conservative-skewing figures such as Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson and Theo Von. According to a Media Matters report from 2024, right-leaning online shows had nearly five times as many followers and subscribers as their left-wing equivalents. Controversy and conspiracy pay off: the more outrageous the content, the more the listeners keep coming back (not for nothing was “rage bait” announced as the Oxford Dictionary's word of the year).

It's a model that Owens has honed to perfection. Outrage drives clicks, listens and views. It keeps fans coming back. And this in turn makes advertisers sit up and take note. Her husband, George Farmer, the British son of a multi-millionaire Tory peer and hedge fund manager, oversees the business side of the operation, and told Bloomberg that her advertisers “have reported seeing returns of two-to-one on dollars spent with us, and up to five-to-one reported in some cases”. 

Her huge listener base means that the podcast can inevitably charge higher advertising rates; recent analysis from Fortune magazine suggested that her company generates up to $10m in revenues per year. And according to Farmer, only one advertiser has pulled out over the past year; the show now has almost 60 sponsors, Bloomberg reports. In 2023, her anti-trans YouTube videos were demonetised, and last year, she was temporarily suspended after violating hate speech policies, but she has since returned with a vengeance. And even if these bigger sites did ban her, she would probably follow in the footsteps of other “cancelled” right-wing figures and simply move to a new platform.

What's particularly shrewd, though, is the way Owens has a knack for throwing herself into topics that are guaranteed to creep onto your social feed. Take actor Blake Lively's legal battle against her It Ends with Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni. Owens covered the story in obsessive detail, responding to suggestions and “clues” from followers with all the zeal of a TikTok sleuth. 

Elsewhere, she borrows the aesthetic of your classic lifestyle influencer. Her website, Club Candace, doesn't exactly look like the online home of a conservative firebrand; instead of Maga red and shouty graphics, it's all swirly, cursive fonts and glowing photos of Owens. But then you look closer at the merch she's selling: the “Candace Intelligence Agency” T-shirts ($35), the “we don't know-know, but we know” sweater ($60), a slogan that gets to the heart of Owens's fast-and-loose attitude to facts, and the “conspiracy theorist” mug ($16). 

And yet with the Macron lawsuit looming, Owens may have met her match. For all the successes of her podcast, she is now facing a major legal battle. She has been asking fans to donate to her legal fund, and estimates she will need around $5m, but that feels like a conservative estimate. Should she lose, she could face millions in legal fees alone. The case of fellow right-wing podcaster and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones feels particularly pertinent here: Jones was ordered to pay around $1.4bn in total damages after the families of Sandy Hook elementary school shooting victims won two separate defamation suits against him. He has since been declared bankrupt (although he is still broadcasting).

In American defamation cases against public figures, though, the onus is on the plaintiff to prove “actual malice”, or essentially to show that the defendant knew the information they were sharing was untrue. This can be tricky to prove. In 2021, Owens was hit with a separate defamation suit by the former Republican congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik. She claimed that Owens had smeared her with false allegations of drug use, fraud and working as a “madame” in a strip club, but the case was tossed out by a judge; Klacik ended up being required to pay her $115,000 to cover legal fees. 

Using Kirk's death as another trending topic to boost her profile looks like an ill-advised move, too. Owens is far from the only podcaster to indulge in bizarre conspiracy theories, but her personal link to Kirk, coupled with her willingness to exploit that for clicks and listens, makes the whole spectacle feel extremely murky. In aiming for Turning Point, too, she risks splitting her support base. Here, she is not going after the “establishment” or the “elite”, those bogey people of conspiratorial thinking, but her own political allies. And the signs are that Turning Point are not going to let her get away with it. 

But Candace is unlikely to let this knock her off course. For her, a backlash is likely to be seen as just another opportunity. In this respect, she is the Trump era pundit par excellence: scandals that would have ended other careers only seem to give her more fodder to feed back to her devoted followers. Until now, Owens, with all her despicable theories, has made notoriety her superpower. In today's topsy-turvy cultural climate, being the ragebait queen has served her well. It remains to be seen, however, if they make her undefeatable.

Regime change in Venezuela could pave the way for the return of U.S. oil majors to the South American nation, which has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. 

President Donald Trump called for U.S. oil companies to invest billions of dollars in Venezuela's energy sector, hours after U.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. 

""We're going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,"" Trump said in a press conference Saturday from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.

The oil majors have largely been silent since Maduro's overthrow as the situation on the ground in Venezuela remains uncertain. But shares of Chevron, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips are rising as investors bet that the three largest U.S. oil companies will cash in after the U.S. military action.

Venezuela's oil reserves are estimated at 303 billion barrels or about 17% of the global total, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 

The country's production peaked at 3.5 million barrels per day in the late 1990s but has declined significantly since then, according to energy consulting firm Kpler. Venezuela's production currently stands at around 800,000 bpd, Kpler data shows. 

Its reserves, located mostly in the Orinoco Belt in the eastern part of the country, are extra-heavy crude oil that require a greater level of technical expertise to extract, according to the EIA. 

Former President Hugo Chavez seized assets from U.S. oil majors in 2007. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela. Exxon and Conoco have billions of dollars in outstanding claims against Caracas from Chavez's nationalization. 

It will take more than just easing U.S. sactions against Venezuela to encourage new investment in the country, Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott told clients in a Monday note. Trump said over the weekend that the U.S. embargo of Venezuelan oil remains in full effect. 

U.S. producers would need to see a path to recover their claims from Caracas and have confidence in the stability of the government in Venezuela, McDermott said. 

Trump railed against Venezuela's oil nationalization, describing it as ""one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country."" 

""The oil companies are going to go in, they're going to spend money, we're going to take back the oil that, frankly, we should have taken back a long time ago,"" the president said. 

The administration will discuss plans with oil executives to expand in the country, a U.S. official told CNBC.

Chevron is best positioned to scale up production quickly if conditions allow, McDermott said. It exported about 140,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2025, Kpler data shows.

Chevron has a significant resource base in Venezuela, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram told clients Monday. It has joint ventures with state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) that are responsible for 23% of the South American nation's output, Jayaram said. 

Chevron said it ""remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets"" in the wake of Maduro's overthrow. ""We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,"" the oil major said in a weekend statement. 

The Biden administration issued a license in 2022 that allowed Chevron's joint venture with PDVSA to produce and export oil. The Trump administration granted the oil major a restricted license in July 2025 that allowed it to pump but banned proceeds from going to the Maduro government. 

Conoco and Exxon participated in Venezuela's ""oil opening"" policy in the 1990s, which invited foreign investment to develop resources in the Orinoco Belt. They exited the country after Chavez's nationalization and filed arbitration claims against Caracas. 

Conoco has oustanding claims from abitration cases against the Venezuela approaching $10 billion, Jayaram said. Exxon's claims are around $2 billion, he said. 

Conoco is ""monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,"" spokesperson Dennis Nuss said in a weekend statement. ""It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.""

Exxon has not responded to requests for comment. 

Rebuilding Venezuela's oil infrastructure will likely cost billions. Investors were speculating the work could boost business for oil services companies, with shares of Slb up more than 10%, Halliburton gained 9%, while Baker Hughes added 4% in trading Monday. 

The future of Venezuelan production depends on how the security situation on the ground evolves, said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in a Saturday note to clients. 

Oil executives operating in Venezuela say it will cost $10 billion annually to turn production around and a stable security environment is essential to grow production back to historic levels, Croft said. 

Venezuela production could grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day over the next 12 months if the Trump administration provides full sanctions relief and there is an orderly transition of power, she said.

""However, all bets are off in a chaotic change of power scenario like what occurred in Libya or Iraq,"" Croft told clients.

Ukraine has appointed former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland as an economic advisor, amid a sweeping government reshuffle of key political appointments. 

""Chrystia is a professional (...) and has significant experience in attracting investments and conducting economic transformations,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Telegram post on Jan. 5.

The move comes as Zelensky lays the groundwork for either a peace deal and Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, or the continuation of the war, with recent appointments aimed at preparing the country for both.

Zelensky appointed the country's now-former military spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as head of the president's office on Jan. 2 — widely perceived to signal Kyiv's preparedness for the war's continuation this year.

But talks of Ukraine's economic future have also gained traction in recent weeks as peace talks drag on. Zelensky said in late December that Ukraine and the U.S. were discussing economic recovery plans for a post-war Ukraine.

""Ukraine needs to increase its internal resilience — for the sake of Ukraine's recovery, if diplomacy works as quickly as possible, and for the sake of strengthening our defense, if we have to work longer to end the war due to our partners' delays,"" Zelensky said on Telegram, explicitly outlining the two possibilities for 2026.

Freeland, who served as deputy prime minister from 2019–2024 under Justin Trudeau, was appointed as Canada's special representative for the reconstruction of Ukraine in 2025.

Zelensky on Nov. 30 also appointed Ukraine's former ambassador to Washington, Oksana Markarova, as presidential advisor on reconstruction and investment.

The Ukrainian army has destroyed more than 90,000 Russian troops over the past three months, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 5. 

The meeting of the ""Coalition of the Willing"" will bring together leaders from around 30 countries to discuss long-term security arrangements for Ukraine.





""(Indian Prime Minister Narendra) Modi is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said.

Russian troops are attempting to close in on Kupiansk from the north and east, aiming to solidify their presence on the western side of the Oskil River. 

The move comes as Zelensky lays the groundwork for either a peace deal and Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, or the continuation of the war, with recent appointments aimed at preparing the country for both.

Russian forces launched 165 strike drones overnight, of which roughly 100 were Shahed-type drones, according to Zelensky. Two of the four wounded victims are in serious condition. 

Russia had publicly accused Ukraine of launching 91 drones toward a residence used by Putin — a claim Putin personally conveyed to Trump during the phone call.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 4, Trump said: ""We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security."" 

The Energia factory in Lipetsk Oblast produces components for Russian missiles and drones, including batteries for the Iskander ballistic missile system and cruise missiles.

Kyiv is ready for ""both options,"" Zelensky said: the diplomatic track, or ongoing active defense against Russia. ""Ukraine will never surrender,"" he said.

Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump wait for the FIFA World Cup draw to begin at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, on Dec. 5, 2025.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

It should have been clear in November, 2024, when Donald Trump won re-election that Canada needed to act with urgency to end the drift of (especially) the last decade, during which the federal government dangerously neglected the basics of safeguarding national sovereignty.

The alarm bells were seemingly heeded last spring, when Mr. Trump launched his trade war and started greedily eyeing Canada as the 51st state. Against the odds, the Liberals won re-election under Mark Carney on the promise of an elbows-up response to Mr. Trump's provocations.

But that promised response has not materialized, despite other worrying developments. In November, the U.S. administration published a National Security Strategy that would dramatically curtail the sovereignty of any Western Hemisphere country, Canada included.

Then came the U.S. military strike on Venezuela on Saturday. Any thought that Canada could simply wait out Mr. Trump's term in the White House ended this weekend. 

There has been no shortage of rhetoric from Prime Minister Mark Carney about the need to expand Canada's military capacity and to end economic stagnation. What has been lacking for more than a year is action commensurate to the national emergency in which Canada finds itself.

Carney hails ouster of Maduro in Venezuela but calls for respect for international law

The conundrum that Canada faces is that there is no immediate fix to today's emergency. It will take years to build a new pipeline, and years to fully rebuild Canada's military. Which is why there is not a moment more to lose.

The Liberals have talked about doubling non-U.S. exports over the coming decade. But what will happen this year? This month? The Liberals have talked about increasing Canada's military spending to five per cent of GDP by 2035. What steps will be taken in 2026? The Liberals have signed a memorandum with Alberta that sets the stage for an oil pipeline to the Pacific. It's a solid first step, but when will the next one come?

The right answer, the only answer, must be immediately, for the three herculean tasks of diversifying Canada's exports, revitalizing the domestic economy and rebuilding this country's military capacity.

The single biggest step that Ottawa can take in diversifying exports is to ensure a new bitumen pipeline to the West Coast is constructed. The economic logic was unassailable before the U.S. seized Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro. Now, the United States is vowing to ramp up Venezuelan crude production, which would swell supplies of heavy oil for U.S. refiners – driving down prices for Alberta producers. The immediate response must be to green-light additional capacity for the Ottawa-owned Trans Mountain pipeline. The company has said it intends to boost capacity over the next five years. That timeline needs to be accelerated to start this year.

What the U.S. attack on Venezuela could mean for oil and Canadian crude exports

More important, Ottawa must work with Alberta to secure a private proponent in the coming months for a new oil pipeline, underpinned by a commitment that all regulatory approvals will be granted in under two years.

There will need to be consultation and accommodation with Indigenous communities to fulfill Ottawa's constitutional duty. But the Liberal government must make it clear in those talks (and to any obstructionist premier) that the only question to be discussed is how a pipeline will be built.

The same kind of leadership is needed for the forging of a national economy. The promise of internal free trade has devolved, yet again, into inter-provincial squabbling. The federal government needs to step in to ensure that internal trade barriers are dismantled speedily and permanently. 

Opinion: A Venezuelan oil reset is an economic risk Canada cannot ignore

Ottawa already has the only tool it needs, in the form of its very deep pockets. Federal funds should be made contingent on provinces and territories tearing down trade barriers.

On national defence, the Carney government has taken some initial measures to boost military capacity. But the announcements last year of an increase in defence spending and procurement reform are, at most, an overdue first step.

Recruitment needs to quicken, now. Procurement delays need to end, now. Any minister who attempts to detour spending into regional pork-barrelling should be booted from cabinet. Any staff officer who gets in the way of ending the bureaucratic snarls of procurement must be cashiered.

In June, former U.S. ambassador Kelly Craft told a Toronto business audience that if Canada doesn't like being called a 51st state, it should stop acting like one. Those may be hard words for Canadians to hear, but they underscore the seriousness of the moment, and the urgency of action.

US President Donald Trump says now that Nicolas Maduro is gone, more US oil companies will enter Venezuela and spend billions revitalizing its oil industry. Several key questions have to be answered.

The United States' strikes on Caracas and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro have left the South American nation in a state of deep confusion and uncertainty.

US President Donald Trump pledged in the immediate aftermath that the US would ""run"" Venezuela, a move that appeared to hinge on how the US would approach the country's key commodity: oil.

""We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,"" he said. 

Venezuela's fragile economy is exceptionally dependent on oil. Maduro's government has been almost entirely dependent on the hydrocarbon for state income.

Crude oil and related products such as petrochemicals account for around 90% of Venezuela's export revenues. They helped keep the heavily sanctioned and isolated government in power despite a severe economic crisis.

Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, with over 300 billion barrels available — even more than Saudi Arabia. However, it accounts for less than 1% of the global oil production, a figure that was more than 10% of global production in the 1960s. Crude production has collapsed by more than 70% since the late 1990s, and Venezuela is now 21st in the list of global producers.

The collapse can be traced back to the government of former President Hugo Chavez. His socialist revolution in the 1990s and 2000s led to massive corruption at the state oil company, PDVSA, and saw foreign investment flood out of the country due to government interference in the oil sector.

Several accidents at its pipelines and oil refineries led to further difficulties, while US sanctions — ratcheted up from 2017 — further limited Venezuela's oil production capacity.

PDVSA has stabilized oil output at around 1 million barrels per day, in part because of US licenses that allow a limited number of foreign partners to operate in Venezuela and export oil.

Throughout the 20th century, the US was a key partner for the Venezuelan oil sector, with its major oil companies investing heavily in the country.

All but one left the country in the aftermath of the Chavez revolution — Chevron.

Although sanctions affected its operations, Chevron was given special licences by the Biden administration in 2022 to resume Venezuelan oil exports under strict conditions. The idea was that softening Venezuelan sanctions would ease wider oil market pressures in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

In October this year, the Trump administration gave Chevron fresh authorization to produce oil in Venezuela, arguing the US company was a vital partner for Caracas.

It stands as the most obvious and immediate beneficiary of any move by Trump to allow further US investment in the country. It employs around 3,000 people there already. In a statement, the company said it would operate in ""full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations."" It did not comment on any possible expansion plans.

Trump says large US oil companies will return to Venezuela under his plan. That could include the likes of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.

ExxonMobil, the largest US oil company, saw its assets expropriated by Chavez in 2007. ConocoPhillips' projects at Hamaca, Petrozuata and Corocoro were also expropriated. Both companies won multi-billion-dollar compensation awards in international arbitration, but Venezuela has not paid out. This is the basis of Trump's repeated claim of ""stolen oil.""

""We built Venezuela's oil industry with American talent, drive and skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us during those previous administrations, and they stole it through force,"" Trump said. ""This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country."" 

ConocoPhillips said it is ""monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability."" It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments,"" a spokesman added.

The US is already comfortably the world's biggest producer of oil, so at first glance, it might not seem clear why Trump is so keen on Venezuela's oil.

However, the issue is the type of oil the US produces. Its main product is light crude, not the heavier, gloopier grade that many of its refineries, especially on the Gulf coast, are equipped to refine. Refineries turn crude oil into petrol, diesel and other products crucial for the economy.

Although the US is a major crude producer, it still imports heavy crude from countries such as Canada and Mexico to supply refineries optimized for those grades. That means a lot of the crude oil produced in the US actually ends up being exported. 

""Using the right types of crude oil keeps our refineries efficient, keeps costs down and maintains energy security,"" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) trade association. ""Re-tooling refineries to process solely US crude oil would cost billions — a risky investment that would take decades to permit, construct and eventually pay off.""

Although Venezuela's production has fallen off a cliff, the massive reserves it sits on include the largest global reserves of heavy crude oil that the US refineries need. In fact, for many decades, heavy Venezuelan crude fed US refineries.

That makes renewed access to Venezuelan oil extremely attractive for US companies.

There are huge legal and logistical questions over whether or not oil will start flowing from Venezuela again.

Precisely what government will take shape in Venezuela in the absence of Maduro is unclear. It is also unknown to what extent the new government will facilitate US attempts to influence the country's oil sector.

Then there is the question of the state of Venezuela's oil infrastructure. Dan Brouillette, a former US Secretary of Energy from the first Trump administration, says that while early reports suggest the country's oil facilities remain intact, there is no guarantee that Venezuela's massive reserves can be tapped quickly.

""The constraint has never been geology. It has been governance, sanctions, capital access, and execution,"" he wrote on LinkedIn. ""If political change brings rapid stabilization and credible authority over PDVSA, the upside is incremental supply over time, not a sudden surge.""

Although some foreign oil companies have remained in Venezuela, sanctions have meant that the country's oil facilities have not received the necessary investment to remain up to date. The extent of the fresh investment required may become clearer over the coming months.

Another key question is the world's appetite for more oil. Prices have fallen over the past year and are expected to fall further in 2026 amid a production glut. If Trump's promise on Venezuela comes good, it would lead to even more oil on already saturated global markets.

China has been an important political and economic partner for Venezuela over the past two decades.

In the oil sector, China's CNPC has a joint venture with PDVSA. Most of the oil produced in Venezuela gets shipped to China. However, China has not hugely expanded its oil operations in Venezuela despite the US absence.

Beijing has sharply criticized the US toppling of Maduro as a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services head pushed dubious MAHA strategies for dealing with the flu instead.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Amid a significant spike in influenza cases across the United States, Mehmet Oz, the current administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), is downplaying the importance of flu vaccinations, suggesting to the public, wrongly, that this year's shot is ineffective.

Oz made the comments in an appearance on Newsmax last week.

“Every year, there is a flu vaccine, it doesn't always work very well,” Oz claimed. “That's why it's been controversial of late. But like many illnesses, the best news out there is that you can take care of yourself so that when you do end up running into the flu, you can overwhelm it.”

Oz then pushed questionable “Make America Healthy Again” strategies for dealing with the flu, advising the public to get “sunlight,” include Vitamin D in their diets, or take zinc supplements to possibly shorten the duration of the flu. He also called on Americans to “eat the right food” and engage in physical activity.

While eating healthy and exercising are good advice in general, Oz's downplaying of vaccines has concerned many health experts. Notably, his recommendation of zinc — which has been shown in some studies to help boost the immune system — came without dosage recommendations, which could potentially lead to overdoses by viewers unaware of the proper dosage. Consuming too much zinc can lead to serious complications, including the same flu-like symptoms people may be trying to treat. 

Oz has a history of providing faulty or dubious medical advice. His recommendation to take supplements echoes President Donald Trump's promotion of untested strategies during the coronavirus pandemic, such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, two “remedies” that turned out to have no effect on treating the virus and led to overdoses, including thousands of deaths, throughout the world. Oz's comments are also similar to those made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this year, in which he touted Vitamin A and cod liver oil as possible treatments for measles, leading to overdoses from those remedies in children throughout the country.

Several medical experts, including Trump's first surgeon general Jerome Adams, spoke out against Oz's claims, reiterating that it's still important for Americans to get a flu vaccine this year, even with the new strain.

“Even in mismatched years, flu vaccines provide cross-protection because the strains are related,” Adams said on social media, adding that “mismatched vaccines can still reduce lab-confirmed flu risk by around 50-60 percent overall and are particularly good at preventing severe outcomes like hospitalization and death.”

A fact-check from Indian news site The Week notes that research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as multiple studies elsewhere, shows that “seasonal flu vaccines consistently reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, intensive care admission, organ failure, and death, even in seasons when the vaccine is not a perfect match for circulating strains.”

Ashish Jha, the former dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, also touted the importance of getting vaccinated, even if the shot is not a complete match to the current flu strain.

“You still get about a third of lower chance of getting infected” from the mismatched vaccine, Jha conceded. “But where the benefit of the vaccine is clear is in preventing ER visits, hospitalizations, and obviously the thing we care most about, which is deaths.”

New CDC estimates about this year's flu season were released on Monday, showcasing numbers up to the final week of 2025. According to those figures, there have already been 120,000 hospitalizations this year, as well as 5,000 deaths from the flu this season. At this same time last year, those numbers were nearly half, with only 63,000 hospitalizations recorded and just 2,700 flu-related deaths at that point. 

It's possible the hospitalization and death rates are higher this year due to fewer people getting vaccinated, as around 13 million fewer flu vaccine doses were administered this year compared to last. 

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The armed forces have response protocols for a wide range of sudden contingencies, including the “Wan Chun Plan” to protect the head of state, the Ministry of National Defense said yesterday.

After US President Donald Trump on Saturday launched a series of airstrikes in Venezuela and kidnapped deposed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, concerns have been raised as to whether China would launch a similar “decapitation strike” on Taiwan.

The armed forces regularly coordinate with government agencies and practice drills to ensure preparedness for a wide range of scenarios, Vice Minister of National Defense Hsu Szu-chien (徐斯儉) told reporters before a meeting at the legislature in Taipei.

However, the upheaval in Venezuela has demonstrated the importance of preparedness and ensuring weapons are regularly upgraded and maintained, he said.

At the legislative committee meeting on this year's defense budget, Hsu told lawmakers that Venezuela's weapons, obtained from China and Russia, proved to be far inferior to US weapons.

The issue was not only the origin of the weapons, but that they had been poorly maintained, Hsu said.

“If the enemy is advancing, we must also advance,” he said.

Hsu said that the ministry's general budget for this fiscal year is set at NT$561.4 billion (US$17.8 billion), an increase of NT$87.5 billion compared with the last fiscal year.

If the total budget is not approved by the legislature during the current session, NT$78 billion of the budget would be affected, he said, adding that systems such as the “long-range precision strike system” and the “Harpoon missile coastal defense system” would be impacted.

Excluding expenses for the maintenance of personnel and legal obligations, 21 percent of the budget would be unable to be executed according to the original schedule, making it difficult to complete equipment procurement, repairs, and adequate replenishment of fuel and ammunition this year, he added.

Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wu Ping-jui (吳秉叡) said that the opposition's continued blocking of a proposed NT$1.25 trillion special defense budget bill would impact national security.

The Chinese Communist Party last week conducted “Justice Mission 2025” drills around Taiwan, seriously undermining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, the ministry said.

As China's military moves toward acquiring the capability to invade Taiwan and enemy threats continue to mount, time has become the most important resource in defense operations, it said.

Each day that the defense budget is delayed consumes precious preparation time, it added.



                                                                                Taiwan is gearing up to celebrate the New Year at events across the country, headlined by the annual countdown and Taipei 101 fireworks display at midnight.

South Pacific countries are the first to bid farewell to 2025. Clocks struck midnight in Auckland, with a population of 1.7 million, 18 hours before the famous ball was to drop in New York's Times Square.
The five-minute display involved 3,500 fireworks launched from the 240m Sky Tower. Smaller community events were canceled across New Zealand's

The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted what it called “Justice Mission 2025” exercises from Monday to Tuesday in five maritime zones and airspace around Taiwan, calling them a warning to “Taiwanese independence” forces.
In a report released on Wednesday, the Institute for the Study of War said the exercises effectively simulated blocking shipping routes to major port cities, including Kaohsiung, Keelung and Hualien.
Taiwan would be highly vulnerable under such a blockade, because it

Slavoj Žižek

Philosophy professor

When criminals are apprehended, their first statement is usually: ""But I did nothing wrong, I am an honest man!""

The latest example of such a procedure — which, of course, stands for ideology at its purest — occurred in mid-December 2025 when Russia announced that it is ""opening the Odesa corridor.""

In this momentous announcement, largely ignored by our big media, ""opening"" stands for its exact opposite: Odesa is Ukraine's main port through which most of its export (grain, sunflowers, etc.) gets out, and to ""open"" a corridor to Odesa means that all ships leaving Odesa and going there will have to pass through this corridor tightly controlled by Russia and enabling it to reject the passage or to seize them.

Since this corridor will pass through international waters, its imposition amounts to a pure exercise of power, violating international laws.

Russia is not alone here. Isn't Trump doing the same with Venezuela, controlling access to it? (Maybe Putin even copied Trump.)

Will China do the same with Taiwan, opening a corridor to its ports? And is Israel not doing the same with Gaza, controlling access to it and seizing ships that approach it in international waters?

When a big power attacks a small country, the terms used are humanitarian help, opening up the space for human rights… as Russia does in Ukraine. That's why I support the idea that Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump deserve a Nobel Peace Prize — I would just add Vladimir Putin to this list.

But what really depressed me is how some big Western ""Leftists"" (Yanis Varoufakis, Richard Wolff, John Mearsheimer…) reacted to the announcement of the opening of the Odesa corridor: they celebrated it as an adequate response to the Western imperialist control over transport infrastructure. (Do they include the constant bombardment of the city and its port that makes Odesa unlivable?)

Their idea is that Russia won without firing a single shot: it focused not on the battlefield but on what effectively upholds the states in their battle for world domination.

Western imperialist powers did not just produce more, and in a more efficient way, they also control the complex infrastructure of transport links, which allows them to exclude from this infrastructure the economies they consider a threat to their domination. 

""Open market"" is meaningless without the equal participation of all states in it. We were so used to this Western domination that we accepted it as the normal open space of commerce, although it was based on a set of obstacles and exclusions, from tariffs to direct military interventions.

Russia thus didn't simply break a neutral international transport network; it just did explicitly what the West was doing implicitly all along and thus rendering palpable the lie of the neutrality of the transport infrastructure.

As a Leftist, I am totally opposed to this reading.

First, it is a military intervention that potentially closes the world market to Ukraine, the greatest exporter of grain to Global South countries. This will not only hit Ukraine hard — making it even more dependent on Western financial support — but will also make food imports more expensive for Global South countries.

Instead of opening the markets, it will make the choice of where to buy products dependent on the brutal power of political feuds.

Yes, there are many things false in the West-dominated transport infrastructure, but Russia's act makes things even worse — it reminds us of the Stalinist critique of bourgeois ""formal freedoms"" which the Communists in power ruthlessly abolished, replacing them with the ""actual freedom"" of state terror.

As for the ""anti-imperialist"" nature of Russia's act, we should never forget that during World War II, fascists in Germany and in Japan also widely used the anti-imperialist rhetoric, presenting themselves as the liberators of the nations they occupied from the British-French-American imperialism.

The ""Leftists"" justify their understanding of Russia's opening of the Odesa corridor with another ""Marxist"" argument.

They remind us of the standard Marxist thesis that wars are never just a matter of military power, politics, and ideology. While the anti-Russian West focuses only on these aspects (Russia's desire to reestablish its lost imperial domain), it neglects what Russia understood clearly: wars are really decided by their economic base, by the economic strength and the social power grounded in this strength.

This is how, without firing a shot, Russia undermined a key moment of European economic strength, laying bare Europe's vulnerability and impotence.

No wonder, then, that the same ""Leftists"" also show great understanding for the second act of Russia: for how Russia reacted to the threat that Europe will grab the Russian money it keeps in Brussels and give it to Ukraine.

On the one hand, these ""Marxists"" point out that, if Europe were to seize this money and give it to Ukraine, it would ruin the basic stability of the international financial system. When a sovereign state deposits its reserves in a neutral financial institution in another country, it retains the unconditional right to freely dispose of this money and get it back when it wants.

Once you break this basic rule, the trust that sustains the international system begins to disintegrate; the consequence would be that the U.S. dollar and the euro will gradually lose their status of global currencies.

Although the EU did not seize the Russian reserves in Brussels, the very threat that it will do it prompted the reaction of Russia at multiple levels: Russia announced that it will begin to seize the property of the Western bank and companies still operating there; it will demand from buyers of its national resources (oil, above all) to pay for them in rubles or renminbi — not just Russia and China but also Saudi Arabia, Emirates and India expressed readiness to follow this de-dollarization.

This last measure will hit the Western European economy heavily: it will render its production costs much higher and thereby less competitive.

A financial space will thus emerge outside the control and regulation of Western ""imperialist"" financial institutions. The ""Leftist"" critics celebrate these Russian acts as an adequate heavy blow to the global imperialist financial infrastructure. When Europe nonetheless refused to directly seize the Russian financial reserves in Brussels, these same ""Leftist"" critics again dismissed this refusal as proof that the EU is afraid to act in a consistent way, and that it prefers to oscillate between helping Ukraine and its own egoistic interest of not disturbing the world order too much.

So, in a truly suicidal mood, the EU decided to get into debt itself in order to help Ukraine to survive — yet another suicidal move which will further cripple the European economy.

There is a strong moment of truth in this reproach. However, I think, a less critical interpretation of what Europe did is possible — I tend to agree with the comment according to which ""what is really significant is that a bloc of 27 unruly sovereign states managed to come up with the money to ensure Ukraine wouldn't collapse. Just as Putin's words ensure the war will continue, so do the EU's deeds. The EU's decision is also important because it shows Europe's willingness to act independently on the war, even if it means putting distance between itself and the U.S.""

I take this comment more literally than it was probably meant: yes, European money hopefully ensures that Ukraine wouldn't collapse, because Europe is fully aware that without this money, Russia will take all of Ukraine. Not just Putin's words, his deeds also ensure the war will go on, so it is a matter of survival for Ukraine to continue to fight. Losing the war means ceasing to exist as a nation.

This is why the implicit but unmissable joy in the ""Leftists"" jumping on Europe's dead body, as well as their repetitive praising of how Russia gave a lesson to Western imperialism, clearly falsifies their neutrality.

To cut a long story short, in the global conflict that is gradually approaching its point of no return, they are obviously on the side of Russia and China.

The united Europe is still an economic power, so it should do something it has been avoiding for years, something both Russia and the U.S. try to prevent at any cost: to proclaim independence of the united Europe.

Is it too late, as the ""Leftist"" critics try to convince us again and again? Is Europe already dead, a rotting corpse?

The very insistence of these critics that now (and there were many of these ""nows"") Europe finally committed suicide demonstrates that it is not too late — for such a decision, it is never too late.

The new power blocks that are emerging around the world are just versions of new Fascism with no ideological foundation — just think about the axis of Russia-Iran-Venezuela. Europe should be here an exception: the only place of fidelity to the emancipatory Enlightenment. Will the proclamation of European independence happen? No, in all probability — but its lack will be felt all around the world. If it will not happen, it is not because of the external pressures — Europe is ultimately afraid of itself.

Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump wait for the FIFA World Cup draw to begin at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, on Dec. 5, 2025.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

It should have been clear in November, 2024, when Donald Trump won re-election that Canada needed to act with urgency to end the drift of (especially) the last decade, during which the federal government dangerously neglected the basics of safeguarding national sovereignty.

The alarm bells were seemingly heeded last spring, when Mr. Trump launched his trade war and started greedily eyeing Canada as the 51st state. Against the odds, the Liberals won re-election under Mark Carney on the promise of an elbows-up response to Mr. Trump's provocations.

But that promised response has not materialized, despite other worrying developments. In November, the U.S. administration published a National Security Strategy that would dramatically curtail the sovereignty of any Western Hemisphere country, Canada included.

Then came the U.S. military strike on Venezuela on Saturday. Any thought that Canada could simply wait out Mr. Trump's term in the White House ended this weekend. 

There has been no shortage of rhetoric from Prime Minister Mark Carney about the need to expand Canada's military capacity and to end economic stagnation. What has been lacking for more than a year is action commensurate to the national emergency in which Canada finds itself.

Carney hails ouster of Maduro in Venezuela but calls for respect for international law

The conundrum that Canada faces is that there is no immediate fix to today's emergency. It will take years to build a new pipeline, and years to fully rebuild Canada's military. Which is why there is not a moment more to lose.

The Liberals have talked about doubling non-U.S. exports over the coming decade. But what will happen this year? This month? The Liberals have talked about increasing Canada's military spending to five per cent of GDP by 2035. What steps will be taken in 2026? The Liberals have signed a memorandum with Alberta that sets the stage for an oil pipeline to the Pacific. It's a solid first step, but when will the next one come?

The right answer, the only answer, must be immediately, for the three herculean tasks of diversifying Canada's exports, revitalizing the domestic economy and rebuilding this country's military capacity.

The single biggest step that Ottawa can take in diversifying exports is to ensure a new bitumen pipeline to the West Coast is constructed. The economic logic was unassailable before the U.S. seized Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro. Now, the United States is vowing to ramp up Venezuelan crude production, which would swell supplies of heavy oil for U.S. refiners – driving down prices for Alberta producers. The immediate response must be to green-light additional capacity for the Ottawa-owned Trans Mountain pipeline. The company has said it intends to boost capacity over the next five years. That timeline needs to be accelerated to start this year.

What the U.S. attack on Venezuela could mean for oil and Canadian crude exports

More important, Ottawa must work with Alberta to secure a private proponent in the coming months for a new oil pipeline, underpinned by a commitment that all regulatory approvals will be granted in under two years.

There will need to be consultation and accommodation with Indigenous communities to fulfill Ottawa's constitutional duty. But the Liberal government must make it clear in those talks (and to any obstructionist premier) that the only question to be discussed is how a pipeline will be built.

The same kind of leadership is needed for the forging of a national economy. The promise of internal free trade has devolved, yet again, into inter-provincial squabbling. The federal government needs to step in to ensure that internal trade barriers are dismantled speedily and permanently. 

Opinion: A Venezuelan oil reset is an economic risk Canada cannot ignore

Ottawa already has the only tool it needs, in the form of its very deep pockets. Federal funds should be made contingent on provinces and territories tearing down trade barriers.

On national defence, the Carney government has taken some initial measures to boost military capacity. But the announcements last year of an increase in defence spending and procurement reform are, at most, an overdue first step.

Recruitment needs to quicken, now. Procurement delays need to end, now. Any minister who attempts to detour spending into regional pork-barrelling should be booted from cabinet. Any staff officer who gets in the way of ending the bureaucratic snarls of procurement must be cashiered.

In June, former U.S. ambassador Kelly Craft told a Toronto business audience that if Canada doesn't like being called a 51st state, it should stop acting like one. Those may be hard words for Canadians to hear, but they underscore the seriousness of the moment, and the urgency of action.

Daily roundup of research and analysis from The Globe and Mail's market strategist Scott Barlow

RBC Capital Markets co-heads of research Graeme Pearson and mark Odendahl published the department's top 30 global stock ideas, a list of high-conviction equity stories from RBC analysts,

“The best-performing Top 30 stock selections in Q4/25 were Barrick (up 30 per cent), DuPont (up 23 per cent) and Loblaw (up 17 per cent). Over the past year, the Top 30 total return was 14.4 per cent vs. the benchmark at 20.1 per cent, and since inception of our quarterly list at year-end 2019, the Top 30 has delivered a total compound annual return of 14.0 per cent, above the benchmark at 12.8 per cent. 

“Changes This Quarter Additions: Airbnb (ABNB-Q), Alcon (ALC SW), Amazon.com (AMZN-Q), Engie (ENGI FP), International Paper (IP-N), Royal Gold (RGLD-Q), Shopify (SHOP-N, SHOP-T), The Williams Companies (WMB US), Visa (V-N), Wisetech Global (WTC AU), Xcel Energy (XEL-Q) 

“Deletions: Alimentation Couche-Tard (ATD-T), Barrick Mining (B-N, B-T), CSX (CSX-Q), EDP Renovaveis (EDPR PL), Ferrari (RACE IM), HubSpot (HUBS-N), NIKE (NKE-N), PayPal (PYPL-Q), Pembina Pipeline (PPL-T), Wells Fargo (WFC-N), Wix.com (WIX-Q) 

“Maintains: Air Products and Chemicals (APD-N), Biogen (BIIB-Q), Boston Scientific (BSX-N), Brookfield Corp. (BN-N, BN-T), ConocoPhillips (COP-N), Constellation Software (CSU-T), DuPont de Nemours (DD-N), Loblaw (L-T), L'Oreal (OR FP), Microsoft (MSFT-Q), Moody's (MCO-N), Palo Alto Networks (PANW-Q), RB Global (RBA-N, RBA-T), Safran (SAF FP), Schneider Electric (SU FP), Snowflake (SNOW-N), U.S. Bancorp (USB-N), Ventas (VTR-N), Xylem (XYL-N)”

TD Cowen oil analyst Menno Hulshof provided an early assessment of Venezuela/U.S. geopolitics' effects on the crude market,

“We expect a limited impact from VZ's most acute geopolitical crisis since 1902-1903, but reiterate the potential for geopolitics to structurally alter global energy market dynamics in 2026. Any immediate-term disruptions to supply risk premia are likely mitigated by the ongoing glut, leaving markets focused on the risk that sanctioned barrels may instead enter into the system, and sentiment regarding the prospect of a medium-term recovery in exports. We also expect a muted war-effect owing to the limited nature of this operation”

Scotiabank analyst Paul Cheng and the energy research team also published a report on the longer term impact of the bizarre U.S. policy in Venezuela,

“We believe this development will have a mixed impact on the oil market. Near-term oil prices may initially rise modestly, reflecting uncertainties in the aftermath of this attack on Venezuela's oil production, while longer dated strip prices fall. The pace of the power transition and the overall security situation on the ground could also cause any near-term rally to fade. Longer term, the removal of Maduro could potentially mark the beginning of a new chapter for OPEC and the oil market, a complete opposite of the outlook in 1999 after Chavez was elected President of Venezuela in late 1998. As a result, we believe these developments will lead to lower longer term oil prices while widening U.S. and global light/heavy oil differentials”

From what I've read over the weekend, Venezuela's facilities are outdated and the quality of oil is broadly poor. Reading between the lines it seems like Venezuelan oil is marginally profitable at best in the current market, and obviously new supply would put downward pressure on the commodity price. 

TD economist Andrew Hencic sees cracks under the surface of domestic growth,

 “The economy has shown some mettle, likely growing 1.7 per cent in 2025 as data revisions revealed better-than-expected past performance and large swings in trade-flattered topline figures. However, there are real cracks under the surface (domestic demand contracted in two quarters this year) and focus is now firmly on how Ottawa's strategy of new infrastructure, defense spending, and greasing the wheels on major projects to diversify trade markets begins to be delivered … Thus far, Canada has managed to more than offset the $13.0-billion decline in exports to the U.S. with $16.3-billion in flows to the rest of the world. Moreover, roughly 87 per cent of Canadian exports to the U.S. in September (the last month for which we have data) were still duty-free … The protection conveyed by CUSMA doesn't extend to specific goods tariffed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. These levies have materially affected the competitiveness of Canadian manufactured goods south of the border. Motor and Other Vehicles (-$3.3 billion year-to-date), steel & iron (-$2.0 billion), and aluminum (-$1.4 billion) exports to the U.S. have contracted significantly. Moreover, flows abroad for most of those products have not been sufficient to offset the lost revenues”

An oil tanker docked at El Palito port in Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, in December. U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to make money off Venezuelan oil faces moral, political and logistical problems, Chris Arsenault writes.Matias Delacroix/The Associated Press

Chris Arsenault is chair of the journalism program at Western University and a former reporter covering Venezuela. 

When it comes to the country with the world's largest oil reserves, U.S. President Donald Trump didn't mince words on why U.S. commandos seized Venezuela's president. “They stole our oil,” Mr. Trump said.

Put aside for a moment clear violations of international law from U.S. actions and the fact “our” oil somehow ended up under Venezuela's soil.

A picture Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social of deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro handcuffed and blindfolded in a tracksuit aboard a U.S. navy ship conjures images of other oil-rich autocrats deposed by Washington and its proxies: Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Muammar Gaddafi. Neither of those interventions ended well.

A photo of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro handcuffed and blindfolded on a U.S. navy ship has echoes of past interventions by Washington into oil-rich countries.@realDonaldTrump/Reuters

Mr. Trump's plan to “have our very large United States oil companies” go and “spend billions of dollars” to “fix the badly broken infrastructure” and start making money, faces a host of problems: moral, political and logistical.

In short, don't expect a big influx of Venezuela's estimated 303 billion barrels of oil to end up on tankers heading north any time soon.

Mr. Maduro is a bumbling, brutal, inept autocrat. He blatantly stole the last election and his disastrous mismanagement forced nearly eight million Venezuelans to flee. Most Venezuelans are happy to see him gone. But like past U.S. interventions in major oil producers, power vacuums can create chaos.

War games simulations run previously by Washington on what could happen following Mr. Maduro's ouster indicate the chances for low-intensity civil conflict are substantial. Already, armed members of pro-Maduro civilian militias are out in force in the capital Caracas.

Leftist rebels from Colombia operate in jungle areas around Venezuela's borders. Attempts by Exxon or other U.S. oil majors – who had their assets nationalized by Maduro predecessor Hugo Chavez – to bring in technicians and repair infrastructure to expand production are likely to be met by resistance, just as U.S. forces and oil companies faced in Iraq.

What the U.S. attack on Venezuela could mean for oil and Canadian crude exports

Opinion: Donald Trump's plans for Venezuela, or rather the lack of them

Ahead of that invasion in 2003, the administration of former president George W. Bush changed the name of its planned Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL) to Operation Iraqi Freedom, seemingly aware of the optics. Mr. Trump has no such scruples. He's almost refreshingly honest about U.S. foreign policy goals.

The plan, as it was for Iraq, is for Venezuela's oil wealth to finance the military and political costs of controlling the country, or as the U.S. Department of War put it to, “[reimburse the] people in our country who were forced out of Venezuela.”

America can deploy gunboat diplomacy around the globe, but Mr. Trump shouldn't hold his breath waiting for a cheque.

Venezuela's oil production dropped from over three million barrels per day in the early 2000s to less than one million in 2025, according to the consultancy Wood Mackenzie, owing to chronic mismanagement and U.S. sanctions.

Big increases in production, the kind of return on investment required for toppling a government and rebuilding an industry, will not be cheap or easy.

Change – but not regime change – comes to Venezuela

In a favorable scenario, a reasonable security environment and lots of capital, Wood Mackenzie estimates boosting production by one million barrels per day could happen within a couple of years.

Beyond refitting old wells or other repairs, expanding productive capacity is a longer-term and more expensive project. Venezuela's largest reserves sit in the Orinoco Belt, a region with heavy crude not so different from Canada's oil sands.

Boosting production to three-to-four million barrels per day means creating new infrastructure to access Orinoco crude which could take a decade and cost more than US$100-billion. The Trump administration, presumably, will be long gone by then.

As explosions rang out in Caracas, one subset of Canada's political class fretted about domestic oil exports to the U.S. being replaced by production from Venezuela.

“The consequences to Alberta and Canada's economy will be severe,” wrote Kevin M. Vickers, one-time New Brunswick Liberal Party leader and Canada's former ambassador to Ireland, who lamented the potential impact on shareholders and pension funds. In the midst of a blatant resource grab, his concerns are misplaced. Moreover, his worries aren't grounded in medium-term oil market realities.

Given Venezuela's current state, it is hard to imagine anyone wanting to invest tens of billions of dollars in long-term infrastructure today.

The real problem for the hemisphere, and Canada specifically, given recent U.S. annexation threats, is an unabashed return to powerful states taking natural wealth by force.

“Today it is Venezuela,” wrote Chilean President Gabriel Boric, “tomorrow it could be any other country.”

An overnight Russian air attack killed at least two people in Ukraine's capital. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has said he doesn't believe Russia's claim that Ukraine attacked Putin's residence. DW has more.

Below is a roundup of the latest headlines from Russia's war in Ukraine on Monday, January 5:

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed Kyrylo Budanov as the new head of the country's presidential office. 

Budanov is the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence service.

He fills the post that was available since the resignation of his predecessor Andrii Yermak, who left the role due to a corruption scandal among Ukraine's high-ranking officials.

Read more about Budanov, and about the reasons for his growing popularity in Ukraine, in our story.

 

Russia's overnight strike on a hospital in Kyiv resulted in one patient being killed and four injured, the Ukrainian capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said Monday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted after the strike, saying Moscow ""'defeated' another hospital.""

Zelenskyy said the Russian drone attack should remind Ukraine's partners — the European Union and the US — of the country's need for air defense and funding for interceptor drones, so that Kyiv can defend itself against Russia's full-scale war.

The overnight strike involved nine ballistic missiles, repurposed anti-aircraft missiles and 165 combat drones, per Ukraine's air force, with 137 of the drones being intercepted.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has said Europe needs to become more self-sufficient in its defense capabilities if it is to combat growing Russian aggression.

Speaking before departing on an official visit to Lithuania, Wadephul said Europe had to ""meet the threat posed by Russia with firm European solidarity.""

He said it was vital ""that we are prepared to defend ourselves and our freedom more independently.""

Both Germany and Lithuania are in agreement that only resolute action would help deter Russia from its current course of constant escalation, Wadephul said.

He said the German government was working together with Lithuania and other NATO partners and EU member states to this end, including by stepping up patrols over the Baltic Sea, being more alert and investing in more robust infrastructure. 

According to Wadephul, both Germany and Lithuania are united by their determined support for Ukraine, ""particularly during this possibly decisive phase of international efforts to end Russia's war of aggression.""

During his visit to Vilnius, Wadephul is scheduled to hold talks with Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene and Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys on Ukraine, the defense of NATO's eastern flank and the fight against hybrid threats such as cyberattacks and disinformation.

Wadephul also intends to visit the 45th Panzer (Tank) Brigade of the German Bundeswehr in Nemencine near Vilnius, which has been deployed to NATO's eastern flank to help counter the threat of Russian territorial aggression. 

Diplomatic efforts to end the nearly four-year-long war between Russia and Ukraine will continue this week.

On Monday, Ukraine's allies' chiefs of general staff are expected to meet in Kyiv to discuss the country's future. 

The following day, the so-called Coalition of the Willing, led by France and the United Kingdom, will meet in Paris to discuss the outcomes of the meetings from the previous day.

Last Saturday, national security advisers from 14 EU countries and Canada met in Kyiv.

Ukraine has targeted Moscow with drones every day in 2026 so far, marking an apparent escalation from earlier, more sporadic attacks on the Russian capital, according to data published by Russia's Defense Ministry.

By midnight on Sunday alone, Russian air defense systems had destroyed 57 drones over the Moscow region, out of 437 drones downed over Russia, the Ministry of Defense said on its Telegram messaging app.

Ukraine says that these drone attacks are intended to disrupt military logistics and energy infrastructure, increase the cost of Moscow's war effort, and retaliate against Russia's repeated missile and drone attacks since the beginning of the war nearly four years ago.

US President Donald Trump has said US officials have determined that Ukraine did not target the residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week.

This contradicts the Kremlin's claims, which Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy had dismissed as ""typical"" lies from Moscow that were designed to detail ongoing peace talks.

Trump said last week that ""something happened nearby"" Putin's residence, but has now said that American officials didn't find evidence that the Russian president's residence was targeted.

""I don't believe that strike happened,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.

""We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check,"" he added.

At least two people have been killed in Russia's overnight strikes on Kyiv and the surrounding region, Ukrainian authorities reported, after a countrywide air alert was issued.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said one person was killed in the capital.

Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported that the strike started a fire at a medical facility in the Obolonskyi district of northern Kyiv.

The facility had an inpatient ward operating at the time of the fire. After extinguishing the blaze, the service found a body inside.

The service reported on the Telegram messaging app that three people were injured and 25 had been evacuated.

Towns and villages across the Kyiv region were also hit. According to Kyiv regional governor Mykola Kalashnyk, a man in his 70s was killed in the town of Fastiv, southwest of the capital.

Welcome to DW's coverage of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Diplomatic efforts to end the war, which will have intensified recently, are set to continue this week.

Despite the peace talks, Russia has continued to regularly attack Ukrainian cities with drones and missiles.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has said US officials have concluded that Ukraine did not target the residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week.

Moscow had accused Kyiv of the alleged attack, claims Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed as ""typical Russian lies.""

The New York Times and The Washington Post reportedly sought to “avoid endangering US troops.”

Major American news outlets were informed of the Trump administration's plan to bombard Venezuela and abduct its president ahead of the operation early Saturday morning, but withheld their reporting on the operation to protect the military, Semafor reports.

Both The New York Times and The Washington Post knew about the raid before President Donald Trump approved it on Friday night at 10:46 pm, Semafor reported over the weekend. 

However, according to two people familiar with the administration's communications with the outlets, they “held off publishing what they knew to avoid endangering U.S. troops.”

The report raises major questions about the media's role in the operation, which has been widely condemned as an illegal and authoritarian action by legal experts and foreign leaders; Semafor describes the withholding of coverage as potential “cooperation” with the military by news outlets.

Major news outlets in the U.S. have a history of coordinating with the Pentagon in order to protect military operations. 

As Semafor notes, The New York Times reportedly withheld a story about the disastrous Bay of Pigs operation in 1961 before the Cuban invasion at the behest of the Kennedy administration. 

There are numerous other such examples. In the mid-2000s, the Times withheld a major report on the National Security Agency's campaign of warrantless spying on American citizens, Stellar Wind, for a year at the Bush administration's request. 

Most recently, The Atlantic withheld a potential report on a planned U.S. attack on Yemen that was the central focus of Signalgate. That attack, which the magazine's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was notified about two hours in advance, killed 15 people, including six children, one of them a newborn baby. 

Goldberg noted that he wasn't clear about the authenticity of the Signal chat. However, even in his article exposing the existence of the chat, he still withheld some of the most sensitive information that government officials discussed.

In reality, major outlets often protect government operations because those in charge at the outlets support them, a phenomenon those on the left have noted is observable in the practice of manufactured consent.

After the Trump administration's attack on Saturday, The Washington Post editorial board — which owner Jeff Bezos has revamped to be more conservative — published an editorial celebrating the abduction, calling the operation that killed at least 80 people, including civilians, an “unquestionable tactical success.”

Meanwhile, U.K. writer Owen Jones reported on Monday that BBC has directed its reporters to avoid using the word “kidnapped” when referring to the U.S.'s abduction of Maduro. Instead, according to the reported directive posted online by Jones, journalists are to use “seized” or “captured,” with attribution to the U.S. for the latter term — despite even Trump saying that kidnapping is “not a bad term” to use to describe the action.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            • Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this morning issued a statement saying he was dropping his bid for a third term as a welfare-fraud scandal in his state intensified. In a later news conference, he largely read from that statement and didn't take questions.
    


            • The former Democratic nominee for vice president is awash in fallout from a recent viral video that propelled yearslong fraud allegations to the forefront of a national conversation.
    


            • Walz: The state has fought scams, but even small amounts of fraud are intolerable and “the buck does stop with me.”
    


            • Walz is set to testify before a Republican-led US House Oversight Committee next month.
    


            The Trump administration is deploying around 2,000 federal agents to Minneapolis as part of an immigration crackdown and on the heels of a welfare fraud scandal in Minnesota, according to two law enforcement officials.
    


            Senior Trump officials have fixated on Minnesota and its Somali community after accusations of alleged fraud by members of the community. Last month, President Donald Trump called the community “garbage” and sent federal immigration authorities to the state.
    


            The latest mobilization marks an escalation in the immigration enforcement push. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, as well as US Border Patrol agents are deploying to Minnesota, including US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, whose controversial tactics have come under increased scrutiny in multiple cities.
    


            In response to questions about the deployment, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN, “While for the safety of our officers we do not get into law enforcement footprint, DHS has surged law enforcement and has already made more than 1,000 arrests of murderers, rapists, pedophiles, and gang members.”
    


            Andy Beshear, the governor of Kentucky and chair of the Democratic Governors Association, praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as “a true leader” after Walz announced he will not seek reelection.
    


                    “Governor Tim Walz has been a true leader who has delivered results that will make life better for Minnesota workers and families for years to come,” Beshear said in a release. “He's been a national leader in fighting for the middle class, ensuring free school meals, investing in public schools, and expanding access to affordable health care. As DGA Chair he helped grow our historic momentum and lay the foundation for big wins over the last two years. Above all, as a veteran, educator, coach, and member of Congress, he's also a great example of a public servant always working hard for the people of his state.”
                





            As Democrats and Republicans alike consider throwing their names in the hat for Minnesota governor, Beshear added that the association “remains very confident Minnesotans will elect another strong Democratic governor this November.”
    


            Responding to news that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would not seek a third term reelection in this year's governor's race, the Republican Governors Association said Walz' “failed leadership is emblematic of Minnesota Democrats' agenda.”
    


            “After presiding over one of the biggest fraud scandals in history it's no wonder that Tim Walz is being forced to drop his re-election bid,” RGA Communications Director Courtney Alexander said in a statement.
    


            “This scandal isn't just reflective of Minnesota Democrats: it is the banner of the Democrat Party nationally,” she continued.
    


            Walz has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but Republicans have sought to blame him and Democrats for alleged – and in some cases proven – fraud on the part of Minnesota child care providers who accepted federal funding.
    


            The Council on American-Islamic Relations is calling on law enforcement and public officials to “take concrete actions to protect Somali-American day care centers and businesses” in the wake of a viral video alleging fraud in Somali-run child care centers in Minnesota.
    


            Somali-American day care centers and businesses have been targeted with threats and harassment after the video and ensuing scandal, according to CAIR. Minnesota is home to the country's largest Somali population, many of whom came to the US as refugees after the start of a brutal civil war in their home country.
    


                    “Baseless and inflammatory allegations targeting an entire community are putting innocent people in danger,” CAIR's national director, Nihad Awad, and the executive director of CAIR's Minnesota chapter, Jaylani Hussein, said in a joint statement. “Somali-American parents are afraid to send their children to school, workers fear showing up to their jobs, and small businesses are suffering, all because of reckless rhetoric dehumanizing a community that has long been an integral part of Minnesota and this nation.”
                





            The video, in which 23-year-old conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley attempted to enter what he said were Somali-owned day care centers, has inspired copycats seeking to do the same, CAIR said.
    


            “We are deeply concerned for the safety and welfare of children attending day care centers who are now facing heightened risks due to unauthorized individuals attempting to access facilities, as well as the very real danger that predators, including those seeking to exploit chaos and fear, may take advantage of this moment,” the CAIR statement reads.
    


            Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison lauded Gov. Tim Walz as a “remarkable leader” in a post on X after the governor announced he would drop his bid for a third term.
    


            “Minnesota has benefitted immensely from the compassion he brought to his decades of public service,” Ellison wrote.
    


            He praised the governor's accomplishments, including fighting hunger in Minnesota schools and passing paid family leave.
    


                    “Tim's legacy is one of putting people first and delivering for Minnesotans in every corner of our state, and that's a legacy to be damn proud of,” he went on. “Tim led Minnesota through some of the greatest challenges faced by any governor in living memory.”
                





            Both Walz and Ellison have been called to testify before the Republican-led House Oversight Committee in February.
    


            The decision of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to drop out of his race for reelection is unlikely to take the heat off from allegations that he allowed fraudsters to take root and steal potentially billions of dollars from the state.
    


            The Republican-led House Oversight Committee in Washington says it will continue to call for Walz to appear at a hearing next month investigating the fraud allegations, which have mostly revolved around the Somali community in the Twin Cities.
    


            “Though Tim Walz is not running for governor again, he cannot run from accountability,” Chairman James Comer said in a statement Monday.
    


            The same committee also has called for Minnesota state representatives to appear Wednesday to testify about “fraud and misuse of federal funds.”
    


            The Trump administration announced last week it would freeze federal child care funding for Minnesota unless it received more information by Friday to verify the money is going to legitimate recipients.
    


            Walz continues to face calls from some Republicans to resign, and state House Speaker Lisa Demuth — a GOP gubernatorial candidate — said a party change is needed.
    


            “If Democrats think they can sweep Minnesota's fraud scandal away by swapping out Tim Walz, they are wrong,” she posted Monday on X.
    


            Walz took no questions after reading his statement Monday but promised to say more later.
    


            “Tomorrow, I'll be back with you … and at that time I'll take all your questions,” Walz said.
    


            All eyes now are on US Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
    


            Klobuchar, who has served Minnesota in the Senate for two decades, is “seriously considering” running for governor, a person close to her tells CNN, after Gov. Tim Walz announced Monday his intention to abandon his bid for reelection.
    


            Klobuchar “has been getting a lot of outreach, encouraging her to run,” the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss closely held conversations.
    


            While Klobuchar has offered no timeframe for making her decision, whatever conclusion she reaches will have a domino-like effect on the midterm election map. Minnesota already has a wide-open Senate race, to fill the seat of retiring Sen. Tina Smith, as well as competitive House contests.
    


            Klobuchar met with Walz on Sunday, two people familiar with the meeting told CNN, and she is expected to return to the Senate when it reconvenes Monday evening.
    


            Calling Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz a “dedicated public servant who's spent his career putting others before himself,” the governor of neighboring Wisconsin, Tony Evers, praised Walz after the Minnesota Democrat announced he would not seek a third term reelection in 2026.
    


            “Tim has always been a good friend and a good neighbor to us across the river, and I'm incredibly grateful we've had the opportunity to serve as governors of our states together,” Evers said in a statement.
    


            “I look forward to working with Tim in the days and months ahead as we continue getting good things done for the people of our states,” Evers continued.
    


            Walz announced he was dropping out of the 2026 governor's race in the wake of renewed scrutiny and new investigations into claims of fraud in the use of federal child care funding in multiple Minnesota organizations.
    


            Even as he announced his decision to drop out of the gubernatorial race for a third term, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz defended himself from allegations that he has done too little to address fraud in government funding.
    


            “A single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud should be intolerable,” Walz said during a news conference Monday. “And while there's a role to play for everyone — from the legislature to prosecutors to insurance companies to local and county government — the buck does stop with me.”
    


            Walz — who took no questions despite an earlier statement from his office saying that he would — argued his administration was already making changes in response to investigations.
    


            “We've gone to the legislature time and time again to get more tools to combat fraud. We've fired people who weren't doing their jobs. We've seen people go to jail for stealing from our state,” Walz said. “We've cut off whole streams of funding, in partnership with the federal government, where we saw widespread criminal activity. We've put new locks on the doors of our remaining programs, and we've hired a new head of program integrity to make sure those locks can't be broken.”
    


            Republicans have disputed the idea that Walz has demanded accountability.
    


            “No one's lost their job,” state House Speaker Lisa Demuth said last week. “No one has been publicly disciplined in any way.”
    


            The Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee said Monday he expects Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to still appear for a public hearing next month, even though he is no longer running for reelection.
    


            “Massive fraud of taxpayer dollars occurred on Tim Walz's watch. He's either complicit in this theft or grossly incompetent in preventing it. Though Tim Walz is not running for governor again, he cannot run from accountability,” Chairman James Comer, the Kentucky Republican, said in a statement.
    


            Comer previously announced his panel expects to hear testimony from Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in a hearing on Minnesota fraud allegations on February 10.
    


            The committee has separately called Minnesota state representatives to appear before the panel on Wednesday about “fraud and misuse of federal funds” in the state.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz took no questions at a news conference held hours after announcing he was dropping his reelection bid for a third term.
    


            The governor briefly read the news release put out hours earlier and condemned Republicans, “conspiracy theorist right wing YouTubers,” and President Donald Trump, before promising another news conference tomorrow and said he would take questions at that time.
    


            Speaking at a news conference Monday, Gov. Tim Walz seemed to be largely reading from the statement his office released earlier in the day announcing he would not seek reelection.
    


            He said he was confident he would have won a third term if he stayed in the race, but he had come “to the conclusion that I can't give a political campaign my all.”
    


            The governor's attitude was defiant as he called out what he characterized as politicization of the state's fraud scandals by Republicans.
    


                    “We've got conspiracy theorist right-wing YouTubers breaking into day care centers and demanding access to our children,” he said. “We've got the President of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating child care funding that Minnesotans rely on. It is disgusting. And it is dangerous.”
                





            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's news conference is now starting.
    


            The governor announced he would drop out of his bid for a third term Monday morning, following a scandal from a viral video alleging fraud involving federal child care funding in the state.
    


            Opponents of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz took to social media to pile on after news broke this morning that he would be dropping his bid for a third term.
    


            Nick Shirley, the conservative YouTuber behind the viral video alleging fraud at Minnesota child care facilities, appears to have taken credit for the announcement.
    


            “I ended Tim Walz,” Shirley posted on X soon after the news.
    


            When Walz announced he wouldn't run again, he cited a need to focus on “defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.”
    


            Republicans have sought to blame Walz and Democrats for what they say is a massive abuse of taxpayer dollars. Walz has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
    


            State Rep. Lisa Demuth, speaker of the Minnesota House and Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, said she would defeat any Democrat the party chooses to run against her.
    


            “If Democrats think they can sweep Minnesota's fraud scandal away by swapping out Tim Walz, they are wrong,” she posted on X.
    


            Another Republican member of the Minnesota House, gubernatorial candidate Kristin Robbins, accused Walz of dropping out to avoid the fraud investigations.
    


            “He knows he will lose in November, and would rather give up than take responsibility,” she said.
    


            States will be allowed to verify child care center attendance records and require services up front before releasing federal funds to child care providers, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced this morning, touting a pending change to rules established during the Biden administration.
    


            “The change will roll back provisions in the 2024 Child Care and Development Fund rule that weakened oversight and increased the risk of waste, fraud and abuse in federally funded state child care — including programs now under investigation in Minnesota,” a news release from HHS said.
    


            The 2024 rules required states to base payments on enrollment as opposed to attendance, and gave preference in funding to contracted providers — a practice the pending changes also would end, HHS said.
    


            The proposed changes are subject to a 30-day public comment period, according to HHS.
    


            State officials must supply the federal government with a trove of information about the recipients of child care funding by January 9, an HHS spokesperson told CNN.
    


            The deadline comes after HHS froze all funding for child care in the state, throwing families and providers both into limbo. Typically, the state receives about $185 million annually in federal child care funding, supporting care for 19,000 children.
    


            The federal government has asked the state to provide information about the total amount of funding received by five specific centers as well as documentation about “attendance, inspections, assessments,” according to a bulletin sent to child care providers by the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families and shared with CNN.
    


            Additionally, the state has to provide administrative data – like names and social security numbers – for all recipients of child care funding.
    


            The government may withhold funds “and impose other penalties if satisfactory responses are not provided,” according to the bulletin.
    


            A video posted by conservative content creator Nick Shirley last month featured disputed claims of fraud against specific day care centers but the larger issue of fraudulent use of government funds in Minnesota's Somali community has been investigated for years, and allegations the Walz administration did not do enough to stop it helped lead to the end of his reelection campaign.
    


            The first blockbuster fraud investigation was revealed in 2022, when the Justice Department announced indictments against people associated with Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit group which allegedly pocketed money that was supposed to be going to feed needy children during the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            Charges have been brought against more 78 people associated with the organization, according to the US Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota, with more than $300 million lost. The vast majority of those indicted are of Somali ancestry, although the group's founder – who prosecutors have called the “mastermind” of the deception – is not.
    


            In addition to Feeding Our Future, federal indictments have been brought against at least 20 other people accused in fraud cases related to housing and autism services, Assistant US Attorney Melinda Williams told CNN last week.
    


            President Donald Trump has called Minnesota a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” in Minnesota, announcing plans in November to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Somali residents in the state. In December, ICE launched operations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area to specifically target undocumented Somali immigrants.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is dropping his bid for a third term as the welfare-fraud scandal in his state has intensified, he announced this morning.
    


            “I can't give a political campaign my all,” Walz said in a release. “Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.”
    


            Walz has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but Republicans have sought to blame him and Democrats for the massive abuse of taxpayer dollars.
    


            In his statement announcing his decision, Walz took aim at President Donald Trump, accusing him of seeking to politicize the scandal by attacking the Somali population in Minnesota.
    


            “I won't mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” he said. “They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors.”
    


            Walz is scheduled to hold a news conference today at 11 a.m. CT (noon ET) in St. Paul.

DHS public affairs assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin discusses the capture of Nicolas Maduro and the Trump administration's continuing crackdown on illegal immigration on ‘The Big Weekend Show.' 

Venezuelan authorities have been ordered to find and arrest anyone involved in supporting the military operation that led to the arrest of Nicolás Maduro.

A state of emergency decree issued Saturday, but published Monday, orders police to ""immediately begin the national search and capture of everyone involved in the promotion or support for the armed attack by the United States,"" according to the text of the decree, Reuters reported. 

It was not clear what charges could be levied against those taken into custody. 

Maduro made his first court appearance Monday in New York, days after he and his wife were arrested by U.S. forces over the weekend.

Both have been charged by the Justice Department with narco-terrorism and other offenses. 

""I am innocent. I am not guilty of anything that is written here,"" Maduro said in court as the charges against him were read.

In Maduro's absence, Delcy Rodríguez, his former number two, has been sworn in as the interim president of Venezuela. Rodriguez, 56, has long been a confidant and backer of Maduro. 

She was the country's vice president from 2018 through Sunday. 

Despite denouncing the U.S. military operation, Rodriguez said in a Sunday social media post that the country aspires towards balanced and respectful international relations between Caracas and Washington.

Iranian-American journalist and activist Masih Alinejad says that President Donald Trump's message to Iran gave people a ‘strong message' of hope on ‘The Story.' 

President Donald Trump was photographed with a signed ""Make Iran Great Again"" hat alongside Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., as nationwide demonstrations in Iran continued against the regime's political and economic corruption.

In a photo posted Monday morning on Graham's X account, the senator could be seen flashing a thumbs up next to Trump as the president holds the black hat emblazoned with his signature.

""Another great day with @POTUS who has brought America back, stronger than ever, at home and abroad,"" Graham wrote. ""God bless our Commander in Chief and all of the brave men and women who serve under him.""

""I'm proud to be an American,"" the post continued. ""God bless and protect the brave people of Iran who are standing up to tyranny.""

Demonstrations have spread to more than 220 locations across 26 of Iran's 31 provinces, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported early Monday. At least 20 people have been killed, the group said, and more than 990 have been arrested.

What began as protests over economic hardship quickly escalated, with demonstrators chanting anti-government slogans.

Iran's collapsing currency has fueled a deepening economic crisis. Prices for staples such as meat and rice have surged, while the country grapples with inflation of around 40%.

In December, the government introduced a new pricing tier for its heavily subsidized gasoline, raising the cost of some of the world's cheapest fuel and adding to public anger. Tehran has signaled that further increases may follow, with officials now set to review fuel prices every three months.

The protests have continued even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday said that ""rioters must be put in their place.""

Secretary of War Pete Hegseth issued a letter of censure and moved to demote retired captain and sitting Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) over a video he and other lawmakers made warning service members not to carry out illegal orders.

Hegseth announced the decision on Monday, saying that the department “has initiated retirement grade determination proceedings under 10 U.S.C. § 1370(f), with reduction in his retired grade resulting in a corresponding reduction in retired pay.” He also issued a letter of censure, which he said will be in Kelly's permanent military personnel file.

There was a possibility the review could result in Hegseth recalling Kelly to active duty to court-martial him, though he made no mention of it in his Monday announcement.

Kelly and five other Democrats, who had either served in the military or intelligence community, participated in the video, which was released in November 2025. In the video, they specifically reminded service members of their legal obligation not to follow illegal orders, though Hegseth and President Donald Trump have accused them of trying to sow doubts to have service members question their orders.

Kelly responded to the letter, vowing to “fight” the demotion. 

“My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,” Kelly said. “Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve. Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way. It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.” 

“If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn't get it. I will fight this with everything I've got — not for myself, but to send a message back that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don't get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government,” he concluded.

Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), Rep. Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-PA), and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA) were in the video as well.

Hegseth said Kelly — the only one of the group still under the Uniform Code of Military Justice — violated Articles 133 and 144. Article 133 is about “conduct unbecoming an officer,” and Article 144 is more of a broad catch-all of more than 50 unique criminal offenses.

Kelly now has 30 days to submit a response.

“Almost anything can fall into the nebulous of conduct unbecoming of an officer as long as it's considered something that's bringing dishonor or discredit to the military,” Sean Timmons, the managing partner at Tully Rinckey PLLC with a focus on military law, previously told the Washington Examiner.

Hegseth did not specifically mention Article 94 of the UCMJ, which is the statute regarding “sedition,” defined as having the “with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of lawful civil authority, creates, in concert with any other person, revolt, violence, or other disturbance against that authority is guilty of sedition.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

In Sentimental Value, the writer-director Joachim Trier probes the real purpose of confessional art.

Separating the art from the artist can be easier debated than done. In 1967, Roland Barthes infamously argued in his essay “The Death of the Author” that a writer's biography should be irrelevant to the meaning or value of their work. In 1983, Nora Ephron asserted the opposite in her novel, Heartburn: “Everything is copy.”

Today's pop culture has tended to agree with Ephron's take: Confession fuels the biggest songs; celebrity memoirs dominate best-seller lists. Whether art is inextricable from the artist is central to many of the buzzy dramas vying for trophies during this year's awards season, too. Hamnet imagines the intimate origins of Shakespeare's famed tragedy Hamlet. Blue Moon and Jay Kelly follow men who have infused their work with so much of their personal life that they find it hard to exist outside of their career. These movies observe how art can function as therapy for the creator, extracting a truth that they couldn't grasp otherwise.

Sentimental Value, an emotionally layered film up for eight Golden Globes this weekend, complicates that perspective. It follows a family of storytellers: Gustav (played by Stellan Skarsgård) is a celebrated director hoping to cast his estranged daughter Nora (Renate Reinsve), an actor, in his first project in 15 years. Nora's sister, Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), is a historian who helps Gustav with researching his script. The tender drama is the latest from the Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Trier who, along with his co-writer, Eskil Vogt, has made plenty of features about creative types. The protagonists of 2006's Reprise are novelists. The story of 2015's Louder Than Bombs hinges on the work of a war photographer. The aimless heroine of their 2021 Oscar-nominated romantic dramedy, The Worst Person in the World, abandons medical school to pursue writing and photography instead.

Read: The Worst Person in the World is devastatingly relatable

Focusing on artistic characters became a pattern—enough that conceiving of Sentimental Value, in part, as a movie about moviemaking brought “a certain shame to Eskil and me,” Trier told me recently, grinning sheepishly at the memory. “We were like, ‘Oh no, are we really doing a film about actors and directors?'” The conceit, they worried, could come off as extremely narrow; the plot's emphasis on the production of Gustav's movie could pull focus away from the emotional stakes, turning Sentimental Value into commentary on the film industry instead.

But when I watched the film, I found myself, like many viewers, wondering something different: whether the father-daughter relationships depicted echoed any of Trier's own feelings about becoming a parent. Those reactions didn't surprise the filmmaker. Since the movie's debut at the Cannes Film Festival, Trier has spoken often about how having children affected his mindset going into Sentimental Value. In one interview, he conceded that the movie was in part about “exorcising fears” about fatherhood; when we spoke, however, he seemed to bristle at that phrasing. He wasn't trying to extract his personal anxieties and commit them to celluloid, he clarified. Making his private thoughts so public in his work, he said, “would be my nightmare.”

If anything, Sentimental Value is about that tension between wanting to explain the origin of your ideas and wanting to distance yourself from your own creations. It also interrogates the cost of drawing from specific, individual experiences. “You deserve something more personal,” Gustav tells Nora when pitching her his screenplay, failing to notice how dismissive the comment sounds of her career. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of her artistry, too: Everything Nora does on stage has always been “personal.” When embodying a character, she can express herself more authentically, something Gustav would know if he ever saw her perform. But Nora suffers from severe stage fright as a result; being able to access her feelings under a fictional guise doesn't mean she's necessarily embracing them. The truth behind the most intimate art can remain a mystery, Sentimental Value posits—even for the artist.

A film is “lifeless,” Trier said, unless its viewers discover what is personal to them as they watch. “You have a wonderful word in English that we don't have in Norwegian,” he said, “and that is verisimilitude, the idea of some sort of contract with the viewer that conveys a sense of truthfulness, yet it's a construct. It's a code.” The goal, in other words, is for the story to feel genuine without being explicitly so.

That can happen when a performer imbues her character with her own nature. In one of the film's most affecting moments, Agnes visits a melancholic Nora, who has been unwilling to perform after Gustav moved forward with his movie without her; he recruited an American star, Rachel Kemp (Elle Fanning), to play the part he'd written for Nora, and has immediately bonded with Rachel. After Agnes encourages Nora to read their father's script, the sisters marvel at how Gustav reveals, in his writing, a side of himself they'd never seen. Nora goes on to wonder how Agnes turned out stable in such a forbidding household. “I had you,” Agnes replies, before crawling onto Nora's bed to embrace her. Agnes then whispers, “I love you”—a line that Lilleaas came up with on the spot.

Read: The sad dads of Hollywood

The ad-lib dramatically changed the scene from how Trier and Vogt had written it. The dynamic between the sisters was originally more antagonistic: Agnes would be carefree, the one in the family hoping to “make everyone happy through humor and avoidance,” Trier told me—much to her sister's annoyance. But Lilleaas, Trier explained, conveyed a “calm, grounded, truthful honesty” when they first met, outside of a formal audition. Her demeanor inspired him: “I could look into her eyes as we talked and I felt, You're real, like really grounded. And then I thought, Let's reinterpret Agnes.”

Realism and fiction occasionally do combine in Sentimental Value in more anticipated ways. The film is purposefully a family affair for Trier: His two children appear briefly as Nora and Agnes in flashbacks. Gustav's screenplay is inspired by memories of his mother's imprisonment in a Nazi camp; her experiences echo those of Trier's paternal grandfather, the filmmaker Erik Løchen. (Trier has reviewed the files on his grandfather's captivity the same way Agnes does in one scene, studying the reports about how her grandmother was tortured.) And the actor who narrates the opening scene, describing an essay Nora wrote as a child that anthropomorphized the family home, is Bente Børsum. She's a celebrated performer in Norway who starred in Løchen's 1959 film, The Chasers.

Trier doesn't expect audiences to know any of the above. Sentimental Value avoids explaining, for instance, who the speaker is in relation to the characters on-screen, let alone the fact that a younger Børsum had seen her mother taken to a German camp, too. “Her voice held a lot of weight for me,” Trier said of his choice to include the 91-year-old actor. The film draws power from the subtle specificity; Børsum's voice, low and knowing, comes suffused with an ineffable meaning. The viewer immediately feels encouraged to pay closer attention to the narration.

These veiled decisions inform the movie Gustav eventually directs as well: He'd wanted the shoot to take place inside Agnes and Nora's childhood home, but eventually settles for a reproduction on a back lot, a series of ceiling-less facades. A viewer wouldn't be able to tell that it's a set, but the care and history Gustav has brought to it lends it an abstract profundity. The opportunity afforded by art for artists to examine—or just merely observe—themselves is essential. “I need to distance myself from the characters to be able to create them,” Trier said. What's on-screen is akin to “a counter-life,” he explained. “It's not intended to say, ‘Hey, look at me!' It's saying, ‘I'm doing this about something that's deeply personal, and yet I feel that it's over there.'”

A film such as Sentimental Value, then, operates like a time capsule for its maker: It reveals its potency to Trier only in the rearview, when he revisits what had been on his mind. “It's like conversations with friends,” Trier said. “If someone says, ‘I sense around our latest coffees over the last year, that you talk a lot about this. What's the purpose?' I'm like, ‘What do you mean, purpose?'” He laughed. “Shit, I don't know. But I know I care about it.”

Jason Lemkin, known to some as the Godfather of SaaS, says the time has come to push the limits of AI in the workplace.

In practice, Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business founders, said on Lenny's Podcast recently that this means he will stop hiring humans in his sales department.

Instead, SaaStr is going all in on agents, which are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.

He said the company now has 20 AI agents automating tasks once handled by a team of 10 sales development representatives and account executives.

That move from an entirely human workforce to an agent-based workforce was rapid.

In May, SaaStr had just one AI agent in production that it used for various digital tasks, Lemkin said. That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit.

Lemkin said he turned to his chief AI officer and said, ""We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're going to push the limits with agents.""

Lemkin's calculus was that it just wasn't worth the cost of hiring another junior sales representative for a $150,000 a year position who would eventually quit, when he could use a loyal AI agent instead.

Amelia Lerutte, SaaStr's chief AI officer, told Business Insider by email that by June, the company began ramping up the number of agents it had in production.

""We had only 1 non-core agent at the time with Delphi, but didn't go deep on 2 to 20+ until the beginning of June,"" she said. ""It was a conscious choice after their departure to reallocate some (but not all) head count spend to agents.""

At the SaaStr office, the 10 desks that once belonged to humans on the go-to-market team are now labeled with the names of agents, like ""Quali for qualified,"" ""Arty for artisan,"" and ""Repli for Replit,"" Lemkin said.

Lemkin said SaaStr is training its agents on its best humans.

""Train an agent with your best person, and best script, then that agent can start to become a version of your best salesperson,"" he said.

SaaStr's process is similar to how Vercel, the cloud-based platform for developers, trained a sales agent off its top performer for six weeks by documenting every step of their work, and then building an agent to mimic their process.

Many companies are experimenting with AI agents, but risks remain. One of the big ones is the threat of data leaks and cybercrime.

""AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them,"" Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, recently told Wired.

All of that access creates more potential attack points for cybercriminals.

Security threats aside, Lemkin said that the net productivity of agents is about the same as humans. However, he said, agents are more efficient and can scale — just like software.

Deborah Carrillo made a classic lawyer pivot. After a decade at a white-shoe firm, she left to join one of her clients, the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures.

What came next is far less common. Menlo has elevated Carrillo, its general counsel and only in-house lawyer, to partner after nearly six years with the firm — a rare distinction inside a venture fund.

Carrillo's promotion suggests the role of the legal department is shifting in the venture industry. Carrillo said she's at the table for weekly partner meetings where they pitch deals and bat around ideas.

""My voice is valued,"" she said.

Lawyers who go in-house often swap the prestige of firm life for steadier hours and a different kind of influence. At venture firms, general counsels typically haven't been on a path to ownership. Carrillo's new title puts her closer to the upside, giving her a larger claim on future profits.

Menlo Ventures is one of the oldest investment shops in Silicon Valley, with $6.8 billion in assets under management. It backed Anthropic early on and counts Lovable, Chime, and Carta among its breakout investments.

Other firms that have granted the partner title to general counsels over the years include Lightspeed and Bessemer Venture Partners.

Before joining Menlo, Carrillo was a partner at the New York law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, where she advised startups and venture firms. She previously taught math in public schools.

As the firm's one-person legal shop, Carrillo helps structure investments and funds and keeps the machinery of compliance running smoothly.

Increasingly, that means translating geopolitics into go or no-go calls: flagging risks that could trigger blowback from the government, and, amid new federal restrictions on foreign investments, digging into whether a portfolio company's ownership traces back to Chinese nationals.

""I help people make the best decision and execute on those decisions,"" Carrillo said.

Carrillo's advice for young lawyers looking to make a move in-house: ""Follow people and follow joy.""

Deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro appeared in a New York court on Monday afternoon, saying he had been ""kidnapped"" with his wife by U.S. forces from their home in Caracas, and that he was a ""prisoner of war,"" as he pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking charges 

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who is also charged in the case, have been held since they were taken from Venezuela on Saturday after a U.S. strike on the country at the orders of U.S. President Donald Trump. Flores also pleaded not guilty.

""I'm innocent. I am not guilty of anything,"" Maduro repeatedly said through a translator to Judge Alvin Hellerstein during his appearance in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

Flores said, ""I am first lady of the Republic of Venezuela.""

""Not guilty. Completely innocent,"" Flores replied when asked for her plea.

Flores had a large bruise on her forehead. Her attorney requested that she get medical attention from jail officials for injuries she sustained during her capture Saturday, including an X-ray for her ribs, which are believed to be broken or severely bruised.

The couple agreed to remain in jail without bail for now, but could submit a bail application in the future.

Hellerstein set the next court date for the case on March 17.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, whose office is prosecuting the couple, during an interview Monday morning on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" said, ""From the perspective of where I sit, my people and I are completely comfortable with this prosecution.""

Defense lawyer Barry Pollack represented Maduro at the hearing.. Pollack previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Assange's federal criminal case.

Pollack said during the hearing said Maduro ""is head of a sovereign state and entitled to the privilege"" from that status. Pollack also said there were ""questions about the legality of his military  abduction"" and that there would be ""voluminous"" court filings addressing that issue.

Flores is being represented by Mark Donnelly, a former federal prosecutor in Texas.

Maduro, 63, is charged in a federal indictment with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. He has previously denied the allegations.

Flores, 69, is charged with the cocaine conspiracy and weapons counts.

Maduro, whom the indictment refers to as the ""illegitimate ruler"" of Venezuela as a result of fraudulent election results, is accused of partnering with co-conspirators, narcotics traffickers, and narco-terrorist groups to import tons of cocaine into the United States.

Maduro and his wife appeared at around noon before Judge Hellerstein. 

""Nicolas Maduro Moros, the defendant, now sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug  trafficking,"" the 25-page indictment alleges.

""This cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,"" the indictment says.

Among the alleged overt acts detailed in the indictment is a meeting that Flores attended in approximately 2007, in which she purportedly ""accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to broker a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres.""

""The drug trafficker later arranged to pay a monthly bribe to Reverol Torres, in addition to approximately $100,000 for each flight that was transporting cocaine to ensure the flight's safe passage, a portion of which was then paid to Flores de Maduro,"" the indictment alleges. 

""Reverol Torres was charged with narcotics offenses in the Eastern District of New York and is a fugitive.""

The other defendants charged in the same indictment are not in U.S. custody.

Those defendants are Maduro's son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guerra; Diosdado Cabello Rondon; Ramon Rodriguez Chacin; and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores.

Cabello is Venezuela's interior minister, a post previously held by Rodriguez.

Guerrero has been identified as the leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

The Trump administration has faced questions about Maduro's apprehension in his own country, given Trump's recent pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted in 2024 of conspiring with drug traffickers and using his government position to help hundreds of tons of cocaine enter the United States.

E-commerce logistics startup Stord has bought CEVA Logistics subsidiary Shipwire, the company said Monday. 

The deal, which closed Jan. 1 for a undisclosed amount, adds 12 new locations to Stord's growing logistics network and about 60 new employees. Shipwire is an AI fulfillment platform used by e-commerce firms. 

""This is a great network, great customers, great team to pull onto our technology and our combined scale,"" CEO Sean Henry told CNBC. ""And with that scale, it spins our flywheel up.""

The deal also brings dozens of new large and mid-market customers and a host of AI-powered internal execution, planning and routing tools to Stord's network, he added. 

Stord will look to partner with CEVA's 120 million square foot network across 170 countries.

This is the seventh acquisition from the Atlanta-based startup that's challenging e-commerce giants such as Amazon by building out a network of infrastructure to help lower shipping costs and speed up deliveries for smaller merchants. 

Stord is part of a crowded market of startups that provide logistics and fulfillment services to online businesses, including ShipBob, Flexport's Deliverr, Cart.com and Shipmonk. 

Demand for these services has only continued to grow as more consumers shop online, and as merchants increasingly operate storefronts on multiple platforms. 

Amazon has sought to capitalize on the trend by offering a competing service that lets businesses tap into its network to ship orders placed on other sites, called multi-channel fulfillment.

Stord has been on an expansion spree.

In May, Stord bought third-party delivery company and UPS subsidiary Ware2Go for an undisclosed amount earlier this year. 

The company previously acquired Pitney Bowes' e-commerce fulfillment business and freight and logistics platform ProPack in 2024. Stord recently announced a major investment plan in Kentucky and tech platform Penny Black. 

Henry told CNBC that the company is looking to make more acquisitions like Shipwire over the coming months and is eyeing expansions into Australia and Asia. Stord's current network includes facilities in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and the Netherlands. 

Last year, Stord raised $200 million at $1.5 billion valuation. Major investors include Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Salesforce Ventures and Strike Capital.

Stord was founded in 2015 by 18-year-old Henry, who dropped out of the Georgia Institute of Technology to pursue the prestigious Thiel Fellowship, which was founded by Peter Thiel. 

The two-year program currently pays aspiring entrepreneurs $200,000 to quit college to build their startups, according to its website. Famous fellows have included design software firm Figma's Dylan Field, Anthropic's Chris Olah and ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin.

Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Starknet is back online after suffering a block production issue that led to more than four hours of downtime early Monday. 

The first report of slow block production took place just before 5:00 am ET, according to the network's status page. Around that time, the network's mainnet block production was halted as developers investigated the issue. 

“Starknet mainnet block production is temporarily paused while we investigate a proving error observed on a transaction,” a message shared in the network's Telegram community read. “Out of caution we halted sequencing while we verify chain safety and state consistency. Transactions will not be processed during this period. We will share updates as we learn more.”

According to another message in the Starknet Telegram around 7:00 am ET, a bug was identified and the team began working on additional testing, validation, and downstream impact assessment. 

Ultimately, the blockchain was reverted to block 5187263, and around 9:00 am ET, the incident was resolved and the network resumed operational status. 

“Starknet is back online and fully operational. Transactions submitted between 9:24 am and 9:42 am UTC may not have been processed properly,” the network posted on X. “A retrospective, including full timeline, root causes, and long-term prevention measures will follow.”

Additional details about the outage have not yet been revealed. A representative for the network pointed Decrypt to the network's post on X

Monday's downtime marks the second operational outage for the layer-2 network in the last few months. Following the network's Grinta upgrade in September, Starknet experienced more than five hours of downtime and required two chain reorganizations, which reverted approximately 80 minutes of transactions.

Though primarily known as an Ethereum scaling network, Starknet added Bitcoin staking to its feature set in September, allowing users to stake the top crypto asset by market cap natively while earning STRK—its native token—in rewards. 

The price of STRK was not significantly impacted by the downtime, showing a less than 1% dip over the last 24 hours to a recent price of $0.090, still up about 11% on the week. Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, is up about 2% on the day to $3,192, rising nearly 9% in the last seven days.

Writer by choice, CryptoCurrency Writer, and Researcher by chance.  Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto “Enthusiast” but trust me I'm getting there.

Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO of SBI Holdings, has shared a thoughtful message linking ancient history with modern technology, as Japan prepares for the rare “Fire Horse” year of 2026, a cycle that appears only once every 60 years. In his remarks, Kitao opened up about how this period is often seen as powerful but demanding, especially for businesses enjoying success.

Kitao explained that even when a company is doing well, danger can quietly build up. He warned that arrogance and overconfidence are the biggest threats during periods of growth. According to him, strong leadership requires clear judgment and courage, especially when things seem to be going smoothly.

Looking beyond 2026, Kitao stressed the importance of thinking in decades, not quarters. He reminded readers that as far back as 2018, SBI identified AI and blockchain as the technologies that would drive the biggest changes in society. Since then, the group has consistently invested in these areas and built a full crypto ecosystem.

Additionally, Ripple Labs received a special mention. Kitao revealed that SBI invested in Ripple around ten years ago, acquiring roughly 10% of the company. Today, that early decision has paid off, with blockchain and crypto-related businesses becoming a major source of revenue for the SBI Group. This long-term partnership shows how early belief in blockchain technology is now shaping real-world financial systems.

“Furthermore, it was about ten years ago that we invested in Ripple Labs in the U.S. and acquired approximately 10% of its shares. Needless to say, these fields currently play a major role in the SBI Group's revenue stream,” he wrote.

The SBI chief also described 2026 as a year when hidden problems come into the open. Long-ignored issues, he said, will become impossible to ignore. He pointed to recent global and Japanese examples where long-standing allegations are now being exposed. His message was simple: businesses must stay honest, disciplined, and careful in their actions.

NFT Paris and RWA Paris 2026 were canceled by their organizers. The events stopped after running for four years following the late 2025 market crash. 

The organizers of NFT Paris and RWA Paris 2026 canceled the events, citing the pressures of the crypto market crash. The meetup was held for four years in a row, even during the 2022-2023 bear market. 

In 2025, as crypto sentiment shifted, older narratives like NFTs were affected deeply. NFTs remain near all-time lows in terms of activity and interest. RWA Paris was also canceled, despite the rising popularity of RWA 

‘The market collapse hit us hard. Despite drastic cost cuts and months of trying to make it work, we couldn't pull it off this year,' announced the team. 

Tickets will be refunded, but the organizers may not refund all sponsors, as the event was progressing until running out of funds. 

The cancellation of one of the top NFT events brings more focus on the issue of failed collections and low activity. 

In 2025, NFT creation continued, boosting the total number of collections. However, trading activity slowed down significantly. 

NFT volumes already varied widely by chain, with Ethereum remaining the most active network for legacy collections. Ethereum still carries $2.74M in NFT activity. Other chains include Solana, Polygon, Cardano, and Immutable. 

Cardano and Bitcoin collectibles have gone through more active periods, depending on the popularity of specific projects. In the past 30 days, Bitcoin briefly held the leading position as the most active chain for collectibles. 

NFTs on most L2 or new L1 chains are even less active, with practically negligible volumes. OpenSea continues to carry traffic for NFTs on Base, which relies on low transaction fees and low-cost activity. 

NFTs as an idea still exist and are issued side by side with tokens, as an addition to games, or as community swag. At the same time, NFTs no longer store value and are rarely resold in high-profile auctions. 

Crypto Punks, Bored Apes, and Pudgy Penguins are still the top 3 NFT collections. For CryptoPunks, the price floor has fallen close to its all-time lows in 2024, at around 29 ETH. 

Ape NFT are down to an all-time low floor of 5.52 ETH, while Penguins had a recovery to 5.15 ETH. 

In the short term, NFTs still have price floor rallies or achieve high-value sales. Some of the NFTs are also part of treasuries and are changing hands at relatively high valuations. NFT building continues, but the market is extremely illiquid. 

The cancellation of conferences is seen as a lagging indicator, as the NFT market bottom was already established. At the same time, building on-chain transactions and activity are expanding for new collections. Despite some collections crashing to zero, NFTs may make a comeback in another form.

Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin, in the final days of 2025 and early days of 2026 lifted both its bitcoin holdings and cash reserve.

Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company added 1,287 bitcoin for just over $116 million, or an average price of about $90,000 each. Firm holdings are now 673,783 bitcoin purchased for $50.55 billion, or an average price of $75,026 each.

The company last week also added $62 million to its cash reserves, bringing that total to $2.25 billion.

The boosts to both the cash and BTC reserves were funded through the sales of common stock.

The cash reserve is intended to fund dividend payments on the company's perpetual preferred equity. At current levels, Strategy has enough cash on hand to fund 32.5 months of dividend coverage, according to the company dashboard.

Alongside news of the balance sheet additions, the company disclosed $17.44 billion in unrealized losses on its bitcoin holdings in the fourth quarter — not surprising given BTC's decline from the $120,000 area at the start of October to $88,000 to close the year.

MSTR shares were up 4.5% in premarket action alongside a weekend rise in the price of bitcoin to the current $92,900.

Bitcoin and the wider crypto market has started to wake up recently, but underlying liquidity conditions appear strikingly weak, according to onchain analytics firm Glassnode — a dynamic that echoes concerns raised in a CoinDesk analysis in November on hollow crypto market liquidity following the October crash.

Glassnode's latest data shows that both bitcoin spot trading volume and aggregate altcoin spot volume have sunk to their lowest readings since November 2023, even as prices have climbed — a divergence that typically points to thinning market participation and fragile demand underneath the recent strength.

Spot volume is a metric that assesses actual buying and selling activity on exchanges, a barometer of real trading interest. 

Traditionally, healthy price advances are supported by rising volumes, as fresh capital and buyers enter the market. But in this case, spot volumes have not only failed to increase alongside prices, they've fallen to year-long lows, underscoring a lack of broad participation behind the moves.

This assessment reiterates issues raised in a CoinDesk research piece published in November, which documented how liquidity across centralized exchanges — including bitcoin and ether market depth — failed to recover fully after the October liquidation cascade. 

The research highlighted that post-crash, order-book depth remained structurally lower than before the sell-off, suggesting a new, thinner baseline of liquidity that leaves markets more vulnerable to exaggerated price reactions.

The October event, which resulted in $19 billion worth of leveraged positions being wiped out in a matter of hours, did more than unwind overextended bets. It reshaped the market's underlying structure, leading to a sustained pullback in resting liquidity as market-making firms and liquidity providers pulled back, making markets shallower and less capable of absorbing large trades without meaningful price impact.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $93,500 after rising by 7.5% since Jan. 1, but the move on minimal volume is presenting traders with a number of warning signs.

This breakthrough in plasma stability brings the dream of endless energy even closer.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Tungsten, represented unexpectedly by the letter W on the periodic table of elements (for wolframite, an ore where tungsten is often found), is proving to be quite the wonder material for fusion reactors. In April 2024, the Korea Institute of Fusion Energy announced that its KSTAR fusion reactor successfully sustained plasma at 100 million degrees Celsius thanks in large part to its Tungsten divertor (basically a tokamak exhaust port). 

Recently, another reactor in France reported a major tungsten breakthrough: its toroidal tokamak, clad in tungsten, successfully sustained a reaction at 50 million degrees Celsius for a full six minutes at higher energies and densities than its carbon-made competitors. 

The reactor, based in Provence, France, is called the Tungsten (W) Environment in Steady-state Tokamak (WEST), and it's the successor of the Tore Supra that sported an interior of graphite tiles. 

While carbon has many benefits—chief among them being its high melting point—it may not be the best go-to material of choice for commercial reactors. That's because carbon can retain fuel in the wall because of its relatively high atomic mass compared to tungsten. This doesn't work because reactors also need to breed tritium from these reactions to create a sustainable fuel supply. 

But tungsten has its own challenges, as even a small piece of it can cool the plasma. And when you're trying to sustain temperatures seven times hotter than the sun, that's not a good thing. 

“The tungsten-wall environment is far more challenging than using carbon,” Luis Delgado-Aparicio, the head of advanced projects at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory that is a partner on the WEST project, said in a press statement. “This is, simply, the difference between trying to grab your kitten at home versus trying to pet the wildest lion.”

In order to record these results, the WEST team relied on a new hybrid photon-counting technology to monitor the plasma. Because tokamaks radiate x-rays, the set-up needed detectors that could study and analyze the plasma while contained, and the multi-energy soft X-ray (ME-SXR) camera delivered. 

“We use the emitted X-rays and their intensity for plasma diagnostics, which allow us to understand how it moves, but also to measure its temperature, velocity, pressure, and density,” Delgado-Aparicio said in a press statement. “This is why we depend on reliable X-ray detectors in our work.”

The reactor is part of the Coordination on International Challenges on Long duration OPeration (CICLOP) program with the International Atomic Energy Agency. “This energy-resolving camera will open a new route in terms of analysis,” said the chair of CICLOP, Xavier Litaudon. “We will have the ability to measure the tungsten inside the plasma and to understand the transport of tungsten from the wall to the core of the plasma.”

Like KSTAR in Korea, the WEST reactor's primary goal is to lay the groundwork for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), another nearby fusion reactor in France.

In 2023, ITER decided to switch the material of the reactor's inner wall from beryllium to, you guessed it, tungsten. ITER's fusion neighbor, WEST, will hopefully have lots of Tungsten data to provide once ITER is fully operational.

Measuring the density profile and mass concentration of dark-matter haloes is a key test of the standard cold dark matter paradigm. Such objects are dark and thus challenging to characterize, but they can be studied via gravitational lensing. Recently, a million-solar-mass object was discovered superposed on an extended and extremely thin gravitational arc. Here we report on extensive tests of various assumptions for the mass density profile and redshift of this object. We find that models that best describe the data have two components: an unresolved point mass of radius ≤10 pc centred on an extended mass distribution with an almost constant surface density out to a truncation radius of 139 pc. These properties do not resemble any known astronomical object. However, if the object is dark matter dominated, its structure is incompatible with cold dark matter models but may be compatible with a self-interacting dark-matter halo where the central region has collapsed to form a black hole. This detection could thus carry substantial implications for our current understanding of dark matter.

Dark matter makes up 85% of cosmic matter, but its nature is still unknown. The cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, in which dark matter consists of massive non-relativistic, collisionless elementary particles, agrees well with a wide variety of astrophysical observations. However, it remains largely untested on sub-galactic scales. One prediction of this model is that cosmic structure formed through a hierarchical bottom-up process. As a result, a large population of low-mass dark-matter haloes (down to planetary mass scales) is expected to exist both (1) as sub-haloes in massive galaxy and cluster haloes and (2) in the field, with mass functions and mass density profiles that have been well characterized through extensive numerical simulations (see, for example, ref. 1). Modifications of CDM in which dark-matter particles have a non-negligible thermal velocity at early times (that is, warm dark matter (WDM)) can predict orders of magnitude fewer low-mass haloes, and these have significantly less concentrated mass density profiles (see, for example, refs. 2,3). The reduction of the number of haloes and their concentration is directly related to the mass of the WDM particle.

Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), where the particles have both gravitational and non-gravitational interactions, can redistribute energy and momentum within haloes, modifying their dark-matter distribution and thus creating more diverse density profiles than in CDM (see, for example, refs. 4,5,6,7,8). If the self-interaction cross-section is high enough, haloes can evolve to have a highly concentrated density profile at the centre. Such objects form via a runaway contraction process, known as the gravo-thermal catastrophe, or core collapse9,10,11, and can be considerably more centrally concentrated than CDM haloes of the same mass. Core collapse rapidly leads to the formation of a central black hole, which, unlike in CDM models, is not dependent on complex and uncertain baryonic processes. Therefore, directly measuring the number and density profile of dark-matter haloes at low masses (below 108M⊙) can robustly discriminate between dark-matter models. These objects are expected to be dark matter dominated, and most should be completely dark. They can thus only be studied with a gravitational probe, such as strong gravitational lensing.

The JVAS B1938+666 system comprises a massive elliptical galaxy at redshift zlens = 0.881 that gravitationally lenses a powerful radio source at redshift zsrc = 2.059 (refs. 12,13,14,15,16). At near-infrared wavelengths (2.1 μm, observed frame), the host galaxy of the radio source forms an almost complete Einstein ring13,15, against which, a (1.9 ± 0.1) × 108M⊙ dark object (where M⊙ is the mass of the Sun) has been detected via its gravitational lensing effect17. The radio source was observed with the global Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network at 1.7 GHz (observed frame), revealing a spectacular and very thin gravitational arc extending over about 200 mas with a width of at most a few milliarcseconds18. This arc is clearly separated on the sky from the infrared Einstein ring, and a gravitational imaging analysis of the 1.7-GHz visibility data by Powell et al.19 detected (at 26σ) the gravitational effects of a second perturber (detection \({\mathcal{V}}\)) that has no obvious luminous counterpart in near-infrared W. M. Keck Telescope adaptive optics data. Powell et al.19 estimated a mass of ≈ 106M⊙ for this object under the assumptions that it lies within the lens galaxy and that its mass profile is well described by a truncated singular isothermal sphere. For clarity, we note that ‘gravitational imaging' refers to the lens modelling technique in which low-mass haloes are ‘imaged' as regularized pixellated corrections to the otherwise smooth lensing potential. This concept was first introduced by Koopmans20. The term is sometimes erroneously used to describe detections obtained with methods that assume a parametrized model for the perturber mass distribution.

We apply the lens modelling code PRONTO21,22,23,24,25,26, extended to allow the analysis of high-angular resolution interferometric data, to investigate the likely nature of detection \({\mathcal{V}}\). We test and compare a wide variety of different parametric models for its mass density profile and redshift using the logarithmic Bayesian evidence (\(\ln {\mathcal{E}}\), that is, the natural logarithm of the probability of a model given the data). These models are chosen to span the most likely candidates for the nature of this unprecedentedly low-mass object: a compact nucleus or black hole, described by a point mass; a globular cluster, described by a King or Plummer profile; a dark-matter halo or sub-halo, described by a conventional Navarro–Frenk–White profile, a truncated singular isothermal profile or a broken power-law profile; and an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy, described by a Sérsic profile. We consider both uninformative priors for the parameters and priors based on observed systems. We also consider composite models that superpose an unresolved central component (a black hole or compact nucleus) on an extended component. We also compare models with the perturber within the lens (at a redshift of 0.881) with models where it is at an unknown redshift along the line of sight.

In total, we tested 23 different models (Tables 1 and 2 and Methods). The best-fitting model (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1) is an object at the main lens redshift made up of a point mass and a uniform, face-on disc (or the equivalent limits of the Sérsic and broken power-law profiles). We designate this as our reference model and give the evidence for other models as \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}\) relative to it. However, we note that this model has a sharp surface density cut-off at the boundary (139 pc), which is challenging to reconcile with the profiles of known astrophysical systems. This may reflect some inadequacy of our main lens model at these small scales, or some un-modelled line-of-sight effect that modifies the surface brightness of the radio arc on scales larger than the low-mass perturber. The best astrophysically plausible model we have found for the extended component is a Plummer sphere, but this is already disfavoured by \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-17\). A model with no perturber has \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-388\), corresponding to 28σ for Gaussian statistics.

The vertical lines represent the 20 and 90 pc radii, which is also where the different models most closely agree with each other. The horizontal lines are the corresponding values of Mcyl for the uniform disk and point mass (UD+PM) model. In the legend, models appear in order of decreasing Bayes factor. Note that the top two models, that is, a uniform disk with a point mass and a Sérsic profile with a point mass (denoted by UD+PM and SER+PM, respectively), are plotted as a single curve and uncertainty band since the differences between them are too small to be easily distinguished at this plotting scale. Also shown are the cylindrical mass profiles for a broken power law with a point mass (bPL+PM), a Plummer sphere with a point mass (PLU+PM), a broken power law (bPL) and a pseudo-Jaffe with a point mass (PJ+PM). The uncertainty bands represent the 1σ confidence interval around the mean.

Adopting a single-point-mass model for the perturber leads to a total mass of Mt = (1.450 ± 0.066) × 106M⊙, but the data strongly disfavour this model with \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-128\). Hence, our lensing analysis rules out a black hole or unresolved ‘point' mass interpretation at high statistical significance. The number density of globular clusters around the Einstein radius of elliptical galaxies is, in some cases, comparable to that of dark-matter sub-haloes (Supplementary Information). Depending on the adopted prior on cluster parameters, the VLBI data disfavour a King model with a \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}\) between −52 and −122. The best-fitting King profile with a finite truncation radius has a mass of \(\left(3.05\pm 0.57\right)\times 1{0}^{6}{M}_{\odot }\), a core radius of rc = 9.39 ± 1.21 pc and a tidal radius of rt = 24.7 ± 22.4 kpc. These properties are extreme compared with known globular clusters, but not outside the observed range (Extended Data Fig. 1). Given the values of the Bayesian evidence, we conclude that the detected object is very unlikely to be a globular cluster in the main lens.

On the other hand, the best-fitting single-component NFW profiles27 both for a field halo (at z = 1.469) and for a sub-halo in the lens are highly concentrated, with \(\log {c}_{{\rm{vir}}}=\log ({r}_{{\rm{vir}}}/{r}_{{\rm{s}}})=2.91\pm 0.09\) and \(\log {c}_{{\rm{v}}}=\log (2\times {\left({V}_{\max }/\left({H}_{z}{r}_{\max }\right)\right)}^{2})=7.25\pm 0.17\), respectively. For comparison, the expected concentrations at these masses and redshifts in a ΛCDM cosmology are \(\log {c}_{{\rm{vir}}}=1.10\pm 0.15\) (ref. 28) and \(\log {c}_{{\rm{v}}}=3.90\pm 0.02\) (ref. 29). Hence, we find a discrepancy at the 10σ to 20σ level between our observations and theoretical expectations. Imposing such a ΛCDM prior leads to a dramatic drop in Bayesian evidence of −75 and −147 for the field halo and sub-halo cases, respectively (see Extended Data Fig. 2 for a comparison of the measured and predicted maximum radius and velocity). Adding a central point mass reduces the tension between the inferred NFW parameters and the ΛCDM expectation to 3σ and 6σ, but this has little meaning since adding a point mass of the mass we infer would substantially modify the central profile of the host halo. Even with the NFW parameters and the central point mass left free, all NFW models for the extended component are strongly excluded by the data, with the best model of this family (for which the mass of the compact object is \(0.3\times {M}_{\max }\)) having \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-31\) relative to our best-fit model.

In our analysis, detection \({\mathcal{V}}\) is best explained by a uniform-surface-density, face-on disk of outer radius R = 139 ± 4 pc centred on an unresolved component containing 19% of the total mass, (1.8 ± 0.1) × 106M⊙. The central object could potentially be a black hole or a nuclear star cluster. In CDM and WDM, the formation of a black hole at the centre of galaxies is the result of complex and uncertain baryonic processes. In the mass regime of detection \({\mathcal{V}}\), haloes are expected to have no stars and to be well described by a single NFW profile. A fully dark halo with properties consistent with our best-fit model thus seems extremely implausible in CDM and WDM models (see Supplementary Information for more details). However, for suitably chosen cross-sections, it may be achievable in SIDM models, where gravo-thermal evolution and core collapse can lead to the formation of black holes at the centre of dark-matter haloes (see, for example, refs. 7,11,30). Reproducing the VLBI data would require a halo that had a CDM equivalent with a maximum circular velocity of vmax ≈ 5 km s−1 and that is deep in the core collapse regime by the observed redshift of 0.881, implying a velocity averaged interaction cross-section of ≈ 800 cm2 g−1, or more (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Information).

Alternatively, the lensing signature of detection \({\mathcal{V}}\) could be that of an ultracompact galaxy with a central massive black hole or nuclear star cluster. These are a distinct class of small, dense stellar systems with masses lying between those of globular clusters and those of normal dwarf galaxies. First discovered in nearby galaxy clusters such as Fornax and Virgo (see, for example, ref. 31), they are some of the densest galaxies currently known. Ultracompact galaxies are thought to form in a variety of ways, for example, by tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies in dense environments. Our best-fit model has an overall size and mass consistent with those of known ultracompact galaxies and local nuclear star clusters (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information), although their radial light distributions are markedly more centrally concentrated than the uniform mass surface density favoured here.

This is the third object to be individually ‘gravitationally imaged' to date17,32. All three detections have properties which, at different statistical levels, appear unusual when compared with dark-matter-dominated haloes in the CDM and WDM paradigms33,34,35,36. Our analysis (see Supplementary Information for more details), together with those of previous detections, suggests that, if deeper observations confirm that these objects are dark matter dominated rather than star dominated, as ultracompact galaxies and nuclear star clusters are, then dark matter cannot be collisionless. Hence, our results could have important implications for the nature of dark matter and the standard cosmological model. However, more numerical and theoretical work is needed to obtain robust predictions from SIDM models at the spatial scales and evolutionary phases relevant to the VLBI data, and to verify that all three detections are consistently explained by the same parameters for the SIDM cross-section.

The data for the radio source JVAS B1938+666 used in this analysis were taken with a global VLBI array consisting of the European VLBI Network (EVN, 11 antennas), the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA, 10 antennas) and the Green Bank Telescope, at a central observing frequency of 1.7 GHz and with a bandwidth of 64 MHz (ref. 18). This observational set-up resulted in an angular resolution (the so-called beam size) of 7.4 mas × 4.7 mas, for a natural weighting of the visibilities. The observation lasted 14 h with a data recording rate of 512 Mbits s−1 (ID GM068, principal investigator McKean).

Using these data, an extended but extremely thin gravitational arc was found18, superposed on which a low-mass object was discovered by Powell et al.19. Here, we focus on the properties of this new object (detection \({\mathcal{V}}\)) and consider possible explanations for its nature in the context of known astrophysical objects and various dark-matter models.

We use the Bayesian lens modelling code PRONTO21,22,23,24,25,26, which fits the data directly in visibility space. The background unlensed source is reconstructed in a pixellated, regularized fashion on a Delaunay tessellation with a magnification-adaptive resolution. The sum of the following components gives the mass density profile of the macro-model: an elliptical power law for the main lens galaxy, multipoles of order m = 3 and m = 4 (as defined in ref. 37) and an external shear component of strength Γ and position angle Γθ. We also include the contribution of a ≈ 108M⊙ low-mass halo, first detected in ref. 17 in the same gravitational lens system (in the following, referred to as detection \({\mathcal{A}}\)). Powell et al.19 have shown that, while the VLBI data do not provide a strong constraint on the redshift of detection \({\mathcal{A}}\), they strongly disfavour the z = 1.4 value proposed in ref. 38. Recently, Tajalli et al.36 presented a re-analysis of the W. M. Keck Telescope adaptive optics (Keck AO hereafter) data for JVAS B1938+666, showing that detection \({\mathcal{A}}\) is indeed a field halo, but at much lower redshift, z = 0.13 ± 0.07. We note that the Keck AO data, when compared with the VLBI data analysed here, are significantly more sensitive to the presence and properties of detection \({\mathcal{A}}\), as it falls right on top of the lensed (rest-frame) optical emission, while offset relative to the 1.7-GHz arc. In fact, it was demonstrated in ref. 19 that assumptions about detection \({\mathcal{A}}\) do not affect the detection and the inferred properties of the object under study here (which we refer to as detection \({\mathcal{V}}\)). Hence, for simplicity, we include detection \({\mathcal{A}}\) as a pseudo-Jaffe sub-halo at the lens redshift.

The dimensionless surface mass density (that is, the convergence) profile for an elliptical power law of axis ratio q and three-dimensional (3D) slope γ (with γ = 2 representing an isothermal profile) is given by

with radius \(R=\sqrt{{q}^{2}({r}_{{\rm{c}}}^{2}+{x}^{2})+{y}^{2}}\) and normalization κ0. We calculate the corresponding deflection angle using FASTELL39. With the exception of the core radius (rc ≡ 10−4 arcsec), the pivot radius (rp ≡ 1 arcsec) and the redshift of detection \({\mathcal{A}}\) (\({z}_{{\mathcal{A}}}\equiv {z}_{{\rm{lens}}}\)), all other parameters of the macro-model are left free to vary (for a total of 16 free parameters including the strength of the source regularization).

We model detection \({\mathcal{V}}\) with the following circularly symmetric profiles: a single power law (PL), a broken power law (bPL), a truncated singular isothermal or pseudo-Jaffe (PJ) profile, a Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile, a King model (KG), a Sérsic (SER) profile, a Plummer (PLU) profile and a point mass (PM). We also tested an elliptical power law (ePL) profile and a number of composite models that add a central point mass to one of the above models for the extended component. In all cases, we keep the position on the sky free.

The convergence of the PL model follows equation (1) with q = 1. Free parameters of the model are the normalization κ0 and the slope γ. For the core radius, we choose a very small value that is well below the resolution of the data. We consider both a sub-halo model (PL) where the redshift is fixed to that of the main deflector and a field halo model (PLfield) where the redshift is a free parameter.

For the broken power law model, we adopt the representation of ref. 40 for the convergence

where x = R/rb. The break radius rb, the inner and outer logarithmic slopes t1 and t2, and the normalization at the break radius κb are all adjustable parameters.

The PJ profile is described as follows:41

with x = R/rt. This model has two degrees of freedom, that is, the total mass \({M}_{{\rm{t}}}=2\pi {r}_{{\rm{t}}}^{2}{\kappa }_{0}{\Sigma }_{{\rm{c}}}\) and the truncation radius rt, where Σc is the critical surface mass density.

The convergence of the NFW27 profile is given by

with x = R/rs, \({\kappa }_{{\rm{s}}}={\rho }_{{\rm{s}}}{r}_{{\rm{s}}}{\varSigma }_{{\rm{c}}}^{-1}\) and

Here, the density ρs and the surface mass density κs are taken at the scale radius rs. We consider two cases: one in which the object is a sub-halo within the lens galaxy (NFW) and one in which its redshift can vary between the observer and the source (NFWfield). For sub-haloes, we characterize the profile by the peak circular velocity radius \({r}_{\max }\) and \({M}_{\max }\), the corresponding enclosed mass in 3D; further, we compare with N-body simulations using the concentration \({c}_{{\rm{v}}}=2\times {\left({V}_{\max }/\left({H}_{z}{r}_{\max }\right)\right)}^{2}\), where \({V}_{\max }\) is the peak circular velocity and Hz is the Hubble constant at redshift z. For field haloes, we use the more conventional parameter pair: the virial mass Mvir and the concentration cvir = rvir/rs. For both the PLfield and the NFWfield models, the prior on the redshift is set to be uniform in the comoving distance of the perturber.

The King model is used to represent globular cluster (GC) profiles. Its convergence is given by the expression

where x = R/rc and t = rt/rc. The degrees of freedom in this case are the core radius rc, the truncation (or ‘tidal') radius rt and the total mass. The latter is given by \({M}_{{\rm{t}}}=\pi {\kappa }_{0}{r}_{{\rm{c}}}^{2}{\Sigma }_{\;{\rm{c}}}f(t)\), with

We consider three cases. In the first, the truncation radius rt is taken to be equivalent to the tidal radius, estimated using the expression42

Here, d is the projected distance of the detected object from the centre of the lens galaxy and Mlens(<d) is the mass of the main deflector within a sphere of radius d. We refer to this model as KGtd and set the prior on the concentration \(c=\log {r}_{{\rm{t}}}/{r}_{{\rm{c}}}\) to be uniform between 0.3 and 2.7, in line with typical values for GCs in the Local Universe43. For the second case (KG), we leave the total mass, the core radius and t−1 = rc/rt free to vary, with the prior on the latter being uniform between 10−4 and 0.5 to encompass all known values for GCs and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs; see below for more details). For the third version of the King profile (KG∞) we allow rt → ∞. As the total mass of this profile is not finite, we define as free parameters the mass \({M}_{\max }\) within the peak circular velocity radius \({r}_{\max } \approx 2.919\times {r}_{{\rm{c}}}\) and the core radius itself, rc.

The majority of UCDs have been shown to be well described by a multi-component King or Sérsic profiles (see, for example, ref. 44). The convergence profile of the latter is given by

with x = R/Re and Ke as the convergence at the effective radius. There are three degrees of freedom: the effective radius Re, the index n and the total mass \({M}_{{\rm{t}}}=2\uppi {R}_{{\rm{e}}}^{2}{\kappa }_{{\rm{e}}}{\Sigma }_{c}n\exp \left({b}_{{{n}}}\right)/{b}_{{{n}}}^{2n}\varGamma \left[2n\right]\). Here, Γ[2n] is the complete gamma function. The constant bn is set by the requirement that half the total mass be projected within Re. In the limit n → 0

Hence, in this case, the Sérsic profile has a constant surface mass density and a finite size, and we refer to it as a uniform disk (UD). This model has only two degrees of freedom: the total mass and the effective radius. It is also a limiting case of the bPL model for t1 = 0 and t2 → ∞.

The Plummer profile (PLU) was initially introduced to describe the light distribution of globular clusters45 and is now often used as an example of a simple, fully analytic model for spherical stellar systems. We consider it because, with an additional central point mass, it turns out to be a relatively good description of our data. The convergence of the Plummer model is given by

with x = r/rs. We take the free parameters of this model to be the total mass Mt and the scale radius rs.

Tables 1 and 2 list the mean and 1σ uncertainty on the inferred parameters for all the different profiles that we tested. When the perturbers are located at a higher redshift than the main lens, we quote their position on the latter plane. Regardless of the assumed mass density profile, the object is detected at high statistical significance, with a Bayes factor relative to a model with no perturber of \(241\le \Delta \ln {{\mathcal{E}}}_{s}\le 388\), corresponding to a detection significance between 22σ and 28σ assuming Gaussian statistics.

The best-fitting model is the UD+PM model. In the following, the Bayes factor of a given model \({\mathcal{M}}\) is measured, unless otherwise specified, relative to this best model, that is, \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=\ln {{\mathcal{E}}}_{{\mathcal{M}}}-\ln {{\mathcal{E}}}_{{\rm{UP+PM}}}\). Extended Data Table 1 reports the inferred parameters for the macro-model (including detection \({\mathcal{A}}\)). We only quote these parameters for the best model (UD +PM), but we find that they change very little for different models for the profile of detection \({\mathcal{V}}\). Images of the system at a variety of scales, showing the position of detections \({\mathcal{A}}\) and \({\mathcal{V}}\) relative to the lensed source emission in the radio and the near-infrared, can be found in fig. 1 of ref. 19.

For models that do not include the PM component, we find small differences in the Bayes factor (at most 4) between those with the perturber at the redshift of the lens and those where its redshift is free. The latter converge to z ≈ 1.4 and are characterized by steeper slopes for the PL models and higher concentrations for the NFW profiles. This is related to the degeneracy between these quantities and redshift, whereby objects located along the line-of-sight need to be more massive and to have steeper or more concentrated profiles to provide the most similar lensing effect to an object within the lens (Tajalli et al. in prep.). Once a PM component is included, the field models converge to a redshift consistent with that of the main lens, and their Bayes factor increases considerably. This indicates that detection \({\mathcal{V}}\) is very likely within the main deflector. In the following, we therefore focus primarily on sub-halo models with z ≡ zlens.

The top model UD+PM is followed closely by SER+PM (\(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-3.5\)) and bPL+PM (\(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-11\)). This is not surprising, since the parameters found for these two models are close to the limits where their mass profiles become identical to that of UD+PM. However, all three models are bounded by an implausibly steep surface mass density cut-off. The fourth best model is PLU+PM (\(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-17\)). This result is also unsurprising since equation (11) shows the convergence of this profile to be almost constant out to the scale radius, where it cuts off steeply. Sub-halo models with a point mass and an extended profile more similar to those usually assumed for dark-matter haloes or real stellar systems are significantly disfavoured relative to these top models, with Bayes factors ranging from \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-30\) for PJ+PM to \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-40\) for ePL+PM. The best model without a central point mass is bPL with \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-27\), followed by PL, SER, PJ and NFW in that order, with the last having a high concentration and \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-44\); when a ΛCDM concentration prior is adopted, this drops catastrophically to \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-147\). All versions of the King profile are strongly disfavoured, with Bayes factors ranging from −52 for KG∞ to −122 for KGtd. A point mass is also very strongly excluded with \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-128\). Hence, from the lens modelling alone, we conclude that the data exclude a naked black hole or a compact system with a radius less than 10 or 20 pc. In the Supplementary Information, we discuss how these profile properties compare with predictions from different dark-matter models and to the observed properties of GCs and UCDs.

Strong gravitational lensing is known to provide a robust and model-independent measure of the projected mass within an appropriately chosen radius. However, our results show that, in the system we consider here, the projected mass profile is tightly constrained over a broad range of radii. This is a consequence of the fact that, for low-mass perturbers, the angular size of the source is larger than that of the deflector, so that the observed image structure constrains the enclosed mass over a range of radii. In the specific case of detection \({\mathcal{V}}\), we find that all models that provide a decent fit to the data agree in the values they predict for the enclosed (cylindrical) mass, Mcyl, both at 20 pc and (most tightly) at 90 pc. This applies to perturbers both within and along the line of sight to the main lens. Indeed, of the 12 models with \(\Delta \log {\mathcal{E}} > -40\), 10 give a best value of Mcyl,90 that differs by less than 3% from that of the best model, while for Mcyl,20, 10 models differ from the best model by less than 8%.

Models such as KGtd and PM that do not lead to the correct mass at either radius, or the NFWCDM model, which fails to match at 20 pc, are strongly disfavoured. Leaving aside these models, the ranking of the other profiles depends both on the curvature of the Mcyl profile between 20 and 90 pc and on the rapidity with which the mass increases at larger radii. Thus, the gradient of the UD+PM and PLU+PM models is increasing outwards, while for the models with \(-27 > \Delta \log {\mathcal{E}} > -32\), it is constant over this range, and for most of the less favoured models it is decreasing outwards (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). We demonstrate explicitly that the data also constrain the profile beyond 90 pc by running a bPL+PM model for which the inner point mass, the break radius and the outer slope were left free, but the inner slope was fixed to that of the best PL+PM model. We found this model to predict an essentially identical Mcyl(R) to PL+PM within the break radius, 98 pc, but a markedly steeper profile at larger radii (t2 = 1.96 as compared with t1 = 1.155). The \(\Delta \log {\mathcal{E}}\) for this extra model was −32, a full 7 units better than the PL+PM model, indicating that a reduced mass beyond 100 pc is strongly preferred by the data. Presumably, this reflects the fact that the lensed arc extends well beyond this distance, and its surface brightness distribution provides extra constraining power.

Irrespective of the choice of model, the position of the perturber on the plane of the lens is extremely well constrained, with an average error of σx = 0.1 mas and σy = 0.2 mas (equivalent to 0.8–1.6 pc in the plane of the lens). The error on the x coordinate is smaller by a factor of 2 because of the corresponding smaller size of the lensed arc in the x direction, a result of the strong tangential magnification experienced by the background source, together with the location of the critical curves; any small shift of the perturber along x corresponds to a substantial change in its gravitational effect. The position is also consistent among the different models, with a standard deviation of 1.1 and 1.5 mas along the x and y axis, respectively. The largest shift relative to our best model is displayed by the PM model, with ∣Δx∣ = 5 mas and ∣Δy∣ = 4 mas. This is related to the fact that the PM is the most centrally concentrated profile we consider and, so, has the largest capability to perturb the lensed images. If located closer to the arc, a PM would further split the arc into further multiple images, but there is no evidence for this in the observational data.

Supplementary Fig. 1 compares the Mcyl(R) curves for all our profile models, while Supplementary Figs. 2–24 display the full posterior distributions for their parameters.

Panel (a): Mass and concentration for the GCs in the Milky Way [black circles,47] and for the KGtd and KG models of detection \({\mathcal{V}}\) (coloured points, mean value and 1-σ uncertainty). Panel (b): relation between stellar mass and effective radius from observations of different types of objects: dSph galaxies at z = 0 [green diamonds,48], strongly lensed star-forming clumps at z = 2 to 6 [gray stars,49], eUCDs in the Virgo cluster [pink squares,44], dEs, dS0s, nuclear star clusters, GCs, UCDs, cEs and YMCs at z = 0 [coral crosses,48]. The yellow diamonds represent simulated star-forming stellar clusters at z ~ 6. The green, red and black dots are detection \({\mathcal{V}}\) when modelled with a Sérsic profile of index n ~ 7, a King profile and a Sérsic profile of index n → 0 with a point-mass, respectively.

The contours represent the number density of CDM subhaloes with Msub > 105h−1M⊙. These were obtained using the SASHIMI-C semi-analytical subhalo model50,51 assuming a host redshift and mass of zh = 0.881 and Mh = 1012M⊙. The coloured crosses show the \({V}_{\max }\) and \({r}_{\max }\) mean values and 1-σ uncertainties inferred for different models of the detected object: an NFW profile with free concentration (NFW, \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-44\)), an NFW halo with concentration drawn from the mass-concentration relation in28 (NFWCDM,field, \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-75\)) and an NFW subhalo with concentration drawn from29 (NFWCDM, \(\Delta \ln {\mathcal{E}}=-147\)).

Projected ‘circular velocity' versus projected radius for different SIDM haloes (solid lines), for their CDM NFW analogues (dashed-dotted lines) and for our best-fit model, a uniform disk with a point mass (UD+PM). The vertical and horizontal lines represent the 90 pc radius at which all models for the detected object agree most closely, and the corresponding circular velocity. The NFW profiles are labelled according to their log values of \({V}_{\max }\) and \({r}_{\max }\). The uncertainty band in the UD+PM curve represent the 1-σ error around the mean value.

Amine functionalization is crucial in pharmaceutical and agrochemical synthesis yet direct enantioselective α-C(sp3)–H functionalization of N-alkyl anilines remains challenging. Here we show a metallaphotoredox-catalysed radical approach for α-C(sp3)–H arylation of N-alkyl anilines, introducing a simple, sterically hindered aryl ketone photocatalyst. This key innovation slows undesired back-electron transfer, enabling efficient α-anilinoalkyl radical generation. Our strategy uses a sequential single-electron transfer and proton transfer process, thereby overcoming multiple limitations of existing methods. In conjunction with a chiral nickel catalyst, we have achieved site-selective, enantioselective arylation of diverse N-alkyl anilines with various (hetero)aryl halides. The method exhibits exceptional functional group tolerance, enabling modular functionalization of complex molecular structures. This approach provides an effective route to valuable α-aryl amines, offering significant possibilities for drug discovery and streamlining challenging synthetic sequences.

Folding phones have been stuck in a rut for a few years. We've seen concept smartphones playing with fresh folding designs, but ever since Samsung kickstarted the trend in 2019, there have only really been two major styles in the market: a booklike fold and the flip. However, there's new life emerging in the category with significantly slimmer designs—such as last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7—and now the company's “TriFold,"" a smartphone that can truly transform into a 10-inch tablet.

Samsung isn't the first to market with such a phone—Huawei takes that cake with the Mate XT—but the Galaxy Z TriFold has a slightly different design. It's only available in a handful of countries, like China, South Korea, and Singapore, but Samsung plans to release it in the US this year. The price? Samsung is being coy with the MSRP, but the price of 3,594,000 South Korean won suggests it'll cost around $2,500 in the US, if not more.

I was able to briefly spend some time with the triple-panel smartphone at CES 2026. Here's what it's like.

Folded and unfolded.

As the name suggests, Samsung's priciest folding phone opts for a trifold design, whereas Huawei's equivalent has a Z fold. I haven't used Huawei's version yet, but that does have a leg up: You can use one, two, or all three panels with its accordion-style design. The Galaxy Z TriFold only goes from a single panel to a triple panel.

As a single panel, the 6.5-inch front screen feels quite like a normal smartphone, albeit with thicker-than-usual bezels around the screen, and a weight of 309 grams that you'll have to get used to. Flip open the screen to the right, then flip the inner layer to the left, and you get a sprawling 10-inch display to work with. Keep in mind, the Galaxy Z Fold7 nets you an 8-inch screen, but that sounds like child's play next to the TriFold. It instantly feels more like an Android tablet than any other foldable Samsung has made before.

That's important because this tablet experience is the promise “book-like” folding phones have made for years, but the slight increase in screen real estate never yielded the same experience as a standard tablet. The TriFold changes that—the screen here is bigger than an iPad Mini! It feels like the actual definition of a phablet.

You can run three apps side-by-side, two apps at once, or one big app across the whole screen.

There are two titanium hinges, and they open up three panels. You can place a full-size app on each of the three panes, use a larger version of split-screen, or expand one app across the vast display. It was easy to configure these setups, and I can totally see myself taking advantage of having three apps open simultaneously. It is still a little unwieldy to hold, but that's not unusual for a 10-inch tablet. The TriFold is very slim in its unfolded state, which helps.

Fold it up and you're looking at a thickness of 12.9 millimeters, which is just a smidge chunkier than the Galaxy Z Fold6 (12.1 mm). The fact that it's roughly the same thickness as a prior-generation fold, yet with a dramatically larger screen, is impressive. It makes the bulk a little more palatable. There is a correct way to fold it and an incorrect way. Thankfully, if you start folding it the wrong way with the right screen in first, the phone violently buzzes, and you'll see an alert on the screen asking to fold in the other screen first. I can still picture someone ignoring this and just carrying on, though.

The hardware is exquisite, and the specs are top-notch, closer to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra; there's a 200-megapixel main camera on the back, and the phone is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. The displays are protected by ceramic glass, and there's even an IP48 dust- and water-resistance rating.

The TriFold's three panels tuck into each other.

You can see the difference in the two hinges.

But as exciting as it is, the TriFold is still a niche phone. Despite nearly a decade of folding phones, the prices for these handsets are still a premium, with Samsung even raising the MSRP of its folding devices in 2025. It is far cheaper to buy a decent tablet and a flagship phone. At a time of economic turmoil, the TriFold feels frivolous.

But it's hard not to feel impressed at this engineering marvel. It's just a shame that only a handful of people will really be able to enjoy this phablet's capabilities.

But the real servers are hosted in kazachstan or russia I think. And they do not cooperate so much with EU courts.So unless the EU installs a great firewall like china, they cannot really shut it down.

First off, it was striking to me how little of the ""top 10 000"" they published back on Christmas I recognize. I'm not sure what I expected, but 10 000 sounds like a big number, so it seemed likely to me, that if I get a random song from my playlist I could find it there. It turned out I hardly can find an artist I recognize. Ok, I can recall a song from Lady Gaga and even Billie Eilish, I've heard of Bruno Mars (cannot recall any song), but I have no idea what is ""Bad Bunny"", ""Doechii"", ""Drake"". I mean, I think I do have a pretty good idea what these things are (abstractly), and I probably wouldn't want to listen that. And while I knew that all this stuff is very popular, I didn't quite realize how little place in the top-10000 it leaves for the music I (and everyone I know) actually listen to.I didn't download the metadata they released (it would be hard to process it on my laptop anyway), but now I wonder how much of my 3 TB music collection is in top 100 000, or heck, even top 1M Spotify, or on Spotify at all.I also am sometimes surprised how little scrobbles some tracks get. I didn't bother to find out what this means, how many people still scrobble to Last.fm or ListenBrainz, but it is just surprising when I see that a track that I didn't consider to be obscure was scrobbled like 50 times this year.So I'm saying that music worlds seems to be terribly fragmented, even more than I imagined. So the very premise of AA backing-up 97% of Spotify (by the number of plays) may be much lesser achievement at ""preserving culture"" than it may sound. And of course we are about 8 years too late to backup everything, since by now half of it must be generative NN bullshit. And I'm not even sure it's in those leftover 3% (bots listen to bot-generated music too, right)?

An while back, another site started with a pile of pirated music, and that was allofmp3.com Remember those peeps?Their business model was to sell music by selling bandwidth.  Basically is was all the music you want charged by the megabit download.Pop titles were $0.10 to $0.25.  A whole album at 256mbps was roughly $3 give or take.What got me really thinking was how great the UX experience was.  At the time, few came close.The end of that site was packaged up with Russia's entry into the WTO.I seem to remember hearing about huge torrents out there too.  The right infohash can point a person to huge archives of various kinds, books, video, academic papers, music, the WikiLeak insurance files, which is password protected, as perhaps all of these are.

""Check Wikipedia to evade the court order"" just encourages legal action against Wikipedia. Even linking to copyright violations is, under current court precedent, able to bring civil liability upon third parties.

Tor and I2P are great technologies. ZLibrary, for example, runs an excellent Tor hidden service and it is usually the most reliable way to access news from the site. However, this did not remain true for a while when two of the operators were arrested. Tor and I2P require you to have infrastructure online. The point of ""check Wikipedia for news"" is that you can have something persist even if you do not have your servers online. Nostr is the best technology available in this category.

Regardless, this remains a far more resilient persistent source of information that you don't operate than ""check Wikipedia"".

> It's almost impossible to seize and you control the keys. YOU ARE THE OWNERThis also remains true for Nostr.But furthermore, as an operator of several Tor hidden services corresponding to public web services. I can assure you that many users, especially those on mobile devices, will stop using your service in large numbers if you direct them to a hidden service. iPhones don't allow background processes without special dispensation from Apple so the Tor/I2P circuit dies every time someone switches between apps. It's also an extreme development challenge, as they don't allow subprocesses either, and then of course your app will have to abide by the GPL at least for I2P (nonstarter for some). ""Just ruin your experience for all iOS users and switch to the GPL for all your client code"" is not a realistic suggestion. Not that Annas-Archive has a their own client app.

You may own the keys but the non-profit The Tor Project owns the network. And when they decide to shut it down your ""ownership"" of the domain keys doesn't matter in the slightest. You might think this is a silly scenario but actually it happened in 2021/2022 when the tor project unilaterally decided to kill the entire Torv2 network and all domains were made inoperable. All links between sites, everything that made .onion a web, was lost.The Tor Project does this whenever they feel that there's a security issue. It will happen again.As someone that spent 10 years building completely legal community sites on the .onion network with the delusion of ownship it really hurt me. I'm never using .onion again. It is not a place to try to build communities. It is only for people that need 'security' as a highest priority and don't care if everything gets wiped out.

Well the purpose of using Tor is to prevent any network operators from knowing who you're talking to.

That's false to some extent. Tor's promise comes from it's vast population of users. The more users it has, the better it is to improve everyone's anonymity. So in a way, even by using it, you are helping Tor network. And please, save the ""criminal"" bs (meant for the original comment).

And conversely, it's enough to visit a random website running WebTorrent or just a plain HTTP DDoS attack to possibly ""use your connection for cybercrime"".Since RFC 3514 unfortunately never gained traction, distinguishing good, bad, and illegal traffic remains difficult.

But if you are going to build some nostr-based “resolver” into a browser you could instead use any of the other protocols - 2 of which are designed specifically for resolution, and the other already having a robust resolver implementation built on top of it?I quite like nostr, but let's not pretend it solves every problem.

reply

I agree with the disdain for IP, especially with what it had grown to become nowadays. But while I was also initially optimistic that AI companies may find a way to make IP go away as a byproduct of their activities, now it seems more like the big businesses will cut deals with one another and leave us commoners with nothing. Entertainment megacorps and AI companies rule the world, and I have no doubts that they'd find a way to become close allies. The AI companies get their near-endless stream of training data, the entertainment industry gets a cut of that juicy AI money and gives away their data willingly, while the IP remains locked away from ordinary people for eons more, just the way they like it. No one but us wants IP reform, or at least no one with real power, so it will probably never happen.

reply

The leading AI labs are not killing IP. They are taking IP and reshaping/combining it to produce their own highly lucrative proprietary IP package which they sell to you.The mirror image of IP defenders are AI boosters who argue against IP when it comes to slurping up media but squirm when you say ""ok, then publish all of the inputs that go into making your frontier models, and publish the model weights too.""

GP is correct to point that out.

reply

And yes, you are technically correct in that there's no way to know that they are or are not pulling in money and pocketing it. I'm not sure how that's relevant to the questions asked but okay.

reply

In UK, a non-profit association does not have to be legally registered to be legal.

No, not only should Tailscale offer a point in time report (click button in GUI, scan queued and report created, report link is preserved in GUI, any user with sufficient access can retrieve the report), they should expose whatever is needed via API to make these attestations available to automated GRC evidence collection systems (Vanta and Anecdotes, for example). Think continuous compliance monitoring of the software defined network tenant/control plane, similar to what you would get out of a CNAPP but scoped for this use case and more geared towards audit and compliance.I would be somewhat surprised if their enterprise users haven't or are not asking for this to be honest.

Qualcomm was so excited to talk about its most powerful ARM-based PC CPUs in 2025, it left off its lower-end, humdrum processor for the big reveal of all its partnered products. Alongside the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Elite Extreme (cue the guitar riff), Qualcomm is coming to CES 2026 with an X2 Plus chip.

Qualcomm's sequel to its initial batch of ARM-based chips that brought us Copilot+ PCs all boast a similar strong battery life and large 80 TOPS NPU (neural processing unit) built for background and low-scale AI tasks. Compared to the previous-gen Snapdragon X Plus, the higher-end X2 Plus promises 2.3 times better GPU performance and upwards of 50% better CPU multi-core performance. All told, the chip could be better for multitasking, light photo editing tasks, and—potentially—some light gaming.

The X2 Plus comes in two flavors, one with six Oryon CPU cores and one with 10 cores. The higher-end version, specifically the X2P-64-100, sports a max multithread frequency of 4GHz with a 34MB cache. The lower-end version sports the same frequency but a lower total cache. The integrated Adreno graphics also hit a higher 1.7GHz frequency compared to the six-core variant. All that is to say, if you're looking at an X2 Plus laptop for any photo editing or any other graphics, you want the higher-end version.

Devices with this chip will support up to three 4K external monitors as well as Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. The mid-range ARM chip is supposed to compete against Intel and AMD's latest lightweight laptop CPUs. These chips won't just have to perform well in battery life as well. Qualcomm claims its new chip demands 43% less power for the same performance as its first-gen Snapdragon X Plus.

One of Qualcomm's big bugbears for ARM on PC has been compatibility. Late last year, the chipmaker launched its Snapdragon Control Panel, a kind of game and app launcher that was supposed to help users update access to Microsoft's refined Prism x86 emulator and keep on top of drivers. Working on an ARM-based Windows machine is far better than it was at the Copilot+ launch in 2024. Support for Windows AVX and AVX2 extensions in the Prism emulator means it's much easier to run previously unsupported programs and even some games on Qualcomm's latest chips.

Still, for the sake of a PC that can keep up with the Joneses of Intel and AMD's top-end laptop CPUs, the X2 Elite Extreme with its 18 Oryon cores (12 “prime” CPU cores and another six “performance” cores) will still offer the best overall performance. At least, there will be an interesting three-way competition for laptop supremacy in 2026.

Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier, aptly nicknamed the Doomsday Glacier, is a ticking time bomb. The rapidly melting body of ice could cause up to 10 feet (3 meters) of global sea-level rise if it were to collapse completely. New evidence suggests the glacier is even less stable than previously believed, with hundreds of iceberg earthquakes shaking up the massive structure for more than a decade.

Thanh-Son Pham, a researcher at the Australian National University, uncovered evidence of hundreds of glacial earthquakes that took place in Antarctica from 2010 to 2023. Most of those earthquakes have previously gone undetected due to their low-frequency seismic waves, and their discovery raises new questions about the threatening instability of Antarctica's melting glaciers.

The new study, published in Geophysical Research Letters, reports 362 glacial earthquakes in Antarctica. Out of the newly documented seismic events, 245 earthquakes took place in Antarctica's Doomsday Glacier, likely caused by capsizing icebergs.

Glacial earthquakes are a newly discovered type of seismic event that produces low-frequency waves, with a magnitude of around 5. They were first detected in 2003 and are mainly caused by the collapse of large icebergs.

Most of the recorded glacial earthquakes were discovered along the coast of Greenland, the largest ice cap in the Northern Hemisphere. Although scientists assumed that glacial earthquakes take place in Antarctica as well, they have been much harder to detect because they are of much lower magnitude than those that occur in Greenland.

Rather than relying on the global network of seismic detectors, Pham used seismic stations in Antarctica itself to find evidence for glacial earthquakes. The search turned up hundreds of events that were never cataloged.

The majority of glacial earthquakes took place near Antarctica's largest glacier, Thwaites. Recent evidence has shown that the amount of ice flowing from Thwaites has doubled in the span of three decades, contributing to the global rise in sea levels.

The new study found that the rocking seismic events don't necessarily coincide with the seasonal movement of warm air temperatures in Antarctica. Instead, the glacial earthquakes near Thwaites seem to take place in parallel with a period of accelerated flow of the glacier's ice tongue toward the sea.

The remaining glacial earthquakes recently detected took place near the Pine Island Glacier, one of the largest ice streams in Antarctica. These events, however, took place around 30 to 50 miles (60 to 70 kilometers) away from the waterfront and are therefore not likely caused by capsizing icebergs. “The nature of earthquakes in Pine Island Glaciers remains puzzling and warrants further investigation,” the study notes.

Pham recommends follow-up investigations of the newly cataloged glacial earthquakes in Antarctica to better understand the main driving cause, as well as their impact on the instability of the glaciers.

HP is putting most of its emphasis on the Qualcomm model, which uses an exclusive variant of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Elite with an NPU capable of 85 TOPS. Until now, the Snapdragon X2 Elite had an 80 TOPS NPU on the high end.

The Qualcomm model will start with the Snapdragon X2 Plus (X2P-64-100). Right now, HP is only saying that an Intel version with ""Intel Next Gen AI"" processors and graphics will exist, but is not naming specific chips. If the Intel models use Panther Lake, that would mean the NPU would go up to 50 TOPS on those models. All of this only matters, of course, if you're using local AI regularly.

 




Both systems come in an anodized aluminum finish. The Qualcomm version comes in a subtle ""stone blue"" color, while the Intel models come in duller gray and ""sand"" options. HP says the new Ultra is 14% lighter than the previous generation laptop at 2.81 pounds, and also claims that this machine is thinner than the 13-inch MarBook Air, though that's specifically at one point on the rear of the laptop and doesn't include the hinge cap or rubber feet.

Both options use a 2880 x 1800 OLED touchscreen that goes up to 120 Hz. They also have similar port layouts (the Intel models use Thunderbolt 4, the Qualcomm options use USB4), and they each feature Wi-Fi 7 and a 70 WHr battery. The designs continue HP's use of a lattice-free keyboard on high-end models (similar to Dell) and large trackpads. The chassis has passed 20 MIL-STD 810G tests for durability.

HP says the Intel version will be released this month, starting at $1,549.99. As of this writing, HP tells me the Qualcomm version will launch in the spring and that pricing will be shared closer to release.

 




Beyond the sleek new Ultra 14, HP is updating the entire OmniBook stack at CES, with a variety of sizes and processors from Qualcomm, Intel, and next-gen Ryzen AI chips. These include the OmniBookX, OmniBook 7, OmniBook 5, and OmniBook 3, which are set to launch throughout February and the spring. HP is also announcing updates to its Chromebook offerings, as well as its Elitebook lineup.

Americans with cancer are turning to online crowdfunding for help with medical bills and basic living expenses — but most fall far short of their fundraising goals.

That's according to a recent study by the American Cancer Society (ACS) that analyzed over 78,000 cancer-related fundraising campaigns on the popular crowdfunding platform GoFundMe. The main takeaway: Only 11.5% of campaigns met their goals within 90 days; instead, they typically raised about one third of the funds requested.

“It was very rare that a campaign was initiated and received no money,” lead author Jason Zheng, PhD, senior principal scientist of health services research at the ACS, told Medscape Medical News. “However, we identified very low success rates in terms of campaigns reaching fundraising goals.”

Given that there are roughly 18 million cancer survivors in the US, it seems that only a small portion are resorting to GoFundMe, Zheng pointed out. However, the fact that some use crowdfunding to pay their bills is a symptom of a bigger problem.

“Healthcare affordability is certainly an issue, and this study highlights that,” Zheng said. “Unless we try to figure out a way to systematically solve the affordability issue, I think medical financial hardship will continue to be a major problem.”

The findings, published in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, build on prior research showing that a growing number of Americans are resorting to crowdfunding to dig themselves out of medical debt.

The particular financial toxicity of cancer is well documented, with patients' high out-of-pocket treatment costs often being compounded by travel expenses and lost wages. Americans with a cancer history are more likely than other Americans to forgo or delay prescription medications due to cost, cut down on food spending, go into debt, or declare bankruptcy.

The rising cost of living in recent years has only added to the problem. “People are struggling right now, and it's really hard to cover healthcare costs alongside everything else that they have to pay for,” said Lynne Cotter, PhD, of the health policy research organization KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation) in San Francisco.

“It makes sense that people might be looking outside the traditional health insurance spectrum to be covering these costs of healthcare,” Cotter, who was not involved in the ACS study, told Medscape Medical News.

While other studies have looked at cancer-related crowdfunding, the ACS research had a broader scope, analyzing detailed donation records at the campaign, state, and national levels.

Zheng's team evaluated publicly available data from 78,338 cancer-related fundraising campaigns initiated between January 2021 and February 2023 on GoFundMe. The platform accounts for over 90% of the US crowdfunding market, with “medical reasons” being the top campaign category.

The researchers used an artificial intelligence tool that interprets written text (natural language processing) to identify campaign characteristics, analyze fundraiser stories, and extract details about the beneficiary's demographics, cancer type and stage, time since diagnosis, and treatment information.

Overall, Zheng's team found, the campaigns raised a large sum: $506 million. But that covered only about one third of what they collectively requested, at $1.47 billion.

On the individual level, campaigns sought to raise a median of $10,000 but received a median of $4000 in donations.

In general, the study found, more donations came into campaigns that described beneficiaries who were younger than 18 years, men, married, living with dependent children, or employed or attending school. However, those campaigns were not necessarily more successful in reaching their goals.

Zheng pointed out that crowdfunding is not simply a go-to for Americans who lack health insurance.

“We found that a lot of people do have health insurance,” he said. “But they still come up short in terms of financial resources to deal with all these financial stresses caused by a cancer diagnosis.”

About 92% of Americans have health insurance. Yet, Cotter noted, roughly 4 in 10 report some kind of healthcare debt, including credit card debt and money owed to family or friends who've helped them cover their bills.

Research conducted by KFF, she said, has demonstrated just how easily a US family can fall into medical debt.

“We found that the average American household has about $5000 in liquid assets, but the average deductible for a family can be as high as $16,000,” Cotter said. “Having a hospital stay for one family member could put you over your liquid assets.”

For clinicians, the ACS researchers wrote in the report, the findings underscore the importance of discussing the “economic implications” of a cancer diagnosis with patients — not only treatment costs but also the potential effects on employment and ability to pay nonmedical bills. Care teams, they added, should be able to connect patients and families with social and financial resources when necessary.

The researchers reported receiving no funding source for the study. One co-author disclosed receiving research support from Merck, and another reported serving as a member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network work group.

Edited by Lora McGlade

 January 05, 2026  

The annual rate of radical hysterectomies performed by gynecologic oncologists in the US declined significantly from 4.5 to 1.5 cases per oncologist between 2004 and 2020, despite the workforce growing from 571 to 1178 specialists.

“The increasing rarity of radical hysterectomy may pose a challenge to those seeking to acquire and maintain competency in this complex operation….The rarity of radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer may justify efforts to centralize these procedures among high-volume surgeons,” wrote the authors of the study.

The study was led by Alexander Melamed, MPH, MD, Meigs Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Vincent Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston. It was published online in Obstetrics & Gynecology.

The study was limited by its reliance on administrative data lacking surgeon-level information, preventing analysis of case distribution among individual surgeons. The authors of the study noted that high case volume of other complex oncologic procedures, including radical hysterectomy for other indications, might mitigate the effect of declining rates for cervical cancer cases.

Melamed disclosed receiving consulting fees from Axena Health, Inc., and grants from the Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health. The other authors reported having no potential conflicts of interest.

Healthcare and therapy systems face a worsening workforce shortage, creating an urgent need for technologies that can support or augment human roles. However, much existing work emphasizes functional-task support while overlooking the emotional impact humans contribute-an omission that is especially critical in care contexts where empathy and emotional support are central to patient well-being. In rehabilitation, for example, robots can deliver highly repeatable, standardized training, yet still fall short of human therapists; a key missing ingredient is the positive affective benefit that typically arises from interpersonal interaction during therapy, which has been underestimated and remains difficult to integrate into technological systems. Interpersonal interaction can strengthen the patient–clinician relationship and improve satisfaction, trust, adherence, and clinical outcomes, but resource constraints make consistent, high-quality empathic interaction hard to sustain.

This motivates ""artificial empathy,"" defined as a machine's capacity to perceive, interpret, and simulate empathic responses during human–machine interaction-implemented via algorithmic recognition and response rather than genuine affective experience. This review surveys major platforms-multiplayer games, social robots, and virtual agents-and how they incorporate interpersonal interaction to advance artificial empathy in therapy and healthcare.""

Tianyu Jia, author, researcher, Imperial College London

This review surveys three major platform families through which interpersonal interaction can be embedded to advance artificial empathy in therapy and healthcare: multiplayer games, social robots, and virtual agents. Multiplayer games are framed as a medium for bringing real human–human interaction into digital rehabilitation/training, using cooperative or competitive structures to elicit social support, motivation, and engagement-yet reported benefits can be inconsistent, often hinging on task design and individual differences, which calls for more careful interaction design and personalization. Social robots leverage embodiment and multimodal social cues (e.g., gaze, posture, facial expression, speech, and touch) to strengthen companionship and interaction quality, frequently acting as coach/companion-like partners; the review discusses expectation-management issues driven by appearance/behavior design and highlights the trend of integrating LLMs to improve dialogue generation and personalization. Virtual agents emphasize scalability and lower deployment cost, delivering social behaviors via screens or VR/AR/MR and potentially enhancing presence with haptics/wearables; the review positions AI and generative models as key drivers toward more natural, personalized, and emotionally intelligent interactions.

After reviewing the three platforms, the paper turns to what it would take to achieve stronger artificial empathy: future human–agent systems should support deeper, more seamless closed-loop interaction by estimating users' cognitive and affective states in real time, with emotion recognition as a central capability-drawing on behavioral cues (voice, text, facial expressions, gestures, eye tracking) and physiological signals (EEG, ECG, HR, GSR, etc.) to infer emotions and enable closed-loop regulation. It notes that emotion recognition is trending toward more contextual, multimodal approaches and improved hardware support, yet current work often lacks ecological validity and struggles to generalize across cultures; beyond emotions, interaction-relevant constructs such as trust, engagement, social presence, and rapport are important but still lack accurate, real-time quantitative models and remain hard to use for flexible behavioral adaptation. To move from short-term reactions to sustained personalization, the review emphasizes adapting interaction styles using inferred personality traits and memory of past interactions, routines, and preferences to improve comfort, trust, and adherence. It then outlines critical concerns: clinical/practical validation is still limited, many studies use small samples and short-term interventions with heterogeneous measures and weak controls-motivating unified evaluation frameworks and more rigorous, longitudinal designs. ""Ethically, overreliance on simulated ""pseudo-empathy"" can foster misuse and false attachment and displace real relationships, while GenAI hallucinations can be harmful in high-stakes healthcare-so artificial empathy should remain an adjunct rather than a replacement for interpersonal communication."" said Tianyu Jia.

Authors of the paper include Tianyu Jia, Feiyu Pan, Xingchen Yang, Linhong Ji, Dario Farina, and Chong Li.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Americans Abroad Five: Brenden Aaronson helps extend Leeds' unbeaten streak","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/national/2026/01/05/americans-abroad-five-brenden-aaronson-leeds-streak/88010026007/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:57:00 GMT","

Brenden Aaronson's coach has already had to defend him from fan abuse this season — twice.

But things appear to be changing at Leeds for the U.S. men's national soccer team attacker, who with each passing week looks more like the solution and less like the problem for the Premier League outfit.

His latest contribution might have been his most significant. Aaronson showed just about everything that makes him valuable on one play against Manchester United, scoring a vital goal as Leeds stretched its unbeaten run to seven.

The American's heroics at Elland Road kick off this week's Five.

Brenden Aaronson has found his footing in the Premier League.

The Leeds attacker scored his side's only goal in a 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Sunday, making it two goals and three assists in his last 11 Premier League appearances.

It's a modest hot streak, but it's a massive improvement when considering Aaronson had one goal and three assists in his previous 44 Premier League games. The 25-year-old has become a key player this season for Leeds, which is now eight points clear of the relegation zone.

Aaronson's goal typified everything that he's about. The USMNT midfielder chased down a 50-50 ball, getting in behind United's defense and then showing the quality and composure to bury his chance.

""Sometimes you have to take a chance,"" Aaronson said after the game. ""The ball came to me. I think that the center back didn't know that I was going to be kind of running off his shoulder like that. It was a good touch. And then it is just about putting it on target.""

Leeds manager Daniel Farke was full of praise after the game for a player he has stuck with despite many calls for his removal from the lineup.

""He deserves all the plaudits at the moment,"" Farke said. ""Great finish. There's more clarity in his play. He embodies what we are about in creating chances and working hard off the ball.""

Weston McKennie playing a new position is hardly earth-shattering news, but the Juventus man's latest shift is noteworthy in the context of his USMNT role.

McKennie was moved into a trequartista – or attacking midfield – role against Lecce on Saturday, a similar spot to where he played under USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino in October.

Playing further up the pitch, McKennie found a pocket of space and converted his first Serie A goal of the season in a 1-1 draw. Though it was his first league goal, McKennie now has three goals and two assists in his past nine games in all competitions.

After he was surprisingly omitted from two of three fall rosters for the USMNT, McKennie's proficiency as a trequartista served as a timely reminder for Pochettino.

""It's not a new position for me,"" McKennie said after the game. ""I'm always available for the coach and the team and I try to give 100 percent wherever I play.

""I like the trequartista role because you can help both defensively and offensively.""

Yunus Musah isn't yet a key player for Atalanta, but the midfielder's role is trending in the right direction.

Musah has now played in four consecutive Serie A games for La Dea, coming off the bench for the last 30 minutes of Saturday's 1-0 win over Roma.

After Musah was an unused sub in seven of eight matches, he has finally started to prove his worth to manager Raffaele Palladino. It certainly doesn't hurt that Atalanta has won three of its past four games either.

""In the middle, he's a buzzing presence who brings freshness and keeps the midfield under Atalanta's control,"" read an assessment from Gazzetta dello Sport this week. ""His rise within the team hierarchy continues.""

Musah found himself on the outside of the USMNT picture in 2025, making just two appearances. If he can find a way to continue his mini-surge at Atalanta, there might still be a way back before the World Cup.

There was no build-up period for Antonee Robinson. When he was back from injury, it was full speed ahead.

After nearly three months on the sideline with knee problems, the Fulham left back has now played every minute of six consecutive games, including Sunday's thrilling 2-2 draw against Liverpool.

Robinson was excellent against Arne Slot's side, and could have had multiple assists with better finishing from his teammates.

The 28-year-old was a major concern for Pochettino just a couple months ago, but he's once again locked in as a vital player for the Cottagers. If he continues in this manner, Robinson will undoubtedly regain the same status with the USMNT in 2026.

Very few, if any, games in La Liga history will have had so much Jersey as Sunday's match between Real Sociedad and Atlético Madrid.

New Jersey-born coach Pellegrino Matarazzo made history in his Sociedad debut, becoming the first American manager in La Liga.

New Jersey-born midfielder Johnny Cardoso, meanwhile, played the final half hour for Atlético in a 1-1 draw. It's been an injury-hit debut campaign for the 24-year-old, who made just his seventh appearance of the season Sunday.

For Matarazzo, securing a draw against a top-four opponent is an auspicious beginning at a club mired in a relegation fight.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Ruben Amorim was sacked as Manchester United manager on Monday after 14 months in charge, sparking speculation over his successor at Old Trafford.

Under-18s coach Darren Fletcher has been put in temporary charge, with the club reportedly keen to appoint a caretaker manager for the rest of the season.

AFP Sport looks at potential appointments as United search for their seventh permanent manager since the departure of Alex Ferguson in 2013.

Oliver Glasner guided Crystal Palace to their first major trophy by lifting the FA Cup last season. The 51-year-old Austrian, whose Palace contract expires at the end of the current campaign, has been linked with several clubs. Glasner, like Amorim, has mostly used a three-man defence with wingbacks at Palace, but last year he told Sky Sports that his favourite formation is 4-4-2.

Enzo Maresca parted ways with Chelsea last week after falling out with the club's hierarchy. The 45-year-old Italian won the UEFA Conference League and Club World Cup in his first season at Stamford Bridge and has been linked with the Manchester City job should Pep Guardiola quit at the end of the season.

Former England manager Gareth Southgate, 55, is reportedly admired by the Old Trafford hierarchy and has been linked with the United job in the past. But it is unclear whether the former Middlesbrough boss would favour a return to club management after stepping down from England duty following Euro 2024.

Unai Emery has transformed Aston Villa's fortunes since taking over three years ago. The 54-year-old Spaniard masterminded a thrilling Champions League campaign last season and his side are now pushing Arsenal and Manchester City hard at the top of the Premier League.

If Darren Fletcher, 41, hits the ground running during his interim spell, could he be a candidate for the full-time job at United? The former Red Devils midfielder has never managed a senior side but has a huge chance to impress. He may hope to follow in the footsteps of former teammate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who landed the job permanently after impressing as caretaker boss.  

Thomas Tuchel has one job at the moment -- to win the World Cup with England later this year. The German, 52, has hinted that he is open to prolonging his stay but the former Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich boss could be tempted by the Old Trafford hotseat.

Manchester United have previously been linked with a move for former Tottenham, PSG and Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentine, 53, is currently in charge of the US national team, meaning he could be available to take over after the World Cup.

Spain's Andoni Iraola, 43, has impressed since taking over at Bournemouth in 2023, securing club-record Premier League points tallies in his first two seasons. His three visits to Old Trafford as Bournemouth boss have included two 3-0 wins and last month's dramatic 4-4 draw.","{'href': 'https://thescore.com', 'title': 'theScore.com'}","soccer"

First minister announces plan for bank holiday on Monday 15 June after opening game against Haiti

Football fans needn't worry about the hangover when they celebrate, or otherwise, into the wee hours after Scotland's first match in the 2026 World Cup – because the day after the 2am UK time fixture looks likely to be a national bank holiday there.

The first minister, John Swinney, announced that Monday 15 June will be designated a national bank holiday to mark Scotland's participation in the tournament for the first time since 1998.

The anticipation among Tartan Army fans has been building since their team qualified for the men's football World Cup for the first time in more than a quarter of a century after a breathtaking 4-2 win against Denmark at Hampden Park in November.

Swinney said: “I am taking steps to ensure the Monday after our opening game should be a national bank holiday so that – no matter the outcome of the match – we can all come together to share the occasion.”

Bank holidays can be appointed in Scotland by royal proclamation, with the first minister advising the privy council on proclamations that are then designated by the king. It means that public-sector employees whose work is managed by the Scottish government will get a day off, with the decision at the discretion of other employers.

Scotland men's national team will play their first fixture against Haiti on Sunday 14 June, with a kick-off at 2am UK time. This will be followed by other late-night starts at 11pm, including against Brazil, who beat Scotland 2-1 in Scotland's last World Cup outing back in 1998.

The significant time difference, as well as the expense of tickets precluding travel for many fans, has prompted industry calls for extended pub opening hours and fan zones on the days Scotland are playing.

Swinney said: “Scotland qualifying for the men's World Cup was a remarkable achievement and a landmark moment, and the reaction to the dramatic win against Denmark reminded us all what football means to the country.

“This year, we want to make the most of this huge opportunity for Scotland and ensure as many people as possible have the opportunity to celebrate the team's success.

“Not only is this an historic sporting event, it's also a chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, create tourism interest within the country and to make cultural and sporting connections.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

The 2026 FIFA World Cup™ tournament is set to kick off in mid-June. As the North America-hosted event inches closer, the fervor for ""the beautiful game"" continues to grow thanks to the help from global institutions like The LEGO Group.

In addition to prepping a 2,482-piece LEGO® version of the World Cup™ trophy, the creativity-oriented company has put together a 1,498 piece soccer ball (football) block set. Instead of recreating the upcoming tournament's adidas Trionda Official Match Ball, the new set opts for a more generic look. Multiple panels come together across the build, donning hits of pink, blue, and white. The LEGO® set's most defining characteristic, however, is the miniature stadium hidden inside. Fan-filled stands surround a pitch and winning team, looking ahead to World Cup™ Final.

Enjoy a closer look at the $130 set ahead. The item should land on LEGO.com soon.

Manchester United have finally put Ruben Amorim out of his misery. On Monday morning, the 20-time champions of England announced that the Portuguese had ""departed his role as head coach"" and that the decision had been ""reluctantly"" made to ""give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish"". Of course, the table doesn't make for particularly poor reading for United.

They're sixth in the standings, and just three points off Liverpool in fourth, so, in that sense, progress had been made, given the Red Devils finished 15th last season. However, United had only won one of their previous five league games under Amorim, who continued to confuse with his stubborn tactical approach and bizarre substitutions. 

So, when he went public with his frustration with the set-up at Old Trafford after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds, his exit became somewhat inevitable. Indeed, Amorim departs with the lowest win ratio of any United manager in the Premier League era (32%), with his time in charge characterised by almost constant disappointment.

Below, GOAL runs through the worst 10 moments of a truly woeful reign...

Before the Manchester derby on September 14, 2025, Amorim was asked whether he or Pep Guardiola had bigger problems to resolve, given United were actually above City in the standings after three games of the new season.

""To compare me with the situation of Pep is just a joke,"" Amorim said. ""I think we have bigger problems."" He was right, too, as all of United's issues were laid bare during a 3-0 defeat to a team that had lost their previous two league games.

As well as lacking a real cutting edge (just two of their 12 shots were on target), United were once again wide open at the back, prompting further criticism of Amorim's preferred formation.

""When Ruben Amorim first came I was heartened by them playing three at the back,"" former United right-back Gary Neville said on Sky Sports. ""But every single game he changes the back three, which tells me he is not sure which back three he should play.

""It was a nothing game from United. They are 14th in the league only four games in and we all said that they can't be getting to October where they are 14th or 15th in the league or the manager will be in trouble. There are a few games to go but they have to start winning quickly.""

By the tail end of last season, it was clear that Amorim was almost solely focused on the Europa League - as it represented United's only hope of Champions League qualification. However, the nature of the performances in the league were still disturbing, with the 4-1 loss to Newcastle on April 13 the most obvious case in point.

Despite dropping Andre Onana, United still turned in another disastrous defensive display at St. James Park as they slumped to a defeat that meant the club would definitely post their lowest-ever Premier League points haul. Worryingly, Amorim had no real explanation for all of the mistakes his players were making.

""It's a little bit of everything,"" he said. ""It's hard to point to one thing. So, I understand [the criticism] but I don't care. Nothing is worse than losing games. People can say whatever they want to say. But I don't want to defend myself or anything like that. If you look at our position in the table, it says it all.""

Despite their dire league form, the FA Cup actually felt like a realistic target for Amorim's United - and particularly after they followed up their shock third-round elimination of Arsenal at the Emirates with a 2-1 win over Leicester City.

However, the Red Devils were dumped out of the competition - and in their own back yard - after being beaten by Fulham in a shootout after a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.

It represented a 10th defeat for Amorim in 24 games - a startling statistic made all the more remarkable for the fact that his much-maligned predecessor, Erik ten Hag, hadn't hit that figure until his 55th match in charge. Nonetheless, Amorim insisted that he was starting to get to grips with the job.

""The goal is to win the Premier League,"" he told the BBC. ""I know that we are losing games, but the goal is to win the Premier League again. I don't know how long it will take but we have a goal and we continue forward no matter what. It's impossible to know when but you start understanding the players are better and we understand the league. So, we'll see in the future.""

Bryan Mbeumo did not enjoy a happy return to the Gtech Community Stadium in September, as Manchester United were beaten 3-1 by his former club. However, while the home fans revelled in the opportunity to mock the Cameroon international for moving to Old Trafford during the summer, with chants of 'You should have stayed at a big club' ringing around the game, Mbeumo wasn't the one held responsible for United's defeat.

Had Bruno Fernandes converted a second-half penalty, the visitors would have left London with at least a point, but even the captain wasn't cast as the main culprit. As far as Match of the Day pundit Micah Richards was concerned, Amorim was to blame for United failing to win an eighth consecutive league game on the road.

""The system is hampering [the players],"" the former Manchester City defender said. ""They're not sure where they're meant to be.

""In terms of the goals, there were individual errors. Harry Maguire was trying to play offside for the first one - there's no point gambling there. But, for the second, Matthijs de Ligt doesn't know where's he's going and Maguire isn't sure where to position himself. It's 100 percent confusion caused by playing that system. It doesn't suit the players.""

A dramatic derby win at the Etihad on December 15, 2024 was portrayed as a statement victory for Amorim just over a month into his tenure. However, United were brought crashing back down to earth by three consecutive defeats, against Bournemouth, Wolves and Newcastle, and without scoring a single goal.

It meant that only bottom side Southampton had lost more times since Amorim's first game in charge on November 24, and also resulted in his side dropping to 14th in the table - the club's lowest position at the turn of the year since 1989.

Nonetheless, it still came as a surprise to hear Amorim admit that relegation was a ""possibility"" for one of the richest clubs in world football. ""It is also my fault,"" he told reporters, ""because the team is not improving. It is a little bit lost in this moment and it is a bit embarrassing to be Manchester United coach and lose a lot of games.

""But I think people are tired of excuses at this club. This club needs a shock.""

United began 2025 showing some fight, as they came from behind to claim a 2-2 draw at Liverpool thanks to Amad Diallo, who then hit a 12-minute hat-trick to earn a 3-1 win over Southampton on January 16.

Just three days later, though, and it felt like United were back to square one after a humbling 3-1 loss at home to Brighton. Indeed, a disillusioned Amorim even went so far as to claim that his team was maybe ""the worst"" in United's history.

""In [the past] 10 games in the Premier League, we won two,"" he pointed out. ""Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me. We are getting a new coach who is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that.

""I know you [the media] want headlines but I am saying [we are the worst] because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines!""

Things appeared to be finally picking up for Amorim in October, after he managed to oversee three successive Premier League wins for the first time. However, November opened with back-to-back 2-2 draws with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham that exposed United's usual defensive frailties.

Worse was to come, though, in their third and final fixture of the month, as Amorim's men lost 1-0 at home to Everton despite playing more than 77 minutes of the game against 10 men following Idrissa Gueye's remarkable dismissal for striking his own team-mate.

Funnily enough, the United manager felt that the incident illustrated the kind of passion and commitment to the cause that his team often lacks.

""Fighting is not a bad thing,"" he reasoned. ""Fighting doesn't mean that they don't like each other. Fighting means that when you lose the ball and 'I will fight you because we will suffer a goal.' I hope my players, when they lose the ball, fight each other.

""Old Trafford was there saying to us 'we are all here to give a big step up', but I felt that we were not ready. Again, these five weeks, when everyone is praising our evolution, I'm always saying the same things. We are not even near what we're supposed to be in this club.""

When asked about his very unhappy anniversary as United boss, Amorim also tellingly admitted, ""I feel afraid of returning to the [negative] feeling of last season. That is my biggest concern. We need to work together. We are going to work together. The players are trying but we need to be better.""

A hard-fought Boxing-day win over Newcastle with an under-strength side had lifted the spirits at Old Trafford as the turn of the year approached. However, on December 30, United were held at home by the Premier League's basement boys Wolves, who had arrived in Manchester on an 11-game losing streak.

Worse still, Wolves had actually appeared the more likely winners of the game before the hosts had a late strike from Patrick Dorgu disallowed for offside.

Again, Amorim had been shorn of the services of some key players but he at least conceded that United had lacked fluidity, quality and creativity. Still, he was adamant that United were ""going to be a strong team"" as soon as they got back to full-strength.

""There is no doubt in mind,"" Amorim said, just six days before his dismissal.

Amorim's one saving grace last season was United's thrilling run to the final of the Europa League, with the 5-4 last-eight second-leg win over Lyon undoubtedly one of the most incredible European nights Old Trafford had ever witnessed. However, all anyone remembers now is United losing 'El Crapico', the showdown at San Mames between two of the worst-performing teams in the Premier League.

In fairness to Amorim, his side dominated the game against Tottenham in Bilbao. However, despite having 73% possession and 16 shots to Tottenham's three, United ended up being beaten by their opponents' only shot on target all evening, from Brennan Johnson. It was an awful goal to concede, too, but rather indicative of United's often comically bad defending under Amorim.

However, despite squandering a golden opportunity to sneak his side into the Champions League, Amorim insisted that he remained the right man for the job.

""I know the patience of the fans will be really short in the next season, but I guarantee you I will not quit and I will not go away,"" he declared. ""I am really confident I am still the guy, more than in the beginning.""

Any hope that United might improve after overhauling their attack during the summer was quickly dispelled after an utterly humiliating Carabao Cup second-round shootout loss at Grimsby Town.

The visitors had actually done well to force penalties, after finding themselves 2-0 down inside half an hour at Blundell Park, but Amorim was disgusted that he'd even had to bring on the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Matthijs de Ligt to turn around a game against League Two opposition.

""I think this is a little bit the limit,"" the Portuguese admitted. ""I think something has to change. I think the team and the players spoke really loud today. I think the best team won, the only team that was on the pitch. The way we start the game without any intensity, we were completely lost.""

Unfortunately for Amorim, he also looked out of his depth - particularly as he once again couldn't bring himself to watch the shootout.

However, the most damaging image of the night - and arguably the defining image of his tenure - was the manager frantically moving pieces around a tactics board as he tried to get to grips with Grimsby during a opening hour for United!","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Get ready for a massive day of tennis across the Tasman. From Aryna Sabalenka's first match of 2026 to Venus Williams' season kickoff and a winner-take-all United Cup showdown between Australia and Czechia, we have the storylines to watch.

But for one match, Aryna Sabalenka would have a perfect 14-0 record at the Brisbane International.

The World No. 1 hasn't forgotten.

“Of course, remembering [the 2024] final,” Sabalenka said, “I really want to do just a little bit better.”

Elena Rybakina knocked out a 6-0, 6-3 win in that championship match, which in retrospect cost Sabalenka the chance to win three consecutive titles in Brisbane. Sabalenka can make it three in four years with a win in this stacked WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz 500 event.

Her journey begins Tuesday with a match against Cristina Bucsa, who was a three-set winner over qualifier Anna Bondar in the first round. Sabalenka is familiar with her game because their only previous meeting came at last year's US Open, when she defeated Bucsa 6-1, 6-4 in the fourth round.

As it turns out, Rybakina also kicks off her new year on Tuesday when she faces Zhang Shuai. Rybakina owns a 2-1 head-to-head record, but she lost to Zhang at the 2022 Australian Open when she retired.

Rybakina, the No. 3 seed, could meet Sabalenka in the semifinals. She has a perfect 5-0 record playing Brisbane.

“I know the courts well,” Rybakina told reporters. “I know the conditions. So I really like that also we have a roof, which helps on couple of courts.

“Yeah, I really enjoy always my time here. I think the courts, since it's fast, it's good for my game, so I'm just looking forward to start.”

Sabalenka, who has appeared in three straight Australian Open finals, winning two of them, also has the kind of power game that thrives Down Under.

“I always enjoy coming here,” Sabalenka told reporters on Saturday. “I always show my best tennis here. I enjoy playing in front of all of the people. I'm really excited to be back and really hope to do well again.”

The first match at Patrick Rafter Arena features 2024 Australian Open champion Madison Keys opposite fellow American McCartney Kessler, who was a 6-1, 6-3 winner over Emiliana Arango.

Three-time Brisbane champion Karolina Pliskova withdrew from the singles draw with a right lower leg injury and was replaced by Lucky Loser Yulia Putintseva, who scored a 6-2, 6-4 first-round victory over Hailey Baptiste.

Pat Rafter Arena: starts 11:00 a.m. (8 p.m. ET)

Show Court 1: starts 11:00 a.m.

Show Court 2: starts 11:00 a.m.

Meanwhile, in Sydney Australia and Czechia, both 1-0, will battle for the Group D title.

When Australia's Maya Joint came up ill, Storm Hunter stepped in and scored two points, defeating Malene Helgo in singles and teaming with John-Patrick Smith in mixed doubles to defeat Norway 2-1. Hunter, ranked No. 428 in singles, was ecstatic.

“Super, super happy,” Hunter said afterward. “Just glad that I could do my part tonight. Just wanted to go out there and, yeah, give it a good crack.”

Team captain Lleyton Hewitt said he isn't sure if Joint will be available for her singles match against Barbora Krejcikova; if not, it would again be Hunter.

Elena Vesnina addressed comments made by Veronika Kudermetova after her former doubles partner claimed parts of a 2025 interview given on Vesnina's “Spring is Calling Весна зовёт\]” podcast [aired without her consent.“My interview with Veronika was one of the first I had done for my podcast last year,” the former WTA doubles No. 1 said in an exclusive statement to TENNIS.com. “I would have never posted anything that my guest had a problem with or asked for me to remove, nor would my production team have put it on the air.”Kudermetova attempted to walk back an anecdote shared in the cold open for Vesnina's podcast, in which the married world No. 30 revealed ATP player Holger Rune had slid into her DMs on social media.

“It was just a private conversation between me and Elena Vesnina while we were setting up the cameras before the interview; I didn't think they would include it in the final version,” Kudermetova claimed in an interview with Tatar-Inform, a Russian-language publication. “That is, the story about Rune was off-camera. I even asked them not to include that segment. But in the end, the podcast was released, and it turned out to be quite provocative.”Vesnina, who partnered Kudermetova to reach the 2021 Wimbledon women's doubles final, has become a full-time analyst and podcaster since officially retiring from tennis in 2024, and pushed back on the accusation when asked for comment over the weekend.“We discussed the comments with her straight away after the interview and she didn't tell us there was anything couldn't publish,” Vesnina said. “But this situation has gotten out of control.

Kudermetova expressed regret that Rune received criticism and mocking as a result of the story, one that was echoed by fellow player Anna Kalinskaya in a later interview with another former WTA player, Anna Chakvetadze.“Veronika is not the only player to have told a story like this,” Vesnina said. “I think we've all learned something from this.

Plus, Ella Langley earns her first Hot 100 top 10.

	Gary Trust



Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” tops the Billboard Hot 100 for a ninth week, besting “Anti-Hero” as the sole longest-leading hit among her 13 career No. 1s.


	“The Fate of Ophelia” surges back to the Hot 100's summit from No. 28 as holiday hits recede from the chart's upper reaches, a week after they claimed a weekly-best top 24 positions. The lead single from Swift's album The Life of a Showgirl reigned in its first eight weeks on the ranking, dating to its mid-October debut. “Anti-Hero” claimed its eight-week No. 1 run upon its start in November 2022.


	Elsewhere, Ella Langley lands her first Hot 100 top 10, as “Choosin' Texas” vaults 48-5. It leads the Hot Country Songs chart for a sixth week.


	Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Jan. 10, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Jan. 6. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. Plus, for all chart rules and explanations, click here.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“The Fate of Ophelia” drew 18.3 million official streams (up 9% week-over-week) and 60.7 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 12%) and sold 30,000 (up 779%) in the United States Dec. 26-Jan. 1.


	The single adds an eighth week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; falls to No. 3 from its No. 2 high on Radio Songs; and lifts 5-4 on Digital Song Sales after six weeks at No. 1. It's the highest-selling song of the week overall, with 26,000 in physical singles, via vinyl versions that shipped during the tracking week, and 4,000 downloads.


	As “The Fate of Ophelia” one-ups “Anti-Hero” for Swift's longest Hot 100 rule, here's a recap of her signature 13 No. 1s, ranked by most weeks at the summit.




	“The Fate of Ophelia” contributes to Swift's eight Hot 100 No. 1s totaling 27 weeks on top in the 2020s — both the most among all artists this decade.


	Overall, Swift's 13 No. 1s tie her for the fourth-most in the Hot 100's history. She has spent 45 weeks atop the chart, eighth-best all-time.


	With the latest Hot 100 dated Jan. 10, 2026, Swift has now placed at No. 1 in 11 distinct years (per chart dates), encompassing her 13 leaders: 2012, 2014-15, 2017, 2020-24 and, thanks to “The Fate of Ophelia,” 2025-26.


	Among the six acts that have each spent time atop the Hot 100 in 10 or more individual years, Swift now solely boasts the second-best total:




	Ella Langley achieves her first Hot 100 top 10, as “Choosin' Texas” soars 48-5 (topping its prior No. 11 peak before the holidays). It totaled 15.7 million streams (up 5%), 25 million in radio reach (up 2%) and sold 5,000 (up 1%) in the tracking week.


	The trad-country single rebounds 4-1 for a second week atop Digital Song Sales, as it leads the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a sixth week, dating to its first in early December.


	Meanwhile, Langley and Beyoncé are the lone stars with Hot 100 top 10s that name-check Texas in song titles. Prior to Langley (who's from Alabama), Houston's own Beyoncé logged two weeks at No. 1 in 2024 with “Texas Hold ‘Em.” (One other such song has hit the top 40: Waylon Jennings' classic “Luckenbach, Texas [Back to the Basics of Love]” reached No. 25 in 1977.)


	HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, flies 28-2 on the Hot 100, after eight weeks at No. 1 beginning in August.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” which ruled the Hot 100 for 10 weeks starting in May, returns at No. 3, tying for the highest reentry in the chart's archives (reflecting rules related, in part, to the fall of holiday songs). It adds a 24th week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (67.8 million, up 24%).


	Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” blasts back, from No. 36, to its No. 4 Hot 100 high.


	Kehlani's “Folded” rises to a new No. 6 Hot 100 best, from No. 51. It tops the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs charts for a fourth week each.


	Sombr's “Back to Friends” bounds 52-7 for a new Hot 100 high, as it adds a 13th week at No. 1 on Hot Rock & Alternative Songs.


	Swift's “Opalite” revisits the Hot 100's top 10 (54-8), after hitting No. 2, and two more songs reenter the chart in the tier: Leon Thomas' “Mutt,” at No. 9 after reaching No. 6, and Justin Bieber's “Daisies,” at No. 10 after peaking at No. 2.

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Ahead of Tyler Perry‘s Sista‘s Season 10 premiere on January 7 at 9 p.m., it has been revealed that Ebony Obsidian and Novi Brown will not be returning for the highly-rated drama's milestone season as series regulars. 


	Fans of the show can expect to see KJ Smith, Mignon, and Crystal Renee Hayslett return to their original roles with the addition of Jordan Coleman (All American: Homecoming) and Tunde Oyeneyin (Life & Beth) as series regulars. 


	Both Obsidian and Brown have been with the show since its inception in 2019 for 9 seasons. The former played hair salon owner, Karen Mott, and the latter played bank supervisor, Sabrina Hollins. No reason has been given for their departures. Reps confirm Brown's exit from the series, and it is as yet unknown if Obsidian will appear in Season 10 to conclude her storyline beyond the events in last season's finale.

					BET Sets Return Of Tyler Perry's 'Sistas' For Season 10		
			








	New episodes of Sistas following the premiere will air weekly on Wednesdays on BET. Watch the first trailer for the season below.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The hour-long series follows a group of single Black women as they navigate their complicated love lives, careers, and friendships through the ups and downs of living in a modern world of social media and unrealistic relationship goals. They must navigate this new-age dating scene as they search for love in their 30s.


	Season 10 of Tyler Perry's Sistas picks up with the gut-wrenching aftermath of a car bomb, and the fallout is far from over. This season, silence is louder than words, loyalties are tested, and as each woman wrestles with the past, not everyone will make it to the other side the same.

	











	Returning cast also includes Angela Beyince, Devale Ellis, Brian Jordan Jr., Chris Warren, and Monti Washington.


	Coleman will play Cheyenne Barnes, a fiercely confident hairstylist whose bold sexuality and razor-sharp wit command attention, masking the emotional scars she's carried for years. Though driven by a desire for luxury and ease, her reunion with her sister Andi slowly peels back layers of guarded vulnerability she's long tried to bury.


	Oyeneyin as Madison Truitt, a powerful, self-assured entrepreneur whose commanding presence and unapologetic ambition have carved her a space in a male-dominated world. Beneath her polished exterior lies a yearning for love and partnership—one that matches her strength, despite whispers that her standards are too high.


	“The longevity of Sistas is a testament to the incredible audience who has so deeply connected to the show. I know they will be invested in every plot line, every character, and a lot is going to happen this season. As always, we've got some big surprises, twists, and turns. It will not disappoint!” shared Perry, creator and executive producer.


	“Reaching a 10th season is a significant milestone that speaks to the incredible connection Tyler Perry's Sistas has forged with our audience,” said Louis Carr, President of BET. “We are profoundly grateful for our enduring partnership with Tyler Perry, whose vision continues to deliver compelling, must-watch television, and we are equally proud of the amazing talent, both returning and new, who bring these dynamic characters to life.”


	As we reported on December 17, ahead of the show's Season 9 finale, Sistas is on track to be the No. 1 scripted cable series of the year among Black adults 18-49 for the fifth consecutive year as well as the top series on cable among all Black viewers for the third year in a row, per live + same-day Nielsen data through October 5. Data for the remainder of the year is not yet available, which is why BET hasn't made the final declaration of success just yet.


	From Tyler Perry Studios, Season 10 of Tyler Perry's Sistas is executive-produced by Perry, written by Courtney Glaude, and directed by Armani Ortiz.

“General Hospital” star Josh Swickard kicked off 2026 with a bang!

The actor, who portrays Detective Harrison Chase on the long-running ABC soap, is expecting his third child with his wife, Lauren Swickard.

In a joint Instagram post shared on January 4, Josh and Lauren confirmed the happy news with a sweet video of their growing family.

“Exciting New Year's update from the Swickard fam . @joshswickard just a couple more months…” Lauren captioned the post.

The video began with footage of the couple and their two children, Savannah and Arthur, enjoying quality time on the farm outside of their Los Angeles home. “The Swickard farm is… GROWING!!!”

Another clip showed the soon-to-be mom of three cradling her baby bump as a horse playfully licked her dress. The video ended with adorable family photos.

Josh first met Lauren when she played his love interest in the 2019 film “Roped.” The two also starred together in the Netflix hit “A California Christmas” and “A California Christmas: City Lights.”

In 2013, Lauren landed her short-term role as nurse Janice on “General Hospital.” Speaking with Soap Opera Digest, Josh revealed what it's like working with his wife on the soap.

“I was more nervous than Lauren was, just because I know what a weird beast it is [to shoot a soap opera],” the actor told the outlet at the time. “Most of her work lately has been feature film stuff, which is just a completely different flow. But I was blown away by how calm and composed she was.”

Meanwhile, “General Hospital” fans flooded the comment section, sending heartfelt congratulations to the expecting parents.

One fan wrote, “Congratulations! How exciting! What a beautiful life you both created for yourselves and your children.”

Another commented, “I remember watching you guys in movies, and you guys have a real-life happily ever after.”

Someone added, “Wow! That is a great New Year's surprise! What a fantastic place to raise your children,” referring to the family's farm.

Josh and Lauren tied the knot on July 6, 2019, in a stunning outdoor ceremony at Hyde Park in Cincinnati, Ohio.

“We wanted the day to reflect our lifestyles and personalities, so ‘Old Hollywood Glamour' was a perfect choice!” Lauren told Over The Moon at the time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","DWTS Favorite Explains Why She Thinks She Didn't Make the Finale","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/melora-hardin-reveals-reason-missed-dwts-finale/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 02:00:54 GMT","

Making it all the way to the semifinals of “Dancing With the Stars” is no small feat, but for one season 30 contestant, it also came with lingering “what ifs.” Looking back on her near-finale run, Melora Hardin, the actress and longtime dancer, is opening up about the moment she believes may have changed her fate on the “DWTS” ballroom floor, and why the hit ABC series is as much about storytelling as it is about technique.

Hardin, who is best known for her roles on “The Office,” “Monk,” and “Transparent,” was one step away from the “Dancing With the Stars” season 30 finals. She never made the finale. It was NBA shooting guard Iman Shumpert and his pro partner, Daniella Karagach, who ended up winning the Mirrorball trophy that season.

Now Hardin is reflecting on her time on the show, as she told Entertainment Weekly, “I love a challenge. I love stretching. I love being pushed to the end. I love all of that. So in that regard, it was very much suited to my personality. I really wanted to learn all the dances. That was my wish at the beginning, because they ask you what your wish is. They want to try to make their celebrities happy.”

Hardin had a history in dance, having started training in ballet as a young girl. Needless to say, she sailed straight into the semifinals. Since she made it that far in the competition, she got to learn all the ballroom styles. She said, “So, I know if got it — my wish came true.”

While learning the different dance styles was enough for Hardin, she knows she could have achieved more. Now, she gave her thoughts on why her time on the show ended when it did.

She told Entertainment Weekly, “I said, ‘If I got to the finals, I'd love to put my pointe shoe on. One pointe shoe, and one bare foot.' They were excited about the idea of that. Then the time came around, and there was no way I was going to put my pointe shoe on. I was so exhausted. My ribs were hurting from this lift we'd done.”

She went on to explain that “DWTS” and producers are always “feeling you out.” They want to see “where you are with things.” Because of that rib injury, she couldn't put on that pointe shoe. She thinks that's the reason she didn't make the finals.

Hardin said, “I think if I said, ‘Yes, I'm putting my pointe shoes on,' I think I would have danced in the finale.”

She went on to add, “I don't want to disperse the magic for the audience, but I'm pretty certain that if I had said that, that I'd be putting my pointe shoes on, I would've been in.”

Had she made it to the finals with her pro partner, Artem Chigvintsev, she would have joined the rare company of 50+ year olds who competed for the Mirrorball. That list now includes John O'Hurley (season 1), Donny Osmond (season 9), Jennifer Grey (season 11), Kirstie Alley (season 12), Bill Engvall (season 17), Wayne Brady (season 31), and Elaine Hendrix (season 34).

Though the 2026 Critics Choice Awards certainly felt business as usual, with comedian Chelsea Handler hosting for the fourth straight year at the ceremony's third consecutive year at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, they did also represent the ongoing identity crisis that most televised awards shows are currently facing.

While much has been said by the team here at IndieWire about SAG's Actors Awards now streaming on Netflix and the Oscars heading to YouTube in 2029, the most pressing thing about the Critics Choice Awards is not its broadcast partner as much as it's the ceremony's relationship to the Golden Globes.

 










How that comes up immediately is that this go-round, the shows swapped weekends, so that the Critics Choice Awards became the first major televised awards show of the year. For attendees, the benefit of that is to re-enter awards season off of holiday break in a more casual setting (again, this awards show is inside a hangar, the Golden Globes are at the Beverly Hilton's International Ballroom).

There's a level of relief on the organizer's side too, given that, just two years ago, the CCAs were jam-packed into a marathon week of awards shows that had been delayed by the strikes. Last year, the ceremony was delayed until February, much further into Oscars season because of the Los Angeles wildfires. The latter ended up working to the show's benefit, as “Anora” winning Best Picture started the tide shift that clued everyone in on the film being the Oscars frontrunner.

This time, being first out the gate, the CCAs got to set the tone the way that the Globes usually do, and here lies that identity crisis. 

Both awards are voted on by entertainment journalists, with the Golden Globes having more of an international focus than the widely American voting body for Critics Choice. Back in the more controversial years, before its 2023 revamp, the Golden Globes had a reputation for being more populist, wanting to give their awards to the most famous awards contenders, while Critics Choice developed a reputation as the awards show that was more predictive of who would win the Oscars.

However, just as they switched show dates this year, Golden Globes and CCAs have also switched what the perception of what their winners are. Consider this: the Golden Globes leaning into being the more international awards body puts them more in tune with the Academy Awards. 

 










The love for “I'm Still Here” in particular was very influential on Oscars voters, especially when, as a result of the fires, they were given more time to watch films before choosing nominees. But the wins for fellow International Feature “Emilia Peréz” were also a bellwether for what was to come.

Meanwhile, the 2025 Critics Choice Awards winners were way more spread out, and arguably more populist, with the biggest surprise being that “Wicked” helmer Jon M. Chu won Best Director. He would go on to not even be nominated at the Oscars for directing the first half of the recent movie musical box office phenomenon.

When put in the position to develop the momentum for awards season winners, the 2026 Critics Choice Awards zigged in a lot of categories that even voters thought they would zag. 

“One Battle After Another” winning Best Picture came as a surprise to almost no one. “Marty Supreme” star Timothée Chalamet winning Best Actor and “Hamnet” star Jessie Buckley winning Best Actress makes sense from an Oscar predictions standpoint, but many other influential critics circles have been voting in other ways. Many were predicting either “The Secret Agent” star Wagner Moura or “Blue Moon” star Ethan Hawke to win the former, and “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You” star Rose Byrne to win the latter award. “Frankenstein” star Jacob Elordi and “Weapons” star Amy Madigan winning the supporting categories were the only film acting awards that felt climactic.

 










That said, 12 films won awards across 23 categories, so few people inside the ceremony could come off as unsatisfied. If there was one core issue with the telecast, it was which awards were given off-camera. The TV categories don't have any craft awards, so only Best Animated Series, Best Foreign Language Series, Best Comedy Special, and Best Variety Series were given off-air. 

But on the film side, while we were still in a time where it felt like certain categories were anyone's game, the CCAs chose not to air the two major director contenders Ryan Coogler and Paul Thomas Anderson winning Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay, respectively, for “Sinners” and “One Battle After Another.” While Anderson got to speak elsewhere, the primary representatives for “Sinners” onstage ended up being Best Young Actor/Actress winner Miles Caton and Best Casting/Ensemble winner Francine Maisler. 

The even more baffling omission was no Best Foreign Language Film, which had “The Secret Agent” win a slight upset. Even if Oscar frontrunner “Sentimental Value” was not actually nominated in the category, the Best Foreign Language Film included several other nominees that are still in the conversation for a Best Picture Oscar nomination, including the other three Neon contenders: “It Was Just an Accident,” “No Other Choice,” and “Sirāt.”

 










Best Picture presenters Moura and his “The Secret Agent” director Kleber Mendonça Filho had one of the best jokes of the night, saying how that category would be the “foreign” one in their native Brazil. But comparing the 10 Best Picture nominees at the CCAs, where “Sentimental Value” is the only film not in English, to the 12 films nominated for Drama or Musical/Comedy at the Golden Globes, almost half of which are not in English, it does feel like the latter awards body is more in line with how the Oscars, which have had at multiple international Best Picture nominees the last two years is evolving.

In terms of highlights from the room, Elordi stood up for “Adolescence” star Owen Cooper when he won for the Netflix limited series, as the teen actor plays the younger version of Elordi's character in the upcoming Warner Bros. Pictures release “Wuthering Heights.” Despite the perception that his fellow nominees seemed unenthused at him winning, “Train Dreams” star Joel Edgerton immediately went to Chalamet's table afterwards to congratulate him. 

And super-producer Amy Pascal, who is believed to be an inspirational figure for the show, did stop by “The Studio” table to catch up with her former Sony colleague Seth Rogen, and the name “James Bond” was mentioned.

Here's How She Rose to the Occasion","https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lucy-dacus-zohran-mamdani-interview-bread-and-roses-1235493926/","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:00:30 GMT","


							By 

	Simon Vozick-Levinson



	When Lucy Dacus walked onstage at the Jan. 1 inauguration of New York's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, music fans watching at home perked up with excitement. Dacus herself was feeling some big jitters. “I was so nervous, because I can't think of a higher-stakes stage that I've been on,” she says. “You can mess up your own things, but it's really not cool to mess up somebody else's thing.”


	In fact, Dacus nailed that moment with a stirring rendition of “Bread and Roses,” an early-20th-century anthem of the labor and women's suffrage movements. A couple of days later, she called Rolling Stone to take us behind the scenes of a historic day in New York.


	Her City Hall appearance, which was not announced until the day of the inauguration, came together in just a few weeks, after the mayor-elect's office reached out in early December. They went back and forth on what to perform — “It would have felt weird to get up and sing one of my own songs,” she says — before Mamdani's team suggested the storied protest song they went with.

	Dacus was familiar with “Bread and Roses” because of a performance she did with Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers, her boygenius bandmates, back in 2021 at a San Francisco benefit for the nonprofit organization of the same name. “It's such a beautiful sentiment,” she says. “The idea that you're not just fighting for your sustenance — you're fighting for your joy.”

	











	Although Dacus is based in Los Angeles, she's one of many people around the country who found something inspiring in Mamdani's promise to work toward a better life for all New Yorkers. In September, ahead of the mayoral election, she brought the popular progressive candidate out as a surprise guest during her set at the All Things Go festival in Forest Hills, Queens, just a few months after he made a similar appearance at one of MJ Lenderman's shows in Brooklyn.

	“I feel such love and joy in the crowd this evening, and this is what our city should feel like,” Mamdani told the crowd at All Things Go. “It should be a city where trans New Yorkers are cherished, a city where our queer neighbors are celebrated, and a city where each and every New Yorker can be the fullest version of themselves. And it has to be a city that all of us can afford, whether you're an artist, or a dreamer, or someone who works the night shifts. And that city, that city is within reach, if we're willing to fight for it.”


	On the frigid afternoon of the inauguration, Dacus walked onstage to join keyboardist Sarah Goldstone and looked out at the people assembled in front of City Hall. “It doesn't feel like that big of a crowd, actually,” she says. “It's not even as many people as I'd have at one of our concerts. But then, all of the cameras, you realize this is a global event.” She tried not to think too much about that, and focused on visualizing the images that went with poet James Oppenheim's lyrics as she sang.


	After finishing the song, she exchanged a hug with New York's new first lady, visual artist Rama Duwaji. “And on the way off the stage, I tried to fist-bump Bernie Sanders, which maybe confused him,” she adds. “But he said that I did a good job.”


	She also took the chance to chat with Broadway legend Mandy Patinkin, whose performance of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” was another highlight of the inauguration. “His voice is so iconic to me,” she says. (Hamilton star Javier Muñoz and Punjabi Canadian musician Babbulicious were also part of the festivities.)


	Ultimately, Dacus thinks it's no coincidence that Mamdani's vision for New York connected with so many creative artists. “When you make art, you realize that it's not a luxury,” she says. “People that make art know the value of having the time and presence to focus on your interests.” That connects with the theme of “Bread and Roses,” too: “I think people need to not look at organizing or participating as something that is only going to be draining. It's something that gives back a lot of purpose and beauty.”

	Mamdani himself has a background in the arts, having grown up as the son of noted filmmaker Mira Nair and, famously, put in some work as indie rapper Mr. Cardamom before entering politics at the suggestion of Das Racist's Himanshu Suri. 


	“I wonder if being creative is a great attribute for a politician, because when you're creative, you make something because you aren't satisfied that it doesn't exist,” Dacus continues, thinking out loud. “If he's bringing a creative approach to policy, I'm glad. Maybe more politicians should be creative.”

LEGO's newest Creator release proves that big ideas come in compact packages. The Space Exploration Telescope (set 31378) landed on shelves January 1, 2026, with 278 pieces that transform into three completely different models: a fully adjustable telescope with spinning planets, a working microscope, or a posable UFO. At $34.99, this set sits comfortably in impulse-buy territory while delivering the kind of replay value that keeps kids engaged long after the initial build.

What makes this set particularly clever is how it uses a single light brick across all three models. The telescope projects celestial images onto walls, the microscope illuminates specimens, and the UFO beams light from its underside. Three decorated lenses featuring a planet, star, and Moon add educational depth that goes beyond typical building sets. For parents seeking STEM toys that actually encourage experimentation rather than collecting dust on a shelf, this Creator set deserves serious consideration.

Designer: LEGO










That primary telescope build is surprisingly robust for being one of three options. Standing over 10.5 inches (27 cm) tall, it has a decent presence, and the tripod design is stable enough for actual play. The accompanying solar system, with its seven spinning planets, is a fantastic kinetic detail that adds life to the model. The projection feature is the real engineering win here. It takes what would be a static display piece and gives it an interactive purpose that cleverly mimics what a real telescope does: show you images of space. It's a smart, elegant solution for a toy.








When you get tired of stargazing, the rebuild into a microscope shows the true genius of the part selection. The core housing for the light brick and lens assembly gets flipped vertically, and what was once a projection system becomes an illumination source. The same decorated lenses that projected planets now serve as makeshift slides, which is a brilliant way to teach kids about functional design and repurposing components. It's a solid B-model that feels complete and intentional, demonstrating how form follows function with just a few clever reconfigurations of the same 278 bricks.



The final build, a UFO, is the set's playful wild card. It shifts the entire theme from educational STEM hardware to pure science fiction. The designers did a great job creating a classic saucer shape with posable antennae and legs that flip out for landing. Here, the light brick serves as a simple beam underneath the craft, perfect for imaginative scenarios. This C-model provides an essential creative outlet, proving the set's versatility extends beyond scientific instruments. It's the build that lets kids take the parts and just have fun, which is arguably the most important function of any LEGO set.



The set is available now through LEGO's official website, Target, and authorized LEGO retailers for $34.99. Batteries for the light brick come included, which saves you a trip to the store or the inevitable disappointment of discovering you need them mid-build. The recommended age is 8 and up, though younger kids with building experience could handle it with minimal supervision. Digital instructions are accessible through the free LEGO Builder app, which lets you zoom, rotate, and track build progress on your phone or tablet. LEGO's website currently shows a 60-day shipping window, so if you're ordering online, factor that into your timeline.

Donald Trump shared a post suggesting that Tim Walz ordered the killing in revenge for Melissa Hortman voting to strip healthcare from illegal immigrants

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

The children of murdered Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman have called for Donald Trump to take down a Truth Social post, which linked her killing to the state governor, Tim Walz.

Hortman and her husband, Mark, were murdered on June 14, 2025, along with their golden retriever, by a man impersonating a police officer. 

Over the weekend, Trump re-shared a post suggesting that fellow Democrats targeted the Hortmans for “exposing a multi-billion dollar money laundering fraud going to illegal immigrants.”

Colin Hortman, the son of the murdered couple, begged Trump to take the post down in an emotional statement as the family continues to grieve.

“I am asking President Trump to remove the video that he shared and apologize to me and my family for posting this misinformation and for using my mother's own words to dishonor her memory,” he wrote in the statement, which was seen by NBC News. 

Trump's post included a video that claimed that the alleged fraud case involved “child care” and “health care rackets,” run by Somali immigrants, whom the social media user claims came to the United States illegally. 

It goes on to claim that the Hortman couple's alleged shooter, Vance Boelter, had been ordered to carry out the murder by Governor Tim Walz. 

The motive given was that Hortman had voted against her party to strip taxpayer-funded health care coverage for illegal immigrants shortly before her death. 

The evidence given by the original social media user was a letter, written by Boelter and mailed to FBI Director Kash Patel. In the document, Boelter claims that Walz instructed him to kill Amy Klobuchar, among some other redacted names.

Boelter, a former employee of Walz's, alleged that the governor would “hurt my family” if he did not “play ball.” 

He also details an alleged meeting, organized by the governor, in which he met with a woman referred to as “Mel.”

According to Boelter, he carried out a double shooting shortly after. 

Lawmakers maintain that Boelter first attempted to murder John Hoffman, a member of the Minnesota Senate, his wife, Yvette, and their daughter, Hope. According to the attorney's office, all three survived the attack.

Boelter allegedly travelled to the Hortman's residence shortly after, before killing the couple. He was caught two days later in the biggest manhunt in Minnesota state history. 

Currently, he faces six federal charges in relation to the case, including stalking, murder, and attempted shooting. If found guilty, the Attorney's Office says that he faces life in prison or even death. 

Governor Walz, who ran as a running mate with former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, has vehemently denied the suggestion that he ordered Boelter to commit the crime. He has also condemned the president for re-sharing the conspiracy theory on social media.

“Dangerous, depraved behavior from the sitting president of the United States,” Walz wrote. “In covering for an actual serial killer, he is going to get more innocent people killed. America is better than this.”

Meanwhile, the Hortman family has reiterated its call for Trump to take down the post. Sophie Hortman, Colin's sister, wrote that the post promotes a “false narrative.”

“The video being shared by the president is another hurdle our family must overcome in grieving the loss of my parents, Mark and Melissa, and their beloved [dog] Gilbert,” she added, in a statement also seen by NBC News. “I ask President Trump to please consider the pain and sadness we have faced, and to honor the spirit of the holidays we have just spent without our parents by taking down the post on Truth Social.”

In recent weeks, Trump has seized upon conspiracy theories about immigration to Minnesota by Somali migrants. 

His administration recently shared an AI-generated trailer for an animated film entitled Minnesota Millionaires, which depicts Somali men travelling to the state in order to defraud the state's daycare program.

“We don't need to be pirates anymore. I found a better way. Government-funded daycare. We must go to Minnesota,” a character in the video says, referencing the fraud cases leveled against some daycare centres that support the children of Somali immigrants. 

Amid the intense pressure put on the Minnesotan government by Trump over the daycare fraud allegations, Walz decided to drop out of the 2026 Minnesota Gubernatorial Race. 

Speaking at a public statement today, Walz said that he could not give “give a political campaign my all” after an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state.”

He cited the childcare program investigations as a particular example of the pressures placed upon him, ever since he rocketed to fame as Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 election. 

“Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St. Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said in a statement. “They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.”

I saw a cylindrical object passing in the same location as the other cylindrical object.  It was so high that it disappeared into the distance. It's the second of four sightings I've made in this region; so far I don't know what it is! Unidentified flying object.*
    


CANAÃ UFO NEWS/INVESTIGATION GROUP



      The question of the most convincing UFO sighting ever recorded is complex and often depends on individual belief and the nature of the evidence. However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples:
    


      Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail.
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature.
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting."" - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee.
    


      Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling.
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



Corroboration: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



Triangular Craft Sighting: [""I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/

Just as its name suggests, ‘Fireplace 10 hours full HD' is just 10 hours of a cozy fireplace burning away to the sound of crackling wood. It's definitely not the most spectacular clip ever uploaded to YouTube, but that didn't stop it from generating over 157 million views in under 10 years. Considering the video has been monetized since its upload in 2016, it is estimated that the creator has made over $1 million from this video alone. 

YouTube is actually full of long clips, often recorded on a loop and meant to be played in the background without causing a distraction. It's a recipe that works, and most creators post multiple such videos to maximize earnings. But that is not the case with ‘Fireplace 10 hours full HD'. The channel, also named ‘Fireplace 10 Hours', has just one upload in the last decade, so the fact that it was able to generate over $1 million in ad revenue is crazy. 

The fact that this is the only video on the channel has fueled a debate around the recipient of the ad revenue. Some have claimed that because the channel does not abide by YouTube's rule to have at least three uploads to even be considered for its partner program, the platform gets all the ad revenue from ‘Fireplace 10 hours full HD'. However, that rule only came into effect in 2023, so this 2016 channel should not be subject to it.

Regardless of who is entitled to the ad revenue, the fact that a 10-hour clip of a cozy fireplace has racked up over 157 million views on YouTube is proof that you don't have to come up with something new and exciting, hire editors, or post every day.

The Justice Department has requested a weeklong delay in returning a group of Venezuelan nationals deported under the Alien Enemies Act to the United States, citing the recent U.S. military operation in Venezuela.

Defendants for the Trump administration have been facing a Monday deadline imposed by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to either “facilitate the return” of the Venezuelan nationals to the U.S. or “otherwise provide them with hearings that satisfy the requirements of due process.” The Venezuelans in question were deported in March 2025 to a megaprison in El Salvador due to their alleged ties to the Tren de Aragua gang, before being transferred to Venezuela under a prisoner exchange.

In a last-minute plea on Sunday night, DOJ lawyers said the extension is necessary because the military operation over the weekend has led to “substantial changes” in the country, most notably the arrest of now-former President Nicolas Maduro.

“Over the weekend, the United States apprehended Nicolas Maduro,” the one-page court filing reads. “As a result, the situation on the ground in Venezuela has changed dramatically. Defendants thus need additional time to determine the feasibility of various proposals. Defendants therefore request a 7-day extension to evaluate and determine what remedies are possible.”

Boasberg has yet to respond to the request, though the toppling of Maduro's government has added a wrinkle to the case that now threatens to drag on even further.

VENEZUELANS POUR INTO STREETS TO CELEBRATE MADURO'S FALL

Maduro, who is now detained in New York City and will appear in court on Monday, was sympathetic toward the alleged gang members' detention in El Salvador, previously referring to them as “kidnapped brothers” and demanding their return to Venezuela.

With Maduro gone and many of the former detainees since released into the country after the prisoner swap, it is unclear where they are or what their status would now be.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

China's leading contract chipmakers are pursuing large domestic acquisitions to expand capacity as Beijing doubles down on semiconductor self-sufficiency.

China's two largest pure-play foundries, SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor, are in the middle of significant consolidation efforts that demonstrate how industrial policy is reshaping the country's chip sector, with SMIC about to take full control of a subsidiary for US$5.8 billion and Hua Hong set to acquire 97.5% of Shanghai Huali Microelectronics from its state-owned parent for US$1.2 billion.

The two multi-billion-yuan deals come as China's access to advanced manufacturing equipment remains constrained by U.S.-led export controls, forcing domestic players to rethink how they scale, where they invest, and which parts of the semiconductor market they prioritize. While the most obvious and immediate aim is capacity and operational efficiency, the broader objective is to harden China's semiconductor supply chain against external pressure while consolidating state resources around a smaller number of national champions.

 






According to the South China Morning Post, SMIC's proposal to acquire its Beijing-based subsidiary, SMIC Jingcheng, for roughly ¥40 billion is emblematic of what is becoming an emerging trend. The Beijing fabs are already majority owned by SMIC, but bringing them fully onto the parent's balance sheet simplifies governance, capital allocation, and future expansion planning. Meanwhile, Hua Hong is pursuing a similar approach by acquiring Shanghai Huali, its closely linked sister foundry, in a deal valued at more than ¥8 billion.

These might look like internal restructurings on paper rather than straight-up mergers between rivals, but they represent a deliberate pivot away from the fragmented growth model that defined China's foundry build-out over the past decade. Instead of creating new entities to chase specific technologies or regional subsidies, Beijing now appears to be encouraging consolidation around existing leaders, with state investors providing the financial backstop.

Why? Because building and equipping fabs has grown dramatically more expensive, even at mature process nodes. At the same time, export controls have reduced the returns on chasing leading-edge manufacturing, particularly below 7nm. By consolidating, SMIC and Hua Hong can pool cash flows from profitable legacy production, reduce duplicated R&D and administrative overhead, and present a more coherent face to regulators and customers.

 




Perhaps the most striking feature of China's current foundry strategy is not what it is building, but what it is not. While SMIC has demonstrated limited capability using DUV lithography, the bulk of new capacity tied to these consolidation moves sits at 28nm and above, including 40nm, 55nm, and 65nm processes.

These nodes are far, far away from the prestige of leading-edge 2nm or 3nm, but they remain both commercially viable and important. Automotive microcontrollers, power management ICs, display drivers, connectivity chips, and a wide range of industrial and consumer components still rely on mature manufacturing. Global shortages during the pandemic — and the recent, still-ongoing Nexperia-Wingtech spat — highlighted just how fragile supply at these nodes can be.

China has leaned heavily into this, with industry estimates suggesting that more than half of all new global capacity additions at mature nodes through the mid-2020s are located in China. Hua Hong's Shanghai fabs alone add tens of thousands of wafers per month at 40nm and 65nm, while SMIC's multiple sites cover an even broader spread of legacy processes.

This serves several purposes for China. Firstly, it reduces dependence on foreign suppliers for essential components used across the economy. Secondly, it creates a buffer against sanctions that target advanced equipment. Thirdly, it positions Chinese foundries as increasingly important suppliers to global customers who need stable access to mature nodes, even if geopolitical concerns complicate sourcing decisions.

U.S. export controls remain the defining constraint on China's ambitions at the cutting edge. Restrictions on EUV lithography tools, advanced deposition equipment, and certain design software have slowed progress below 7nm and raised costs for any attempt to push further using workarounds.

Consolidation does not remove these limits, but it does change how Chinese firms operate within them. Larger, integrated foundries are better positioned to absorb higher tool costs, manage complex multi-patterning flows, and negotiate with domestic equipment suppliers that are still maturing. They also offer a clearer channel for state support, whether through direct funding, favorable financing, or guaranteed demand from state-owned enterprises.

As Washington tightens scrutiny of potential sanctions circumvention, having fewer, larger entities also simplifies compliance and reduces the risk that smaller, less visible fabs become flashpoints for enforcement actions. From Beijing's perspective, consolidation is as much about political risk management as it is about manufacturing efficiency. China's foundry consolidation is likely to have its biggest impact at mature nodes, and as Chinese capacity continues to grow, pricing pressure on legacy processes is expected to increase. Foundries in Taiwan, Japan, and parts of Southeast Asia that rely heavily on these nodes may find margins squeezed, particularly for commodity products.

At the same time, not all customers will be willing to shift sourcing to China. Concerns around export controls, intellectual property protection, and supply chain resilience are obvious sticking points, and some Western companies are already looking to diversify away from Chinese fabs even if that means higher costs. This points toward a more segmented market, where Chinese foundries dominate domestic and select international demand, while non-Chinese fabs serve customers with stricter geopolitical or regulatory constraints.

SMIC and Hua Hong's acquisitions are unlikely to produce dramatic short-term shifts in China's technological standing. They do, however, reveal a maturing phase in Beijing's semiconductor strategy. The emphasis is shifting from rapid expansion to consolidation, from aspirational leadership at the cutting edge to dependable strength across the bulk of the market.

While U.S. and allied firms continue to concentrate resources on advanced nodes, advanced packaging, and heterogeneous integration, China is building scale and resilience where it can compete most effectively today. That does not preclude future breakthroughs at the leading edge, but it suggests a longer-term strategy built on volume and incremental gains rather than rapid node-to-node leaps.

In a comparative study, the early addition of radiotherapy to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was associated with improved 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival compared with TACE alone among patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

These findings, the authors wrote, “demonstrated clear improvements in both [overall survival] and [progression-free survival] with the combined therapy and further revealed that the magnitude of these benefits varied according to tumor size, AFP level, and response to TACE.” Prospective trials are warranted, the authors added, but in the meantime their proposed stratification model “may help identify appropriate candidates for this combined therapy.”

This study, led by Jinhong Jung, MD, PhD, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea, was published online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics.

This study was retrospective and conducted at a single center, which may have introduced selection bias and limited generalizability. Treatment allocation was not randomized, and patients who received radiotherapy more often had a poorer initial response to TACE. Heterogeneity in the number and timing of TACE sessions and in radiotherapy dose fractionation may have influenced outcomes. Treatment-related toxicity was not systematically assessed.

No funding was received for this study. The authors declared no relevant conflicts of interest.

An actor from HBO‘s groundbreaking drama “Oz” has passed away. The Hollywood Reporter published an obituary for Jon Korkes, who played the recurring role of Tom Robinson in the show, on Sunday, January 4. Korkes' death was announced on social media by the Stella Adler Studio of Acting, where the HR's report says he taught from 2008 until this November. The report says there are currently no further details on his passing.

The Stella Adler Center for the Arts honored Korkes in a statement on their Facebook page. They wrote:

 “We mourn the passing of Jon Korkes, beloved actor, teacher, and longtime member of the Stella Adler Studio community.

Jon began teaching with us in 2008 and continued every single semester through this past November. As a central scene study teacher in our Workshop Program, he brought decades of experience across film, television, and theater into the classroom, meeting each student exactly where they were. He loved teaching, and his students knew it.

Jon's extraordinary career spanned more than five decades. He made his Off-Broadway debut in Little Murders in 1968 and appeared in films including Catch-22, The Day of the Dolphin, Riding in Cars with Boys, and The Double. His television work included a recurring role on Oz and guest appearances on All in the Family, Maude, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Larry Sanders Show, Homicide, and Law & Order.

Jon's legacy lives on through the countless actors he inspired… on stage, on screen, and in the classroom. He will be deeply missed.”

In December 2011, actress Simone Soares shared a candid shot of the star.

Joe Goskinsci, a Stella Adler faculty member who specializes in voice and speech, per the center's website, posted a heartfelt tribute to Korkes on January 3. 

Goskinsci wrote, “Mourning the loss of a good friend, and gifted artist, Jon Korkes. Jon always greeted me with a welcoming smile and a sarcastic joke or two, followed by stories that came from a career spanning 6 decades.

He went on to share fond memories of his friend, writing, “When Alan Arkin passed away two years ago he told the most endearing and enlightening stories of a friendship that grew out of the first time they worked together. Jon shared his thoughts about the play ‘Marty' which he loved and thought had great scenes in it for actors, and always had a suggested book for me to read or old movie to watch that ‘he just watched again the other night.'”

The educator also talked about Korkes' love of sports, reminiscing, “He was an avid Celtics fan, and we'd talk about sports theatre, his belief of what good acting was, his review of the latest sandwich made for him by the ‘guy downstairs', and anything and everything. And he'd never forget to ask how I was doing. A class act through and through. I reached out to him recently to check up on him when he was sick, and he thanked me and called me a ‘good friend'. And for that title I'm deeply honored. The studio will not be the same without him, and he'll be deeply missed.”

In 2022, actress Dangelyn Vargas warmly acknowledged Korkes for his efforts. In the caption of a photo showing the native New Yorker with a group of students she called him “a brilliant mind” before going on, “Thank you for pushing me. And trusting me with the parts that you gave me. I'm in awe of you. Your wisdom and kindness.”
