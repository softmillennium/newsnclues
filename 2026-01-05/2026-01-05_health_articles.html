                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reconstructive surgical procedures often involve prosthetic implants or transplanted tissue from elsewhere in the body. So, researchers reporting in ACS Applied Bio Materials developed a prototype injectable paste derived from human skin cells that could help restore breast volume after tumor removal, with less scarring and shorter healing time than current options. Pham Ngoc Chien, one of the study's lead researchers During breast cancer treatment, cancerous cells and damaged tissue are often taken out, sometimes resulting in complete removal of the breast. For those who want to keep their breast volume, physicians turn to breast-conserving surgical techniques, where the remaining tissue is rearranged to account for space left by the tumor removal. Sometimes, skin and fat are even donated from other parts of the body to fill in the gaps left behind, like a skin graft. An alternative strategy involves acellular dermal matrix (ADM) - skin that has been processed to remove the outermost layer. This leaves a material with important cellular components for healing, including collagen, elastin and growth factors. Currently, ADM is available primarily in sheet form for tendon repair or plastic surgery, but Chien, Chan-Yeong Heo and colleagues wanted to create an injectable form of ADM that would be suitable for space-filling reconstructive breast surgery. The researchers took a sample of skin donated by a living female participant and processed it through a series of steps including decellularizing, freezing and pulverizing to form small ADM particles. The team injected small amounts of this paste into rats to test its biocompatibility and compared it to two commercially available ADM products. After a six-month period, the rats presented no adverse health effects. Thinner tissue layers are preferable in breast implant procedures because they're less likely to cause complications such as infections or hematomas. Longer-term safety trials and more complex tests are necessary before this material could be considered for clinical use. But the researchers say that this work highlights the potential of their ADM implant to improve breast reconstruction surgery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than half of the world's population speaks more than one language-but there is no consistent method for defining "bilingual" or "multilingual." A team of New York University researchers has now created a calculator that scores multilingualism, allowing users to see how multilingual they actually are and which language is their dominant one. These new formulas provide a clear, evidence-based way to understand your language strengths and how multilingual you truly are, bringing scientific clarity to an everyday part of life for millions of people." Blanco-Elorrieta and Xuanyi Jessica Chen, an NYU doctoral student and the paper's lead author, developed the formulas-embedded in a multilingual calculator that users can deploy to measure their multilingualism and language dominance-that are drawn from two primary variables: Age of language acquisition for listening, reading, speaking, and writing Self-rated language proficiency for listening, reading, speaking, and writing The authors-both multilingual speakers-note that past research has shown that self-rated language proficiency is, in fact, an accurate and efficient measure of actual language proficiency. The researchers also implemented other statistical controls to minimize self-rating bias. They add that, similarly, age of language acquisition has been shown to be a predictor of abilities: the earlier one learns a language, the more likely it is they will be able to master native-like proficiency in that language. The researchers validated their measure by testing it in two distinct populations: healthy young bilinguals and older bilinguals with language impairments. They compared their results to those obtained from existing methods that rely on acquiring much more extensive language background information. Across both groups, the formulas produced language-dominance results that were nearly identical to those generated by more complicated measures, showing that the new approach is both simple and accurate. "Rather than just labeling someone as 'bilingual' or 'monolingual,' this tool quantifies how multilingual one is," notes Chen. "This calculator offers a transparent, quantitative tool that researchers, clinicians, and educators can adopt to better characterize multilingual populations, ultimately improving research quality and real-world applications-from language education to clinical assessment," concludes Blanco-Elorrieta.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology has launched a randomized phase III clinical trial called RECIPROCAL (Alliance A032304) to explore whether doctors can optimize the timing of targeted radiation therapy to minimize side effects while preserving efficacy in men with advanced prostate cancer. Our goal in this trial is to strategically improve both survival and quality of life for men living with advanced prostate cancer. We hope to prove we can safely adjust the therapy based on an individual's cancer instead of sticking to a rigid schedule, thus maintaining the effectiveness of targeted radiation therapy while reducing side effects." Thomas Hope, MD, Alliance study chair, nuclear medicine physician and Professor in Residence, University of California, San Francisco The current standard of care for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer includes Lutetium-177 Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) targeted Radioligand Therapy (RLT), a targeted radiation therapy attached to a drug molecule and injected into the bloodstream. While PSMA RLT improves survival, it can cause side effects, such dry mouth, fatigue and gastrointestinal issues. Serious side effects can include blood disorders, kidney damage or liver problems. All participants will start by receiving two infusions of PSMA RLT every six weeks. During this time, if a patient's prostate specific antigen (PSA) level falls, they will be randomized into one of two groups: Our goal with RECIPROCAL is to show that treatment can be smarter, not just stronger. By tailoring therapy to each patient's PSA response, we aim to reduce unnecessary toxicity and diminish side effects while still delivering the same survival benefit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international research team identified hundreds of genes essential for the development of brain cells, including one gene linked to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder not previously described. Which genes are required for turning embryonic stem cells into brain cells, and what happens when this process goes wrong? In a new study published today in Nature Neuroscience, researchers led by Prof. Sagiv Shifman from The Institute of Life Sciences at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in collaboration with Prof. Binnaz Yalcin from INSERM, France, used genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens to identify genes that are needed for early brain development. The study set out to answer a straightforward question: which genes are required for the proper development of brain cells? Using CRISPR-based gene-editing methods, the researchers systematically and individually "switched off" roughly 20,000 genes to study their role in brain development. By disrupting genes one by one, the team could see which genes are required for this transition to proceed normally. Using this approach, the team mapped key steps in neural differentiation and identified 331 genes that are essential for generating neurons. Many of these genes had not previously been linked to this process, and the findings may help clarify the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental conditions, including altered brain size, autism, and developmental delay. PEDS1 is required for the production of plasmalogens, a specialized class of membrane phospholipids that are enriched in myelin, the fatty sheath that insulates nerve fibers. In their genetic screen, the researchers also found that PEDS1 plays an important role in nerve cell formation and that its loss leads to reduced brain size. Based on these results, the team hypothesized that PEDS1 deficiency could also disrupt human brain development. To test causality, the researchers inactivated PEDS1 in experimental models. Prof. Sagiv Shifman of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at Hebrew University explains: "By tracking the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neural cells and systematically disrupting nearly all genes in the genome, we created a map of the genes essential for brain development. This map can help us better understand how the brain develops and identify genes linked to neurodevelopmental disorders that have yet to be discovered. Identifying PEDS1 as a genetic cause of developmental impairment in children, and clarifying its function, opens the door to improved diagnosis and genetic counseling for families, and may eventually support the development of targeted treatments." For genes that regulate other genes, such as those involved in regulating transcription and chromatin, disorders are often dominant, meaning a mutation in just one copy of the gene can be enough to cause disease. By contrast, disorders linked to metabolic genes (including PEDS1) are often recessive and require mutations in both copies of the gene, typically with each parent carrying one altered copy. The team's "essentiality map," which shows when genes are required during development, also helped clarify differences between the mechanisms underlying autism and developmental delay. Genes that are broadly essential were more strongly associated with developmental delay, while genes that are specifically critical during the stages of nerve cell formation were more strongly associated with autism. This helps explain how disruptions in different pathways can lead to overlapping symptoms and supports the view that changes in early brain development can contribute to autism. Prof. Shifman added: "This was an excellent idea from PhD student Alana Amelan, who carried out a large part of the study and also created the website. We wanted our findings to serve the entire scientific community, supporting ongoing work on the genes we identified and helping researchers pinpoint additional genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders." The study provides a comprehensive map of genes involved in early nervous system development and highlights molecular mechanisms underlying a developmental disorder that affects the developing brain. These insights may improve genetic diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders and help lay the groundwork for medical research into new approaches to prevention and treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A drug mimicking the hormone progesterone has anti-cancer activity when used together with conventional anti-estrogen treatment for women with breast cancer, a new Cambridge-led trial has found. A low dose of megestrol acetate (a synthetic version of progesterone) has already been proven as a treatment to help patients manage hot flushes associated with anti-estrogen breast cancer therapies, and so could help them continue taking their treatment. The PIONEER trial has now shown that the addition of low dose megestrol to such treatment may also have a direct anti-cancer effect. These women are usually offered anti-estrogens, medication that reduces level of estrogen and hence deprives the cancer of estrogen and inhibits its growth. After two weeks of treatment, those that received the combination saw a greater decrease in tumor growth rates compared to those treated with an anti-estrogen only. PIONEER was led by Dr Richard Baird from the Department of Oncology at the University of Cambridge and Honorary Consultant Medical Oncologist at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH). He said: "On the whole, anti-estrogens are very good treatments compared to some chemotherapies. They're gentler and are well tolerated, so patients often take them for many years. But some patients experience side effects that affect their quality of life. If you're taking something long term, even seemingly relatively minor side effects can have a big impact." Some ER-positive breast cancer patients also have high levels of another molecule, known as progesterone receptor (PR). This group of patients also respond better to the anti-estrogen hormone therapy. To explain why, Professor Jason Carroll and colleagues at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute used cell cultures and mouse models to show that the hormone progesterone stops ER-positive cancer cells from dividing by indirectly blocking ER. When mice treated with anti-estrogen hormone therapy were also given progesterone, the tumors grew even more slowly. Professor Carroll, who co-leads the Precision Breast Cancer Institute, said: "These were very promising lab-based results, but we needed to show that this was also the case in patients. There's been concern that taking hormone replacement therapy – which primarily consists of estrogen and synthetic versions of progesterone (called progestins) – might encourage tumor growth. Although we no longer think this is the case, there's still been residual concern around the use of progesterone and progestins in breast cancer." To see whether targeting the progesterone receptor in combination with an anti-estrogen could slow tumor growth in patients, Dr Baird and Professor Carroll designed the PIONEER trial, which tested adding megestrol, a progestin, to the standard anti-estrogen treatment letrozole. A total of 198 patients were recruited at ten UK hospitals, including Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, and randomised into one of three groups: one group received only letrozole; one group received letrozole alongside 40mg of megestrol daily; and the third group received letrozole plus a much higher daily dose of megestrol, 160mg. In the two-week window that we looked at, adding a progestin made the anti-estrogen treatment more effective at slowing tumor growth. Although the higher dose of progesterone is licenced as an anti-cancer treatment, over the long term it can have side effects including weight gain and high blood pressure. But just a quarter of the dose was as effective, and this would come with fewer side effects. We know from previous trials that a low dose of progesterone is effective at treating hot flushes for patients on anti-estrogen therapy. This could reduce the likelihood of patients stopping their medication, and so help improve breast cancer outcomes. Megestrol – the drug we used – is off-patent, making it a cost-effective option." Dr. Rebecca Burrell, joint first author from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and CUH Because women in the trial were only given megestrol for a short period of time, follow-up studies will be needed to confirm whether the drug would have the same beneficial effects with reduced side-effects over a longer period of time. The specialist facility planned for the Cambridge Biomedical Campus will bring together world-leading researchers from the University of Cambridge and its Cancer Research UK Cambridge Centre and clinical excellence from Addenbrooke's Hospital under one roof in a brand-new NHS hospital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It said: "When was the last time you were STD tested?" "Luckily, I had not caught HIV, but it was a wake-up call," they said. That experience moved Hurley to seek out PrEP, shorthand for preexposure prophylaxis. The therapy is 99% effective at protecting people against sexual transmission when taken as prescribed. Hurley started PrEP and all was well for the first nine months  -  until their health insurance changed and they started seeing a new doctor: "When I brought PrEP up to him, he said, 'What's that?' Hurley, who is a librarian, went into teaching mode. They explained that the PrEP regimen they'd been on required daily pills and lab work every three months to look out for breakthrough infections or other health issues. Hurley was surprised they knew more about PrEP than the physician. Hurley said older friends and acquaintances who survived the AIDS epidemic shared the horror of living through a time when there was no effective treatment or drugs for prevention. Oller said many queer people have had negative experiences during health care visits. "I have a lot of patients who had not done preventive care for years because of the medical stigma," she said. Hurley started receiving a string of bills for PrEP-related care. They knew  -  even if the billing office didn't  -  that under the Affordable Care Act most private insurance plans and Medicaid expansion programs are required to cover PrEP and ancillary services, like lab tests, as preventive with no cost sharing. The bills for doctor visits and blood draws piled up. Hurley would appeal the bill and get a denial almost every time. Hurley shared a series of appeal letters for one service, in which the billing office acknowledged that blood work had been initially incorrectly coded as diagnostic. They dealt with at least six incorrect bills over several months. Hurley estimated they spent more than 60 hours contesting the bills. During that time, Hurley said, the billing department "is continuing to send me emails and bills that are saying, You're overdue. Fed up with the hassles, Hurley decided to find a health provider (and billing office) better informed about PrEP. Hurley hasn't gotten an unexpected bill since. "I have multiple organizations that I have to deal with to get my holistic health dealt with," Hurley said. A provider doesn't need to be an HIV specialist, an infectious disease expert, or a physician to prescribe PrEP. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages primary care providers to treat PrEP like other preventive medications. To avoid some of the headaches Hurley faced, try these tips: The CDC estimates 2.2 million Americans could benefit from HIV prevention drugs, but just over a quarter of that group have been prescribed them. "Not enough people know about PrEP, and there are a number of people who know about PrEP but do not realize it's for them," said Jeremiah Johnson, executive director of PrEP4All, an organization dedicated to universal access to HIV prevention and medication. According to the CDC's clinical guidelines, PrEP can be prescribed as part of a preventive health plan to anyone who's sexually active. It's especially recommended for people who don't use condoms consistently, intravenous drug users who share needles, men who have sex with men, and people in relationships with partners living with HIV or whose HIV status is unclear. The vast majority of PrEP users are men. For example, based on the patterns of new infection in the U.S., a group that would benefit from PrEP is cisgender Black women, whose gender identity aligns with their sex assigned at birth. If your doctors aren't well informed, start by educating yourself. There are also clinical guidelines and information you can share with your provider. Under the Trump administration, some HIV/AIDS resources have been taken down from federal websites. Others now have headers saying: "This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department rejects it." Johnson said Hurley's experience with billing mistakes is common. "The lab expenses in particular end up being very tricky," Johnson said. For example, a doctor's office may mistakenly code the lab work required for PrEP as a diagnostic test instead of preventive care. Patients like Hurley can end up with a bill they shouldn't have to pay. If your doctor's office is making mistakes, share the PrEP billing and coding guide from NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs. If the lab is out-of-network, Johnson said, it can be difficult to appeal. And if you can't resolve the dispute, Johnson said, file a complaint with the agency that regulates your insurance plan. There are lower-cost, generic versions of Truvada, for example, sold as emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, often shortened to FTC/TDF. Newer PrEP drugs Apretude and Yeztugo have list prices in the thousands of dollars. With many health care premiums dramatically increasing and millions at risk of losing Medicaid coverage, many people may go without health insurance this year. Drug manufacturers such as Gilead and ViiV have assistance programs for qualifying patients. If you have to pay out-of-pocket, prescription price comparison websites, like GoodRx, can help you find the pharmacies with the cheapest price. Telehealth is an increasingly popular option if you don't live near an affirming provider or are looking for a more private way to get PrEP. Online pharmacies like Mistr and Q Care Plus offer PrEP without an in-person appointment, and lab work can be done at home. Some telehealth options have ways to lower the cost if you're uninsured. Telehealth can also broaden the number of doctors who are ready to prescribe PrEP. "They're in the comfort of their own bedroom or living room but can interface virtually with a provider.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Golden berries (Physalis peruviana) are a nutrient-dense fruit rich in steroidal lactones, polyphenols, and fiber with demonstrated anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects in preclinical models. Golden berries (Physalis peruviana) are native to the Andean highlands of Peru and Ecuador, with commercial production in Colombia, South Africa, the United States, and New Zealand. Rather than relying on limited human evidence, current “metabolic” mechanistic support for goldenberry comes primarily from in vitro enzyme/AGE-inhibition assays and animal studies.2 For example, calyx preparations have been evaluated for α-glucosidase inhibition and AGE-formation inhibition in vitro - two targets that are relevant to postprandial glycemia and glycation-associated tissue stress.2 Golden berries elicit anti-inflammatory effects by limiting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation and downstream cytokine production. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophages, golden berry extract reduced nitric oxide, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and PGE2 levels.3 Mechanistically, golden berry extract was reported to reduce NF-κB signaling by preventing IκBα degradation and reducing p65 nuclear translocation in LPS-stimulated macrophages, consistent with lowered production of pro-inflammatory mediators.3 Oxidative stress also declined, as demonstrated by reduced MPO activity, neutrophil infiltration, and ROS levels.3 While observational and intervention studies in humans have linked higher overall fruit intake (as a dietary pattern) to lower levels of common inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP and cytokines, targeted clinical trials that isolate goldenberry-specific effects on these endpoints are still needed.3 In an obese rat model of metabolic syndrome, a high-fat diet combined with daily golden berry intake reduced fasting blood glucose levels and improved insulin signaling, as demonstrated by higher INSR and PPARγ expression, as well as lower levels of FASN and LPL.4 Liver weight decreased with golden berry supplementation, suggesting lower hepatic fat accumulation, whereas brown adipose tissue mass increased, which is consistent with improved energy expenditure potential. Visceral and subcutaneous fat pads were lighter, with overall weight gain attenuated as compared to control rats consuming a high-fat diet alone. Fresh golden berries are tart-sweet and often consumed as a snack, in fruit salads, salsa for fish or poultry, or as a garnish. Dried golden berries are often incorporated into trail mixes, baked goods, and compotes, or rehydrated for sauces. Drying reduces water activity into the microbial-safe range of 0.23-0.52, thereby improving shelf stability at room temperature when stored in airtight packaging away from light.5 Thus, dried golden berry products made with gentle and rapid dehydration retain more bioactive compounds.2,5 Powdered golden mixes can be incorporated into smoothies, yogurt, oatmeal, and baked goods. Golden berry powders should similarly be stored in moisture-proof, opaque containers and refrigerated or frozen after opening to slow vitamin loss.2,5 Golden berries are routinely processed into jams, juices, syrups, and savory or sweet appetizers. Goldenberry contains multiple classes of potentially functional compounds, particularly steroidal lactones (physalin/withanolide-related compounds), phenolics, carotenoids, vitamin C, and fiber, with preclinical evidence supporting anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects. Golden berries contain numerous bioactive compounds, including withanolides, carotenoids, vitamin C, and fiber, that mitigate inflammation, support glucose control, and improve triglyceride handling. Preclinical models suggest that golden berry intake inhibits NF-κB, reduces cytokine levels and oxidative stress, while conferring improvements in insulin pathways, lipids, and hepatic fat.2 Further ReadingAll Superfood ContentAmla (Indian Gooseberry) Health Benefits: From Vitamin C to Anti-Aging EvidenceWhy Pomegranate Is Good for You: Evidence-Based Insights Into Its Health BenefitsGoji Berries: Health Benefits for Immunity, Vision, and MetabolismDo Superfoods Really Exist?More...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How an ancient Mediterranean resin is reshaping modern understanding of gut lining resilience, immune signaling, and microbiota-driven inflammation. Mastiha has been used throughout the Mediterranean region for over 2,500 years, with historical records from Hippocrates, Dioscorides, and Galen describing its use in managing gastrointestinal complaints such as dyspepsia, gastralgia, and peptic ulcers. Among these compounds, terpenes are particularly abundant, with monoterpenes like α-pinene, β-pinene, and β-myrcene, as well as triterpenes including mastihadienonic and isomastihadienonic acids.1,2 Rather than acting as a classical fermentable prebiotic fiber, mastiha appears to exert microbiota-modulating effects through selective antimicrobial activity and host–microbe immune signaling, indirectly supporting microbial diversity and gut homeostasis.3,4 Preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that mastiha modulates gut microbial composition rather than directly stimulating bacterial proliferation. In a murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model, mastiha supplementation improved hepatic steatosis and fibrosis while enhancing gut microbiota diversity. In human NAFLD trials, mastiha supplementation altered beta-diversity, downregulated pro-inflammatory taxa such as Flavonifractor, and reduced bile acid–related and phospholipid metabolites, suggesting indirect microbiota remodeling.3,4 In dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, oral mastiha protects against colon injury and attenuates expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, alongside adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1.7,8 Mechanistic studies demonstrate that mastiha triterpenes activate antioxidant defense pathways (including Nrf2-mediated glutathione synthesis) while suppressing NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades. In Sprague-Dawley rats with colitis, oral mastiha resin oil at 400 mg/kg/day decreased the total colitis index, while intrarectal administration significantly reduced TNF-α, with efficacy comparable to that of prednisolone. Across experimental colitis models, mastiha consistently downregulates TNF-α and IL-6, supporting its role as an immunomodulatory adjunct rather than a direct immunosuppressant.5–8 In a randomized controlled trial of adults with functional dyspepsia, 350 mg of mastiha resin three times daily for 21 days significantly improved epigastric pain and dyspeptic symptoms compared with placebo. These benefits are attributed to local antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on the gastric mucosa rather than acid suppression.1,10 Although direct IBS-specific trials are limited, extrapolation from IBD studies suggests benefit in symptoms driven by low-grade inflammation and barrier dysfunction. In a double-blind trial of 60 patients with IBD, 2.8 g/day of mastiha for three months improved IBDQ quality-of-life scores, reduced fecal lysozyme, and lowered oxidative stress biomarkers, without inducing clinical immunosuppression.8,10,11 Symptom improvement occurred in a subset of participants and should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited sample size.12–15 In quiescent IBD, six-month supplementation prevented increases in plasma free amino acids, an early metabolic marker of mucosal stress, without altering remission rates. Additional mechanistic studies demonstrate modulation of miRNA-155–Th17 signaling, preservation of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, and shifts in fecal metabolites linked to epithelial resilience rather than direct disease remission.10–15 Mastiha is available in several forms used across clinical and traditional settings. Chewing gum or whole resin pieces represent the oldest mode of intake. Powdered mastiha and encapsulated resin are most commonly used in clinical trials for dosing consistency.4,16 Clinically studied doses range from ~1 g/day for dyspepsia and H. pylori adjunct therapy to 2.2–2.8 g/day in IBD trials. Higher intakes (≥4 g/day) appear primarily in older or exploratory studies and are not routinely recommended. Trial durations typically range from 2 to 12 weeks, with more extended observational use requiring medical supervision.3,4 Allergic reactions are rare but possible, particularly in individuals with known sensitivities to Pistacia or Anacardiaceae. Animal toxicity findings occur at exposures far exceeding human supplemental doses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New study reveals that bacteria can survive antibiotic treatment through two fundamentally different "shutdown modes," not just the classic idea of dormancy. This distinction is important because antibiotic persistence is a major cause of treatment failure and relapsing infections even when bacteria are not genetically resistant, and it has remained scientifically confusing for years, with studies reporting conflicting results. By demonstrating that persistence can come from two distinct biological states, the work helps explain those contradictions and provides a practical path forward: different persister types may require different treatment strategies, making it possible to design more effective therapies that prevent infections from coming back. This phenomenon, known as antibiotic persistence, is a major driver of treatment failure and one reason infections can be so difficult to fully cure. For years, persistence has largely been blamed on bacteria that shut down and lie dormant, essentially going into a kind of sleep that protects them from antibiotics designed to target active growth. But new research led by PhD student Adi Rotem under the guidance Prof. Nathalie Balaban from Hebrew University reveals that this explanation tells only part of the story. The study shows that high survival under antibiotics can originate from two fundamentally different growth-arrest states, and they are not just variations of the same "sleeping" behavior. One is a controlled, regulated shutdown, the classic dormancy model. The other is something entirely different: a disrupted, dysregulated arrest, where bacteria survive not by protective calm but by entering a malfunctioning state with distinct vulnerabilities. "We found that bacteria can survive antibiotics by following two very different paths," said Prof. Balaban. "Recognizing the difference helps resolve years of conflicting results and points to more effective treatment strategies." The researchers identified two archetypes of growth arrest that can both lead to persistence, but for very different reasons:1) Regulated growth arrest: A protected dormant stateIn this mode, bacteria intentionally slow down and enter a stable, defended condition. These cells are harder to kill because many antibiotics rely on bacterial growth to be effective.2) Disrupted growth arrest: Survival through breakdownIn the second mode, bacteria enter a dysregulated and disrupted state. Yet despite intense research, scientists have struggled to agree on a single mechanism explaining why persister cells survive. Different experiments have produced conflicting results about what persisters look like and how they behave. This study offers an explanation: researchers may have been observing different types of growth-arrested bacteria without recognizing they were distinct. By separating persistence into two different physiological states, the findings suggest a future where treatments could be tailored, targeting dormant persisters one way, and disrupted persisters another. The team combined mathematical modeling with several high-resolution experimental tools, including: Together, these approaches revealed clear biological signatures distinguishing regulated growth arrest from disrupted growth arrest, along with the specific vulnerabilities of the disrupted state. Differentiation between regulated and disrupted growth arrests allows tailoring of effective treatments for antibiotic persistence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Self-harming and self-sabotaging behaviors, from skin picking to ghosting people, all stem from evolutionary survival mechanisms, according to a compelling new psychological analysis. Clinical psychologist Dr. Charlie Heriot-Maitland, in his new book Controlled Explosions in Mental Health, explores the biological necessities behind harmful behaviors. He argues that although these behaviors seem counterintuitive, the brain uses these small harms as a protective dose to prevent further harms. For example, someone may procrastinate starting a project, causing themselves harm, but trying to prevent a higher-stakes harm of failure or rejection. It needs us to exist in a predictable world. It does not want us to be caught off guard." "Being exposed to threats and dangers is bad enough, but the most vulnerable state for us humans is being exposed to unpredictable threat. Our brain cannot allow this, and will intervene to give us more controlled, predictable versions of threat. It would rather we were well-rehearsed in receiving internally-created hostility than risk being unprepared for it from others," explains Dr Heriot-Maitland. This protective mechanism operates on a fundamental principle: the brain would rather deal with the certainty of a controlled, known threat, than cope with the possibility of an out-of-control, unknown threat. The science behind this theory is based on how the human brain evolved, that is primarily for survival rather than happiness. Brains are hardwired to spot danger everywhere, which helped the species survive. However, it now means we are extra attuned to any potential hurts on the horizon – physical or emotional. Dr Heriot-Maitland suggests this evolutionary tactic of 'better safe than sorry', signifies that even though we know it might not be sensible to eat a share bag of chocolates, we do it anyway to avoid the bigger shame of failure. Another example is even when someone does not really hate us, we might still avoid them anyway instead of facing the bigger potential rejection. "Our brains have evolved to favour perceiving threat, even when there isn't one, in order to elicit a protective response in us. We have all inherited a highly sensitive threat-detection and threat-response system," he explains. Perfectionism operates similarly to procrastination, but through different mechanisms. While procrastination diverts attention away from tasks, perfectionists might show a hyper-focus and attention to detail with the hope of ensuring that errors are not being made. Self-criticism represents another form of self-sabotage, whether trying to self-improve or self-blame to create a feeling of agency and control – these behaviors all involve a neurological hijacking in which the brain's threat-response system co-opts higher cognitive functions, such as imagination and reasoning. The threat system utilises these cognitive functions, he explains, which is why when experiencing fear, our imagination can become instantly flooded with fear-related predictive scenarios. One problem with self-sabotaging behaviors, Dr Heriot-Maitland points out, is that they often become self-fulfilling prophecies. "Or if we think someone doesn't like us, and we avoid them, then our fear of rejection may have stood in the way of creating a relationship." Even if we can acknowledge these behaviors aren't helpful, addressing them requires to first understand their protective function rather than simply trying to eliminate them. The controlled explosions do harm us though – we must not lose sight of that either." Effective psychological interventions focus on processing the underlying emotional pain, he says, although acknowledges this is a 'tough choice' and unlikely to be a 'quick fix'. Dr Heriot-Maitland explains: "Resolving underlying harm can often involve both of these two aspects: creating safeness around the feared situation and feeling; grieving the loss of having a core need in that situation that was unmet, denied or dismissed." To utilise the brain's neuroplasticity and learn new, less harmful habits, people must deliberately choose to recognise and understand the behavior first, he argues: "To instil these compassionate motivations into a process like this is not just 'a given'. Heriot-Maitland concludes: "We don't want to fight these behaviors, but nor do we want to appease them and let them carry on controlling, dictating, and sabotaging our lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Circadian rhythms that are weaker and more fragmented are linked to an increased risk of dementia, according to a new study published on December 29, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study also found that circadian rhythm levels that peaked later in the day, rather than earlier, were also linked to an increased risk. The study does not prove that these factors cause dementia, it only shows an association. With a strong circadian rhythm, the body clock aligns well with the 24-hour day, sending clear signals for body functions. People with a strong circadian rhythm tend to follow their regular times for sleeping and activity, even with schedule or season changes. With a weak circadian rhythm, light and schedule changes are more likely to disrupt the body clock. People with weaker rhythms are more likely to shift their sleep and activity times with the seasons or schedule changes. Changes in circadian rhythms happen with aging, and evidence suggests that circadian rhythm disturbances may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. Our study measured these rest-activity rhythms and found people with weaker and more fragmented rhythms, and people with activity levels that peaked later in the day, had an elevated risk of dementia." Wendy Wang, MPH, PhD, study author, Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas Participants wore small heart monitors that adhere to the chest to measure rest and activity for an average of 12 days. Participants were then followed for an average of three years and during that time 176 people were diagnosed with dementia. Researchers reviewed heart monitor data for various measures to determine circadian rhythm strength. These measures included relative amplitude, which is a measure of the difference between a person's most active and least active periods. After adjusting for factors such as age, blood pressure and heart disease, researchers found when compared to people in the high group, those in the low, weaker rhythm group had nearly 2.5 times the risk of dementia, with a 54% increased risk of dementia for every standard deviation decrease in relative amplitude. Researchers also found people who experienced a peak of activity later in the afternoon, 2:15 p.m. or later, compared to earlier in the afternoon, 1:11 p.m.-2:14 p.m., had a 45% increased risk of dementia. Seven percent of those in the early group developed dementia, compared to 10% of those in the high group. Having a later peak of activity means there could be a difference between the body clock and environmental cues such as later hours and darkness. "Disruptions in circadian rhythms may alter body processes like inflammation, and may interfere with sleep, possibly increasing amyloid plaques linked to dementia, or reducing amyloid clearance from the brain," said Wang. "Future studies should examine the potential role of circadian rhythm interventions, such as light therapy or lifestyle changes, to determine if they may help lower a person's risk of dementia." A limitation of the study was that researchers did not have information on sleep disorders, like sleep apnea, which could affect the results.

This article discusses the importance of sulfur for various physiological processes, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) signaling, while offering practical ways to maximize allicin and sulforaphane intake for healthy aging. In proteins, sulfur-containing residues enable catalysis, redox sensing, and structural regulation. SAAs also support protein folding, repair oxidized targets, and rebuild damaged macromolecules, sustaining resilience under oxidative or metal stress.1,2 Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, kale, and cauliflower contain high levels of glucosinolates, whose concentration varies widely by species, cultivar, tissue, and processing rather than constituting a fixed percentage of total dry weight.3,6 Researchers have identified various organosulfur compounds in fish, chicken, and minced beef. Eggs, pasta, and rice primarily provide sulfur in the form of SAAs. Chicken, beef, and fish exhibit similarly high levels of SAA, with proportions ranging from 74% to 97%.3 Inorganic sulphate can also be found in tap water, with concentrations varying globally. H2S functions as a gasotransmitter that supports longevity through its role in mitochondrial respiration, redox signaling, and stress adaptation. Nrf2 binds antioxidant response elements (AREs) and induces phase II detoxification enzymes, including glutathione S transferases (GSTs), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) hydrogen [NAD(P)H] quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and enzymes for GSH synthesis. This limits oxidative damage, sustains redox homeostasis, and protects long-lived tissues.4 Cysteine-rich dietary isothiocyanates also attenuate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and inflammasome activation, thereby lowering chronic inflammation that accelerates biological aging.4,6 Protein persulfidation further protects catalytic cysteine residues from irreversible oxidation, preserving enzyme function under stress conditions.2 Crushing fresh garlic converts S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (alliin) to allicin through the enzyme alliinase. Allicin is transient and rearranges into organosulfur compounds such as diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, ajoene, and dithiins, with concentrations varying by preparation method, including powders, oils, or aged extracts.7 Garlic compounds modulate cytokine profiles, often decreasing tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while increasing interleukin-10 (IL-10). In vivo, allicin supports host defense by promoting macrophage activation and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling.5 Sulforaphane activates Nrf2, inducing detoxification enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1.6 In rodents, broccoli sprouts or purified isothiocyanates reduce carcinogen-induced tumor burden across multiple tissues and decrease polyp formation in adenomatous polyposis coli multiple intestinal neoplasia (ApcMin) models. Heating intact cloves first inactivates alliinase and prevents allicin generation. When cooking, lightly crushed garlic should be exposed only to moderate heat for short durations, as prolonged heating beyond approximately 10 minutes reduces bioactivity. Adding garlic toward the end of cooking or off heat helps preserve sulfur compounds. Pre-crushed garlic gently warmed in oil favors ajoene formation, whereas higher temperatures shift products toward allyl sulfides.7 Aged garlic extract provides stable, water-soluble sulfur compounds such as S-allyl cysteine with favorable bioavailability.7 Preparations that preserve plant enzymes maximize the production of bioactive sulfur metabolites. For crucifers, boiling, frying, blanching, and high-power microwaving reduce glucosinolates, whereas steaming better preserves myrosinase activity. Raw crucifers or sprouts yield higher sulforaphane exposure than myrosinase-free supplements, although gut microbial β-thioglucosidases can partially compensate for enzyme loss. Finely chopping allium vegetables activates alliinase, rapidly generating allicin and downstream sulfides. High-temperature processing significantly decreases organosulfur bioavailability, emphasizing the value of low-heat and minimal-water techniques.8 His academic journey has allowed him to delve deeper into understanding the intricate world of microorganisms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A closer look at how a traditional Adriatic way of eating translates Mediterranean heritage into measurable cardiovascular protection through diet, lifestyle, and long-term adherence. Like the Mediterranean diet, the Adriatic diet emphasizes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and olive oil, with regular fish intake, moderate dairy consumption, and limited red and processed meats.1,2 Consuming oily fish two to three times every week provides sufficient omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to lower triglyceride levels and modestly improve blood pressure, while also reducing inflammation. Extra-virgin olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fat and phenolic compounds, particularly hydroxytyrosol, which support endothelial function and reduce oxidative stress.2 Whole grains are high in fiber, which improves cholesterol regulation, inflammation, and weight management. Moderate wine intake with meals reflects traditional practice, although cardioprotective benefits are context-dependent and not required for cardiovascular risk reduction.2,4 The Adriatic diet aligns with the Mediterranean Diet through a plant-forward pattern, emphasizing extra-virgin olive oil as the primary fat, abundant vegetables and cereals, frequent fish, legumes, and a lifestyle that values seasonality, biodiversity, conviviality, and culinary tradition.3 Adriatic meals frequently feature ‘blue' oily fish, such as anchovies, prepared with olive oil and herbs. Regional culinary traditions include wild edible plants and bitter greens prepared with olive oil, reflecting historical food availability and cultural heritage rather than distinct nutritional advantages over other Mediterranean sub-patterns. Premium local virgin olive oils with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) further define flavor profiles and are commonly paired with vegetables, pulses, crudités, and fish.3 The Mediterranean dietary pattern reduces vascular inflammation, modulates pro-atherogenic gene expression, and decreases platelet aggregation. These cardioprotective effects are associated with reduced incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke in randomized trials.2,4 High fiber intake from whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruits, and vegetables improves metabolic health by lowering LDL cholesterol, improving glycemic responses, promoting satiety, and reducing blood pressure. Fiber also supports gut microbiome diversity, which is associated with lower production of pro-atherogenic metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide.4 Classic cohort studies from Mediterranean regions linked traditional dietary patterns rich in olive oil, fish, legumes, grains, fruits, and vegetables with low cardiovascular mortality despite relatively high total fat intake. In the PREDIMED trial, Mediterranean-style diets enriched with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts were associated with improved blood pressure control and a lower incidence of major cardiovascular events, with a reduction in stroke risk representing the most consistent individual outcome. Olive oil–rich dietary patterns are also associated with improved endothelial function and reduced vascular inflammation, contributing to favorable cardiometabolic risk profiles.2,6 The Adriatic diet is rich in olive oil, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole-grain cereals, and pasta, with regular fish and moderate dairy consumption. Individuals following the Adriatic diet often limit sweets, commercially baked pastries, and fast food. Irregular breakfast patterns and lower breakfast quality have been observed among Adriatic youth and are associated with poorer adherence to the Mediterranean diet.7 An Adriatic-style week typically includes fruit once to twice daily and vegetables daily, fish two to three times weekly, legumes at least once weekly, nuts two to three times weekly, and pasta or rice about five days per week. With an emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and frequent fish consumption, the Adriatic diet reflects a regional Mediterranean pattern associated with improved lipid profiles, lower blood pressure, reduced inflammation, and better vascular function. Evidence from cohort studies and randomized trials of Mediterranean dietary models aligns biomarker improvements with fewer major cardiovascular events, particularly stroke. Distinct regional culinary traditions enhance palatability, cultural continuity, and long-term adherence. Benefits, Nutrition, and How It Supports Women's HealthIs Watermelon a Superfood?
