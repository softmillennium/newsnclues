                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brenden Aaronson's coach has already had to defend him from fan abuse this season — twice. Aaronson showed just about everything that makes him valuable on one play against Manchester United, scoring a vital goal as Leeds stretched its unbeaten run to seven. The American's heroics at Elland Road kick off this week's Five. Brenden Aaronson has found his footing in the Premier League. The Leeds attacker scored his side's only goal in a 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Sunday, making it two goals and three assists in his last 11 Premier League appearances. It's a modest hot streak, but it's a massive improvement when considering Aaronson had one goal and three assists in his previous 44 Premier League games. The 25-year-old has become a key player this season for Leeds, which is now eight points clear of the relegation zone. The USMNT midfielder chased down a 50-50 ball, getting in behind United's defense and then showing the quality and composure to bury his chance. "Sometimes you have to take a chance," Aaronson said after the game. Leeds manager Daniel Farke was full of praise after the game for a player he has stuck with despite many calls for his removal from the lineup. He embodies what we are about in creating chances and working hard off the ball." Weston McKennie playing a new position is hardly earth-shattering news, but the Juventus man's latest shift is noteworthy in the context of his USMNT role. McKennie was moved into a trequartista – or attacking midfield – role against Lecce on Saturday, a similar spot to where he played under USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino in October. Though it was his first league goal, McKennie now has three goals and two assists in his past nine games in all competitions. After he was surprisingly omitted from two of three fall rosters for the USMNT, McKennie's proficiency as a trequartista served as a timely reminder for Pochettino. "It's not a new position for me," McKennie said after the game. "I like the trequartista role because you can help both defensively and offensively." Yunus Musah isn't yet a key player for Atalanta, but the midfielder's role is trending in the right direction. Musah has now played in four consecutive Serie A games for La Dea, coming off the bench for the last 30 minutes of Saturday's 1-0 win over Roma. After Musah was an unused sub in seven of eight matches, he has finally started to prove his worth to manager Raffaele Palladino. It certainly doesn't hurt that Atalanta has won three of its past four games either. "In the middle, he's a buzzing presence who brings freshness and keeps the midfield under Atalanta's control," read an assessment from Gazzetta dello Sport this week. If he can find a way to continue his mini-surge at Atalanta, there might still be a way back before the World Cup. There was no build-up period for Antonee Robinson. After nearly three months on the sideline with knee problems, the Fulham left back has now played every minute of six consecutive games, including Sunday's thrilling 2-2 draw against Liverpool. Robinson was excellent against Arne Slot's side, and could have had multiple assists with better finishing from his teammates. Very few, if any, games in La Liga history will have had so much Jersey as Sunday's match between Real Sociedad and Atlético Madrid. New Jersey-born coach Pellegrino Matarazzo made history in his Sociedad debut, becoming the first American manager in La Liga. New Jersey-born midfielder Johnny Cardoso, meanwhile, played the final half hour for Atlético in a 1-1 draw.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First minister announces plan for bank holiday on Monday 15 June after opening game against Haiti The first minister, John Swinney, announced that Monday 15 June will be designated a national bank holiday to mark Scotland's participation in the tournament for the first time since 1998. The anticipation among Tartan Army fans has been building since their team qualified for the men's football World Cup for the first time in more than a quarter of a century after a breathtaking 4-2 win against Denmark at Hampden Park in November. Swinney said: “I am taking steps to ensure the Monday after our opening game should be a national bank holiday so that – no matter the outcome of the match – we can all come together to share the occasion.” Bank holidays can be appointed in Scotland by royal proclamation, with the first minister advising the privy council on proclamations that are then designated by the king. Scotland men's national team will play their first fixture against Haiti on Sunday 14 June, with a kick-off at 2am UK time. This will be followed by other late-night starts at 11pm, including against Brazil, who beat Scotland 2-1 in Scotland's last World Cup outing back in 1998. The significant time difference, as well as the expense of tickets precluding travel for many fans, has prompted industry calls for extended pub opening hours and fan zones on the days Scotland are playing. “This year, we want to make the most of this huge opportunity for Scotland and ensure as many people as possible have the opportunity to celebrate the team's success. “Not only is this an historic sporting event, it's also a chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, create tourism interest within the country and to make cultural and sporting connections.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United have finally put Ruben Amorim out of his misery. They're sixth in the standings, and just three points off Liverpool in fourth, so, in that sense, progress had been made, given the Red Devils finished 15th last season. However, United had only won one of their previous five league games under Amorim, who continued to confuse with his stubborn tactical approach and bizarre substitutions. So, when he went public with his frustration with the set-up at Old Trafford after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds, his exit became somewhat inevitable. Indeed, Amorim departs with the lowest win ratio of any United manager in the Premier League era (32%), with his time in charge characterised by almost constant disappointment. Below, GOAL runs through the worst 10 moments of a truly woeful reign... Before the Manchester derby on September 14, 2025, Amorim was asked whether he or Pep Guardiola had bigger problems to resolve, given United were actually above City in the standings after three games of the new season. "To compare me with the situation of Pep is just a joke," Amorim said. He was right, too, as all of United's issues were laid bare during a 3-0 defeat to a team that had lost their previous two league games. As well as lacking a real cutting edge (just two of their 12 shots were on target), United were once again wide open at the back, prompting further criticism of Amorim's preferred formation. "When Ruben Amorim first came I was heartened by them playing three at the back," former United right-back Gary Neville said on Sky Sports. "It was a nothing game from United. They are 14th in the league only four games in and we all said that they can't be getting to October where they are 14th or 15th in the league or the manager will be in trouble. By the tail end of last season, it was clear that Amorim was almost solely focused on the Europa League - as it represented United's only hope of Champions League qualification. Despite dropping Andre Onana, United still turned in another disastrous defensive display at St. James Park as they slumped to a defeat that meant the club would definitely post their lowest-ever Premier League points haul. Worryingly, Amorim had no real explanation for all of the mistakes his players were making. "It's a little bit of everything," he said. But I don't want to defend myself or anything like that. Despite their dire league form, the FA Cup actually felt like a realistic target for Amorim's United - and particularly after they followed up their shock third-round elimination of Arsenal at the Emirates with a 2-1 win over Leicester City. However, the Red Devils were dumped out of the competition - and in their own back yard - after being beaten by Fulham in a shootout after a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. It represented a 10th defeat for Amorim in 24 games - a startling statistic made all the more remarkable for the fact that his much-maligned predecessor, Erik ten Hag, hadn't hit that figure until his 55th match in charge. "I know that we are losing games, but the goal is to win the Premier League again. I don't know how long it will take but we have a goal and we continue forward no matter what. It's impossible to know when but you start understanding the players are better and we understand the league. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Bryan Mbeumo did not enjoy a happy return to the Gtech Community Stadium in September, as Manchester United were beaten 3-1 by his former club. Had Bruno Fernandes converted a second-half penalty, the visitors would have left London with at least a point, but even the captain wasn't cast as the main culprit. As far as Match of the Day pundit Micah Richards was concerned, Amorim was to blame for United failing to win an eighth consecutive league game on the road. "In terms of the goals, there were individual errors. But, for the second, Matthijs de Ligt doesn't know where's he's going and Maguire isn't sure where to position himself. It's 100 percent confusion caused by playing that system. However, United were brought crashing back down to earth by three consecutive defeats, against Bournemouth, Wolves and Newcastle, and without scoring a single goal. It meant that only bottom side Southampton had lost more times since Amorim's first game in charge on November 24, and also resulted in his side dropping to 14th in the table - the club's lowest position at the turn of the year since 1989. Nonetheless, it still came as a surprise to hear Amorim admit that relegation was a "possibility" for one of the richest clubs in world football. It is a little bit lost in this moment and it is a bit embarrassing to be Manchester United coach and lose a lot of games. "But I think people are tired of excuses at this club. United began 2025 showing some fight, as they came from behind to claim a 2-2 draw at Liverpool thanks to Amad Diallo, who then hit a 12-minute hat-trick to earn a 3-1 win over Southampton on January 16. Just three days later, though, and it felt like United were back to square one after a humbling 3-1 loss at home to Brighton. Indeed, a disillusioned Amorim even went so far as to claim that his team was maybe "the worst" in United's history. "Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. "I know you [the media] want headlines but I am saying [we are the worst] because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Things appeared to be finally picking up for Amorim in October, after he managed to oversee three successive Premier League wins for the first time. However, November opened with back-to-back 2-2 draws with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham that exposed United's usual defensive frailties. Worse was to come, though, in their third and final fixture of the month, as Amorim's men lost 1-0 at home to Everton despite playing more than 77 minutes of the game against 10 men following Idrissa Gueye's remarkable dismissal for striking his own team-mate. "Fighting is not a bad thing," he reasoned. Fighting means that when you lose the ball and 'I will fight you because we will suffer a goal.' I hope my players, when they lose the ball, fight each other. "Old Trafford was there saying to us 'we are all here to give a big step up', but I felt that we were not ready. Again, these five weeks, when everyone is praising our evolution, I'm always saying the same things. When asked about his very unhappy anniversary as United boss, Amorim also tellingly admitted, "I feel afraid of returning to the [negative] feeling of last season. The players are trying but we need to be better." However, on December 30, United were held at home by the Premier League's basement boys Wolves, who had arrived in Manchester on an 11-game losing streak. Worse still, Wolves had actually appeared the more likely winners of the game before the hosts had a late strike from Patrick Dorgu disallowed for offside. Again, Amorim had been shorn of the services of some key players but he at least conceded that United had lacked fluidity, quality and creativity. Still, he was adamant that United were "going to be a strong team" as soon as they got back to full-strength. "There is no doubt in mind," Amorim said, just six days before his dismissal. Amorim's one saving grace last season was United's thrilling run to the final of the Europa League, with the 5-4 last-eight second-leg win over Lyon undoubtedly one of the most incredible European nights Old Trafford had ever witnessed. However, despite having 73% possession and 16 shots to Tottenham's three, United ended up being beaten by their opponents' only shot on target all evening, from Brennan Johnson. It was an awful goal to concede, too, but rather indicative of United's often comically bad defending under Amorim. Any hope that United might improve after overhauling their attack during the summer was quickly dispelled after an utterly humiliating Carabao Cup second-round shootout loss at Grimsby Town. The visitors had actually done well to force penalties, after finding themselves 2-0 down inside half an hour at Blundell Park, but Amorim was disgusted that he'd even had to bring on the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Matthijs de Ligt to turn around a game against League Two opposition. Unfortunately for Amorim, he also looked out of his depth - particularly as he once again couldn't bring himself to watch the shootout. However, the most damaging image of the night - and arguably the defining image of his tenure - was the manager frantically moving pieces around a tactics board as he tried to get to grips with Grimsby during a opening hour for United!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 FIFA World Cup™ tournament is set to kick off in mid-June. As the North America-hosted event inches closer, the fervor for "the beautiful game" continues to grow thanks to the help from global institutions like The LEGO Group. In addition to prepping a 2,482-piece LEGO® version of the World Cup™ trophy, the creativity-oriented company has put together a 1,498 piece soccer ball (football) block set. Instead of recreating the upcoming tournament's adidas Trionda Official Match Ball, the new set opts for a more generic look. Multiple panels come together across the build, donning hits of pink, blue, and white. The LEGO® set's most defining characteristic, however, is the miniature stadium hidden inside. Fan-filled stands surround a pitch and winning team, looking ahead to World Cup™ Final. Enjoy a closer look at the $130 set ahead. The item should land on LEGO.com soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weston McKennie continues to let his football do the talking as he waits for a new deal from Juventus, teenager Cole Campbell seeks first-team football in Germany with a loan move, and Brenden Aaronson proves his worth to Leeds United in a huge derby match. It was quite the weekend for a selection of American players in Europe. Weston McKennie has missed more games than he has played for the United States men's national team under Mauricio Pochettino. Pochettino rates him and made that clear when he left the 27-year-old out of his November roster for friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay. But while the U.S. have other promising midfield players, including Aidan Morris, Sebastian Berhalter, Diego Luna and Malik Tillman, Pochettino can be confident that, in McKennie, he has an ace to play. McKennie was at it again on Saturday, scoring his first Serie A goal of the season in Juventus' 1-1 draw with Lecce, and excelling, as usual, in a different position. Instead of playing wing-back in a 3-5-2 — where he has played often under Juve manager Luciano Spalletti and his predecessor Igor Tudor — McKennie was deployed in an advanced midfield role. And it could have been all three for the home side, but McKennie's Canadian team-mate, Jonathan David, had a penalty saved. “I like playing as a trequartista (attacking midfielder) because you can both defend and attack.” Cole Campbell's potential has been discussed for some time at Borussia Dortmund, where he has been on the bench for the Bundesliga side five times this term. But the 19-year-old has played only 16 minutes, and has now gone on loan to fifth-placed Hoffenheim to chase more game time. Hoffenheim are believed to have agreed an option to make the deal permanent in the summer for around €10million-€12million (about £9.5m; $13m). “Cole is a young player with a lot of potential, but for various reasons he has not been able to show that recently,” Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl told the club's official website. “He has high expectations of himself and was unhappy with his current role. That is one of the reasons we agreed to this loan and believe that he will get more playing time at Hoffenheim in the second half of the season than he has recently had with us. The Athletic's German football correspondent Seb Stafford-Bloor believes it could be a good move. “Hoffenheim are having a dramatic turnaround, based on excellent, low-cost recruitment and a team that have become one of the most athletically dominant in the Bundesliga this season,” he said. “They're top, or otherwise second, in every meaningful running category. Brenden Aaronson continues to prove his own worth in the Premier League. Yesterday, he went one better with a wonderful goal to give his side the lead against Manchester United at Elland Road. Daniel Farke's side had to settle for a draw in the end, but it pulled them eight points away from the relegation place. “It is tough because you are fighting the whole game to get good chances,” Aaronson told the club website media after the match, “Man United have great players and they are tough to break down. In France, Folarin Balogun's assist for Monaco failed to make much difference as Tanner Tessmann's Lyon ran out 3-1 winners. Balogun was bundled over in the break that produced Mamadou Coulibaly's strike, but his contribution counts as an assist. Tessmann, meanwhile, came on as a 66th-minute substitute, while rumours in Italy suggest that Fiorentina are keen to bring the former Venezia man back to Serie A during the January transfer window. Christian Pulisic made a rare drop to the bench for Milan's 1-0 win over Cagliari on Friday. See if he is back in the starting XI as Milan take on Genoa in Serie A on Thursday (2:45pm, Paramount +). While tomorrow (Tuesday), McKennie and Juventus head to Sassuolo (2:45pm, Paramount +). The following day sees a resurgent Antonee Robinson, who was excellent in Fulham's 2-2 draw with Liverpool on Sunday, take on Chelsea in a west London derby (2:30pm, Wednesday, Peacock Premium). On Saturday, Tillman and Bayer Leverkusen, who are in third place in the Bundesliga, will look to make it three consecutive wins when they face Stuttgart (12:30pm, ESPN+). He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While several leagues, including the American-heavy Bundesliga and Eredivisie, have yet to resume from their winter breaks, others are already in full stride in the new year, with some U.S. men's national team players already having played two games since the calendar flipped. It was a memorable weekend in Europe for American players, with important goals, milestone-moments and defensive masterclasses taking center stage. West Bromwich Albion's George Campbell is putting himself in contention for a USMNT role at some point in 2026, even if it may not be for the 2026 World Cup. Unfortunately for the American center back, he is impressing in an area of depth. The match against Swansea saw him shift to an unusual right back position, but he continued to deliver, getting more involved in the attack with a pair of shots and three passes into the final third. Antonee Robinson continued to play heavy minutes for Fulham on the weekend, going the full 90 in a blockbuster 2–2 draw with Liverpool, which featured a goal for either side in second-half stoppage time. Robinson had two passes into the final third, created a chance and chipped in with six defensive contributions, often matched up against  Dominik Szoboszlai down the wing. The match was the sixth straight game that saw him play all 90 minutes, after only having a single previous substitute appearance in his return to Premier League action on Sept. 28. Brenden Aaronson is playing some of the best soccer of his career right now for Leeds United and brought his goal tally on the season to three with a strike in a 1–1 draw with Manchester United on Sunday. The goal marked his third goal contribution in the last six matches, after picking up an assist on a stellar team goal against Sunderland and his first helper of the productive run in a 3–3 draw with Liverpool on Dec. 6.On Sunday, he bolted up the pitch before sprinting between Ayden Heaven and Leny Yoro and finishing his shot past Senne Lemmens between the sticks. “I was kind of just running in behind to see if I could get lucky and sometimes you have to take a chance,” Aaronson said postgame. I had a good touch, and then it's just about putting the shot on target.”While he has nine goals in 56 USMNT caps and has not played consistently at the international level as of late, Aaronson is nearing a spot on the World Cup roster and a potential starting role if he keeps up his current form.

Making his 205th appearance for the club, the 27-year-old took on a more attacking role than usual, playing in his eighth position this season under manager Luciano Spalletti's versatile demands.While the Bianconeri will rue a missed penalty from Jonathan David, McKennie's performance was promising. In addition to his goal, he created three chances and had two shots. Riding a wave of form with five goal contributions across his last nine games in all competitions, McKennie will look to lead fourth-place Juventus to a win in their next match against 10th-place Sassuolo on Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Entering 2026, the U.S. men's national team is trending upward. After months of apathy and doubt, optimism is suddenly abundant. But that does not mean the USMNT is anything close to a finished product. The national team will gather only once between now and the naming of a World Cup roster in late May. Christian Pulisic, for example, leads the Italian Serie A in goals plus assists per 90 minutes (and across all of Europe's Big Five leagues, he's second to only Harry Kane). He will start for the U.S. on June 12 against Paraguay, if healthy. But other spots — in the 11, in head coach Mauricio Pochettino's rotation, and on the 26-man roster — are up for grabs. And what about the strikers behind Folarin Balogun? That tweak means the U.S. will likely start with two attacking midfielders on the field along with two central midfielders. And the group of players being considered for those four spots grew after the Gold Cup and fall friendlies. Tyler Adams feels like a natural starter as one of those two players, but while Adams was often seen as the No. 6 in the U.S.'s 4-3-3, with Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah playing in front of him, there is a real argument to be made that allowing Adams to roam and attack in midfield is the better use of his skill set. Thus, Pochettino could be looking at players such as Tanner Tessmann, Cristian Roldan, Aidan Morris, and Johnny Cardoso as fighting it out at the No. Adams, then, holds down the top spot on the depth chart in that box-to-box role, but Pochettino has also coaxed fantastic performances out of players such as Sebastian Berhalter, McKennie, Tessmann — and even Timmy Tillman — in that role. Whereas he was always seen as a natural midfield partner for Adams, tucked in behind Pulisic in a 4-2-3-1, or as a more advanced central midfielder in the 4-3-3, he now might be a better fit as one of the dual No. Or even as a substitute for Adams in the box-to-box role. The Bournemouth midfielder left a 4-4 draw against Manchester United on Dec. 15 with a torn MCL and will miss up to three months. That would put Adams back on the field in March, so he should have time to recover ahead of the World Cup, but his injury is a reminder that the math in midfield can swing dramatically based on the health of any one player. Our current depth chart for the two central midfield roles: The question about the two attacking midfield roles has to begin with Gio Reyna's health, form and availability. Reyna, 23, was once considered the best American prospect ever. His early seasons at Dortmund made him look like the natural follow-up to Pulisic, but the last four seasons have been marred by injury. Reyna totaled just 2,925 minutes across all competitions with his club team since 2021-22 — an average of 731.25 per season. There are real concerns about whether he can stay healthy for a full season and also get back to his previous levels of production. Reyna started four consecutive games for Borussia Monchengladbach in December, the first time he's completed that feat at club level since August 2021. Reyna has yet to score or assist for Gladbach, but he did pick up a goal and assist in his return with the U.S. in November. That adds intrigue to the battle in attacking midfield. Pulisic has eight goals and two assists in 12 league games for Milan this season, two goals behind Lautaro Martínez for the Serie A lead. That makes for a three-way battle at the other spot. In the mix: Malik Tillman, one of the U.S.'s standouts in 2025; McKennie, who has been sharp for Juventus this year, with two Champions League goals; Reyna; Diego Luna, a Pochettino favorite; and Tim Weah, who is an option as a right back/right wingback/winger, but can also play inside. How many midfielders will Pochettino bring to the World Cup? What even is a right back in this current system? It is notable, however, that Sergiño Dest started alongside Alex Freeman in the 5-1 win over Uruguay, and while Freeman sometimes looked like a third center back, he was actually considered the right back while Dest was a winger. Over the past few months, that means Max Arfsten has played as a left back/left wingback, while the right back — whether it was Dest, Tim Weah or Freeman — has been more of a winger than a defender. Will that look the same when and if Antonee Robinson is back healthy and in the U.S. lineup again? Or will he be asked to push higher up the field? Freeman's ability to play as a hybrid third center back/right back is especially intriguing because it adds another attacking element for the U.S. Pochettino might opt to start three center backs in the back line, as he has before with Chris Richards, Tim Ream and Miles Robinson or Mark McKenzie. He might opt instead to start a right back in that spot, as he has with Joe Scally and Freeman. Here's how we think things stand right now in the pecking order: Goalkeeper has been a position of uncertainty ever since Matt Turner's club minutes vanished in Europe. Freese got an opportunity in June, won the job, and has played every single minute of every match since. He still has more upside than Freese. Freese, though, has proven himself to Pochettino. 1 shirt, but U.S. coaches will surely be watching both Matts (and other goalkeepers) once the MLS season begins in February. Balogun has almost cemented himself as the USMNT's starting striker, but beyond him, the depth chart remains in flux. Haji Wright has performed well for both Coventry City and the national team. Ricardo Pepi was performing well a year ago before his knee injury, and he has recaptured that goalscoring form with goals in four straight Eredivisie games and in three of his last four Champions League appearances (all off the bench). Meanwhile, Patrick Agyemang (six goals in his debut season at Derby County in the EFL Championship) endeared himself to Pochettino at this summer's Gold Cup and brings a physical presence that this striker group would otherwise lack. And yes, although Josh Sargent has likely fallen off the roster bubble, he — or another forward — could always play his way back into the mix. The answers, as always with strikers, depend on form. Agyemang is probably on the outside looking in, but could fill a unique role — if he continues playing well enough for Derby County.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First Minister John Swinney made the announcement during his New Year election pitch to voters in Glasgow on Monday morning. Scotland's first minister has proposed a national bank holiday to mark the men's football team playing in its first World Cup since 1998. Scotland's opening game is against Haiti in Boston, with kick-off scheduled to take place at 2am UK time on Sunday 14 June. John Swinney has proposed that Monday 15 June be designated a national bank holiday in celebration. Mr Swinney said: "The whole nation will come to a standstill in June. Even more so in July once we've seen off Brazil and progressed to the knockout stages. "This is a moment 28 years in the waiting - and I want as many people as possible to share the occasion. Michael Gove reveals regret over Boris Johnson leadership bid Sir Keir Starmer will 'absolutely' still be PM next Christmas, insists Labour chair Watchdog criticises 'unprecedented' government offer to delay local elections – as five councils confirm requests for postponement "That will mean that supporters across the country can watch our men's team in their first World Cup match for almost 30 years and share in the chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, to create tourism and hospitality interest within the country, and to make deep and lasting cultural and sporting connections." Mr Swinney made the announcement during his New Year election pitch to voters in Glasgow on Monday morning. He added: "We've all been on the doorsteps a lot in recent months. Far too many people are struggling to make ends meet. He added: "In this election, there are those who will seek to obtain power by spreading fear and insecurity. There are those who will seek to divide us. "And there are those who don't care about Scotland and instead seek to use the election to further their own interests. The first minister claimed the best way to support the nation's NHS, bring down energy bills and make daily life more affordable for people "is for Scotland to become an independent country". Mr Swinney said: "To become independent, we need a referendum that will be recognised by the international community. Mr Swinney admitted it was an "ambitious task" as he called for a "fresh start with independence". During his speech, Mr Swinney also addressed the US raid on Venezuela saying he was "deeply concerned" about the situation.

"So, I am not running to be Scotland's first minister in denial of the truth. I am running to be Scotland's first minister in defiance of it." Mr Sarwar said the "SNP have had their chance" but "blew it". He took aim at both the SNP and Reform UK, claiming they "both play the politics of fear and blame". He said: "The truth is, Nigel Farage does not care about Scotland. Mr Sarwar added: "I want to build something better here in Scotland. But we must confront the reasons pushing people towards Reform. Later on Monday, Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay pledged to cut taxes if his party gets into power this year. Freezing rates means those who see an increase in wages can be pulled into higher tax brackets. "The public will have the choice between five more miserable years of SNP tax rises and wasteful spending or a new era of hope with a common sense focus on bringing down bills through economic growth." Mr Findlay said his party would "fight to bring down bills", help Scotland's economy to thrive, lower NHS waiting lists, and raise standards in schools.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid have been offered the chance to sign Crystal Palace sensation Adam Wharton, but Los Blancos will face fierce competition for his signature. Premier League giants Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea are all tracking the midfielder, who will reportedly cost at least €70 million and is demanding a huge salary to leave Selhurst Park. The race to sign one of England's most prodigious midfield talents has taken a continental twist, with reports in Spain saying that Wharton has been offered to Madrid. The 21-year-old, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise since swapping Blackburn Rovers for Crystal Palace in January 2024, has established himself as a linchpin in the Eagles' midfield, drawing admiring glances from the elite of European football. While Real Madrid have focused heavily on recruiting French and Brazilian talent in recent years - alongside the marquee signing of Jude Bellingham - the opportunity to pair Wharton with his international teammate is an intriguing proposition for the Spanish hierarchy. However, the report suggests that while Madrid are attentive to the market, they have not yet made a definitive move. The club is currently weighing up their options as they look to future-proof their engine room, but the financial package required to land the Palace ace could prove to be a stumbling block even for a club of their stature. AS states that the Eagles have slapped a minimum price tag of €70 million (£58m) on the midfielder, a figure that would represent a massive profit on the initial £18m they paid Blackburn just two years ago. This suggests the player is aware of his soaring stock and expects to be remunerated as a top-tier starter immediately, rather than stepping onto a developmental wage structure. For Real Madrid, who manage their wage bill meticulously to accommodate superstars like Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior, these demands could necessitate a significant departure from their usual policy for signing young players. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Liverpool have long admired Wharton's ability to break lines and dictate tempo, seeing him as a potential long-term successor to their current midfield anchors. Meanwhile, City are perpetually in the market for technically secure midfielders who can operate in Pep Guardiola's complex system, with Wharton's profile fitting the mould of a City player perfectly. United, under the INEOS regime, are prioritising young, domestic talent, making Wharton a prime target for their continued rebuild at Old Trafford.

Whether he moves to the bright lights of Madrid or stays in the Premier League to fight for titles, one thing is certain: Wharton is now considered elite property, and it will take a monumental financial package to secure his services in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans heading to the Fifa World Cup can expect more than just a game, as I discovered at an Inter Miami match last month Thinking about heading to the Fifa World Cup this year? The fact that the tournament takes place across three countries – United States, Canada and Mexico – should make it a bucket list experience for football fans. Here are a few other things to be aware of. There are no cheerleaders or rodeo cowboys during the half-time break. But you can expect lots of snazzy video packages on the big screen, deafening pyrotechnic displays just before kick off, and even those “fan cams” they have at baseball games. Though don't expect the old school “kiss cam”: these days it's been retired due to PC sensibilities. There's also a healthy dose of patriotism with the national anthem played before all games. Attendees are expected to stand up and remove their hats, though singing along is optional. There is one thing you can always say about watching sport in America: you're unlikely to go hungry. Visit most stadiums and you will find a veritable smorgasbord of different food concessions, either on the inner perimeter of the stadium or just outside. Tacos, fried chicken, pizza, poke bowls – you name it. You can booze too, including during the action. Walk around the stadium and you'll find dozens of enthusiastic vendors hawking beers from their ice-filled cool boxes. One word of warning though: it's common for them to only sell the massive 700ml cans of US beer. Oh and you'll also pay hefty prices for the privilege of all that hospitality. When I last watched Inter Miami play, I paid around £20 for a single beer (including tip) and £30 for a burrito before the game. Be careful about wandering out of the designated area carrying a drink, though, as there's every chance you could be fined under the ubiquitous “open container” laws. If anything, American soccer fans are often totally obsessed, and their knowledge of the Premier League can be impressive. It's definitely true that games are much more family-friendly than you might find in Europe. You'll see lots of families with young children. But every MLS team also has its share of hardcore partisan fans too. In those areas there's a carnival atmosphere: expect big drums and trumpets, coloured smoke bombs, and lots of coordinated chanting. The vibe is very rarely aggressive, but I have seen witless opposition fans being shoved out of the enclosure after wandering in out of curiosity. MLS games routinely kick off several minutes after their advertised starting time. Maybe that will change with the World Cup, which presumably has strict rules about these things due to the broadcast deals. Then again, given the ongoing bromance between Donald Trump and Gianni Infantino, who knows who will be calling the shots. This one is hardly exclusive to America, but it bears repeating anyway. When 25,000 football fans leave the stadium at once, the vast majority of them travelling by car, all those eight-lane freeways count for nothing: even the most sprawling US city can be brought to an instant standstill. By contrast, in soccer-mad Miami, I ended up enduring one of the slowest, and most expensive, Uber rides of my life, as it took more than an hour to crawl a few miles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scott Stinson is a journalist based in suburban Toronto. Scott Stinson is a journalist based in suburban Toronto. Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, finally spoke up about sky-high ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, described as “extortionate” and “scandalous” by football supporters' groups in Europe and elsewhere. Showing that he has learned something from his budding friendship with U.S. President Donald Trump, Infantino gave an explanation that was equal parts shameless and ridiculous. Without the billions of dollars FIFA will rake in this year, he claimed, there “would be no football in 150 countries.” It is true that FIFA sends much of its revenues back to its 211 member associations — the governing bodies of soccer for nations around the world — for investment in the sport. But there is simply no reason for FIFA to increase the scale at the levels planned for this summer's tournament, which is of course being supported by hundreds of millions of public dollars. When member nations received their ticket allotments and prices in early December, supporters were outraged to discover that group-stage games began at about US$270, more than eight times the amount charged at Euro 2024. Lower-bowl seats were listed for more than US$700. Those figures reflect a doubling of ticket prices since the last World Cup, in Qatar, in 2022. In its 2018 bid document for this year's event, FIFA said it expected ticket prices for the group stages in North America would range between US$21 and $230. The same report says Infantino's FIFA will end up with cash reserves of more than US$4 billion by the end of this cycle. These are staggering amounts for a non-profit organization, and it's obvious that FIFA could still generate considerable revenue while offering reasonable ticket prices. The expanded 2026 World Cup has more games, and in larger stadiums, than previous editions, so the potential for increased revenue was already baked in. And it all comes back to Infantino, the man who has blazed new trails of obsequiousness with his sucking up to Trump. All that revenue FIFA hoards can then be doled out back to the member nations who, in turn, will eventually vote to keep Infantino in his job. Would it surprise you to learn that amounts paid out to member associations have more than quadrupled over the past decade? I'm guessing it would not, just as it was no surprise to anyone when Infantino's predecessor Sepp Blatter was ousted in a corruption and bribery scandal that involved, literally, stacks of cash paid out in brown paper envelopes. Will some of FIFA's vast World Cup income make it back to the countries that need it for youth development and pitch maintenance, especially in poorer parts of the world? But you don't have to be a cynic to recognize that all those billions sloshing around in FIFA's coffers will make it that much easier for certain cronies and swells to justify their five-star hotels and private-jet jaunts. FIFA will say its prices are justified, given the high demand for World Cup tickets.
