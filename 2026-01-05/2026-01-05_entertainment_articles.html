                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus, Ella Langley earns her first Hot 100 top 10. Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” tops the Billboard Hot 100 for a ninth week, besting “Anti-Hero” as the sole longest-leading hit among her 13 career No. 28 as holiday hits recede from the chart's upper reaches, a week after they claimed a weekly-best top 24 positions. The lead single from Swift's album The Life of a Showgirl reigned in its first eight weeks on the ranking, dating to its mid-October debut. Elsewhere, Ella Langley lands her first Hot 100 top 10, as “Choosin' Texas” vaults 48-5. It leads the Hot Country Songs chart for a sixth week. Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Jan. 10, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Jan. 6. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. Plus, for all chart rules and explanations, click here. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “The Fate of Ophelia” drew 18.3 million official streams (up 9% week-over-week) and 60.7 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 12%) and sold 30,000 (up 779%) in the United States Dec. 26-Jan. 1. The single adds an eighth week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; falls to No. 2 high on Radio Songs; and lifts 5-4 on Digital Song Sales after six weeks at No. As “The Fate of Ophelia” one-ups “Anti-Hero” for Swift's longest Hot 100 rule, here's a recap of her signature 13 No. 1s, ranked by most weeks at the summit. “The Fate of Ophelia” contributes to Swift's eight Hot 100 No. She has spent 45 weeks atop the chart, eighth-best all-time. With the latest Hot 100 dated Jan. 10, 2026, Swift has now placed at No. 1 in 11 distinct years (per chart dates), encompassing her 13 leaders: 2012, 2014-15, 2017, 2020-24 and, thanks to “The Fate of Ophelia,” 2025-26. Ella Langley achieves her first Hot 100 top 10, as “Choosin' Texas” soars 48-5 (topping its prior No. The trad-country single rebounds 4-1 for a second week atop Digital Song Sales, as it leads the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a sixth week, dating to its first in early December. Meanwhile, Langley and Beyoncé are the lone stars with Hot 100 top 10s that name-check Texas in song titles. Prior to Langley (who's from Alabama), Houston's own Beyoncé logged two weeks at No. 1 in 2024 with “Texas Hold ‘Em.” (One other such song has hit the top 40: Waylon Jennings' classic “Luckenbach, Texas [Back to the Basics of Love]” reached No. HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, flies 28-2 on the Hot 100, after eight weeks at No. Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” which ruled the Hot 100 for 10 weeks starting in May, returns at No. Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” blasts back, from No. Kehlani's “Folded” rises to a new No. It tops the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs charts for a fourth week each. Sombr's “Back to Friends” bounds 52-7 for a new Hot 100 high, as it adds a 13th week at No. Swift's “Opalite” revisits the Hot 100's top 10 (54-8), after hitting No. 2, and two more songs reenter the chart in the tier: Leon Thomas' “Mutt,” at No. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

For attendees, the benefit of that is to re-enter awards season off of holiday break in a more casual setting (again, this awards show is inside a hangar, the Golden Globes are at the Beverly Hilton's International Ballroom). Related Stories ‘Dead Man's Wire' Review: Gus Van Sant's Burn-It-All-Down Crime Film Has Sympathy for the Kidnapper ‘They Will Kill You' Trailer: ‘Ready or Not' Meets ‘Rosemary's Baby' in Kirill Sokolov's Cult-Centric Horror Outing There's a level of relief on the organizer's side too, given that, just two years ago, the CCAs were jam-packed into a marathon week of awards shows that had been delayed by the strikes. Last year, the ceremony was delayed until February, much further into Oscars season because of the Los Angeles wildfires. Both awards are voted on by entertainment journalists, with the Golden Globes having more of an international focus than the widely American voting body for Critics Choice. Back in the more controversial years, before its 2023 revamp, the Golden Globes had a reputation for being more populist, wanting to give their awards to the most famous awards contenders, while Critics Choice developed a reputation as the awards show that was more predictive of who would win the Oscars. However, just as they switched show dates this year, Golden Globes and CCAs have also switched what the perception of what their winners are. The love for “I'm Still Here” in particular was very influential on Oscars voters, especially when, as a result of the fires, they were given more time to watch films before choosing nominees. But the wins for fellow International Feature “Emilia Peréz” were also a bellwether for what was to come. Meanwhile, the 2025 Critics Choice Awards winners were way more spread out, and arguably more populist, with the biggest surprise being that “Wicked” helmer Jon M. Chu won Best Director. When put in the position to develop the momentum for awards season winners, the 2026 Critics Choice Awards zigged in a lot of categories that even voters thought they would zag. “Marty Supreme” star Timothée Chalamet winning Best Actor and “Hamnet” star Jessie Buckley winning Best Actress makes sense from an Oscar predictions standpoint, but many other influential critics circles have been voting in other ways. Many were predicting either “The Secret Agent” star Wagner Moura or “Blue Moon” star Ethan Hawke to win the former, and “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You” star Rose Byrne to win the latter award. “Frankenstein” star Jacob Elordi and “Weapons” star Amy Madigan winning the supporting categories were the only film acting awards that felt climactic. That said, 12 films won awards across 23 categories, so few people inside the ceremony could come off as unsatisfied. But on the film side, while we were still in a time where it felt like certain categories were anyone's game, the CCAs chose not to air the two major director contenders Ryan Coogler and Paul Thomas Anderson winning Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay, respectively, for “Sinners” and “One Battle After Another.” While Anderson got to speak elsewhere, the primary representatives for “Sinners” onstage ended up being Best Young Actor/Actress winner Miles Caton and Best Casting/Ensemble winner Francine Maisler. The even more baffling omission was no Best Foreign Language Film, which had “The Secret Agent” win a slight upset. Even if Oscar frontrunner “Sentimental Value” was not actually nominated in the category, the Best Foreign Language Film included several other nominees that are still in the conversation for a Best Picture Oscar nomination, including the other three Neon contenders: “It Was Just an Accident,” “No Other Choice,” and “Sirāt.” In terms of highlights from the room, Elordi stood up for “Adolescence” star Owen Cooper when he won for the Netflix limited series, as the teen actor plays the younger version of Elordi's character in the upcoming Warner Bros. Pictures release “Wuthering Heights.” Despite the perception that his fellow nominees seemed unenthused at him winning, “Train Dreams” star Joel Edgerton immediately went to Chalamet's table afterwards to congratulate him. And super-producer Amy Pascal, who is believed to be an inspirational figure for the show, did stop by “The Studio” table to catch up with her former Sony colleague Seth Rogen, and the name “James Bond” was mentioned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Lucy Dacus walked onstage at the Jan. 1 inauguration of New York's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, music fans watching at home perked up with excitement. In fact, Dacus nailed that moment with a stirring rendition of “Bread and Roses,” an early-20th-century anthem of the labor and women's suffrage movements. A couple of days later, she called Rolling Stone to take us behind the scenes of a historic day in New York. They went back and forth on what to perform — “It would have felt weird to get up and sing one of my own songs,” she says — before Mamdani's team suggested the storied protest song they went with. Dacus was familiar with “Bread and Roses” because of a performance she did with Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers, her boygenius bandmates, back in 2021 at a San Francisco benefit for the nonprofit organization of the same name. Although Dacus is based in Los Angeles, she's one of many people around the country who found something inspiring in Mamdani's promise to work toward a better life for all New Yorkers. In September, ahead of the mayoral election, she brought the popular progressive candidate out as a surprise guest during her set at the All Things Go festival in Forest Hills, Queens, just a few months after he made a similar appearance at one of MJ Lenderman's shows in Brooklyn. “I feel such love and joy in the crowd this evening, and this is what our city should feel like,” Mamdani told the crowd at All Things Go. “It should be a city where trans New Yorkers are cherished, a city where our queer neighbors are celebrated, and a city where each and every New Yorker can be the fullest version of themselves. And it has to be a city that all of us can afford, whether you're an artist, or a dreamer, or someone who works the night shifts. “It doesn't feel like that big of a crowd, actually,” she says. But then, all of the cameras, you realize this is a global event.” She tried not to think too much about that, and focused on visualizing the images that went with poet James Oppenheim's lyrics as she sang. (Hamilton star Javier Muñoz and Punjabi Canadian musician Babbulicious were also part of the festivities.) Ultimately, Dacus thinks it's no coincidence that Mamdani's vision for New York connected with so many creative artists. “People that make art know the value of having the time and presence to focus on your interests.” That connects with the theme of “Bread and Roses,” too: “I think people need to not look at organizing or participating as something that is only going to be draining. It's something that gives back a lot of purpose and beauty.” Jimmy Kimmel Takes Aim at ‘Donald Jennifer Trump' in Critics Choice Speech Lucy Dacus Performs ‘Bread and Roses' at NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani's Inauguration The Clown-Car Congressional Race That Could Show Where Democrats Are Heading Kim Petras Offers to Send Zohran Mamdani Her New Album if He Does One Thing for NYC Mamdani himself has a background in the arts, having grown up as the son of noted filmmaker Mira Nair and, famously, put in some work as indie rapper Mr. Cardamom before entering politics at the suggestion of Das Racist's Himanshu Suri. “If he's bringing a creative approach to policy, I'm glad.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the heels of Mayor of Kingstown‘s bloody Season 4 finale, the Paramount+ crime drama starring Jeremy Renner has been renewed for a fifth. It will be the final installment of the series, created by Taylor Sheridan and Hugh Dillon, and will consist of eight episodes, down from 10 for Seasons 1-4, with recent cast addition Edie Falco returning alongside Renner. In the months following Skydance's acquisition of the streamer's parent Paramount Global in August, Paramount+ has ordered new seasons of Sherdian's Landman, Tulsa King and Lioness. (Paramount's new streaming chief Cindy Holland in August called the the Taylor Sheridan universe “a really great foundation” for Paramount+; in October, the prolific creator set a 2029 move to NBCUniversal.) Mayor of Kingstown has been a solid draw on Paramount+. It also has steadily improved its standing with critics, going from 33% on Rotten Tomatoes for Season 1 to 100% for the most recent fourth season featuring Emmy winner Falco as a new lead opposite Oscar nominee Renner. RELATED: 2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable Still, Mayor of Kingstown‘s ratings performance has not been on the level of other Sheridan dramas, especially recently. Both Landman and Tulsa King have charted on Nielsen's weekly Top 10 of streaming originals, with Landman also making waves as a Top 3 series on the overall Nielsen chart. Meanwhile, Mayor of Kingstown, which — like most Sheridan series — is expensive to make, has not broken into Nielsen's originals Top 10 with its fourth season having done so with previous installments. Still, it is a Paramount+ legacy show being part of the Taylor Sheridan universe, which led to the decision to pick up a final season, with a six-episode order reportedly discussed before the two sides settled on eight installments. In Season 4 of Mayor of Kingstown, Mike's (Renner) control over Kingstown is threatened as new players compete to fill the power vacuum left in the Russians' wake, compelling him to confront the resulting gang war and stop them from swallowing the town. Meanwhile, with those he loves in more danger than ever before, Mike must contend with a headstrong new Warden (Falco) to protect his own while grappling with demons from his past. Sheridan and Dillon will now have eight more episodes to examine the aftermath and tell the rest of the story, which Dillon previously shared they had been prepared to take to seven seasons. “[Sheridan] has an ending for it in Season 7. Whether it goes that far or that's where we get [who knows], but he has an ending, and everyone knows about it,” Dillon said in a Screen Rant interview last year. 15 years ago, ‘So, here's how it's starting, Mitch is going to get killed off in the first 10 pages, and season 7, episode 10, this is where Mike's going to be.” Mitch, played by Kyle Chandler, was Mike's (Renner) older brother who was famously shot dead in the series' opening episode. In addition to Renner and Falco, the latest season stars Lennie James, Laura Benanti, Dillon, Taylor Handley, Tobi Bamtefa, Derek Webster, Hamish Allan-Headley and Nishi Munshi. Sheridan executive produces with Dillon, Renner, Antoine Fuqua, David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Michael Friedman, Dave Erickson, Christoph Schrewe, Wendy Riss, Evan Perazzo and Keith Cox. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. It's a great show but the 10 shows every year or more is ridiculous.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Label a film a “zombie movie” and our genre-trained brains zip right to the question of whether it will feature fast-moving or slow-moving iterations of the undead. With that trope so embedded into the modern DNA of this particular horror subgenre, it's refreshing when a filmmaker puts it on the backburner and explores something more interior, which is what writer-director Zak Hilditch (1922) does with We Bury The Dead. More than 300,000 are now dead, and that may include Ava's husband Mitch (Matt Whelan), who was attending a corporate retreat on the island and hasn't touched base since all communications went dead. Adrift in a fugue state, Ava arrives on the island to volunteer, assigned to one of many body retrieval teams organized by the Australian military. Their mission is to go into all of the rural communities that are furthest away from the impact zone to remove bodies from residences so they can be buried. Only after she lands does she find out that there could be a third option: A by-product of this modern catastrophe is that some victims are waking up, then quickly culled by the military. As she engages in the bleak, voyeuristic work of intruding into these abandoned homes to recover the dead, Ava is forced to knock on her own doors, confronting and acknowledging the unresolved complexities of her marriage. It's through a series of flashbacks framed as Ava's remembrances that the audience gets a more truthful taste of who she and Mitch were together before. Initially, Ridley conveys much of Ava's numbness and interior conflict through her amply expressive face, with little dialogue and to great success. The opening third of We Bury The Dead provides her a rich succession of scenes that are allowed to breathe as she finds her moorings in this disturbing wasteland of lost futures and abrupt endings. Ridley's work is supported by rich sound design which provides space for Ava's solitude while also gently building an aural tapestry for this island—which includes the spine-chilling noises associated with the “waking,” including their signature teeth-grinding. Hilditch and his editor Merlin Eden set an unhurried pace for Ava's journey that might seem antithetical to modern horror, but it facilitates the way this place changes her—slowly, but thoroughly, so she'll be ready to face the answers awaiting her. The inclusion of two challenging male characters also allows us to see how Ava holds herself when placed under the eyes of others. With fellow body retriever Clay (Brenton Thwaites), she develops an unconventional bond as he is bracingly candid and seemingly apathetic about the death around them. As for those awoken by this disaster, Hilditch takes the existential path. That means there are plenty of unanswered questions, but questions which bolster Ava's quest to determine what she wants out of life now that she may be alone. She's remarkably unafraid of those who now straddle the living and the dead and more intrigued by what she can still recognize in an ambling corpse, or a newly woken father that bestows one last act of love to his dead family. As Ava moves towards her own discovery, she ends up finding more truth in what remains unresolved—by experiencing what grief dredges up in the living.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I wish all Greenlanders blessing in their fight for independence,” Björk wrote on Instagram Monday (Jan. 5), adding: “Colonialism has repeatedly given me horror chills up my back, and the chance that my fellow Greenlanders might go from one cruel colonizer to another is too brutal to even imagine. Greenland hasn't been a Danish colony since the 1950s, but it's still a semi-autonomous district of Denmark, with its own local government and two representatives in Danish parliament. Iceland became independent in 1944, with Björk writing that her fellow citizens are “extremely relieved that they managed to break from the Danish” and “didn't lose our language.” She went on to share two harrowing stories about Denmark's control over Greenland. One referred to a lawsuit over 140 Greenlandic women filed in 2024, accusing Denmark of fitting them with IUDs without their consent or knowledge in an effort to reduce Greenland's population. “They are my age and younger … childless,” Björk wrote. Jimmy Kimmel Takes Aim at ‘Donald Jennifer Trump' in Critics Choice Speech Chevy Chase Addresses Tumultuous ‘Community' Exit: ‘I'm Not Racist' She also mentioned the “parenting competency” tests that Denmark subjected Greenlandic people to for years, until they were finally banned last May. These tests, though frequently used in Denmark as part of child protection investigations, were criticized as inappropriate and unsuitable for the people of Greenland and other minorities. Björk's post mentioned a Greenlandic mother who saw her daughter taken from her just two hours after her birth in 2024; despite the tests being banned since then, mother and child still have not been reunited. In closing her note, Björk wrote, “Dear Greenlanders, declare independence ! Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kylie Jenner is kicking off awards season with a bang. Jenner chose a metallic lace and chainmail gown from Versace's Fall/Winter 1996 collection, making the vintage piece a year older than the 28-year-old makeup mogul. Jenner's gown featured a low bustier neckline, sheer black lace down the sides, with spaghetti straps that crossed at her back. The archival piece hails from Tab Vintage and, while currently unavailable on the popular store's site, there is a similar listing on 1st Dibs for the same dress, ringing in at a whopping nearly $10,000. The reality star kept things simple in terms of jewelry, wearing nothing but a large pear-shaped solitaire diamond ring on her left pinky finger. Chalamet, meanwhile, wore a double-breasted Givenchy pinstriped suit and floral tie. With a crisp white button-down, he, too, looked to the archives, opting for a vintage pink flowered tie from the design house. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

Ryan Murphy's latest Evan Peters vehicle, “The Beauty,” is coming to FX in late January, and like all of the “American Horror Story” and “Monster” creator's projects, it promises to be a glossy affair filled with jutting cheekbones, addictive beats, and a surplus of campy vibes. This time, the Golden Globe-winning “Dahmer” star is playing an FBI agent who, along with his partner, played by Rebecca Hall, is sent to Paris to look into a pattern of international supermodels dying in mysterious and gruesome ways.

The slideshow kicked off with a smiling shot of the star in a strapless red bikini top and matching bottoms with “no makeup” and “no filter.” After showing off two dresses and a pair of pajamas, Schumer concluded the social media upload with an airport selfie. “The last photo I'm on the trip,” she told her followers, adding that 2026 “is about self care and self love.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Schumer's A-list pals gushed over her appearance in the comments section. “You look 🔥,” model Paulina Porizkova wrote, while “Friends” alum Courteney Cox praised the “gorgeous” Emmy winner. Schumer shared her mindset for the new year on the heels of her headline-making split from husband Chris Fischer. We love each other very much and will continue to focus on raising our son,” she wrote in December 2025, referencing 6-year-old son Gene. Earlier that same month, Schumer cryptically clarified via Instagram that “whatever ends up happening” with Fischer, 45, had “nothing to do with” her recent weight loss. The Golden Globe winner, notably, dropped 50 pounds with the help of Mounjaro, years after a “horrible” experience with Wegovy. Schumer issued an apology to those “let down” by her slimdown last month, writing, “Sorry for whatever feeling it's giving you.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amy Schumer has welcomed 2026 with optimism and a fresh outlook. Schumer's Instagram posts have been refreshingly honest as she embraces her ‘self-love' era with honesty and self-acceptance, all while keeping her signature sense of humor. On Sunday, January 4, the “I Feel Pretty” star shared a series of makeup-free bikini photos on Instagram, offering a candid glimpse into her mindset as she moves forward personally and professionally. The post focused on Schumer's pre-vacation trip planning, but with a twist. The 44-year-old “Trainwreck” star posted photos taken before and during a recent getaway. “My mom took these photos of me while I was packing for a trip,” Schumer wrote. She also added in the caption that she was not wearing any makeup in the photos and chose to share them without filters. The post wasn't just a regular one highlighting her stunning physical transformation. Schumer shared a more important message of resilience with her fans and followers. Schumer addressed her split from husband Chris Fischer on December 12. “We love each other very much and will continue to focus on raising our son. In her post, she added, “We would appreciate people respecting our privacy at this time. As the couple faces a complicated chapter, Schumer's statement focused on their mutual commitment to raising their son, Gene, whom they welcomed in May 2019. On New Year's Eve, Schumer joked about being newly single in an Instagram Story, crossing her eyes and holding a plate of spaghetti. “Who's kissing this at midnight?” she captioned the image, as reported by Page Six. Schumer's noticeable weight loss over the past few years has drawn widespread attention and prompted questions about how she achieved it. While in March she confirmed using the weight loss medication Mounjaro, she has also been clear that serious health concerns drove her decision to lose weight. She has previously explained that the change followed a medical diagnosis. “I had a disease that makes your face extremely puffy that can kill you, but the internet caught it, and the disease has cleared,” Schumer wrote, referencing her diagnosis, as reported by People.

Mickey Rourke has launched a GoFundMe campaign as he faces a possible eviction from his Los Angeles home after allegedly falling nearly $60,000 behind on rent.

What remains is a person who deserves dignity, housing, and the chance to regain his footing.” According to People, Rourke was served a notice on Dec. 18 demanding payment of $59,100 in back rent or that he vacate the property within three days. Rourke began renting the home shortly before pursuing legal action against Celebrity Big Brother UK over an alleged pay dispute following his exit from the series in April 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some love stories are not meant just for the screen. For Adam Sandler, the most remarkable love story he has ever been in is his own. The actor truly believes some things in life are meant to be. While accepting a major career honor this weekend, the actor reflected on love, fate, and the life he might have lived had he taken a very different path. Sandler, 59, was honored with the Chairman's Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival gala on Saturday, January 3, in Palm Springs, California. The honor celebrated his dramatic performance in “Jay Kelly,” marking a complete shift from the comedic roles that made him a household name. “I sometimes think about it, [if] I didn't click that year and I did go work for my dad, what my life would be right now,” he said, as reported by People. He followed the heartfelt moment with humor, adding, “But we definitely [would] have a different house.

Kimmel's remarks about Altman appear to be a reference to Disney's recent $1 billion investment in OpenAI that included striking a licensing deal with the Altman-run AI powerhouse. Kimmel joked that his fellow nominees, save Hot Ones‘ Sean Evans, who was shown onscreen laughing at Kimmel's acceptance speech, “did not care enough to be here with you tonight.” Meanwhile, Trump has gone after Colbert, Kimmel and Meyers, saying they all should be taken off the air. Kimmel's win comes after ABC briefly suspended him this fall after he made comments about Charlie Kirk's killer that led Trump's FCC chair to threaten ABC affiliates' licenses. He later added, “Most of all I wanna thank our president, Donald Jennifer Trump. It's been a banner couple of weeks, and we can't wait to get back on the air tomorrow night to talk about them.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
