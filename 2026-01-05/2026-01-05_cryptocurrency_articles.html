                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitget Review 2026: Is It a Safe and Legit Crypto Exchange? Instead of betting on roadmaps alone, attention is shifting toward presales that show live activity, transparent token distribution, and visible growing demand. This change has pushed a few names into focus as buyers rush to secure early positions before conditions tighten. What stands out across today's big presale crypto projects is urgency. Live presale auctions, rising participation, and parallel demand for infrastructure are reshaping how early exposure is evaluated. Below are the four leading presale cryptos, including Zero Knowledge Proof, IPO Genie, Digitap, and Best Wallet, which are currently drawing strong interest, each for different reasons. Each window resets allocation and pricing based on demand, which has created visible urgency as missed days cannot be reclaimed. Participation has been accelerating as buyers rush to secure positions before the daily supply tightens. Contributors are entering consistently across presale auction windows, signaling sustained interest rather than short-term spikes. That flow has turned the presale auction into a live signal of demand. What amplifies this urgency is that buyers are not limiting themselves to token exposure. These devices allow users to operate inside the network by running verifiable compute and earning ZKP through real workload contribution. This dual demand shows that participants are positioning for both ownership and activity. Momentum strengthened further after confirmation that the first Proof Pod has already been delivered to Australia. IPO Genie has carved out a different lane within the big presale crypto space by focusing on tokenized access to private and pre-IPO investments. Its presale follows a tiered pricing model that reflects gradual expansion rather than sharp jumps. Utility is centered on governance participation, staking rewards, and direct deal access, which supports holding rather than fast exits. For buyers comparing the popular presale crypto options, IPO Genie stands out for combining private market access with mainstream visibility while still in its presale phase. Digitap approaches the big presale crypto conversation from a utility-first angle. The project is designed to integrate crypto wallets with traditional banking infrastructure via a phased deployment strategy and growing fiat on-ramp partnerships. Payment and banking infrastructure projects tend to follow steadier adoption curves, which has attracted attention from buyers seeking measured growth rather than sharp volatility. Digitap's roadmap emphasizes integration over experimentation, aligning with broader fintech trends rather than short-term narratives. As regulatory clarity improves across regions, crypto-fiat bridges continue to draw long-term interest. This framing places it among analyst-watched presales where progress is expected to compound over time. Best Wallet rounds out the list by focusing on access rather than assets alone. Wallet platforms have historically scaled in parallel with ecosystem growth, particularly during early access phases. Best Wallet ties its utility directly to onboarding users into presales and early token opportunities, making discovery part of the product rather than an external process. The focus on simplicity and visibility supports sustained engagement rather than short-term trading behavior. Within the popular presale crypto space, Best Wallet stands out as an infrastructure play that benefits from continued presale activity across the market rather than dependence on a single token narrative. Zero Knowledge Proof leads on that front with a live presale auction and rising Proof Pod purchases, creating urgency that builds day by day. Together, these projects show how crypto presales are shifting away from static fundraising toward active ecosystems where timing, structure, and participation shape early opportunity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and the wider crypto market has started to wake up recently, but underlying liquidity conditions appear strikingly weak, according to onchain analytics firm Glassnode — a dynamic that echoes concerns raised in a CoinDesk analysis in November on hollow crypto market liquidity following the October crash. Glassnode's latest data shows that both bitcoin spot trading volume and aggregate altcoin spot volume have sunk to their lowest readings since November 2023, even as prices have climbed — a divergence that typically points to thinning market participation and fragile demand underneath the recent strength. Traditionally, healthy price advances are supported by rising volumes, as fresh capital and buyers enter the market. This assessment reiterates issues raised in a CoinDesk research piece published in November, which documented how liquidity across centralized exchanges — including bitcoin and ether market depth — failed to recover fully after the October liquidation cascade. The research highlighted that post-crash, order-book depth remained structurally lower than before the sell-off, suggesting a new, thinner baseline of liquidity that leaves markets more vulnerable to exaggerated price reactions. It reshaped the market's underlying structure, leading to a sustained pullback in resting liquidity as market-making firms and liquidity providers pulled back, making markets shallower and less capable of absorbing large trades without meaningful price impact. The VC mogul has previously said crypto apps must hide blockchain complexity or risk missing mass-market adoption. Disclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry. CoinDesk is part of Bullish (NYSE:BLSH), an institutionally focused global digital asset platform that provides market infrastructure and information services. $BTC and aggregate altcoin spot volumes printed their lowest levels since Nov 2023. This weakening demand contrasts sharply with upside moves across the market, highlighting increasingly thin liquidity conditions behind recent price strength.📈https://t.co/WEAmnNjNOx pic.twitter.com/0Aw1DVFbSv</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee Predicts $250K Ethereum Price as BitMine Adds to $13 Billion Stash Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies added 32,977 ETH valued around $104 million during the final week of 2025, the firm announced on Monday. The latest purchase brings its total holdings to more than 4.14 million ETH, worth more than $13 billion as of this writing. “Our analysis shows that BitMine has continued to accumulate ETH at an accelerated pace versus other Ethereum [digital asset treasuries]. The firm's purchase announcement follows aggressive forecasting for the price of Ethereum and shares in BitMine (BMNR) as part of Lee's latest chairman's message. In his Friday remarks, Lee predicted a move to $250,000 for ETH—a roughly 7,760% increase from the recent trading price of $3,180. ETH is up nearly 9% over the last week. Lee also predicted a future price of $5,000 per share for BMNR based on its relationship to the price of Ethereum. But that mark is without any stock splits, a major focus for the firm as it seeks shareholder approval to increase the authorized share count from 500 million to 50 billion. Lee's message urged all shareholders to vote yes on the proposal by January 14. Other proposals ahead of its annual meeting include electing eight directors and implementing special compensation and incentive plans. Shares in the Ethereum treasury firm are up around 4% on Monday, recently changing hands at $32.49 and up nearly 14.8% in the last five trading days, according to data from Yahoo Finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Banking-focused crypto is quietly re-entering investor conversations as investors seek the best altcoins to buy now, particularly those focused on payments, settlement, and real financial infrastructure rather than speculative narratives. Not to replace banks overnight fantasy, but the boring part that actually matters: moving money, settling payments, and bridging cash with stablecoins. It is designed for low-liquidity market conditions where fast conversion and predictable settlement matter more than upside volatility. The list below focuses on altcoins to watch that are connected to payments, settlement rails, and financial infrastructure, plus one early-stage banking presale designed around capital protection. Digitap is a consumer-facing banking app that prioritizes settlement reliability and conversion speed in volatile markets. Digitap supports real-time crypto-to-fiat conversion, allowing users to convert supported assets into fiat quickly within the same platform. Digitap offers a no-KYC wallet setup, with additional verification requirements applying to expanded banking features. On the token side, $TAP is framed around a fixed supply (2B) and deflationary mechanics. The model is designed to use app-generated revenue for token buybacks, with a portion of those tokens permanently removed from circulation over time. The project reports Round 3 as nearly sold out, with approximately $3.5 million raised. In July 2025, OpenPayd announced a partnership with Ripple to provide stablecoin and payments infrastructure for businesses, combining OpenPayd's fiat rails with Ripple Payments and stablecoin liquidity access. That type of integration matters because it pushes crypto payment rails closer to the systems businesses already use: treasury flows, cross-border settlements, and multi-currency operations. Why XRP ranks behind Digitap in this list: XRP is mostly payment infrastructure and network positioning, not a consumer banking surface where token value capture is directly tied to app usage and defensively framed tokenomics. MoneyGram Ramps is designed to connect cash and digital dollars through a single integration, enabling cash-in and cash-out in many countries without requiring a bank account. Stellar sits inside that on/off ramp layer, where utility matters more than memes. Quant's banking relevance is tied to interoperability and regulated finance projects. In September 2025, Quant stated it was selected by UK Finance and a consortium of commercial banks to provide technology underpinning the UK's tokenised sterling deposits (GBTD) project, running until mid-2026. Tokenised deposits are essentially digital representations of commercial bank money, designed to keep the trust and regulatory protections of traditional deposits while adding programmability and speed. Why QNT ranks behind Digitap: Quant is institutional plumbing, not a beginner-friendly banking product layer. It can matter massively for finance infrastructure, but it does not offer the same direct consumer utility and presale asymmetry that Digitap is selling for 2026. XDC Network is built around trade finance, real-world asset tokenization, and enterprise use cases. The ecosystem around TradeFinex describes an ISO 20022-aligned trade finance protocol with industry partners, which is part of why XDC is often discussed in banking rails circles. This approach fits cleanly into a bear-market environment: fixed supply, buyback-and-burn mechanics, stable settlement, and practical tools for converting and spending value when charts are unstable. Presale mechanics also matter when evaluating the best crypto presales 2025, because Digitap's price steps are programmed and time-boxed rather than driven by market hype. The projects above are connected to settlement rails, cash access, tokenized deposits, and trade finance infrastructure, all areas that tend to grow quietly and matter later. For users searching for the best crypto to buy right now, Digitap stands out by combining a working banking layer with a value-capture token model.

Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO of SBI Holdings, has shared a thoughtful message linking ancient history with modern technology, as Japan prepares for the rare “Fire Horse” year of 2026, a cycle that appears only once every 60 years. In his remarks, Kitao opened up about how this period is often seen as powerful but demanding, especially for businesses enjoying success. Kitao explained that even when a company is doing well, danger can quietly build up. He warned that arrogance and overconfidence are the biggest threats during periods of growth. Looking beyond 2026, Kitao stressed the importance of thinking in decades, not quarters. Since then, the group has consistently invested in these areas and built a full crypto ecosystem. Kitao revealed that SBI invested in Ripple around ten years ago, acquiring roughly 10% of the company. Today, that early decision has paid off, with blockchain and crypto-related businesses becoming a major source of revenue for the SBI Group. This long-term partnership shows how early belief in blockchain technology is now shaping real-world financial systems. Needless to say, these fields currently play a major role in the SBI Group's revenue stream,” he wrote. Long-ignored issues, he said, will become impossible to ignore. He pointed to recent global and Japanese examples where long-standing allegations are now being exposed. His message was simple: businesses must stay honest, disciplined, and careful in their actions.

"At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking fee is $374 million annual (using 2.81% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day," stated Tom Lee. "We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN). According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $980 million (5-day average, as of January 2, 2026), ranking #44 in the US, behind IBM (rank #43) and ahead of Home Depot (rank #45) among 5,704 US-listed stocks (statista.com and Fundstrat research).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's price will surge 8,000% and trade at $250,000 per token, according to Bitmine chairman Tom Lee. That surge would catapult the value of the second-largest crypto to about $30 trillion — more than Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla combined. The confidence bump comes as digital asset treasury firms like Bitmine is under pressure due to the crypto market having shaved roughly $1 trillion of its value since October. This means that many of the public firms that have pivoted into becoming DATs are trading at lower values than their underlying assets, putting the viability of their business models into question. This marks a dramatic change from the beginning of 2025 when a wave of companies pivoted into becoming DATs, spurred on by the Trump administration support of the crypto industry. “The initial hype is over,” Brian Huang, co-founder of investment platform Glider, told DL News earlier in January. Lee's bold call comes as Ethereum trades just above $3,100. Publicly-traded companies perform stock splits to lower the price of a single share. That will make it seem more affordable for regular investors to buy in without changing the company's actual total value. Backed by top institutional investors — including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest — Bitmine now owns over 3.4% of Ethereum's circulating supply and is aiming for 5%. He did not offer a timeframe for any of his targets. To be sure, Lee is far from the only one with grand plans for Ethereum. Commenting on the development of new ZKEVM technology, Buterin said “they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralised network.” Lance Datskoluo is DL News' Europe-based markets correspondent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The retail digital yuan is no longer a central bank digital currency. China's version 2.0 upgrade, launched 1 January 2026, has transformed it into a commercial bank deposit solution where retail balances become liabilities of the holding institution – whether a bank or non-bank payment provider. Banks can now use these deposits for fractional reserve banking with balances covered by deposit insurance, while non-bank providers must hold full reserves. The fundamental pivot, positions the approach as a more financially stable alternative to stablecoins. The major state-owned banks and others have issued announcements stating they now pay interest on digital RMB deposits at the same rate as existing demand deposits. In the case of many banks that rate is just 0.05%. In an article published in the Financial News, the deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, Lu Lei, outlined that this approach addresses the risks of stablecoins. That's partly because stablecoins could result in outflows from banks, but also because it avoids the volatility in the valuation of stablecoin backing assets (such as Treasury bonds) and supports full integration with current systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Jan. 1, Vitalik Buterin announced a New Year's resolution for the blockchain he devised way back in 2013. It's time, he declared, for Ethereum to step up and deliver on its original mission: “To build the world computer that serves as a central infrastructure piece of a more free and open internet.” It has also spawned legions of mostly fly-by-night imitators. In recent years, the blockchain has come to resemble that can't-miss sports prospect who can't quite hack it in the big leagues. Instead of evolving into a popular global computer, Ethereum still feels like a sub-culture where cliques of insiders build esoteric applications for each other. The blockchain has a core community that believes passionately in decentralization, and is mistrustful of anything resembling formal authority. That includes Buterin, who stepped back from his creation several years ago, preferring to let Ethereum find its own path forward. All of this is admirable, especially in contrast to many recent arrivals on the crypto scene, whose first and only concern is to make a buck. Unfortunately, it has also led Ethereum developers to dither in the face of obvious problems, including congestion and high gas fees. To be fair, the blockchain has made some important fixes—but only after allowing piggy-back chains, known as layer 2s, to siphon off large amounts of revenue and make the crypto landscape painfully complicated. This is a testament to how Ethereum remains the gold standard for security and points to a future where it will be the backbone of global finance. The tokenized transactions also legitimize Ethereum's claim to be a universal computer, and could spur the mainstream adoption of other decentralized applications for social media, identity, and more. For this to happen, though, the Ethereum community will require Buterin's ongoing leadership. That's why his New Year's Day post is a welcome development. Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party interference. But it also delivered a pragmatic piece of advice to the community seeking to build this decentralized future: Get on with it, already. Trump airdrop coming: Yet another Trump token is on the way as Truth Social announced an upcoming drop to its shareholders via Crypto.com. The company added the token will not be transferable and “cannot be exchanged for cash” but could become redeemable for Trump Media discounts. The firm is actively providing audits and advice to clients. Bitcoin bounces back: The crypto market is off to a strong start in 2026 as Bitcoin climbed over $93,000 and altcoins posted gains even as the economic impact of events in Venezuela remain uncertain. Counting coins: In a key development in corporate accounting, the standard setting body FASB will formally explore whether firms can treat stablecoins as cash equivalents. He now faces a fate many would regard as worse than prison—resuming domestic life with his rapper wife Razzlekhan. These “Bitcoin obituaries” persisted well after the currency's viability became clear, but now appear to have finally faded altogether.
