                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Get ready for a massive day of tennis across the Tasman. From Aryna Sabalenka's first match of 2026 to Venus Williams' season kickoff and a winner-take-all United Cup showdown between Australia and Czechia, we have the storylines to watch. But for one match, Aryna Sabalenka would have a perfect 14-0 record at the Brisbane International. “Of course, remembering [the 2024] final,” Sabalenka said, “I really want to do just a little bit better.” Sabalenka can make it three in four years with a win in this stacked WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz 500 event. Her journey begins Tuesday with a match against Cristina Bucsa, who was a three-set winner over qualifier Anna Bondar in the first round. Sabalenka is familiar with her game because their only previous meeting came at last year's US Open, when she defeated Bucsa 6-1, 6-4 in the fourth round. As it turns out, Rybakina also kicks off her new year on Tuesday when she faces Zhang Shuai. 3 seed, could meet Sabalenka in the semifinals. “I know the courts well,” Rybakina told reporters. So I really like that also we have a roof, which helps on couple of courts. “Yeah, I really enjoy always my time here. I think the courts, since it's fast, it's good for my game, so I'm just looking forward to start.” Sabalenka, who has appeared in three straight Australian Open finals, winning two of them, also has the kind of power game that thrives Down Under. “I always enjoy coming here,” Sabalenka told reporters on Saturday. The first match at Patrick Rafter Arena features 2024 Australian Open champion Madison Keys opposite fellow American McCartney Kessler, who was a 6-1, 6-3 winner over Emiliana Arango. Three-time Brisbane champion Karolina Pliskova withdrew from the singles draw with a right lower leg injury and was replaced by Lucky Loser Yulia Putintseva, who scored a 6-2, 6-4 first-round victory over Hailey Baptiste. Meanwhile, in Sydney Australia and Czechia, both 1-0, will battle for the Group D title. When Australia's Maya Joint came up ill, Storm Hunter stepped in and scored two points, defeating Malene Helgo in singles and teaming with John-Patrick Smith in mixed doubles to defeat Norway 2-1. “Just glad that I could do my part tonight. Just wanted to go out there and, yeah, give it a good crack.” Team captain Lleyton Hewitt said he isn't sure if Joint will be available for her singles match against Barbora Krejcikova; if not, it would again be Hunter. It was Krejcikova, who came through for Czechia against Norway on Monday, tallying a singles win over Helgo and adding a mixed doubles victory with Adam Pavlasek. Group D: Australia (1-0) vs. Czechia (1-0)Start time: Not before 5 p.m. local / 4 a.m. In Group C, it's 0-1 Italy versus 0-1 France with the winner finishing second. Things are heating up in Auckland, with top-seeded Elina Svitolina plays her first match of the season, against Varvara Gracheva. 5 Magda Linette goes up against 45-year-old wild card Venus Williams. Get ready for a massive day of tennis across the Tasman. From Aryna Sabalenka's first match of 2026 to Venus Williams' season kickoff and a winner-take-all United Cup showdown between Australia and Czechia, we have the storylines to watch.</p>

But then Taylor Fritz saved a match point on the way to winning the men's singles match and Gauff combined with Christian Harrison in the mixed doubles to clinch victory for the Americans. "I‘m going to clarify because people are dragging this out of context," Gauff said in the pre-match morning social media post, referring to the "worst" comment she made earlier at the tournament when comparing support for players from smaller countries with the kind of support American players receive on foreign soil. 4-ranked Guaff, who lost the first five games and struggled in a 6-1, 6-7 (3), 6-0 loss to No. 42 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in Perth.It gave Spain a 1-0 lead over the defending champion U.S. team in the Group A contest.

"Those from smaller countries come with their colors and flags and it is clear on who they are supporting." "I was just speaking from my perspective. I understand the financial aspect of things and know tennis is not accessible for everyone, it was more of a comment for those who are already attending and how I wish they were as passionate as those from other countries. "I was asked and it was simply an observation I noticed about other countries vs. mine that is all," she said. "Nevertheless I am grateful for any support no matter how big or small it is.

She added that at previous team events she'd noticed that players from other countries get more animated support from their fans than the American tennis players do, but attributed that to the U.S. sports fans having so many successful teams and athletes to support.Guaff said there was always good support for the Americans from fans who travel to the Australian Open in Melbourne, "but I would like to see some more Americans if we make it to Sydney (United Cup finals) in Sydney than there were last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff redeemed herself on the mixed-doubles court to send the United States into the United Cup quarterfinals in Perth on Monday, teaming with Christian Harrison for a 7-6 (5), 6-0 win over Inigo Cervantes and Yvonne Cavalle-Reimers. 9 Taylor Fritz saved a match point against Jaume Munar to keep the defending champions' hopes alive after Gauff lost the opening singles match in three sets to World No. 42 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro -- the biggest win of Bouzas Maneiro's career by ranking and an early jolt to Gauff's 2026 season on the WTA Tour driven by Mercedes-Benz. "Obviously it wasn't a great match for me," Gauff said to reporters on the defeat to Bouzas Maneiro. "I think that's the beauty of this event that you have other people could pick you up on your off days." Fritz earned his first break points of the match at 5-6 in the third set but couldn't convert either match point. He then saved a match point in the deciding tiebreak before closing out a 7-6 (4), 3-6, 7-6 (6) victory in 3 hours, 14 minutes. "It was a crazy match," Fritz said on-court. I felt I was in a lot of his service games, but he played so well on so many of the big points. "I had to come up with a lot to keep myself in the match or convert any of the big points. He saved a break point in the following game. Fritz is hoping for a repeat of last year's United Cup run, when he also dropped his opening match before winning four in a row to guide the Americans to their second title in three years. He entered the tournament after intensive offseason rehab on his knee for what he described as "pretty serious tendonitis," but he didn't give an inch to Munar in a series of grinding baseline exchanges. 9 also fired 16 aces, adding to the 22 he hit against Baez. It was a monumental effort from Fritz, required only because Bouzas Maneiro -- who enjoyed a breakout 2025 highlighted by her first Grand Slam fourth round and a career-high ranking of No. Seemingly intent on carrying her 2025 breakthrough into the new season, the Spaniard upset Gauff in convincing fashion, 6-1, 6-7 (3), 6-0, at RAC Arena. It was Gauff's first United Cup loss in 10 career matches across singles and doubles; she entered the day 6-0 in singles and 9-0 overall. "I know Coco and she's a fighter," Bouzas Maneiro on-court said after the match. "And that was my mentality in the third set. To be [there] with power every point because even if you are [up] 3-0 or 4-0, you have to be ready." 4 in the opening game en route to a 5-0 lead. She went on to break the American in all four of her service games in the first set and nine times overall. It was a stark contrast to Gauff's dominant performance earlier in the week against Argentina's Solana Sierra. She was further undone by 14 double faults and 54 unforced errors. Bouzas Maneiro could only match Gauff's first-serve numbers but managed her unforced errors more effectively (41) and converted 9-of-12 break points. She rallied from 4-1 down to take the second set in a tiebreak and appeared poised for a remarkable comeback. But Bouzas Maneiro broke to open the decider and never looked back, racing to a 4-0 lead after saving two break points in a five-deuce game. After 2 hours and 12 minutes, Bouzas Maneiro closed out the match with a third-set bagel, earning a bit of redemption after being blanked in a deciding set by Sierra earlier in the week, and secured the biggest win of her career despite her country's elimination. "It's just good to experience those pressure moments early in the season, especially since this is my only event before Australia," Gauff said. "I would prefer to win in straights, but it doesn't hurt to go three -- more so when you're on the winning side of it."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thanasi Kokkinakis did not expect a first-round doubles match at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ could move him to tears. The 29-year-old Australian, who underwent a radical and unprecedented pectoral surgery in February, is back competing on home soil in Brisbane, where he teamed with Nick Kyrgios to earn a three-set win over Matthew Ebden and Rajeev Ram. “I've never really teared up from a doubles match, even when we won,” Kokkinakis said. “What I have gone through the past 12 months is crazy, speaking to a lot of surgeons, a lot of doctors. For much of the past year, Kokkinakis had been trapped in a frustrating medical grey area. Chronic issues around his shoulder and chest left him in pain but without a clear diagnosis or treatment plan, forcing him to bounce between specialists while his season slipped away. “No physio or doctor that I saw was really comfortable and confident of which was the right way to go,” he said. In the past I'd play one match and maybe have a big win, and my arm was shot for the next couple of rounds. That cycle — flashes of form followed by forced withdrawals — ultimately pushed Kokkinakis toward a drastic decision. After years of managing damaged tissue, he agreed to undergo a surgery few tennis players had ever attempted. “I essentially cut half my pec off,” explained the former No. I saw a bunch of surgeons that didn't want to operate on it. They thought it's risky, never been done in tennis. “It's really hard coming back from that process, because you don't really have anyone to speak to because no one's done it,” said Kokkinakis. “A lot of people do ACLs and Achilles ruptures, which are brutal, terrible injuries. Even reaching the start line in Brisbane required careful management. Kokkinakis acknowledged that simply being fit enough to contest doubles felt like a milestone after months of stop-start progress. Kokkinakis has fond memories of this period, having won his sole ATP Tour title in 2022 in Adelaide, the city where he was born. I don't know how my future is going to go, what it holds, but I've done everything I can to give myself at least a chance. The Aussie endured isolated winter training sessions in Melbourne with the vision of returning to court in front of home fans. “I was so sick of training, and just being in Melbourne in the winter with no one to really train with and trying to motivate myself for the Aussie summer,” Kokkinakis said. “That was always the carrot at the end, just trying to look forward to that moment, not knowing if I can actually play. It's a feeling that is very hard to replicate. “All my rehab and everything I was doing was focused on trying to get back in front of a crowd in Australia and being competitive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States has qualified for the United Cup quarter-finals in Perth after a complicated group-stage victory over Spain Monday. 9 Taylor Fritz had to save a match point against Jaume Munar to keep alive the defending champion's hopes of topping Group A after Coco Gauff suffered a shock three-set loss to World No. 42 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in the day's opening match. The United States' conquest of Group A was only complete when Gauff found redemption on the mixed doubles court, partnering Christian Harrison to a 7-6(5), 6-0 win over Inigo Cervantes and Yvonne Cavalle-Reimers after they rallied from an early break in the first set. Spain has now been eliminated from the tournament. 9 Fritz saved a match point in a do-or-die clash with Munar, who would have sent Argentina to the quarter-finals had he upset the American. Seeing his first break points of the match at 5-6 in the third, Fritz failed to convert both match point opportunities and later saved a match point on his serve in the tie-break before winning 7-6(4), 3-6, 7-6(6) in three hours and 14 minutes. I felt I was in a lot of his service games but he played so well on so many of the big points. "I had to come up with a lot to keep myself in the match or convert any of the big points. He saved a break point in the following game. Had they lost the mixed, the Americans would have finished runner-up in Group A and would only have claimed a quarter-final berth if they had a better record than the other two Group runners-up. Fritz came into the tournament after intensive rehab in the offseason on his knee for what he described as “pretty serious  tendonitis”. But he didn't give an inch to Munar in a series of lengthy baseline exchanges. "The knee is something I'm going to be dealing with for a while," he said. I started feeling it towards the end of the first set but it didn't get any worse. Jessica Bouzas Maneiro is coming off a breakout 2025 season in which she set a career-high ranking of No. 40, reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time at Wimbledon and made her first WTA 1000 quarterfinal in Montreal. 4 Coco Gauff in dominant fashion, 6-1, 6-7 (3), 6-0 at RAC Arena. The win marks Bouzas Maneiro's first career Top-5 victory. “I know Coco and she's a fighter,” Bouzas Maneiro said after the match. “And that was my mentality in the third set. To be [there] with power every point because even if you are [up] 3-0 or 4-0, you have to be ready.” She went on to break the American in all four of her service games in the first set and nine times overall. It was a stark contrast to Gauff's dominant performance earlier in the week against Argentina's Solana Sierra. She was further undone by 14 double faults and 54 unforced errors. Bouzas Maneiro could only match Gauff's first-serve numbers but managed her unforced errors more effectively (41) and converted 9 of 12 break points. Still, Gauff refused to go quietly despite her struggles. She rallied from 4-1 down to take the second set in a tiebreak and appeared poised for a remarkable comeback. But Bouzas Maneiro broke to open the decider and never looked back, racing to a 4-0 lead after saving two break points in a five-deuce game. After 2 hours and 12 minutes, Bouzas Maneiro closed out the match with a third-set bagel, earning a bit of redemption after being blanked in a deciding set by Sierra earlier in the week, and secured the biggest win of her career.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barbora Krejcikova steadied after a slow start to take the opening point before Jakub Mensik backed it up with a composed win over Casper Ruud, as Czechia completed a sweep and eliminated Norway from United Cup contention. Two first-time United Cup participants -- Barbora Krejcikova and Jakub Mensik -- led Czechia to a win over Noway at the United Cup in Sydney on Monday. Two-time Grand Slam singles champion Krejcikova triumphed over Norway's Malene Helgo to give Czechia an early 1-0 lead in Group D Sydney action, before Mensik clinched the victory by downing fellow Top 20 star Casper Ruud 7-5, 7-6(6). Krejcikova, alongside Adam Pavlasek, won mixed doubles to secure the sweep. 2 Krejcikova comes into the 2026 WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz season ranked No. 65 in the rankings after another bout with injury to close 2025. But as quickly as she was healthy, Krejcikova was dealing with physical problems again after she suffered a knee injury against McCartney Kessler in the third round of the China Open. She retired from that match, later revealing her injury was worse that previously thought, and also retired from her first match at the WTA 125 in Limoges in December. "I'm also really happy that I'm part of this event, this nice competition where we have a team. The 26-year-old Oslo native has punched above her weight in United Cup in the past -- she pushed both Caroline Garcia and Donna Vekic to three sets at the event in 2024 -- and she took advantage of a slow start by Krejcikova to open up an early 3-1 lead. But after the Czech, who played the 1 hour, 38-minute match with supportive sleeve on her left knee, erased a break point opportunity in a five-deuce fifth game, she righted the ship by winning eight of the next nine games and never trailed again. It took some time, but it's improving every day and I'm very happy with that," Krejcikova added at her on-court interview. Making his United Cup debut and playing his first match of the season, Mensik's win also eliminated Norway, which fell to 0-2 this week.Mensik held his nerve late in both sets, earning a crucial break at 5-5 in the opener before serving for a one-set advantage. The winner of last year's ATP Masters 1000 event in Miami, Mensik crushed a forehand pass cross-court when facing a set point at 6-5 in the second-set tie-break.“First match of the season, it's never easy,” Mensik said during his on-court interview. At 20 years and four months, Mensik is the second-youngest man to record a singles win in United Cup history, behind an 18-year-old Stefanos Sakellaridis in 2023. 18 in the PIF ATP Rankings improved to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Ruud, whom Mensik beat at last year's Australian Open in the second round.Mensik crushed 16 aces and won 78% of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, compared to Ruud's 56%.Australia and Czechia are both 1-0 in Group D action, and will face each other Jan. 6 at Ken Rosewall Arena in Sydney.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jakub Mensik clinched Czechia's victory against Norway at the United Cup on Monday, when he downed fellow Top 20 star Casper Ruud 7-5, 7-6(6) in Sydney. Making his United Cup debut and playing his first match of the season, Mensik's win followed Barbora Krejcikova's victory against Malene Helgo to give Czechia a 2-0 win in the Group D tie, eliminating Norway, which fell to 0-2 this week. Mensik held his nerve late in both sets, earning a crucial break at 5-5 in the opener before serving for a one-set advantage. The winner of last year's ATP Masters 1000 event in Miami, Mensik crushed a forehand pass cross-court when facing a set point at 5/6 in the second-set tie-break. “First match of the season, it's never easy,” Mensik said during his on-court interview. At 20 years and four months, Mensik is the second-youngest man to record a singles win in United Cup history, behind an 18-year-old Stefanos Sakellaridis in 2023. Mensik crushed 16 aces and won 78 per cent of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, compared to Ruud's 56 per cent. Earlier, two-time major singles champion Krejcikova scored a winning United Cup debut in a 6-4, 6-3 triumph over Norway's Helgo. 2 comes into the 2026 WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz season ranked No. 65 in the PIF WTA Rankings after another bout with injury to close 2025. She reached the quarter-finals of the US Open in September, a watershed moment in her season that only began in May after dealing with a recurring back injury. Krejcikova then unfortunately dealt with physical problems again, suffering a knee injury against McCartney Kessler in the third round of the China Open. She retired from that match, later revealing her injury was worse than previously thought. 532 Helgo proved to be an ideal return. “I didn't play for a long period, and the injury that I had was really tough and very unfortunate," Krejcikova said. She pushed both Caroline Garcia and Donna Vekic to three sets in 2024 and took advantage of a slow start by Krejcikova to open up an early 3-1 lead. But then, Krejcikova, who played the one-hour, 38-minute match with supportive wrapping on her left knee, erased a break point opportunity in a five-deuce fifth game and righted the ship by winning eight of the next nine games. It took some time, but it's improving every day and I'm very happy with that," Krejcikova said. Australia and Czechia are both 1-0 in Group D action.
