                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether it's forcing Brigitte Macron to prove that she is a woman or wildly speculating about Charlie Kirk's murder, the far-right podcaster and conspiracy theorist has millions of listeners hooked on her unique brand of dangerous misinformation. They're also extremely compelling, for her millions of social media followers and podcast listeners at least, and extremely lucrative, helping the 36-year-old American build a staggering media empire in under a decade. All these disparate subjects have received Owens's signature treatment. She is part one-woman outrage machine, part millennial version of a medieval mystic; she has certainly worked out how to cleverly monetise the human impulse to “uncover” so-called “truths” and to feel like we are somehow in possession of a secret knowledge that explains how the world works. Last summer, French president Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte filed a defamation lawsuit against Owens, who has regularly and fervently spouted bizarre claims that the first lady was born male; the couple have accused her of mounting “a campaign of global humiliation” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”. Their civil suit followed separate criminal prosecutions in France against 10 people accused of making malicious comments about the first lady's gender and sexuality. On Monday (5 January), a Paris court found the eight men and two women guilty of cyberbullying, describing their claims as “particularly degrading, insulting and malicious”; their penalties ranged from cyberbullying awareness training to eight-month suspended prison sentences. And towards the end of last year, Owens dragged herself and her followers even further down the rabbit hole by stirring up conspiracies around the death of her one-time boss, Charlie Kirk, the right-wing activist and founder of conservative student group Turning Point, who was shot dead in September. The suggestion that his death was somehow an “inside job” involving Turning Point employees. Her claims prompted Kirk's longtime producer, Blake Neff, to finally call Owens out for spending months “attacking Charlie's closest friends”, who, he said, “have had to endure harassment from people who have gotten whipped up by what Candace is saying”. Owens is now playing an even higher stakes game, running the risk of finally alienating one-time allies on her end of the political spectrum, while also surely aware that her most devoted core of fans will expect wilder theories to come. Her early days didn't exactly lay obvious foundations for a hard-right pivot. Her family sued the Stamford Board of Education, eventually gaining a $37,500 settlement. Around this time, she developed “an abiding interest in current affairs”, as a Tatler profile would later put it, with her political sympathies initially skewing towards the Democrats. After dropping out of a journalism degree at the University of Rhode Island, Owens interned in the fashion cupboard at American Vogue (“There was not some kind of formal hierarchy, but it was very clear that she was running the show,” a fellow intern recalled in Vanity Fair). She then worked her way up the ranks in administration in a New York private equity firm before co-founding a marketing agency. Inevitably, it stoked criticism: wouldn't this just amount to doxxing, the typically malicious act of posting another person's private details on the internet? Owens ended up on the receiving end of online hate herself, and blamed left-wing activists. Not long after, she started posting on YouTube: her first video was a sketch in which she “came out” to her parents as a conservative. Owens positioned herself as a supporter of Donald Trump, who was then in the early stages of his first presidency, and decried ideas around identity politics, structural racism and the Black Lives Matter movement. She particularly vehemently opposed any suggestion that African-Americans should perceive themselves as victims – and still does. “Within 30 seconds of seeing her on stage, I said to myself, ‘Oh my goodness, I have not seen a talent like this in my six years of politics,'” Kirk later told The Washington Post. He immediately hired her to work in communications for Turning Point, and they spent the next few years touring colleges, spreading the conservative gospel. Kanye West publicly supported her, writing “I love the way Candace Owens thinks” on Twitter. At an event in London in December 2018, Owens ended up appearing to suggest that if Hitler had simply stuck to Germany, his policies would have been “fine”. “Whenever we say ‘nationalism', the first thing people think about, at least in America, is Hitler,” she said. “He was a national socialist, but if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine.” The “problem”, she added, was that he “had dreams outside of Germany. 2021 saw the launch of Candace, an online show for the conservative platform Daily Wire, co-founded by another right-wing controversy magnet, Ben Shapiro; it featured sit-down interviews with the likes of Trump, but she also used her platform to weigh in on pop culture and lifestyle topics (such as her vehement belief that women should not wear leggings outside of the gym, because doing so is indicative of “the decline of our culture”). But in 2024, Owens parted ways with Daily Wire, reportedly over her antisemitic comments (although she would later claim this was a “smear campaign” and a “ridiculous storyline”). Owens's great talent, though, is for turning controversy into content, and it wasn't long before she returned with her own venture, a self-titled podcast. Since launching in June of 2024, its ascent has been dizzying: in October 2025, it ranked as the No 1 show across platforms in terms of downloads and views per episode, with an average of around 3.5 million downloads per show, according to analytics from Podscribe. Just a quick glance at the US charts demonstrates the dominance of controversial conservative-skewing figures such as Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson and Theo Von. According to a Media Matters report from 2024, right-leaning online shows had nearly five times as many followers and subscribers as their left-wing equivalents. It's a model that Owens has honed to perfection. Her husband, George Farmer, the British son of a multi-millionaire Tory peer and hedge fund manager, oversees the business side of the operation, and told Bloomberg that her advertisers “have reported seeing returns of two-to-one on dollars spent with us, and up to five-to-one reported in some cases”. Her huge listener base means that the podcast can inevitably charge higher advertising rates; recent analysis from Fortune magazine suggested that her company generates up to $10m in revenues per year. And according to Farmer, only one advertiser has pulled out over the past year; the show now has almost 60 sponsors, Bloomberg reports. In 2023, her anti-trans YouTube videos were demonetised, and last year, she was temporarily suspended after violating hate speech policies, but she has since returned with a vengeance. And even if these bigger sites did ban her, she would probably follow in the footsteps of other “cancelled” right-wing figures and simply move to a new platform. What's particularly shrewd, though, is the way Owens has a knack for throwing herself into topics that are guaranteed to creep onto your social feed. Take actor Blake Lively's legal battle against her It Ends with Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni. Owens covered the story in obsessive detail, responding to suggestions and “clues” from followers with all the zeal of a TikTok sleuth. Elsewhere, she borrows the aesthetic of your classic lifestyle influencer. And yet with the Macron lawsuit looming, Owens may have met her match. For all the successes of her podcast, she is now facing a major legal battle. She has been asking fans to donate to her legal fund, and estimates she will need around $5m, but that feels like a conservative estimate. The case of fellow right-wing podcaster and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones feels particularly pertinent here: Jones was ordered to pay around $1.4bn in total damages after the families of Sandy Hook elementary school shooting victims won two separate defamation suits against him. In 2021, Owens was hit with a separate defamation suit by the former Republican congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik. She claimed that Owens had smeared her with false allegations of drug use, fraud and working as a “madame” in a strip club, but the case was tossed out by a judge; Klacik ended up being required to pay her $115,000 to cover legal fees. Using Kirk's death as another trending topic to boost her profile looks like an ill-advised move, too. Owens is far from the only podcaster to indulge in bizarre conspiracy theories, but her personal link to Kirk, coupled with her willingness to exploit that for clicks and listens, makes the whole spectacle feel extremely murky. In aiming for Turning Point, too, she risks splitting her support base. Here, she is not going after the “establishment” or the “elite”, those bogey people of conspiratorial thinking, but her own political allies. But Candace is unlikely to let this knock her off course. For her, a backlash is likely to be seen as just another opportunity. In today's topsy-turvy cultural climate, being the ragebait queen has served her well. It remains to be seen, however, if they make her undefeatable. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

Jeff Bezos seemed to get a special delivery at his $165 million home in Beverly Hills: a UFO!

The odd, futuristic structure sits on the grounds near the cactus garden. Bezos, 61, has yet to reveal the contents of the shiny installation. Some speculate it's a sauna, but it also bears a striking resemblance to a made-to-order, stainless-steel statement piece designed by Timothy Oulton Studio.

The pod was designed as a scale replica of NASA's Apollo 11 space capsule, according to the studio's website, and can be utilized as “a private VIP seating lounge, a workspace meeting capsule or a dining pod.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COLUMBIA — An unmanned underwater research vehicle, an event center to train hospitality students and an institute centered around federal defense research are among items on South Carolina colleges' budget wish list for the coming year. Legislators won't approve colleges' full requests, but the plans are a preview of higher education priorities across the state. Coastal Carolina students to build satellite in state's 1st college space program Now it's time to launch the shoebox-sized satellite into orbit, where it will circle the planet 15 times a day from roughly 1,200 miles up. The Conway-based college is asking legislators to set aside $450,000. “Coastal systems are vital to the state's economy and culture, supporting fisheries, ecotourism, and economic development,” the college's request reads. “The data collected will enhance our ability to assess ecosystem resilience and provide early warnings for environmental stressors.” They'll also monitor impacts to habitats and movements of key marine species, such as shrimp, crabs, oysters, red knots, red drum, sharks, turtles, dolphins, and whales, according to the college's request. The technical college system is collectively seeking $743 million for projects across its 16 college campuses, accounting for a third of the total newly requested. Most of it would pay for construction projects. High-dollar projects include $80 million to move the medical campus of Florence-Darlington Technical College out of downtown Florence, giving the college room to grow its training programs in high-demand health care fields. And Denmark Technical College, the state's only historically Black tech school, is renewing a $35 million request for new lab and classroom space. MUSC Health seeks $350M for new, top-tier cancer center And about half of USC's $307 million ask would go to further the flagship university's own health care ambitions. That includes one-time money to move the pharmacy school to the university's new medical campus that's under construction in downtown Columbia's redeveloped BullStreet District. USC to establish center for civics education, following national trend Beyond money for the medical campus, USC is asking for annual operating dollars to run a newly-formed center focused on teaching civil debate and civics lessons. It wants more money to continue a four-way, multi-year research partnership between USC, Clemson University, South Carolina State University and the Savannah River National Laboratory. Across the USC system, other major requests include a new nursing education center in Beaufort, complete with simulation labs, and the renovation of an event center in Spartanburg to train hospitality students in the Upstate. As for Clemson, its request tallies $193 million in additional aid. It wasn't until 1955 that the school began admitting non-military students and women. Clemson also is renewing requests for projects the Legislature either didn't fund or partially funded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump shared a post suggesting that Tim Walz ordered the killing in revenge for Melissa Hortman voting to strip healthcare from illegal immigrants At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. The children of murdered Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman have called for Donald Trump to take down a Truth Social post, which linked her killing to the state governor, Tim Walz. Over the weekend, Trump re-shared a post suggesting that fellow Democrats targeted the Hortmans for “exposing a multi-billion dollar money laundering fraud going to illegal immigrants.” “I am asking President Trump to remove the video that he shared and apologize to me and my family for posting this misinformation and for using my mother's own words to dishonor her memory,” he wrote in the statement, which was seen by NBC News. Trump's post included a video that claimed that the alleged fraud case involved “child care” and “health care rackets,” run by Somali immigrants, whom the social media user claims came to the United States illegally. It goes on to claim that the Hortman couple's alleged shooter, Vance Boelter, had been ordered to carry out the murder by Governor Tim Walz. The motive given was that Hortman had voted against her party to strip taxpayer-funded health care coverage for illegal immigrants shortly before her death. The evidence given by the original social media user was a letter, written by Boelter and mailed to FBI Director Kash Patel. In the document, Boelter claims that Walz instructed him to kill Amy Klobuchar, among some other redacted names. Boelter, a former employee of Walz's, alleged that the governor would “hurt my family” if he did not “play ball.” He also details an alleged meeting, organized by the governor, in which he met with a woman referred to as “Mel.” According to Boelter, he carried out a double shooting shortly after. Lawmakers maintain that Boelter first attempted to murder John Hoffman, a member of the Minnesota Senate, his wife, Yvette, and their daughter, Hope. Currently, he faces six federal charges in relation to the case, including stalking, murder, and attempted shooting. If found guilty, the Attorney's Office says that he faces life in prison or even death. “In covering for an actual serial killer, he is going to get more innocent people killed. Sophie Hortman, Colin's sister, wrote that the post promotes a “false narrative.” “The video being shared by the president is another hurdle our family must overcome in grieving the loss of my parents, Mark and Melissa, and their beloved [dog] Gilbert,” she added, in a statement also seen by NBC News. In recent weeks, Trump has seized upon conspiracy theories about immigration to Minnesota by Somali migrants. His administration recently shared an AI-generated trailer for an animated film entitled Minnesota Millionaires, which depicts Somali men travelling to the state in order to defraud the state's daycare program. Speaking at a public statement today, Walz said that he could not give “give a political campaign my all” after an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

Astrobiology, while traditionally focused on understanding the origin of life on Earth and the potential for life elsewhere, offers powerful tools and insights for addressing urgent challenges on our planet.

We call for a deliberate integration of astrobiological research with applied science. Knowledge gained from biological systems and study sites on Earth that guide investigation of planetary bodies in our solar system can inform strategies for carbon capture, low-carbon energy production, waste remediation, and biotechnology.

Therefore, we argue that astrobiology must evolve to become a bidirectional science that not only explores the cosmos but also supports sustainable life on Earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just as its name suggests, ‘Fireplace 10 hours full HD' is just 10 hours of a cozy fireplace burning away to the sound of crackling wood. It's definitely not the most spectacular clip ever uploaded to YouTube, but that didn't stop it from generating over 157 million views in under 10 years. Considering the video has been monetized since its upload in 2016, it is estimated that the creator has made over $1 million from this video alone. YouTube is actually full of long clips, often recorded on a loop and meant to be played in the background without causing a distraction. It's a recipe that works, and most creators post multiple such videos to maximize earnings. But that is not the case with ‘Fireplace 10 hours full HD'. The channel, also named ‘Fireplace 10 Hours', has just one upload in the last decade, so the fact that it was able to generate over $1 million in ad revenue is crazy. Some have claimed that because the channel does not abide by YouTube's rule to have at least three uploads to even be considered for its partner program, the platform gets all the ad revenue from ‘Fireplace 10 hours full HD'. However, that rule only came into effect in 2023, so this 2016 channel should not be subject to it. Regardless of who is entitled to the ad revenue, the fact that a 10-hour clip of a cozy fireplace has racked up over 157 million views on YouTube is proof that you don't have to come up with something new and exciting, hire editors, or post every day.</p>

Oh Cooper, what have you gotten yourself into? Image credit: Sean McGrath from Saint John, NB, Canada - Cooper and Styrofoam via Wikimedia Commons (CC BY 2.0) Just check out the leading image for “static cling” on Wikipedia (oh Cooper, what a pickle you've found yourself in). Turns out, the static potential of cats in winter comes down to two key things: your petting approach, and humidity. A 2024 study set out to answer a key question in our understanding of static electricity – what puts the “tribo” in triboelectricity? It's a well-documented phenomenon, as anyone who's ever had a balloon rubbed on their hair only for it to stick can attest to (such as dear Nosey the cat). It's something we've only just got to grips with. “For the first time, we are able to explain a mystery that nobody could before: why rubbing matters,” said Laurence Marks of Northwestern University in a statement, who led the 2024 study. “We now can, and the answer is surprisingly simple. Petting a cat involves sliding your hand across their fur. As your hand moves, both your hand and the cat's fur experience different amounts of stress because of the way surfaces resist motion. This difference causes electric charges to build up unevenly along your hand and the cat's fur. As those charges build and flow, they can suddenly discharge in the form of that static zap you feel when touching your cat. So it's not touching the cat that creates static electricity, but the sliding motion involved in petting that produces uneven charges. Moist air normally helps static charges slowly leak away, but when the air is dry, charges linger and build up more easily.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LEGO's newest Creator release proves that big ideas come in compact packages. The Space Exploration Telescope (set 31378) landed on shelves January 1, 2026, with 278 pieces that transform into three completely different models: a fully adjustable telescope with spinning planets, a working microscope, or a posable UFO. At $34.99, this set sits comfortably in impulse-buy territory while delivering the kind of replay value that keeps kids engaged long after the initial build. What makes this set particularly clever is how it uses a single light brick across all three models. Three decorated lenses featuring a planet, star, and Moon add educational depth that goes beyond typical building sets. For parents seeking STEM toys that actually encourage experimentation rather than collecting dust on a shelf, this Creator set deserves serious consideration. That primary telescope build is surprisingly robust for being one of three options. Standing over 10.5 inches (27 cm) tall, it has a decent presence, and the tripod design is stable enough for actual play. The accompanying solar system, with its seven spinning planets, is a fantastic kinetic detail that adds life to the model. It takes what would be a static display piece and gives it an interactive purpose that cleverly mimics what a real telescope does: show you images of space. The core housing for the light brick and lens assembly gets flipped vertically, and what was once a projection system becomes an illumination source. The same decorated lenses that projected planets now serve as makeshift slides, which is a brilliant way to teach kids about functional design and repurposing components. It's a solid B-model that feels complete and intentional, demonstrating how form follows function with just a few clever reconfigurations of the same 278 bricks. It shifts the entire theme from educational STEM hardware to pure science fiction. The designers did a great job creating a classic saucer shape with posable antennae and legs that flip out for landing. This C-model provides an essential creative outlet, proving the set's versatility extends beyond scientific instruments. Digital instructions are accessible through the free LEGO Builder app, which lets you zoom, rotate, and track build progress on your phone or tablet. LEGO's website currently shows a 60-day shipping window, so if you're ordering online, factor that into your timeline. The most interesting AI hardware this year might not be a new screen or headset. This strikingly designed record player beautifully blurs the boundaries between digital and physical media! Packed full of carefully thought out design features, this is undeniably… We're an online magazine dedicated to covering the best in international product design. We have a passion for the new, innovative, unique and undiscovered.</p>
