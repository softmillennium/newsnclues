                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China's leading contract chipmakers are pursuing large domestic acquisitions to expand capacity as Beijing doubles down on semiconductor self-sufficiency. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. China's two largest pure-play foundries, SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor, are in the middle of significant consolidation efforts that demonstrate how industrial policy is reshaping the country's chip sector, with SMIC about to take full control of a subsidiary for US$5.8 billion and Hua Hong set to acquire 97.5% of Shanghai Huali Microelectronics from its state-owned parent for US$1.2 billion. The two multi-billion-yuan deals come as China's access to advanced manufacturing equipment remains constrained by U.S.-led export controls, forcing domestic players to rethink how they scale, where they invest, and which parts of the semiconductor market they prioritize. While the most obvious and immediate aim is capacity and operational efficiency, the broader objective is to harden China's semiconductor supply chain against external pressure while consolidating state resources around a smaller number of national champions. According to the South China Morning Post, SMIC's proposal to acquire its Beijing-based subsidiary, SMIC Jingcheng, for roughly ¥40 billion is emblematic of what is becoming an emerging trend. The Beijing fabs are already majority owned by SMIC, but bringing them fully onto the parent's balance sheet simplifies governance, capital allocation, and future expansion planning. Meanwhile, Hua Hong is pursuing a similar approach by acquiring Shanghai Huali, its closely linked sister foundry, in a deal valued at more than ¥8 billion. These might look like internal restructurings on paper rather than straight-up mergers between rivals, but they represent a deliberate pivot away from the fragmented growth model that defined China's foundry build-out over the past decade. Instead of creating new entities to chase specific technologies or regional subsidies, Beijing now appears to be encouraging consolidation around existing leaders, with state investors providing the financial backstop. Because building and equipping fabs has grown dramatically more expensive, even at mature process nodes. While SMIC has demonstrated limited capability using DUV lithography, the bulk of new capacity tied to these consolidation moves sits at 28nm and above, including 40nm, 55nm, and 65nm processes. Automotive microcontrollers, power management ICs, display drivers, connectivity chips, and a wide range of industrial and consumer components still rely on mature manufacturing. China has leaned heavily into this, with industry estimates suggesting that more than half of all new global capacity additions at mature nodes through the mid-2020s are located in China. Firstly, it reduces dependence on foreign suppliers for essential components used across the economy. Secondly, it creates a buffer against sanctions that target advanced equipment. Thirdly, it positions Chinese foundries as increasingly important suppliers to global customers who need stable access to mature nodes, even if geopolitical concerns complicate sourcing decisions. Restrictions on EUV lithography tools, advanced deposition equipment, and certain design software have slowed progress below 7nm and raised costs for any attempt to push further using workarounds. Larger, integrated foundries are better positioned to absorb higher tool costs, manage complex multi-patterning flows, and negotiate with domestic equipment suppliers that are still maturing. They also offer a clearer channel for state support, whether through direct funding, favorable financing, or guaranteed demand from state-owned enterprises. As Washington tightens scrutiny of potential sanctions circumvention, having fewer, larger entities also simplifies compliance and reduces the risk that smaller, less visible fabs become flashpoints for enforcement actions. Foundries in Taiwan, Japan, and parts of Southeast Asia that rely heavily on these nodes may find margins squeezed, particularly for commodity products. Concerns around export controls, intellectual property protection, and supply chain resilience are obvious sticking points, and some Western companies are already looking to diversify away from Chinese fabs even if that means higher costs. This points toward a more segmented market, where Chinese foundries dominate domestic and select international demand, while non-Chinese fabs serve customers with stricter geopolitical or regulatory constraints. SMIC and Hua Hong's acquisitions are unlikely to produce dramatic short-term shifts in China's technological standing. They do, however, reveal a maturing phase in Beijing's semiconductor strategy. That does not preclude future breakthroughs at the leading edge, but it suggests a longer-term strategy built on volume and incremental gains rather than rapid node-to-node leaps.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research tied to the University of Washington School of Medicine adds to mounting concerns among educators about smartphone use in schools. U.S. adolescents between the ages of 13–18 spend more than one hour per day on phones during school hours, with “addictive” social media apps accounting for the largest share of use, according to new research published in JAMA. “These apps are designed to be addictive,” said Dr. Dimitri Christakis, the paper's senior author. “They deprive students of the opportunity to be fully engaged in class and to hone their social skills with classmates and teachers.” That study had fewer participants but also included iPhone users. The effect of those policies “remains to be seen,” Christakis said. “To date they've been very poorly enforced, if at all. A majority of school districts in Washington state planned to have policies in place at the start of the school year last fall to limit students' use of cellphones and other devices such as smart watches. The UW's Youth Advisory Board, a group of approximately 20 teens from Seattle-area schools, recently published its first memo tackling the contentious issue of phones in school. A year after school's phone ban, educators and parents love it, but kids aren't so sure The kids have spoken: Teens' holistic approach to school phone policies rivals adult rules Proposed law would restrict phone usage in Washington public schools</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rapidly melting body of ice could cause up to 10 feet (3 meters) of global sea-level rise if it were to collapse completely. New evidence suggests the glacier is even less stable than previously believed, with hundreds of iceberg earthquakes shaking up the massive structure for more than a decade. Thanh-Son Pham, a researcher at the Australian National University, uncovered evidence of hundreds of glacial earthquakes that took place in Antarctica from 2010 to 2023. Most of those earthquakes have previously gone undetected due to their low-frequency seismic waves, and their discovery raises new questions about the threatening instability of Antarctica's melting glaciers. Out of the newly documented seismic events, 245 earthquakes took place in Antarctica's Doomsday Glacier, likely caused by capsizing icebergs. Glacial earthquakes are a newly discovered type of seismic event that produces low-frequency waves, with a magnitude of around 5. They were first detected in 2003 and are mainly caused by the collapse of large icebergs. Although scientists assumed that glacial earthquakes take place in Antarctica as well, they have been much harder to detect because they are of much lower magnitude than those that occur in Greenland. Rather than relying on the global network of seismic detectors, Pham used seismic stations in Antarctica itself to find evidence for glacial earthquakes. The search turned up hundreds of events that were never cataloged. The majority of glacial earthquakes took place near Antarctica's largest glacier, Thwaites. These events, however, took place around 30 to 50 miles (60 to 70 kilometers) away from the waterfront and are therefore not likely caused by capsizing icebergs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qualcomm was so excited to talk about its most powerful ARM-based PC CPUs in 2025, it left off its lower-end, humdrum processor for the big reveal of all its partnered products. Alongside the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Elite Extreme (cue the guitar riff), Qualcomm is coming to CES 2026 with an X2 Plus chip. Qualcomm's sequel to its initial batch of ARM-based chips that brought us Copilot+ PCs all boast a similar strong battery life and large 80 TOPS NPU (neural processing unit) built for background and low-scale AI tasks. Compared to the previous-gen Snapdragon X Plus, the higher-end X2 Plus promises 2.3 times better GPU performance and upwards of 50% better CPU multi-core performance. All that is to say, if you're looking at an X2 Plus laptop for any photo editing or any other graphics, you want the higher-end version. The mid-range ARM chip is supposed to compete against Intel and AMD's latest lightweight laptop CPUs. Qualcomm claims its new chip demands 43% less power for the same performance as its first-gen Snapdragon X Plus. One of Qualcomm's big bugbears for ARM on PC has been compatibility. Late last year, the chipmaker launched its Snapdragon Control Panel, a kind of game and app launcher that was supposed to help users update access to Microsoft's refined Prism x86 emulator and keep on top of drivers. Working on an ARM-based Windows machine is far better than it was at the Copilot+ launch in 2024. Support for Windows AVX and AVX2 extensions in the Prism emulator means it's much easier to run previously unsupported programs and even some games on Qualcomm's latest chips. Still, for the sake of a PC that can keep up with the Joneses of Intel and AMD's top-end laptop CPUs, the X2 Elite Extreme with its 18 Oryon cores (12 “prime” CPU cores and another six “performance” cores) will still offer the best overall performance. At least, there will be an interesting three-way competition for laptop supremacy in 2026.

HP is updating its top-of-the-line consumer productivity laptop, the OmniBook Ultra 14, with the latest silicon from both Qualcomm and Intel. Right now, HP is only saying that an Intel version with "Intel Next Gen AI" processors and graphics will exist, but is not naming specific chips. If the Intel models use Panther Lake, that would mean the NPU would go up to 50 TOPS on those models. Both systems come in an anodized aluminum finish. The Qualcomm version comes in a subtle "stone blue" color, while the Intel models come in duller gray and "sand" options. Both options use a 2880 x 1800 OLED touchscreen that goes up to 120 Hz. They also have similar port layouts (the Intel models use Thunderbolt 4, the Qualcomm options use USB4), and they each feature Wi-Fi 7 and a 70 WHr battery. The designs continue HP's use of a lattice-free keyboard on high-end models (similar to Dell) and large trackpads. The chassis has passed 20 MIL-STD 810G tests for durability. HP says the Intel version will be released this month, starting at $1,549.99. As of this writing, HP tells me the Qualcomm version will launch in the spring and that pricing will be shared closer to release. Beyond the sleek new Ultra 14, HP is updating the entire OmniBook stack at CES, with a variety of sizes and processors from Qualcomm, Intel, and next-gen Ryzen AI chips.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the company's cloud unit has established itself as a major AI infrastructure and enterprise services provider, Amazon has struggled to match the momentum of OpenAI, Google, and the rapidly growing field of consumer AI startups. As previously reported by GeekWire, the web interface extends Alexa beyond voice commands, enabling document uploads, web-based chat integration, and point-and-click control over reminders, calendars, and smart home devices. Alexa+ uses generative AI to offer smoother conversations and better answers than its predecessor, along with new agentic capabilities such as booking tickets and reservations. Amazon is competing against consumer AI rivals such as ChatGPT and Gemini, which have become everyday tools for millions of people. The company had an initial false start with a more limited conversational Alexa feature called “Let's Chat,” first shown publicly in September 2023, but never fully released. Working on Let's Chat led to “some realizations about how big of an effort we needed to put in with Alexa+,” said Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Echo, in a recent interview with GeekWire. According to the company, tens of millions of customers are now using Alexa+, with engagement rates two to three times higher than prior Alexa versions. Amazon is also betting on hardware to extend its AI ambitions beyond the home. In a post Monday, Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo gave the first public update since Amazon acquired the San Francisco startup last year. Since joining Amazon, Bee has shipped four major features in 90 days, Zollo wrote, including Voice Notes for capturing thoughts on the go, Actions that connect conversations to email and calendar, and Daily Insights that surface patterns across weeks of interactions. Zollo described the acquisition as a path toward “ambient AI” — technology that understands and assists users everywhere, “across every surface throughout your day.” Rausch said taking Alexa+ further beyond the home will be a big push for Amazon in 2026. He hinted at more to come, including new “personal mobile devices” from Amazon designed to help customers bring Alexa+ with them throughout the day. The chips powering your smart TV, voice assistant, tablet, and car all have something in common: MediaTek From AI experiences in your smart home, vehicle, office, and beyond — processing voice commands, visual recognition, and predictive responses are faster than ever.

So now he has been interrupted twice by two different manager and you have contradicted your own boss in front of an employee. You just broke a cardinal rule of middle management: it's ok to tell your boss he is wrong, but not in front of someone else. AT best you seem to tell him you will "look into it" in two weeks.Much better solution is to help you junior dev solve the problem so the interruption goes away as fast as possible and he can go back to contributing to the sprint. If the VP requires these numbers and went as far as back channeling you there is probably a quite good reason for that. Maybe the last time he needed something you told him it was not possible because the sprint thingy is unmovable ? He gets what he wants, the difficult conversation of "you did not do what you are supposed to do" happens behind closed doors, and you have a much better of getting results if he sees you as an ally to get his important stuff rather than a hinderance.

How much do you care about being put astray in comparison to the quality of overall work ? How likely is for the Jr to bypass you anyway ?And as one can see, this is just too much to bother with. Sometimes it is easier to cry out that you need more money and or time.I would do the same by the way. If the process does not work and this is constant there is no reason to tell the person that pays you that they are always wrong.

In real life, specific contexts (like 'Is the VP usually reasonable?') It trades short-term sprint purity for long-term political capital.I love this. I'm going to add your 'Shield & Deliver' path as an alternative (and perhaps superior) winning state. This is exactly the nuance I wanted to surface. This highlights a key point: I built this to teach transferable heuristics (e.g., 'Protect the team'), not to be a rigid playbook.

And I'm with you—my default instinct is also to tell Gary to back off using a Process Reason (e.g. 'It's not in the sprint'). It feels safe because it's logical.The 'Advice at the end' was just trying to highlight why that specific shield often cracks against a VP (because they think they own the process). Glad that specific breakdown was useful to read, even if the scenario felt a bit generous to the exec!Again, it also depends on who "Gary" is in the real world!

Again, it also depends on who "Gary" is in the real world! Meanwhile there are five other subordinates and all the overhead that you're neglecting while you fiddle with your dev environment trying to get started on the task, as you've been away from direct engineering for a while. This is good intuition but generally people won't tell you whether they have a good or silly/self-serving reason in my experience, and you can only really get them to surface that by comparing it to the priority of other commitments and forcing them to depriotize something.I think the ratings might be a bit borked. There's a dialogue path choice that results in the A+ where you end up asking directly whether the back-channel was worth another delay, and you. I think the ratings might be a bit borked. There's a dialogue path choice that results in the A+ where you end up asking directly whether the back-channel was worth another delay, and you. Sometimes you don't even need to surface it. You just force responsibility: “This will prevent us from being ready for Friday's demo. If Gary has a meeting with the client later and it goes poorly, that could be in part because of the lack of flexibility of the team to meet Gary's needs. At the end of a sprint, there should be plenty of things to demo even if search doesn't make it into this sprint. Also, I'm a firm believer in natural consequences - if Gary can be made aware of the consequences of bypassing the tech lead, he learns the hard way that it needs to be worth it. For people looking to transition to management, one thing I've learned is that a big part of my job is getting everyone to do only one thing at a time. Every stakeholder (including engineering managers) are obsessed with the idea of “sneaking a bit more work in,” and I've never seen it work. After all, estimation is work and we have a higher priority!The benefit is that you'll often find nobody actually estimated the business value/priority before asking for the work estimate, so you end up wasting less time overall. You really highlighted the core tension here: The theory of management (WIP limits, focus) is logical and easy to understand. That specific 'hard part' you mentioned—resisting the pull of authority—is exactly the muscle I'm trying to help people build without burning bridges. Also, you're commiting the team to deliver something you (probably) don't have the technical knowledge to estimate, so you might be adding another week of death March after just 1 weekend.The lesson at the end is not wrong, but the characters don't seem realistic.That said, I have always been IC for a reason, so what do I know. The lesson at the end is not wrong, but the characters don't seem realistic.That said, I have always been IC for a reason, so what do I know. You are spot on about the risk: Promising a 'Soul Update' without consulting the team is essentially writing a blank check that Engineering has to cash. As an IC, you are right to call that out—it's a dangerous move.Why I wrote the 'Winning' path that way: In my experience, Founder objections are often 50% about the product and 50% about anxiety. Why I wrote the 'Winning' path that way: In my experience, Founder objections are often 50% about the product and 50% about anxiety. On a lighter note: I definitely had a 'Steve Jobs' archetype in mind when writing that dialogue—hence the obsession with the product's 'Soul' over its metrics! If there was a way to combine this with coaching sessions, I think this could be a very effective way to train IC's that are stepping into leadership roles (managers, staff/principal IC's, PM's, etc.). It could also be interesting to have a variant of the exercise where you ask the student/user to write their own message. I actually view this tool not as a replacement for coaching, but as the 'Lab Work' that happens between sessions.If a new manager can play the 'Firing' scenario 5 times at home and fail safely, they come to their coaching session with specific, high-quality questions rather than generic anxieties. If a new manager can play the 'Firing' scenario 5 times at home and fail safely, they come to their coaching session with specific, high-quality questions rather than generic anxieties. However, I won't pay for the course as I'm only an IC with no realistic path to management. But maybe "transitioning from IC to management" is too small of a niche for this product: sounds like it would be good for managers that want to improve: "strategies for management from an ex-developer" or something like that On the niche size: You make a great point. I targeted 'Transitioning' specifically because that's usually the moment of maximum pain (and imposter syndrome).Established managers often feel they've 'figured it out' (even if they haven't!). The transition window is where people are actively looking for a lifeline.But you're right—at the Staff/Principal IC level, a lot of this just becomes 'Managing Up.'

Was there a specific turn in the conversation where you really wanted to just give a hard 'No' or call them out, but felt restricted by the choices? I'm not a manager and have no interest in becoming one but I have often wondered what is going through a manager's head when they cave to egregious horseshit from executives. I find this simulation really interesting and maybe it might help me empathize my manager more. "Political capital" is irrelevant and only exists when we permit it to exist. If the junior dev is really that critical for a large project for some bizarre reason (fix that next time), tell Gary he's critical to that and say you can realloc ppl to cover or do this task under a 1hr time limit if it's urgent (if exceeds then kill the task). Say to Gary next time let me know directly rather than dm someone on the team so you can route it to the right person (buys trust, covers team). Renewal of BigCo is important to the biz. It will not buy you or your team favour at all. This highlights a key distinction: The simulator is designed to teach heuristics (e.g., 'Default to protecting the team'), not a rigid playbook.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is rolling out a Fire TV redesign that puts more focus on the content, while also simplifying the navigation and layout. “We know the data — there's a lot of time spent searching,” he added. The new user interface features several design changes, including rounded corners, varied gradients, consistent typography, and increased spacing between content to make the interface feel less cluttered. While you can still scroll down to see your favorite rows, like what's up next, you can also see your apps in an expanded horizontal row. Before, you could only pin six apps to the Fire TV's home screen — a common user complaint. At the top of the screen, navigation has been simplified into obvious categories like Movies, TV, Live TV, Sports, and News. Across the new tabs, Fire TV centralizes access to the content you're already watching, and what's available across services you're subscribed to. These pages don't offer infinite scrolling, but they're lengthy as they represent the depth of content available on streaming services. Other TV features are tucked away under the three-line hamburger menu icon, like Games, Art & Photos, the Appstore, Music Video & Audio, a now-universal watchlist (“My Stuff”), Settings, and other options. To make it easier to access commonly used settings, you can also now long-press on the Home button to adjust settings for the display and audio, set a sleep timer, use accessibility features, access smart home features, and more. From this panel, you can do things like adjust the TV brightness, boost the audio dialogue, or display your Ring camera's feed on screen while you watch, among other things. Of course, Alexa+ access is built in, allowing users to ask questions, find content, or even do things like call an Uber. This AI-powered assistant allows users to ask questions in natural language, refine their queries as they chat, ask follow-ups, and use visual context. For instance, you could say, “Tell me more about that one,” when you have a movie or TV show's square tile selected on screen. You could even ask questions with some nuance, like “find me more movies that have the same look,” or have it help you find photos or art. Alexa+ will be available as an add-on subscription after it exits its early access phase (which currently requires opting in). The AI service will also be included with a Prime subscription. The Fire TV app, meanwhile, was also updated to offer the classic remote control combined with a new way to discover new content. It will also be available at launch on the new Amazon Ember Artline TVs (see below). The Ember Artline TVs are Amazon's latest televisions that ship with a frame that can match your room's style and colors. The new TVs themselves offer 4K QLED screens with 450 nits of brightness. The display is also thin, at one-and-a-half inches, and has a matte screen finish to reduce glare. However, the big selling point is the 10 different frame options you can choose from, offering a variety of colors, textures, and geometries. This allows customers to take better advantage of Fire TV's Ambient features, which include displaying art when the TV is not in use. The colors available include Walnut, Ash, Teak, Black Oak, Matte White, Midnight Blue, Fig, Pale Gold, Graphite, and Silver. Fire TV comes with access to over 2,000 pieces of free art, or you can use your own photos. You can also ask Alexa+ to display certain photos from your Amazon Photos collections using commands like, “Alexa, create a slideshow of our family trip to Colorado” or “Alexa, show photos from our wedding.” It's a max 450 nits for the Artline TVs' brightness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We've seen concept smartphones playing with fresh folding designs, but ever since Samsung kickstarted the trend in 2019, there have only really been two major styles in the market: a booklike fold and the flip. However, there's new life emerging in the category with significantly slimmer designs—such as last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7—and now the company's “TriFold," a smartphone that can truly transform into a 10-inch tablet. It's only available in a handful of countries, like China, South Korea, and Singapore, but Samsung plans to release it in the US this year. I was able to briefly spend some time with the triple-panel smartphone at CES 2026. As the name suggests, Samsung's priciest folding phone opts for a trifold design, whereas Huawei's equivalent has a Z fold. I haven't used Huawei's version yet, but that does have a leg up: You can use one, two, or all three panels with its accordion-style design. As a single panel, the 6.5-inch front screen feels quite like a normal smartphone, albeit with thicker-than-usual bezels around the screen, and a weight of 309 grams that you'll have to get used to. Keep in mind, the Galaxy Z Fold7 nets you an 8-inch screen, but that sounds like child's play next to the TriFold. It instantly feels more like an Android tablet than any other foldable Samsung has made before. That's important because this tablet experience is the promise “book-like” folding phones have made for years, but the slight increase in screen real estate never yielded the same experience as a standard tablet. The TriFold changes that—the screen here is bigger than an iPad Mini! It feels like the actual definition of a phablet. There are two titanium hinges, and they open up three panels. You can place a full-size app on each of the three panes, use a larger version of split-screen, or expand one app across the vast display. It was easy to configure these setups, and I can totally see myself taking advantage of having three apps open simultaneously. The TriFold is very slim in its unfolded state, which helps. Fold it up and you're looking at a thickness of 12.9 millimeters, which is just a smidge chunkier than the Galaxy Z Fold6 (12.1 mm). The fact that it's roughly the same thickness as a prior-generation fold, yet with a dramatically larger screen, is impressive. It makes the bulk a little more palatable. I can still picture someone ignoring this and just carrying on, though. The TriFold's three panels tuck into each other. Despite nearly a decade of folding phones, the prices for these handsets are still a premium, with Samsung even raising the MSRP of its folding devices in 2025. At a time of economic turmoil, the TriFold feels frivolous. But it's hard not to feel impressed at this engineering marvel.

However, that's precisely what's going on with the new ROG Xreal R1 augmented reality gaming glasses announced today at CES 2026. Asus has also experimented with AR, but we weren't impressed with the AirVision M1 glasses we sampled early last year. Will this new collaboration make the ROG Xreal R1 a better product? At its heart is an all-new, world-first 240 Hz Micro-OLED technology with 1920 x 1080 resolution. This provides wearers with a simulated 171-inch virtual viewing space for everything from productivity tasks to extreme gaming. As with most AR glasses, the ROG Xreal R1 requires a single USB-C cable, providing plug-and-play support for a wide range of PCs, smartphones, and tablets. Going from the built-in 7-inch display to a virtual 171-inch display using AR glasses that weigh just 91 grams should really up the stakes for mobile gaming. But the ROG Xreal R1 won't just be limited to the ROG Ally; the optional ROG Control Dock features a DisplayPort 1.4 port and two HDMI 2.0 ports for connecting to a desktop PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, or PlayStation 5 (among other devices). In addition, the ROG Xreal R1 features electrochromic lenses that automatically adjust transparency based on ambient light levels. If you don't want to use the automatic setting, there are also three user-selectable dimming modes. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. According to Asus, the ROG Xreal R1 will ship in the first half of 2026, but pricing hasn't been announced yet. However, for reference, the previous AirVision M1 glasses originally debuted at $699.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Father Mike Schmitz, a Catholic priest and podcaster, addressed his congregation of more than 1.2 million YouTube subscribers in November with an unusual kind of homily. Schmitz had become the target of AI-generated impersonation scams. “You must act quickly, because the spots for sending prayers are already running out,” said another fake Schmitz with a looming hourglass behind him. “And the next trip will only take place in four months.” The fake Schmitz sounded ever-so-slightly robotic as he urged viewers to click a link and secure their blessing before it was too late. “I can look at them and say ‘That's ridiculous, I would never say that,'” the real Schmitz, who is based in Duluth, Minnesota, said in his callout video. According to cybersecurity expert Rachel Tobac, who is the CEO of SocialProof Security, that's because pastors have become extremely popular subjects of AI scams and other deceptive media. Alan Beauchamp, a pastor in the Ozarks, said his Facebook account was hacked, with the hacker posting a fake, possibly AI-generated certificate for cryptocurrency trading with Beauchamp's name on it and a caption urging his congregants to join him. A megachurch in the Philippines received reports of deepfakes featuring its pastors. An evangelical church in Nebraska issued an AI “scammer alert” on Facebook, and one churchgoer in the comments posted a screenshot of texts purported to be from one of their pastors. It doesn't help that a lot of the pastors and ministers who have grown large online followings often actually are soliciting donations and selling things, just not the same things that their AI impersonators are. With the help of social media, religious authority figures have been able to reach believers far beyond their neighborhoods, but the proliferation of content featuring their likenesses and voices has also provided the perfect opportunity for scammers wielding generative AI tools. “The scammer can use that voice and call into a church and say ‘Hey, would you transfer this fund to this account? When searching Father Schmitz on TikTok, WIRED found that three of the fake accounts Schmitz had shown in his video were still active, though it wasn't immediately clear whether the videos they posted were AI or just clips pulled from Schmitz's real social media profiles. There are more than 20 accounts on TikTok posing as Schmitz, who doesn't have a verified account of his own on the platform. Schmitz didn't respond to a request for comment, while TikTok removed the fake Schmitz accounts after WIRED pointed them out to the company, citing its rules against impersonation. Scams aren't the only example of AI imitating pastors. Tobac has come across viral short-form AI videos that feature pastors who don't appear to be based on a specific individual but quickly rack up views because of how unexpected their sermons are. In one TikTok she shared with WIRED, which has over 11 million views, a pastor yells furiously into a crowd, hands gripping the sides of his pulpit: “Billionaires are the only minority we should be scared of! But while viral fake Paul videos were instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with his usual demeanor, a fake nondescript pastor has an easier time avoiding suspicion and gaining a different kind of influence in the process. “When you see someone who's high up in say, the church, espouse a specific belief, we ascribe meaning and value and power to that statement in a way that's different than an influencer,” Tobac said. The same incentives driving TikTok creators to dabble in AI media may also be driving churches to do the same. In September, a church in Dallas, Texas, showcased AI-generated videos of the slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk speaking about Christ from beyond the grave. According to a 2025 report from a company that is promoting the use of AI by church leaders, a majority of pastors surveyed said they are already using tools like ChatGPT and Grammarly to help prepare their sermons. While some faith leaders have rapidly warmed to religious AI, industry watchdogs like Tobac and Lucas Hansen, who cofounded the AI education nonprofit CivAI, remain concerned about users of the technology experiencing severe mental health consequences as a result. Some of those delusions can be religious in nature. “I think there might end up being a fair number of people that think that God is using AI as a tool to communicate with them. I think we're already seeing a little bit of that,” Hansen says. For priests and pastors who have already been impersonated by AI without their consent, there may be less of a desire to embrace the technology. After he warned his viewers about deepfakes of him, Schmitz reminisced on growing up watching the Terminator movies and its depiction of AI as the villainous Skynet. But the implications of AI advancement so far remind him more of the lethargic humans hovering around in recliners with floating screens in Wall-E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lockin has announced the Veno Pro Wireless and V7 Max, two new smart locks that the company says will have “zero need to recharge or replace batteries.” That's because each uses wireless optical charging—infrared light, pointed at the lock at all times and beaming low-level power into it at a distance. This is made possible by a separate, wall-mountable module that transmits wired power as light beamed at a small panel on the lock's indoor portion. Lockin spends most of its press release talking about the V7 Max, which it says has a four-meter wireless charging range. Wireless charging locks like these aren't exactly new, but they haven't exactly been something you can just go out and buy. (The tech is apparently quite nice, though; my former colleague at The Verge, Jennifer Tuohy, has said she never wants to go back after testing such a lock from Alfred.) That's all set to change with the Veno Pro Wireless and V7 Max, both of which Lockin says will be available for preorder soon after CES 2026 and shipping early this year. Like the V5 Max, it offers palm vein-scanning and facial recognition, but also offers finger vein, rather than fingerprint, scanning. Also, there's a physical shutter on the interior portion, if you don't want that camera to be able to see you. They also said it works best positioned directly in front of the lock, rather than at an angle. The V7 Max will be Matter-compatible, which makes it usable with any major smart home platform that supports the universal standard. Finally, the V7 Max is neither a normal door handle nor a deadbolt replacement; it's a mortise lock, which is more common in commercial buildings and would require significant rejiggering to install on the front of your house; unless you're extremely handy, you'll want a professional to put it in. The Veno Pro Wireless is a redesigned version of the existing Veno Pro, which also offers palm vein and fingerprint scanning, doubles as a video doorbell, and is Matter compatible. The Veno Pro Wireless will be an easier sell for most people since it's a simple deadbolt replacement and shouldn't require any costly modification to install.
