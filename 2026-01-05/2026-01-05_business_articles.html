                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump called for U.S. oil companies to invest billions of dollars in Venezuela's energy sector, hours after U.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. "We're going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure," Trump said in a press conference Saturday from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. But shares of Chevron, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips are rising as investors bet that the three largest U.S. oil companies will cash in after the U.S. military action. Venezuela's oil reserves are estimated at 303 billion barrels or about 17% of the global total, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The country's production peaked at 3.5 million barrels per day in the late 1990s but has declined significantly since then, according to energy consulting firm Kpler. Venezuela's production currently stands at around 800,000 bpd, Kpler data shows. Former President Hugo Chavez seized assets from U.S. oil majors in 2007. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela. Exxon and Conoco have billions of dollars in outstanding claims against Caracas from Chavez's nationalization. It will take more than just easing U.S. sactions against Venezuela to encourage new investment in the country, Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott told clients in a Monday note. U.S. producers would need to see a path to recover their claims from Caracas and have confidence in the stability of the government in Venezuela, McDermott said. "The oil companies are going to go in, they're going to spend money, we're going to take back the oil that, frankly, we should have taken back a long time ago," the president said. Chevron is best positioned to scale up production quickly if conditions allow, McDermott said. It exported about 140,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2025, Kpler data shows. Chevron has a significant resource base in Venezuela, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram told clients Monday. It has joint ventures with state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) that are responsible for 23% of the South American nation's output, Jayaram said. "We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations," the oil major said in a weekend statement. The Biden administration issued a license in 2022 that allowed Chevron's joint venture with PDVSA to produce and export oil. They exited the country after Chavez's nationalization and filed arbitration claims against Caracas. Conoco has oustanding claims from abitration cases against the Venezuela approaching $10 billion, Jayaram said. Conoco is "monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability," spokesperson Dennis Nuss said in a weekend statement. "It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments." Exxon has not responded to requests for comment. Rebuilding Venezuela's oil infrastructure will likely cost billions. Investors were speculating the work could boost business for oil services companies, with shares of Slb up more than 10%, Halliburton gained 9%, while Baker Hughes added 4% in trading Monday. The future of Venezuelan production depends on how the security situation on the ground evolves, said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in a Saturday note to clients. Venezuela production could grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day over the next 12 months if the Trump administration provides full sanctions relief and there is an orderly transition of power, she said. "However, all bets are off in a chaotic change of power scenario like what occurred in Libya or Iraq," Croft told clients. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon on Monday launched an Alexa+ website that lets some users chat with its assistant via their browser, putting it in more direct competition with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The Alexa.com website is only available to users of Alexa+, its revamped artificial intelligence assistant that debuted last February and remains in early access. Amazon says consumers can use Alexa.com to "get quick answers, explore complex topics, create content, plan trip itineraries and get help with homework." Users can also manage their smart home gadgets within the Alexa+ chat window, the company said. By launching a browser-based version of Alexa, Amazon wants to make sure users can interact with its AI assistant across different interfaces. Previously, Alexa+ was only available via a mobile app or some Echo devices. It also puts Amazon's service more in line with popular AI chatbots made by the likes of OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Perplexity, all of which are frequently accessed via web browsers. Amazon has faced growing pressure to update its hardware and software for the generative AI age following the success of ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and others. Alexa+ has gradually rolled out to users since its debut, and the company has said tens of millions of people now have access to the service. Amazon previewed Alexa.com when it launched Alexa+ last year, saying at the time that the website would launch in the coming months. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pentagon will cut the military retirement pay of Sen. Mark Kelly for what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the Arizona Democrat's "seditious" statements on a video with other members of Congress telling service members they have the right to refuse to execute illegal orders. Hegseth also issued a formal letter of censure against Kelly, which the Defense secretary said details  "reckless misconduct" by the retired Navy captain and astronaut. Hegesth said the Defense Department has begun a proceeding aimed at reducing Kelly's rank in retirement, which would in turn lead to a decrease in retirement pay. "Six weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline," Hegseth said in a statement on X. "As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he is still accountable to military justice. The Pentagon in November announced a probe of Kelly for his involvement with the video, and said that further actions could include a recall to active duty and a court-martial proceeding. But, in his tweet, Hegseth warned, "Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action." Kelly, in a statement on X, vowed to fight the disciplinary action "with everything I've got," and called Hegseth "the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history." "Over twenty-five years in the U.S. Navy, thirty-nine combat missions, and four missions to space, I risked my life for this country and to defend our Constitution – including the First Amendment rights of every American to speak out," Kelly wrote. "My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder," Kelly wrote. "Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve. "Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way," the senator said. There is nothing more un-American than that." The video that Kelly spoke on was made in response to the U.S. military conducting 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people. The legality of those strikes, which were made without authorization from Congress, has been questioned. In the video, which was posted on X on Nov. 18, Kelly says, "Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders." The five other Democratic members of Congress who delivered similar messages on the same video are Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania. Deluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer. But unlike Kelly, the other three veterans on the video separated from their service branches rather than retiring from them. As a result, they are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as Kelly is. Hegseth, in his statement on Monday, said about the Pentagon's move to discipline Kelly: "These actions are based on Captain Kelly's public statements from June through December 2025 in which he characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders." "This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay," Hegseth said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the Pentagon's action on Monday. "Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump. This is a despicable act of political retribution," Schumer wrote. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Walz of Minnesota is dropping his bid for reelection, he announced Monday morning. The announcement came as Walz, who was Kamala Harris' vice presidential pick for her failed 2024 White House bid, continues to weather heated criticism over a sweeping fraud scandal in his state. "As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can't give a political campaign my all," Walz said in a statement. "Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences," he said. Walz read the same statement during a brief news conference later Monday. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, is weighing a Minnesota gubernatorial bid in light of Walz bowing out, The New York Times reported Monday. Walz and Klobuchar spoke over the weekend, multiple outlets reported. A federal prosecutor in Minnesota last month estimated that the fraud schemes may have totaled more than $9 billion, though Walz has called that number "sensationalized." President Donald Trump has responded to the fraud reports with vehemently anti-Somali rhetoric and renewed attacks against Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, the first Somali American member of Congress. The Trump administration's Health and Human Services Department last week announced it would freeze all federal child-care payments to Minnesota. Walz, in Monday's statement, defended Minnesota's Somalian population while acknowledging that the fraud in the state must be addressed. "Make no mistake: We should be concerned about fraud in our state government. We cannot effectively deliver programs and services if we can't earn the public's trust," Walz said, listing the steps his administration has already taken. "But the political gamesmanship we're seeing from Republicans is only making that fight harder to win," he said. "We've got the President of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating childcare funding that Minnesotans rely on." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Versant Media Group, the portfolio of cable TV networks and digital assets spun off by Comcast, joined the small cohort of public media companies Monday as the industry reckons with ongoing disruption. Versant began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "VSNT," opening at $45.17 per share. The company's so-called when-issued stock — a security that is expected to be issued and has been authorized to trade on a conditional basis to give investors an early chance to buy shares — initially began trading on Dec. 15 at $55 per share and ended trading Friday at $46.65 per share. As of mid-morning Monday, Versant shares had fallen to roughly $40 per share, down 14% on the day. The company's market capitalization stands at roughly $6.5 billion with shares outstanding of 145.76 million based on the spinoff ratio. "It's been a year in the making," said Mark Lazarus, Versant CEO, on CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. In November 2024, Comcast announced its intention to separate out the bulk of NBCUniversal's cable TV networks, including MS Now (formerly MSNBC), CNBC, Golf Channel, USA, E!, Syfy and Oxygen, as well as digital properties Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow and Sports Engine. Now we're bringing these [assets] into their own company, we're going to be able to invest into them. Lazarus said "vertical scale" is necessary to diversify the business away from a dependence on pay TV. "While that's still a big, profitable part for us, it's not going to be the end game," he said. There are few traditional media companies that have gone public in recent years — namely because of the significant challenges the industry has been facing due to the shift away from the TV bundle and toward streaming. In 2025, Newsmax, the conservative cable news network, went public on the New York Stock Exchange and quickly saw its shares soar from its $14 per share opening price. It has fallen precipitously since its debut. Instead, the media sector has been marked by a rush for consolidation and fresh M&A deals. Paramount Skydance completed its merger last year, and since then CEO David Ellison has been acquisitive. Paramount has since made a hostile offer to WBD shareholders to upend the proposed transaction with Netflix. Its executives, led by CEO Lazarus, former chairman of NBCUniversal's media group, spent the final months of 2025 convincing Wall Street investors that the future of the business would be focused on growing the digital presence of its portfolio. Although networks like those in Versant's portfolio are seeing declines in financials, they are still profitable and beckon ad dollars. On Monday, Lazarus once again pointed to Versant's weight in sports and news, saying 62% of the portfolio is in those two content areas. "We have a really strong position," Lazarus said. In September Versant reported declining revenue in recent years as consumers exit the cable TV bundle. Shortly after, ratings agencies S&P Global and Fitch Ratings each issued BB credit ratings on the company's debt noting stable outlooks, placing the company's rating in junk territory. Versant's low debt levels have boded well for the company with both ratings agencies and have been a highlight in its pitch to Wall Street investors. Discovery have grappled with heavy debt loads while also contending with the decline of cable TV subscribers and lower ad revenue. Both ratings agencies noted the headwinds facing the traditional TV landscape, which S&P said "offset the strength of [Versant's] portfolio," noting that revenue from linear distribution and advertising from its networks accounted for more than 80% of total revenue. Fitch said "the strong viewer loyalty and engagement" with Versant's TV networks, as well as its conservative debt structure, bodes as a positive for the company. Versant executives said at a recent investor day presentation that the company intends to grow its digital business through acquisitions and investments. — CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this article.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe here to receive future editions in your inbox. It was anything but a quiet weekend for news, so I'll cut to the chase. S&P 500 futures are up slightly this morning. The market is coming off a losing week. President Donald Trump said early Saturday that the U.S. carried out a large-scale strike on Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife were captured and taken to New York to be indicted for narco-terrorism. Oil prices and stocks are being closely watched this morning as investors wonder what the shakeup in Venezuela would mean for the market structure. As CNBC's Spencer Kimball notes, Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. Petroleum-focused intergovernmental group OPEC+ kept its oil output unchanged yesterday. Shares of oil stocks such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil jumped in premarket trading today. This phrase-turned-governing principle has been a bedrock for Anthropic president and co-founder Daniela Amodei. As CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos reports, the buzzy artificial intelligence startup has been disciplined when it comes to spending. As Amodei puts it: "Anthropic has always had a fraction of what our competitors have had in terms of compute and capital, and yet, pretty consistently, we've had the most powerful, most performant models for the majority of the past several years." Read and watch the full interview here. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. Tesla lost its spot as the world's largest electric vehicle maker for the first time last week. The company reported 418,227 deliveries in the fourth quarter on Friday, missing Wall Street's forecast and marking a 16% decline from a year ago. Tesla's 2025 calendar year total of 1.64 million placed it behind China-based company BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles in the year. Users also criticized Musk's xAI company last week over recent Grok chatbot posts showing AI-generated, sexualized images of children shared on X. Meanwhile, Musk's Starlink business said it would provide free broadband internet service to Venezuela users until early February following the U.S. strike. As CNBC's Amelia Lucas found, the fast-food chain is dishing out retro packaging, collectible cups, special merchandise and freebies to mark the occasion. Chick-fil-A's marketing blitz comes as the restaurant industry grapples with sliding traffic. Here's what we're keeping an eye on this week: CNBC Pro subscribers can see a calendar and rundown for the week here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The starting dose of 1.5 milligrams is available at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as select telehealth providers, including Ro, LifeMD, Weight Watchers, GoodRx and Novo Nordisk's NovoCare Pharmacy. Cash-paying patients can pay $149 per month for the starting dose. The 4-milligram dose of the pill will also be available for $149 per month through April 15, then $199 per month after that. The highest doses of the Wegovy pill – 9 milligrams and 25 milligrams – will be available for $299 per month. Patients with insurance coverage for the drug can pay as little as $25 per month for the treatment. Cash-paying patients will also be able to access the starting dose of the pill for $149 per month on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration in November. The site also launches in January, though it's unclear when. Novo Nordisk on Monday said the pill's availability "opens new possibilities" for the more than 100 million Americans living with obesity. Injections from Novo Nordisk and its chief rival, Eli Lilly, carry a list price of roughly $1,000 per month. But both companies offer lower cash-pay prices for their shots that range from $299 to $499 monthly, depending on the dose. Goldman Sachs analysts said in August that oral drugs could capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market. The launch of Novo Nordisk's daily oral drug on Monday gives the company a clear head start. The Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment on Dec. 22 and will decide whether to clear a rival pill from Eli Lilly later this year. The FDA also approved Novo Nordisk's pill for use to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke, in adults with obesity and established cardiovascular disease. Both work by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 to suppress appetite. "This moment is about changing what's possible in weight management, and to make that possible, we have worked to ensure [the Wegovy pill] is affordable and accessible to those who need it, however they choose to receive their care," said Ed Cinca, Novo Nordisk's senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions, in a release. People who take Novo Nordisk's pill have to wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking each day. In a phase three trial that followed more than 300 adults with obesity and not diabetes, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average after 64 weeks. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug. The pill appears to be slightly more effective than Eli Lilly's experimental oral drug, which does not have dietary restrictions. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Chick-fil-A's 80th anniversary, the chicken chain is going all out: retro packaging, collectible cups, themed merch and even the chance to win free food for a year. To win back diners, many restaurants have leaned into deals, buzzy promotions and larger marketing budgets. As a privately held company, Chick-fil-A does not disclose quarterly financial results, but franchise disclosure documents show that the company's system sales growth slowed to 5.4% in 2024, making it the first year in more than a decade with less than double-digit sales growth. The yearlong marketing campaign kicks off on Monday and represents the biggest promotional push ever for Chick-fil-A. Khalilah Cooper, Chick-fil-A's vice president of brand strategy, advertising and media, told CNBC that new advertising will spotlight the anniversary in both national TV spots and on social media. "We've thought about this as a way to celebrate our heritage with customers who've been with us, potentially for decades, for all 80 years, or whether they've been with us for eight days or have never tried Chick-fil-A before," Cooper said. While Chick-fil-A's growth is slowing, its sales are still rising even as the broader restaurant industry struggles with more budget-conscious consumers who are eating out less often and spending less, leading to shrinking traffic to eateries. In 2025, July was the only month with increasing restaurant visits compared with the year-ago period, according to Black Box Intelligence. Chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Papa John's and Wendy's have reported declining traffic and falling same-store sales. Hundreds of restaurant locations, from the likes of Starbucks and Jack in the Box, permanently closed in 2025 due to weak traffic. To start, Chick-fil-A is also rolling out four retro collectible cup designs every few weeks, inspired by the company's archives and the shape of its 32-ounce cup. Plus, Chick-fil-A has come up with its own riff on Willy Wonka's famous golden ticket: the Golden Fan Cup. The 3,000 customers who buy a collectible cup and receive the Golden Fan Cup will receive free Chick-fil-A for a year. The chain will also give its iconic chicken sandwich limited-time, vintage-inspired packaging. Chick-fil-A plans to sell themed merch through its website over the course of the year. Customers who visit its restaurants will also be able to purchase limited-edition designs of its stuffed cows. Also as part of the campaign, Chick-fil-A is adding its frosted sodas and floats to its menu permanently, starting Monday. Customers can also expect to see more limited-time menu items throughout the year than Chick-fil-A typically offers, according to Cooper. Chick-fil-A traces its roots to 1946, when S. Truett Cathy and his brother opened a restaurant called The Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. More than two decades later, Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A location, with its trademark chicken sandwich. The business is still family owned, and Cathy's grandson Andrew serves as its CEO. Over the past decade, Chick-fil-A has expanded far beyond its Southeastern stronghold, opening locations all across the U.S. and planning to expand its international business into the United Kingdom and Singapore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro appeared in a New York court on Monday afternoon, saying he had been "kidnapped" with his wife by U.S. forces from their home in Caracas, and that he was a "prisoner of war," as he pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking charges Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who is also charged in the case, have been held since they were taken from Venezuela on Saturday after a U.S. strike on the country at the orders of U.S. President Donald Trump. I am not guilty of anything," Maduro repeatedly said through a translator to Judge Alvin Hellerstein during his appearance in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Completely innocent," Flores replied when asked for her plea. Flores had a large bruise on her forehead. Her attorney requested that she get medical attention from jail officials for injuries she sustained during her capture Saturday, including an X-ray for her ribs, which are believed to be broken or severely bruised. The couple agreed to remain in jail without bail for now, but could submit a bail application in the future. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, whose office is prosecuting the couple, during an interview Monday morning on CNBC's "Squawk Box," said, "From the perspective of where I sit, my people and I are completely comfortable with this prosecution." Defense lawyer Barry Pollack represented Maduro at the hearing.. Pollack previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Assange's federal criminal case. Pollack said during the hearing said Maduro "is head of a sovereign state and entitled to the privilege" from that status. Pollack also said there were "questions about the legality of his military  abduction" and that there would be "voluminous" court filings addressing that issue. Flores is being represented by Mark Donnelly, a former federal prosecutor in Texas. Maduro, 63, is charged in a federal indictment with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. Flores, 69, is charged with the cocaine conspiracy and weapons counts. Maduro, whom the indictment refers to as the "illegitimate ruler" of Venezuela as a result of fraudulent election results, is accused of partnering with co-conspirators, narcotics traffickers, and narco-terrorist groups to import tons of cocaine into the United States. Maduro and his wife appeared at around noon before Judge Hellerstein. "Nicolas Maduro Moros, the defendant, now sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug  trafficking," the 25-page indictment alleges. "This cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States," the indictment says. Among the alleged overt acts detailed in the indictment is a meeting that Flores attended in approximately 2007, in which she purportedly "accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to broker a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres." "The drug trafficker later arranged to pay a monthly bribe to Reverol Torres, in addition to approximately $100,000 for each flight that was transporting cocaine to ensure the flight's safe passage, a portion of which was then paid to Flores de Maduro," the indictment alleges. "Reverol Torres was charged with narcotics offenses in the Eastern District of New York and is a fugitive." Those defendants are Maduro's son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guerra; Diosdado Cabello Rondon; Ramon Rodriguez Chacin; and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores. Cabello is Venezuela's interior minister, a post previously held by Rodriguez. The Trump administration has faced questions about Maduro's apprehension in his own country, given Trump's recent pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted in 2024 of conspiring with drug traffickers and using his government position to help hundreds of tons of cocaine enter the United States.

After a decade at a white-shoe firm, she left to join one of her clients, the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. What came next is far less common. Menlo has elevated Carrillo, its general counsel and only in-house lawyer, to partner after nearly six years with the firm — a rare distinction inside a venture fund. Carrillo said she's at the table for weekly partner meetings where they pitch deals and bat around ideas. Lawyers who go in-house often swap the prestige of firm life for steadier hours and a different kind of influence. At venture firms, general counsels typically haven't been on a path to ownership. Menlo Ventures is one of the oldest investment shops in Silicon Valley, with $6.8 billion in assets under management. Other firms that have granted the partner title to general counsels over the years include Lightspeed and Bessemer Venture Partners. Before joining Menlo, Carrillo was a partner at the New York law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, where she advised startups and venture firms. As the firm's one-person legal shop, Carrillo helps structure investments and funds and keeps the machinery of compliance running smoothly. Increasingly, that means translating geopolitics into go or no-go calls: flagging risks that could trigger blowback from the government, and, amid new federal restrictions on foreign investments, digging into whether a portfolio company's ownership traces back to Chinese nationals. "I help people make the best decision and execute on those decisions," Carrillo said.</p>

In practice, Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business founders, said on Lenny's Podcast recently that this means he will stop hiring humans in his sales department. Instead, SaaStr is going all in on agents, which are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user. He said the company now has 20 AI agents automating tasks once handled by a team of 10 sales development representatives and account executives.

That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit. Amelia Lerutte, SaaStr's chief AI officer, told Business Insider by email that by June, the company began ramping up the number of agents it had in production. "We had only 1 non-core agent at the time with Delphi, but didn't go deep on 2 to 20+ until the beginning of June," she said. SaaStr's process is similar to how Vercel, the cloud-based platform for developers, trained a sales agent off its top performer for six weeks by documenting every step of their work, and then building an agent to mimic their process. Many companies are experimenting with AI agents, but risks remain. "AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them," Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, recently told Wired. All of that access creates more potential attack points for cybercriminals. However, he said, agents are more efficient and can scale — just like software.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that the US had conducted a raid on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and big names in business and foreign policy have been reacting as the aftermath unfolds. Myers, chairman of political risk consulting firm Signum Global Advisors, told Business Insider that foreign investment in oil, tourism, and construction will be the "centerpiece" of Venezuela's financial recovery going forward, adding that he expects the country's economy will grow "faster over the next two years than people anticipate because of the extent or scale of foreign investment." Myers, also a former head of investment advisory firm Evercore, is planning a trip of 15-20 investors to visit Venezuela in March to identify investment opportunities. Signum Global Advisors has hosted similar trips for investor groups in Syria and Ukraine. The horse's head was depicted as a rudimentary children's drawing, captioned "plans for future of Venezuela. "I wouldn't exactly call it a plan," Bremmer added. Make no mistake where the world is heading here." The billionaire hedge fund manager wrote in a post on X that "The removal of Maduro will lower oil prices, which is good for America and very bad for Russia. A weaker Russian economy will increase the probability that the war in Ukraine ends sooner and on more favorable terms for Ukraine. And Putin will be sleeping in his safe room from this point going forward." Gao is a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a law professor at Singapore Management University. In a series of posts on X, he said the raid on Caracas ushered in "the brave new world of international law." "Maduro's capture has triggered the biggest revival of international law since Grotius — and overnight turned everyone on X into an international law wonk, eager to compare Venezuela to Taiwan," he wrote. "But China has never treated the Taiwan issue as a matter of international law," he continued. The reason China has not acted is not because it lacks legal justification, but because it lacks the capability. Thus, US ops in Venezuela provide China with no additional legal justification." The Democratic senator from Massachusetts is a former Harvard Law professor who holds deep expertise in bankruptcy and consumer finance. In a post on X, she wrote that Trump's action to seize Maduro, "no matter how terrible a dictator he is — is unconstitutional and threatens to drag the US into further conflicts in the region." "What does it mean that the US will 'run' Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?" "The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump's dangerous military adventurism overseas that won't make the American people safer." The Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent most of Saturday posting praise for the Trump administration and the military operations in Venezuela, posting that it was "heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant." In another post, Musk retweeted a White House image of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after being apprehended, with the caption "Congratulations, President Trump! Musk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, alternating between appearing to be close allies and trading sharp criticisms in the media. Washington's effective control of Venezuela would hand the US a major energy advantage, according to Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's head of macro research for Asia ex-Japan. Proximity gives the US a logistical edge to Venezuelan oil supply, while the loss of access leaves China's remaining oil imports increasingly vulnerable to major maritime chokepoints. In an X post on Saturday, he said that while Venezuela holds an estimated 17% to 18% of global oil reserves, it accounts for just 1% to 1.5% of global production, calling oil a "secondary benefit" rather than the main motivation. Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said Maduro's removal may be widely welcomed, but that the operation was not strategically wise. Writing in his "Home & Away" newsletter, Haass called the raid a "military operation of choice, not of necessity," saying that Maduro "hardly posed an imminent threat to the United States." He said that removing a leader is far easier than replacing a regime, invoking former Secretary of State Colin Powell's "Pottery Barn rule" — the idea that if you break a country, you own the consequences. Haass also said that the operation could set a dangerous precedent, potentially emboldening Russia and China to justify interventions in Ukraine and Taiwan under similar logic.</p>
