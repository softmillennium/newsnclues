            Nippon Steel has finalized its deal to buy 100% of US Steel, the iconic steelmaker that was once the world's most valuable company and a cornerstone of American industrial might.
    


            The companies announced Wednesday that the two had completed the partnership. Under the terms of the deal ﻿first announced in December 2023, Nippon will buy US steel for $55 per share, or $14.1 billion. The company will also retain its name and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania headquarters.
    


            But while Nippon is buying the entirety of US Steel, under the final deal the US government will gain a say in many key decisions on how the company is run. That includes giving President Donald Trump veto power over any decision to idle plants, reduce production or staffing levels.
    


            Despite the terms disclosed Tuesday, the acquisition comes despite Trump's past opposition the deal, saying he would only allow it because it was an “investment” by Nippon, not an outright purchase.
    


            “It's an investment, and it'll be a partial ownership (by Nippon),” Trump said last month, days after announcing he would approve the deal. “It will be controlled by the United States, otherwise I wouldn't make the deal.”
    


            The deal was previously blocked by President Joe Biden in his final weeks in office, citing national security grounds, and it was opposed by Trump when he was on the campaign trail. But once Trump took office, he said Nippon improved the deal and promised additional investment totaling $14 billion in the company's facilities, although only $11 billion in investment through 2028 is in the agreement Nippon and US Steel signed with the US government.
    


            At a rally at US Steel facility outside of Pittsburgh a week after saying he would allow the deal, Trump told a crowd of cheering steelworkers that it would be a good one for them.
    


            “They kept asking me over and over, and I kept rejecting it, no way, no way, no way,” he said. “The deal got better and better and better for the workers,” Trump said. “I'm going to be watching over it. It's going to be great.”
    


            Trump went on to say that US would keep its blast furnaces operating at full capacity for at least the next decade, and there would be “no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.”
    


            But while some local union officials were at the rally and praised the deal, the United Steelworkers union continued to oppose it. In a statement Sunday it questioned the promises and protections that the deal provides, even with Trump and future presidents having veto power over some moves.
    


            “Perhaps the historic “USS” logo will remain, but it seems it will be no more than a smoke screen to allow a wholly-owned privately held subsidiary of a Japanese corporation to be called ‘American.'”
    


            US Steel was once a symbol of American industrial dominance. It was the most valuable company in the world and the first to be worth $1 billion, soon after its creation in 1901. It was also crucial to the US economy throughout much of the 20th century providing the steel needed to build cars, appliances, bridges and skyscrapers, as well as weapons that helped win War War II.
    


            But it has suffered through decades of decline since its post-World War II height. It is no longer even the largest US steelmaker, and a relatively minor employer, with 14,000 US employees — 11,000 of whom are members of the USW.

Iran has a legitimate right to respond to Israel's attacks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said, accusing West Jerusalem of engaging in “banditry and state terrorism.” 

He also compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler.

Israel began bombing Iran on Friday, claiming Tehran is nearing the completion of a nuclear bomb. Iran dismissed the accusations and retaliated to the Israeli military operation with waves of drone and missile strikes on the Jewish state.

“It is entirely natural, legitimate, and lawful for Iran to defend itself against Israel's banditry and state terrorism,” Erdogan stated on Wednesday during a parliamentary group meeting in Ankara.

The Turkish president strongly criticized Israel's leadership for its acts of aggression, claiming that Netanyahu has “long surpassed the tyrant Hitler in the crime of genocide.” 

He also condemned the global inaction over Israel's aggression in Gaza, seen by the UN rights committee as characteristic of genocide, stating that “the blood of massacred civilians, murdered babies, and children is splattered not only on the hands and faces of those who support Israel's arrogance, but also on those who remain silent.”

Türkiye is doing “everything we can” to stop what he called “inhumane aggression” not only against Iran, but also Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, Erdogan insisted. 

“Stopping Israel's aggression is essential for the world and humanity,” he said.

Ankara is staying vigilant and “closely monitoring Israel's terrorist attacks on Iran,” he said.

The government is committed to safeguarding the country's interests, peace and security and is prepared for “every possible negative development and scenario.”

Russia has condemned the Israeli campaign as illegal and warned that strikes on Iran's nuclear infrastructure could trigger a “nuclear catastrophe.” In a statement on Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Israel's attacks on peaceful atomic sites violate international law and threaten global stability.

US President Donald Trump, however, has backed Israel and demanded Iran's “unconditional surrender.” 

On Tuesday, he claimed that American forces and allies have achieved “complete and total control of the skies over Iran,” and said the US knew the location of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling him an “easy target.”

Israel struck several military targets in Iran, including a centrifuge production facility and several weapons manufacturing sites in Tehran, on Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).   

The operation, which involved more than 50 fighter jets, targeted Iran's nuclear weapons and missile programs, the IDF said in a statement.   

The Israeli air force struck a centrifuge production site near Tehran that the IDF claimed was designed to “enable the Iranian regime to expand the scale and speed of its uranium enrichment to develop nuclear weapons.” The IDF described it as “a key facility for centrifuge production.”  

In addition to the centrifuge facility, the IDF said its jets hit factories that make missile components.  

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed that Israeli airstrikes targeted two centrifuge production facilities linked to Iran's nuclear program.  

In a statement posted on X, the agency named the sites as the Tehran Research Center and the TESA workshop in Karaj, a city west of the capital.  

The IDF claimed Iran is enriching uranium at levels “not required for civilian use,” and said the strike was “part of the broad effort to operate against Iran's nuclear weapons development project.”

Iran currently enriches uranium to 60% purity, far above the 3.67% cap set under the now-defunct 2015 nuclear deal, which was rendered null and void after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from it during his first term.  

Despite Israel's claims, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said the agency does “not have any proof of a systematic effort” by Iran to move closer to producing a nuclear weapon, in an interview with CNN.

Despite the ongoing talks between the US and Iran, late last week Israel launched strikes on Iranian military and nuclear sites, killing a number of senior commanders and scientists. Iran responded with missile strikes on Israel.  

Moscow, which had earlier offered to mediate between the two sides, condemned Israel's strike and warned that further escalation could destabilize the entire region. The Russian Foreign Ministry also called on Israel to “come to its senses and immediately stop raids on nuclear installations.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Germany's Merz praises Israel for doing ‘dirty work for us'","https://www.rt.com/news/619589-germany-israel-dirty-work/","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 01:31:00 GMT","

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has lauded Israel's military strikes against Iran, saying the Israeli government and army are doing the “dirty work” of Western nations.

Merz made the remarks in a series of interviews on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, attended by all guarantors of the original 2015 Iran nuclear deal, except for Russia and China.

“This is the dirty work that Israel is doing for all of us. We are also victims of this regime,” he said in an interview with ZDF, claiming that “this mullah regime has brought death and destruction to the world.”

I can only say: The greatest respect for the fact that the Israeli army and the Israeli leadership had the courage to do this.

“I assume that the attacks of the last few days have already weakened the mullah regime considerably and that it is unlikely to return to its former strength, making the future of the country uncertain,” Merz said in a separate interview with Die Welt.

Germany is part of the P5+1 group, which negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, in 2015. Despite his support for the strikes, Merz stated that Berlin is ready to back new negotiations to ensure Iran never obtains nuclear weapons.

West Jerusalem justified its attack on Friday by claiming Iran is on the brink of obtaining nuclear weapons. Tehran has repeatedly denied the accusations, maintaining that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful.

Iran retaliated by firing dozens of ballistic missiles into Israel, with both sides exchanging attacks ever since. Iran has reported at least 224 deaths since the hostilities began. Israel has reported 24 deaths.

In a joint statement on Monday, the leaders of the G7 called Iran the “principal source of regional instability and terror,” adding: “we have been consistently clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon.”

US President Donald Trump, who abruptly cut his stay at the G7 summit short, demanded an “unconditional surrender” from Iran on Tuesday.

Washington previously demanded that Tehran stop all uranium enrichment, which Iranian officials described as “completely detached from reality.”

Iran currently enriches uranium to 60% purity, far above the 3.67% cap set under the now-defunct 2015 nuclear deal, which was rendered null and void after Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from it during his first term.

Russia has condemned Israel's initial airstrikes and called for deescalation. President Vladimir Putin spoke with Trump by phone over the weekend, and according to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, the two discussed the possibility of reviving negotiations on Iran's nuclear program.

MOSCOW, June 18 /TASS/. SPIEF may yield $95.5 billion in contracts, and US President Donald Trump leaves the G7 summit in Canada early. Meanwhile, Iran deploys a hypersonic missile to strike Israel. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines in Russia.

 

Contracts to be signed at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), which kicks off on Wednesday, may reach 7.5 trillion rubles ($95.5 billion), marking a 20% rise year-on-year, experts interviewed by Izvestia estimate. The key agreements are expected to contribute to developing Russian exports in new directions and other international initiatives. More than 20,000 delegates from over 140 nations are planning to attend the forum, running through June 21, with Bahrain enjoying the status of guest country at SPIEF 2025, which will be themed ""Shared Values: The Foundation of Growth in a Multipolar World."" This year's forum will differ by featuring deeper international cooperation and a more active investment strategy by both regions and individual companies, experts say.

The traditional plenary session, to be chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin, will crown SPIEF. It will take place on Friday, June 20. Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov specified that the head of state will present his vision of the situation in the Russian and global economy.

Also, events in the format of business dialogues with foreign partners from Africa, Bahrain, India, Iran, China, and EU countries will be held at the forum. The Russian side plans to sign a declaration on strategic cooperation with Indonesia, Ushakov added. In addition, American entrepreneurs will participate in SPIEF.

Politicians from around 50 countries will attend. A number of nations will be represented by heads of government and ministers, including Hungary's top diplomat Peter Szijjarto, Qatari Finance Minister Ali bin Ahmed Al Kuwari, and Cuban Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment Oscar Perez-Oliva.

""While SPIEF 2024 focused on identifying growth points in the evolving multipolar system, SPIEF 2025 will emphasize such shared values as trust, equal rights, and transparency as a foundation to build new international relations amid global fragmentation,"" Freedom Finance Global analyst Vladimir Chernov noted.

Contracts will likely be tied to the expansion of Russian exports, including in the fields of energy and defense, independent expert Andrey Bakhota suggested. ""The most valuable agreements at the forum usually involve high-tech services that Russia offers to other nations - in constructing nuclear power plants, maintaining advanced weapons systems, or education,"" he explained. Bakhota said this year's forum may even yield 8 trillion rubles ($102 billion) worth of contracts. Among other major agreements, Finam expects projects in technological sovereignty, import substitution, digital economy, infrastructure modernization, and enhanced cooperation with partners from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

 

On June 17, US President Donald Trump decided to return home on the first day of the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Canada. He attributed his early departure to efforts to contribute to stabilizing the situation in the Middle East, as Israel and Iran have been exchanging strikes since June 13, when Israel launched its Operation Rising Lion.

So far, Trump has not put forward any specific proposals to either Israel or Iran. He reiterated that Tehran should have signed a nuclear deal with the United States. Meanwhile, Trump slammed a statement from French President Emmanuel Macron on why he had to leave the G7 summit even as he called on everybody to ""evacuate Tehran,"" the city with a population of roughly 14 million, minutes before he departed from Canada.

Trump always goes against the current, so it was typical how he violated the protocol, said Pavel Koshkin, a senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies. According to him, this is how Trump shows his weariness with both Europe and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, Trump is concerned about prospects of resolving the confrontation between Israel and Iran, the expert in American studies emphasized.

Nor did the US leader meet with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, who was originally scheduled to attend the G7 summit. In that, it differed from all the previous summits, which have focused on the Ukraine crisis since 2022. Trump and Zelensky last met in the Vatican in May, when they attended the funeral of Pope Francis.

The format of G7 meetings is largely losing its relevance due to global shifts and the foreign policy course being pursued by the United States under Trump, Associate Professor at the Faculty of World Economy and International Affairs at the Higher School of Economics Lev Sokolshchik told Vedomosti. According to the expert, the current US administration tends to prioritize unilateral actions or bilateral format to multilateral institutions. This rhymes with the principle of Trump's foreign policy of putting American interests first, Sokolshchik stressed.

As regards the Iran-Israel conflict, the expert says the positions of the United States and Europe on Israel's security coincide. ""The G7 leaders' statement affirmed Israel's right to self-defense. But any escalation poses serious risks to European countries, ranging from the disruption of transportation routes in the event of a potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz to new migrant waves,"" the expert concluded.

 

As the Israel-Iran conflict continued into the fourth day, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the newly appointed Iranian Chief of Staff Ali Shadmani was killed. He became the 14th representative of the Islamic Republic's military establishment killed in the Jewish state's operation, which claimed at least 300 civilian casualties over three days, Iranian Ambassador to Moscow Kazem Jalali said on Tuesday.

Since the launch of Operation Rising Lion targeting Iran's nuclear program, over 15,000 centrifuges at Iran's biggest underground enrichment plant in Natanz have been damaged. Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi said there was a possibility of both radiological and chemical contamination within the Natanz facility.

Meanwhile, Shlomi Binder, who heads the IDF Intelligence Directorate, told his officers that they will soon ""break ground"" in other areas of Iran.

The conflict between Israel and Iran is escalating rapidly with complete unpredictability, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on June 17. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Israel's attacks on civilian nuclear facilities in Iran are illegal, as they are pushing the world toward a nuclear disaster.

Since the latest escalation, Iran has fired more than 400 missiles and hundreds of drones on the Jewish state, IDF Spokeswoman Anna Ukolova told Izvestia. The chief of the Islamic Republic's General Staff called on residents in Israel's Tel Aviv and Haifa to evacuate the two cities. Tehran delivered strikes on the building of Israel's military intelligence and the Mossad headquarters, killing multiple Israeli officers and servicemen. Iranian attacks have killed 24 people in Israel and injured more than 640, Dmitri Gendelman, an adviser in the Israeli prime minister's office, said in a bulletin. In the early hours of June 17 alone, the Israeli military recorded 30 missile launches, the majority of which were destroyed.

On Tuesday morning, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced a fresh and more devastating wave of missile strikes against Israel, in which it fired a new missile that the Zionist regime failed to detect until it struck. Analysts think Tehran might have used its Fattah hypersonic missile in the attack.

Only several countries, namely Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, possess hypersonic missiles, military expert Dmitry Lyamin told Izvestia. ""Systems that can not only fly at hypersonic speed but also make maneuvers are considered such weapons today,"" the expert explained. Exactly how many such missiles Iran has in service is classified, he emphasized. Also, he added, Tehran may have a hypersonic missile not previously disclosed.

 

Global portfolio wealth managers are becoming less fearful of trade wars, the latest survey conducted by Bank of America showed, with US trade talks with Britain and China inspiring their cautious optimism. However, the hostilities between Israel and Iran may now take center stage. Russian wealth managers believe that any potential US involvement in the conflict or the closure of the Strait of Hormuz may impact the global economy the most, even as they see such a scenario as unlikely.

Given that BofA's latest survey was conducted before Israel launched a surprise missile attack on Iran, it did not cover the recent escalation in the Middle East. Alyona Nikolayeva, portfolio manager at Astero Falcon, said the latest flare-up may disrupt expectations of a ""soft landing of the economy"" among most portfolio managers.

Even as missile attacks will heighten geopolitical risks, trade war risks will not be automatically pushed aside, portfolio managers interviewed by Kommersant believe. This is because, over the past two years, Iran and Israel have exchanged strikes for a third time already, with the two previous rounds being quite brief and not escalating into a broader conflict. Therefore, the role of this factor will largely depend on how long the hostilities last and what actions the parties involved take. ""Should the US directly interfere in the conflict and the physical oil market comes under real pressure from supply shortages, oil prices may easily spike above $100 per barrel,"" Nikolayeva warned.

According to Igor Kozak, managing investment director at TKB Investment Partners, a potential blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could be critical for the global economy and markets, pushing oil prices to $130 per barrel. If prices remain at that level for an extended period, a likely outcome in a sustained oil shortage, global inflation will rise, forcing central banks worldwide to return to monetary tightening.

 

In January-May 2025, Russian coal exports unexpectedly returned to growth, despite an unfavorable market situation. Coal supplies to overseas countries saw a 1% year-on-year increase to 81.3 million metric tons, data from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) showed.

The growth is attributed to increased exports to China and Turkey, as well as the expansion of trading, CCI analysts note. In the first five months of 2025, coal exports to China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, grew by 14% to 43 million metric tons, while exports to Turkey increased by 1.5 times to 7.9 million metric tons.

Over the past three years, Russian coal exports have been declining amid sanctions, issues with railway infrastructure, and falling global commodity prices. Data from the Energy Ministry showed that last year, coal supplies abroad stood at 195.9 million metric tons, an 8% decline from 2023.

This year, Russian coal exports have been rising due to a flexible pricing policy of coal suppliers and a partial reduction in logistics costs, Sergey Suverov, an investment strategist at Aricapital, told Vedomosti. According to Dmitry Baranov, lead expert at Finam Management, the positive trend stems from low market prices that encourage additional purchases and favorable freight rates. Some importers chose to build coal reserves in advance amid emptying warehouses and expectations of a hotter-than-usual summer, he explained.

Independent industry expert Maxim Khudalov said that the evolution of trading schemes has enabled Russian companies to circumvent sanctions barriers and increase supplies, even though this has reduced export margins. According to the expert, Russia's eastern regions, capable of maintaining exports to China even amid low coal prices, have stronger export prospects.

BRUSSELS, June 18. /TASS/. The EU will not be able to reduce the ceiling on Russian oil prices as US President Donald Trump opposes the initiative, the European edition of Politico reported, citing diplomatic sources.

According to it, the opinion of the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on the issue of restrictions on prices for Russian raw materials is not very important, since without Washington's approval Brussels is unlikely to be able to fully implement these plans.

Earlier, von der Leyen said that the new package of EU sanctions against Russia would include a ban on the use of damaged Nord Stream pipelines, blacklisting banks and tankers, banning EU countries from buying Russian oil, and an attempt to lower the price ceiling from $60 to $45 per barrel. Also, von der Leyen and Kallas promised to impose new export restrictions on 22 companies, not only from Russia, but also from Belarus, China, and other countries, to try to reduce the effectiveness of Russian measures to circumvent sanctions.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, June 18. /TASS/. The Iran-Israel conflict has pushed Ukraine to the sidelines, as US President Donald Trump is more interested in playing his game in the Persian Gulf, Viktor Medvedchuk, head of the Other Ukraine movement and former leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party banned in Ukraine, said.

According to him, Washington is pulling back from pumping Kiev with weapons, as the US sees this as a threat to its own economy. He noted that even Vladimir Zelensky ""has realized that the US's incredible generosity is over.""

""It wasn't hard to predict that the US would abandon Zelensky's Ukraine at the most inconvenient moment for the Kiev regime. The illegitimate can only 'win' on television — and only if opposition media are eliminated. The Iran-Israel war has pushed the Ukrainian conflict into the background,"" Medvedchuk wrote in his opinion piece on the Smotrim.ru website.

He also emphasized that under the new paradigm, the burden of financing the Zelensky regime may fall on the shoulders of the Europeans - but they ""will have to dig deep into their pockets.""

In the politician's opinion, it would be more advantageous for European intelligence services to stage a provocation, although they are clearly late to act.

""Israel is much more successful in drawing the US into its war with Iran,"" he noted.

Medvedchuk added that Trump is more interested in the conflict in the Middle East, as he is forced to ""play by the British rules in Ukraine.""

""The other option is to play his own risky game in the Persian Gulf. So far, Trump is choosing the second scenario,"" he stated.

Medvedchuk also stressed that, against this backdrop, the US leader ""does not want to declare Russia an ‘evil empire,' as he is counting on its mediation in resolving the Iranian issue.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Justice Sonia Sotomayor says decision ‘does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause' and ‘invites legislatures to engage in discrimination'

US supreme court upholds ban on youth gender-affirming care

In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision “does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and “invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight”.

This, she said, “authorizes … untold harm to transgender children”.

This case presents an easy question: whether SB1's ban on certain medications, applicable only if used in a manner ‘inconsistent with … sex', contains a sex classification. Because sex determines access to the covered medications, it clearly does. Yet the majority refuses to call a spade a spade. Instead, it obfuscates a sex classification that is plain on the face of this statute, all to avoid the mere possibility that a different court could strike down SB1, or categorical healthcare bans like it.

The Court's willingness to do so here does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight. It also authorizes, without second thought, untold harm to transgender children and the parents and families who love them. Because there is no constitutional justification for that result, I dissent.

She acknowledged her “sadness” and said the decision “abandons transgender children and their families to political whims”.

[T]he majority subjects a law that plainly discriminates on the basis of sex to mere rational-basis review. By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims. In sadness, I dissent.

The stories about Melissa Hortman keep coming in from her colleagues and friends as they grapple with her murder and prepare to honor her at a vigil tonight.

I just caught up with Zack Stephenson, who met Hortman when he was 18 and volunteered on her campaign and now is a state lawmaker and colleague of hers. Stephenson got to work closely with his longtime mentor and friend in what became the final months of her life - he as co-chair of a House committee that worked on the budget and she as speaker emeritus. He's one of several people I spoke to who called Hortman a mentor.

She was a leader who was not afraid to invest in other leaders. It didn't threaten her.

She talked about running for higher office at times, and Stephenson advocated for her to run for governor someday. But she also had a full life outside the office. In one classic example, Stephenson recalled a staff member who said his parents' gardening business was having trouble finding seasonal help. Hortman, an avid gardener, asked how much the gig paid. “She's like, ‘oh, yeah, great. I could pin my earbuds in, listen to disco music and just garden.' And then she was talking about it for weeks,” he said.

She told Democratic committee chairs at the start of the 2023 session to not mistake kindness for weakness - that they could be kind, respectful and still strong leaders, he said. That was how she operated. “No one worked harder than her,” Stephenson said.

Those kind of timeless values of, be kind to people, work hard, care about the institution more than partisan politics, those things really matter. People saw that.

Hortman's style of politics is one way to address the rise in political violence, Stephenson said. She was a successful negotiator because she actually listened to the other side and tried to find solutions. She stayed respectful, though with some humor and barbs here and there. She was a committed Democrat, but was more interested in good governance than partisan wins.

Clearly, what we need is more of that stuff.

Transatlantic airfares have dropped to rates last seen before the pandemic, data shows, the latest sign that fewer Europeans are traveling to the US amid concerns over US border controls and Donald Trump's policies.

The trend could extend into and beyond the summer holiday period, typically the busiest time for airlines and travel companies.

Overseas arrivals to the United States fell 2.8% in May from a year ago, according to preliminary data from the US National Travel and Tourism Office within the US Department of Commerce. Travel from western Europe fell 4.4% in May, led by a decline in travelers from Denmark and Germany.

Forward bookings suggest sustained declines are on the horizon, with total inbound bookings to the US in July down 13% year-over-year, according to OAG Aviation, an analytics firm.

Transatlantic airfare has been declining since the first quarter when Europeans started reconsidering travel to the US after Trump suggested annexing Greenland, launched a global trade war, and issued orders to tighten border policy. A stronger dollar has also deterred some trips.

I talked with Minnesota's Republican House speaker Lisa Demuth, a colleague and friend of Melissa Hortman's who worked closely with her in a tied state House this year.

Demuth said she learned a ton by watching how Hortman worked, and despite their political differences, they had a mutual respect. She recalled their shared love of Cheetos as a late-night snack during long legislative sessions and said Hortman was always direct, true to her word and looking for creative solutions even in rocky times.

Since Hortman's death by a gunman this weekend, Demuth, who is leading the chamber through this moment, said the body's human resources department is working to get resources to all members of the legislature and staff to make sure they have assistance. For her personally, on the fifth day since the murders, she said she has cried less today.

A vigil is planned for the state capitol this evening. Hortman's family has also put up a GoFundMe to support the Hortmans' two adult children with the costs of their parents' funerals and repairs to the home, cars and garage that were damaged by the shootings. “In the ensuing police response to capture the assassin, their home, garage and cars were severely damaged in a hail of bullets, stun grenades and tear gas canisters,” the fundraiser notes.

People are checking in with each other, Demuth said, and “there's an extra layer of compassion, not dependent on political alignment, but just people are like, how are you doing? And genuinely asking that and pausing for a response.”

In a time of heightened divisiveness, the tragic shootings can give people an opportunity to extend grace to each other regardless of their political disagreements and see each other first as people, she said.

“There are those moments that are fewer now than maybe they were years ago, something that we can recapture, where we can know each other as people,” Demuth said. “And then even when we disagree, it doesn't have to become personal.”

Donald Trump has once again knocked Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell for what he expected would be a decision not to lower interest rates and said the man he put in the role during his last term had done a poor job.

Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, mused about appointing himself to lead the US central bank, based on his dissatisfaction with Powell.

Maybe I should go to the Fed. Am I allowed to appoint myself at the Fed? I'd do a much better job than these people.

Trump has long criticized Powell and sparked market concern earlier this year when he suggested the central bank chief's termination couldn't come fast enough.

Trump has since walked back from that rhetoric, saying he would not fire Powell before his term as chair ends next year, but he has not held back on his broader criticism – he has called Powell a “major loser” – and has made clear that he will not ask Powell to stay on as the central bank's leader.

He told reporters:

What I'm going to do is, you know, he gets out in about nine months, he has to, he gets fortunately terminated ... I would have never reappointed him, Biden reappointed him. I don't know why that is, but I guess maybe he was a Democrat ... he's done a poor job.

The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged today as its policymakers weigh signs of a cooling economy, the risk of higher inflation from US import tariffs, and the escalating crisis in the Middle East.

Trump expressed disappointment in advance of the decision and underscored his belief that the Fed had been too late at cutting rates.

I call him ‘too late Powell' because he's always too late. I mean, if you look at him, every time I did this I was right 100%, he was wrong.

Vinay Prasad, the director of the US Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, has been named as the health regulator's chief medical and science officer, STAT News reports, citing an internal memo.

Prasad will also lead the center that regulates vaccines, and gene therapies. The agency's chief scientist and chief medical officer have typically been two distinct roles. Prasad will now hold three separate jobs at the agency, solidifying his position as a top adviser to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who announced the appointment to the staff, according to the STAT News report.

Pete Hegseth said that he would remove military troops from American cities that Trump deployed to assist federal law enforcement officers if the Defense Department is directed to as a result of a supreme court ruling.

“If the supreme court orders you to remove troops from American cities, will you do so?” asked senator Elizabeth Warren.

“As I've said senator, I don't believe district courts should determine national security policy, but if the supreme court rules on a topic, we will abide by that,” the defense secretary said.

Trump deployed National Guard troops and US Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against the administration's immigration enforcement policies. The move sparked widespread controversy, including among the leaders of the Los Angeles police department and California governor Gavin Newsom.

The US supreme court has ruled against the state of Texas and oil industry interests in their challenge to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) authority to license certain nuclear waste storage facilities.

The 6-3 ruling reversed a lower court's decision declaring a license awarded by the NRC to a company called Interim Storage Partners to operate a nuclear waste storage in western Texas unlawful. The NRC is the federal agency that regulates nuclear energy in the US.

The NRC issued a license in 2021 to Interim Storage Partners, a joint venture of France-based Orano and Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists, to build a nuclear waste storage facility in Andrews County in Texas, near the New Mexico border.

The US government and the company had appealed the decision by the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals that the NRC lacked authority to issue the license based on a law called the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The appeal was brought under Democratic former President Joe Biden and was continued under Republican president Donald Trump.

Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, released a statement following the Supreme court decision upholding the Tennessee ban on youth gender-affirming care. The statement says that the ruling is “yet another example of why governments, politicians, courts, and extremists have no place in the exam room.” It reads:

“We are profoundly disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision to side with the Tennessee legislature's anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.

Gender-affirming care is proven to save lives. Major medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, support gender-affirming medical and psychological care because it saves lives and improves mental well-being. Providers, pediatricians, and specialists have been making thoughtful, evidence-based, and age-appropriate health care decisions with families and transgender patients for decades.

Equal access to health care and bodily autonomy are fundamental human rights for every person, including our transgender children and youth. Instead of protecting young transgender people across the nation, states will now feel emboldened to codify discrimination more broadly in health care. This ruling is yet another example of why governments, politicians, courts, and extremists have no place in the exam room, endangering every transgender person. The consequences of this devastating decision will be felt by anyone who needs gender-affirming care; worse for transgender patients already facing widespread discrimination in hostile states.

The Tennessee Equality Project fought this bill in the 2023 legislative session, then stood up for Tennesseans on the steps of the Supreme Court on December 4th, 2024. We are even more determined in our fight for transgender rights across Tennessee and call on our allies to honor transgender youth by taking actions in state and local government. To our transgender community, we see you, we love you, and we stand with you.”

US senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said today that he has asked the Trump administration to provide all 100 senators a classified briefing on the situation unfolding between Israel and Iran that has resulted in days of the two countries trading missile attacks.

“We've gotten briefings and I have requested that we get an all-senators classified briefing,” Schumer said, adding that he believes it will be granted.

Speaking outside the White House, Donald Trump declined to answer reporters' questions on whether the US was planning to join Israel in launching air strikes on Iran or its nuclear facilities.

He said Iran had “reached out” and “wants to negotiate” but he feels “it's very late to be talking”.

“There's a big difference between now and a week ago,” Trump said. “Nobody knows what I'm going to do.”

Trump said that Iran had proposed to come for talks at the White House. He did not provide details. He described Iran as totally defenceless, with “no air defence whatsoever”.

Meanwhile, defence secretary Pete Hegseth told the Senate armed services committee the US military is “prepared to execute” any decision Trump might make on matters of war and peace, even as he declined to confirm preparations of strike options on Iran.

“If and when those decisions are made, the Department [of Defense] is prepared to execute them,” Hegseth said.

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called the decision part of the Republican “cruel crusade against trans kids” to divert attention away from proposed cuts to Medicaid.

Republicans' cruel crusade against trans kids is all an attempt to divert attention from ripping healthcare away from millions of Americans. We'll keep fighting and we'll keep marching on.

In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision “does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and “invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight”.

This, she said, “authorizes … untold harm to transgender children”.

This case presents an easy question: whether SB1's ban on certain medications, applicable only if used in a manner ‘inconsistent with … sex', contains a sex classification. Because sex determines access to the covered medications, it clearly does. Yet the majority refuses to call a spade a spade. Instead, it obfuscates a sex classification that is plain on the face of this statute, all to avoid the mere possibility that a different court could strike down SB1, or categorical healthcare bans like it.

The Court's willingness to do so here does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight. It also authorizes, without second thought, untold harm to transgender children and the parents and families who love them. Because there is no constitutional justification for that result, I dissent.

She acknowledged her “sadness” and said the decision “abandons transgender children and their families to political whims”.

[T]he majority subjects a law that plainly discriminates on the basis of sex to mere rational-basis review. By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims. In sadness, I dissent.

The supreme court's 6-3 decision is a major blow to the transgender community at a time when the Trump administration has taken steps to roll back gains made in recent years.

The court's majority opinion was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by the other five members of the conservative wing. The three liberal justices dissented.

Roberts wrote:

This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements.

A Tennessee state law banning gender-affirming care for minors can stand, the US supreme court has ruled, a devastating loss for trans rights supporters in a case that could set a precedent for dozens of other lawsuits involving the rights of transgender children.

The justices' 6-3 decision effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by the Trump administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to the one in Tennessee.

The case, United States v Skrmetti, was filed last year by three families of trans children and a provider of gender-affirming care. In oral arguments, the plaintiffs – as well as the US government, then helmed by Joe Biden – argued that Tennessee's law constituted sex-based discrimination and thus violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. Under Tennessee's law, someone assigned female at birth could not be prescribed testosterone, but someone assigned male at birth could receive those drugs.

Tennessee, meanwhile, has argued that the ban is necessary to protect children from what it termed “experimental” medical treatment. During arguments, the conservative justices seemed sympathetic to that concern, although every major medical and mental health organization in the US has found that gender-affirming care can be evidence-based and medically necessary. These groups also oppose political bans on such care.

In recent years, the question of transgender children and their rights has consumed an outsized amount of rightwing political discourse. Since 2021, 26 states have passed bans on gender-affirming care for minors, affecting nearly 40% of trans youth in the US. Twenty-six states have also outlawed trans kids from playing on sports teams that correspond with their gender identity.

Many of these restrictions have been paused by court challenges, but the supreme court's decision could have vast implications for those lawsuits' futures. A study by the Trevor Project, a mental health nonprofit that aims to help LGBTQ+ kids, found that anti-trans laws are linked to a 72% increase of suicide attempts among trans and nonbinary youth.

In a vivid illustration of the enormous schism on the American right over the Iran question, clips from Tucker Carlson's interview yesterday in which he calls out Texas senator Ted Cruz for not knowing basic facts about Iran have gone viral. The full interview will be out today.

Cruz, who has called for regime change in Iran, could not answer basic facts about the country, including its population size and ethnic makeup, spurring a shouting match with Carlson. At one point a fuming Carlson says to Cruz:

You're a senator who's calling for the overthrow of the government and you don't know anything about the country!

The former Fox News host has been highly critical of the prospect of Trump getting involved in Israel's war with Iran for being at odds with his isolationist “America First” approach to foreign policy and his administration's pledge to keep America out of “forever wars” in the Middle East. Trump has responded to his criticisms by repeating his stance that “Iran can't have nuclear weapon”.

Ted Cruz on Iran. Full interview tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/hJNwAHAnxZ

The exchange represents the wider dilemma Trump finds himself in with the issue threatening to split his Maga base, with even Georgia congresswoman and Trump loyalist Marjorie Taylor Greene leaping to Carlson's defence in a major break with the president, saying that anyone who supported intervention in Iran was not “America First”.

Yesterday conservative Republican congressman Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, sided with Democrats to introduce a bill that would block the president from engaging US forces in “unauthorised hostilities” with Iran without congressional approval. “This is not our war,” he said on X.

Trump's former political strategist, Steve Bannon, also argued on Carlson's podcast that allowing the “deep state” to drive the US into a war with Iran would “blow up” the coalition of Trump supporters.

Women across the political spectrum are more concerned about the state of the US economy and inflation under Donald Trump than men are, according to a new exclusive poll for the Guardian.

More Democrats than Republicans are now concerned about the economy following the president's return to power. But pessimism was higher for women even among Republicans and independents, according to a new Harris poll.

Overall, 62% of women and 47% of men said that the economy and inflation is getting worse, a gap of 15 percentage points. The gender gap crossed party lines with both Democratic and Republican women expressing greater concerns about the economy than men.

“Here's what everyone missed: women aren't being pessimistic about the economy – they're being realistic,” said Libby Rodney, chief strategy officer of Harris Poll.

Women are experiencing the sharp edge of inflation on essentials like groceries and childcare in ways that stock portfolios can't capture.

Across questions about their outlook on the state of the economy, most respondents (78%) expressed concerns about the amount of uncertainty, particularly around prices. Yet women appear to be bearing the brunt of Trump's economic policy, particularly around his tariffs.

More women (71%) than men (62%) reported being their household's primary shopper. This difference in household shopping responsibility translates into broader gaps in concern over affordability and prices:

More women said they are very worried about food prices (52% of women compared to 39% of men)

More women said they're spending more time trying to find deals or go to more affordable stores (36% versus 26%)

More women said their financial security is getting worse because of their difficulty in affording essential goods and services (55% versus 46%)

The differences increased when respondents were asked about their comfort in affording their lifestyles in the current economy, including affording a family, a home, life as a single individual, and childcare. Just 27% of women said they felt comfortable affording a family now, compared to 43% of men.

Although confidence in switching jobs was low among all respondents, 34% of men were confident in a job switch compared to 25% of women. Women are also more pessimistic about receiving a meaningful raise this year: 54% of women said they think they'll get a raise, compared to 63% of men.

US Senate Democrats have demanded health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr make public the reviews on which his department said it based its decision to cancel a contract for developing a bird flu vaccine.

Donald Trump's administration last month canceled a $590m contract awarded to Moderna in January by outgoing president Joe Biden's administration for the late-stage development of its bird flu vaccine for humans, as well as the right to purchase shots.

“This is a grievous mistake that threatens to leave the country unprepared for what experts fear might be the next pandemic - and there appears to be no rationale for this decision other than your ill-informed and dangerous war on vaccines,” senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth wrote in a letter seen by Reuters.

The cancellation endangers American lives and will likely contribute to a 20% rise in the price of eggs this year, they wrote to Kennedy, who has a long history of questioning the safety of vaccines contrary to scientific evidence.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services at the time said the contract was canceled after a comprehensive internal review determined the project did not meet the scientific standards or safety expectations required for continued federal investment.

Warren and Duckworth demanded Kennedy make the review public, alongside a similar review the department cited when it cut funding of a $258m program researching an HIV vaccine. They also asked for a detailed description of how the department decided to end the contracts, and a staff briefing.

“You have failed to justify either of these moves to cripple vaccine research,” Warren and Duckworth wrote. “Furthermore, these decisions appear to be part of your larger, unfounded vendetta against mRNA technology.”

Kennedy named eight members last week to serve on a panel of vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including some who have advocated against vaccines, days after abruptly firing all 17 members who had been serving on the independent committee of experts.

Several of his appointees specifically oppose the mRNA vaccine technology used in some of the newest immunizations such as the Covid-19 vaccine, including by Moderna.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Israel-Iran conflict is at a critical juncture as thousands flee Tehran. Plus, Alex Padilla makes speech about being handcuffed

Good morning.

Israel's war on Iran appeared to be approaching a pivotal moment on Tuesday night after five days of bombing and retaliatory Iranian missile strikes, as Donald Trump demanded “unconditional surrender” from Tehran and weighed his military options.

Trump convened a meeting of his national security team in the White House situation room after a day of febrile rhetoric in which the president gave sharply conflicting signals over whether US forces would participate directly in Israel's bombing campaign over Iran.

He told journalists in the morning that he expected the Iranian nuclear program to be “wiped out” long before US intervention would be necessary. Later, he took to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to suggest that the US had Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in its bomb-sights, and could make an imminent decision to take offensive action.

What's the latest in the conflict? Israel's defense forces said they launched a fresh wave of strikes on Tehran in the early hours of Wednesday morning, warning residents in parts of the city to urgently evacuate.

What's the situation on the ground? Some Tehran residents are fleeing the capital, with witnesses citing strong explosions hitting buildings in western and eastern parts of Tehran on Tuesday evening, the Associated Press reports.

Alex Padilla took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to deliver a deeply personal speech, formally entering into the congressional record his account of being restrained and forcibly removed as he attempted to ask a question at a press conference held by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, in Los Angeles last week.

Meanwhile, Brad Lander, New York City's comptroller and a mayoral candidate, was arrested on Tuesday by masked federal agents while visiting an immigration court and accompanying a person out of a courtroom.

What did Padilla say? “If that is what the administration is willing to do to a United States senator for having the [audacity] to simply ask a question, imagine what they'll do to any American who dares to speak up.”

What did Lander's wife say? In a news conference after the arrest, Meg Barnette said she was “extraordinarily proud” of her husband and called the ordeal “shocking and unacceptable.”

A federal appeals court on Tuesday seemed ready to keep Donald Trump in control of California national guard troops after they were deployed following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.

Last week, a district court ordered the US president to return control of the guard to the state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who had opposed their deployment. US district judge Charles Breyer said Trump had deployed the guard illegally and exceeded his authority. But the administration quickly appealed, and a three-judge appellate panel temporarily paused that order.

Tuesday's hearing was about whether the order could take effect while the case makes its way through the courts, including possibly the supreme court.

How unprecedented is this? It's the first time a US president has activated a state national guard without the governor's permission since 1965, and the outcome of the case could have sweeping implications for Trump's power to send soldiers into other US cities.

A volcano in eastern Indonesia has spewed a colossal ash tower into the sky, forcing the cancellation of dozens of flights to and from Bali.

PEN America has condemned the detention and deportation from the US of an Australian writer  as “gravely concerning”. Alistair Kitchen was last week detained at Los Angeles airport before being deported back to Melbourne.

Federal police have formally accused Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro of presiding over an illegal spying network that allegedly snooped on political rivals, journalists and environmentalists.

An analysis published in the journal Heart suggested heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome, 20% higher for stroke, and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Researchers at the University of Toulouse reviewed studies including about 200 million people.

Tinder is trialling a height filter. But what is behind the “6ft fixation” on dating apps, Leah Harper asks, and could it be blocking true connection? “I've worked with couples where there is a significant height difference and it makes no difference to their physical, emotional or sexual compatibility,” says one relationship therapist.

Turning recently closed coalmines into solar energy plants could add almost 300GW of renewable energy by 2030, according to a Global Energy Monitor report. If 312 surface coalmines, closed since 2020, were filled with solar panels and developed into energy plants, the report claims, it could generate enough energy to power Germany.

Regulators say online retailer not doing enough to prevent sale of counterfeit clothes and unsafe children's toys

The European Commission has accused the online retailer AliExpress of a “systemic failure” to prevent the sale of illegal and dangerous goods on its platform, as Brussels steps up its case against the Chinese company.

Issuing formal findings of an investigation launched in March last year, EU regulators said on Wednesday that AliExpress was failing to do enough to prevent the sale of counterfeit clothes and dangerous children's toys, among other items.

The company, which claims 104 million monthly users in the EU, did not devote enough resources to content moderation to take down illegal goods on sale on its platform, regulators said.

An EU official said the company – which is owned by Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce group founded by the Chinese billionaire Jack Ma – had “underestimated the general risk of the sale of illegal products”. The official added: “General measures they have in place to avoid the dissemination of illegal products do not work properly – it shows a systemic failure.”

The European Commission said these were preliminary findings, pending further investigation and responses from AliExpress. If EU officials uphold the verdict, the company can in theory be fined up to 6% of global turnover under the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA).

AliExpress has, however, persuaded EU regulators to close aspects of their investigation, by pledging to take action to tackle “hidden links” that take users to an illegal product via a legitimate one.

The online marketplace promised to develop a system to monitor and detect hidden links to illegal products, such as food supplements and medicines, which have been offered for sale via legitimate items. Such hidden links were also said to have taken children to pornographic material.

AliExpress also promised greater transparency over its advertising systems and availability of its data to researchers, which Brussels said addressed concerns in these areas.

The European Commission described the commitments as “legally binding” and said AliExpress could face fines if it failed to follow through.

The investigation comes under the DSA, which is intended to protect people from online harms such as disinformation, illegal content and dangerous products. The act imposes the strictest requirements on the largest companies with more than 45 million users, including Amazon, Google, Meta and X.

AliExpress said it had “proactively engaged and closely collaborated with the European Commission throughout this process” and would continue to do so.

“The commission has recognised our committed approach to ensure a high level of consumer protection and transparency through the breadth and depth of these voluntary commitments offered and agreed,” it said. “We are confident that a positive and compliant result will be achieved through continuing our mutual dialogue with the commission to address any remaining concerns on the DSA.”

Last year, the UK consumer group Which? found dangerous and illegal children's toys for sale on several websites including AliExpress. The consumer group bought 23 toys from seven platforms and found problems with more than half the items, including toys from AliExpress that broke into small pieces, or had sharp edges that could puncture a small child's skin.

The products were removed from sale after Which? alerted the companies. AliExpress said at the time it was working with regulators to prevent non-compliant products from being sold.

The European Consumer Organisation, whose members include Which?, welcomed Brussels' actions on Wednesday.

“It is now very important that the commission monitors whether the commitments AliExpress has agreed to are respected and if they are not, the commission should take more deterrent action,” the group's director general, Agustín Reyna, said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was detained for several hours on Tuesday after being arrested at an immigration court, the latest politician opposed to US President Donald Trump's immigration raids to get caught up with law enforcement.

Lander, who is among 11 Democratic candidates seeking to replace Mayor Eric Adams, was released after New York Governor Kathy Hochul went to the courthouse. She left the building with Lander and said charges against him had been dropped.

Lander, the city's chief financial officer, said he had been escorting a defendant out of immigration court when he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

He said he was “fine,” only losing a button on his shirt as he was arrested by federal agents.

“The rule of law is not fine and our constitutional democracy is not fine,” Lander said outside the court, adding that families were being separated and immigrants denied due process in Trump's immigration crackdown.

US Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.

“It is wrong that politicians seeking higher office undermine law enforcement safety to get a viral moment. No one is above the law, and if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will face consequences,” she said.

Lander denied that accusation.

“I certainly did not assault an officer,” he said.

A spokesman for the Manhattan US attorney's office said it was investigating Lander's actions at the federal building on Tuesday.

A video posted earlier on Tuesday to Lander's personal X account showed him being placed in handcuffs and led into an elevator by men in plainclothes, backward baseball caps and masks. One man wore a vest that said “police federal agent.”

“It's bullshit,” Hochul said when asked by reporters about the arrest.

“How dare they take an elected official who's been going down there for weeks, to escort people who are afraid to walk into a courthouse in the United States of America,” she said ahead of going to the courthouse.

US Senator Alex Padilla was forced to the ground and handcuffed by security in Los Angeles last week, after trying to ask US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a question about ICE raids that led to mass protests in the city.

Chamorro, who ruled the poor Central American country from 1990 to 1997, “died in peace, surrounded by the affection and love of her children,” said a statement issued by her four children. 
As president, Chamorro ended a civil war that had raged for much of the 1980s as US-backed rebels known as the “Contras” fought the leftist Sandinista government. That conflict made Nicaragua one of

                                        The US and Russia make up about 90 percent of the world stockpile and are adding new versions, while China's nuclear force is steadily rising, SIPRI said                                        Most of the world's nuclear-armed states continued to modernize their arsenals last year, setting the stage for a new nuclear arms race, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said yesterday.
Nuclear powers including the US and Russia — which account for about 90 percent of the world's stockpile — had spent time last year “upgrading existing weapons and adding newer versions,” researchers said.

China tried to mislead foreign governments last year by playing down the importance of a nuclear-capable missile test over the Pacific Ocean, New Zealand diplomats privately warned in documents obtained by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Beijing sent shivers through the South Pacific in September last year, when its elite Chinese People's Liberation Army Rocket Force fired a dummy warhead into the high seas near French Polynesia.

A tranche of classified government briefing notes showed deep concern within the New Zealand government in the wake of the surprise launch, which China shrugged off as “routine.”

It was China's first long-range missile launch over international waters in more than 40 years, the papers confirmed, serving as a blunt reminder of Beijing's potent nuclear-strike capabilities.

“We are concerned that China is characterizing this as a ‘routine test,'” senior diplomats wrote in a memo to New Zealand's foreign affairs minister. “It is not routine: China has not conducted this type of long-range missile test in over 40 years. We do not want to see this test repeated.”

China's military played down the test as a “legitimate and routine arrangement for military training,” while behind the scenes, New Zealand diplomats privately decried China's “mischaracterization.”

“As this is the first time that China has undertaken such an action in the Pacific in several decades, it is a significant and concerning development,” they wrote in one of the briefing documents.

AFP applied to access the heavily redacted documents — written between September and October last year — under New Zealand's Official Information Act. They were classified as “restricted,” which protects government information with diplomatic or national security implications.

China has been seeking to cement its presence in the strategically important South Pacific, showering developing island nations with new hospitals, freshly paved roads and gleaming sports stadiums. Rarely has it so obviously flexed its military might in the region, where the US, Australia and New Zealand have long been the security partners of choice.

“We have again asked China why it conducted the test at this time, and why it chose to terminate the missile test in the South Pacific,” New Zealand diplomats wrote.

The Rocket Force launched the intercontinental ballistic missile with little warning on Sept. 25 last year.

Photos released by China showed a projectile streaking into the sky from a secret location atop a billowing plume of smoke. It appeared to be one of China's advanced Dong Feng-31 missiles, analysts said, a weapon capable of delivering a thermonuclear warhead.

The long-range missile splashed into a patch of ocean long designated a nuclear-free zone under an international treaty. Pacific island nations remain deeply scarred by the nuclear tests that shook the region in the decades following World War II.

“This is the first time that we are aware of a test of a nuclear-capable missile terminating within the zone since its establishment in 1986,” the New Zealand diplomats wrote.

China alerted the US, the UK, France, Australia and New Zealand before the test, but there was only a vague indication of what it would do, a separate batch of Australian government documents showed.

“Beijing advised us of a planned activity the evening prior to the launch, but specific details were not forthcoming,” Australian defense officials wrote in November last year.

However, Pacific island nations were not provided with advance notice of the launch, New Zealand diplomats said.

Following the launch, Japan voiced “serious concern,” Australia said the test risked “destabilizing” the South Pacific and Fiji urged “respect for our region.”

China foreign policy expert Nicholas Khoo said the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test was particularly significant because it took place in the South Pacific.

“Since 1980, China's ICBM tests have taken place within Chinese territory,” he said.

“The test is a reminder to regional states that China is a ‘full spectrum' power that has economic and military power. It is a peer with the US,” he said.

Harvard University researcher Zhang Hui (張會) said it was a forceful reminder of China's nuclear strength.

“The test shows that the Rocket Force has an operational and credible nuclear force that can help ensure China's ability to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent,” he wrote last year for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

“The rare public ICBM test seems to have been specifically aimed at dissuading Washington from using nuclear weapons in a potential conflict across the Taiwan Strait,” he said.

Chamorro, who ruled the poor Central American country from 1990 to 1997, “died in peace, surrounded by the affection and love of her children,” said a statement issued by her four children. 
As president, Chamorro ended a civil war that had raged for much of the 1980s as US-backed rebels known as the “Contras” fought the leftist Sandinista government. That conflict made Nicaragua one of

Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki yesterday erupted again with giant ash and smoke plumes after forcing evacuations of villages and flight cancelations, including to and from the resort island of Bali.

Several eruptions sent ash up to 5km into the sky on Tuesday evening to yesterday afternoon. An eruption on Tuesday afternoon sent thick, gray clouds 10km into the sky that expanded into a mushroom-shaped ash cloud visible as much as 150km kilometers away.

The eruption alert was raised on Tuesday to the highest level and the danger zone where people are recommended to leave was expanded to 8km from the crater.

Officers also evacuated from the Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki monitoring post 7km from the crater to avoid falling gravel released in the eruption. No casualties have been reported.

Ash and debris fell in a number of places outside the danger zone, including the villages of Boru, Hewa and Watobuku. Some residents from Nurabelen village in Ile Bura subdistrict fled to evacuation sites in Konga to avoid the impact of the eruption, the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure said in a statement.

“Some residents have also evacuated to Nileknoheng village, which is 12km from the crater,” agency spokesman Abdul Muhari said.

Dozens of flights were canceled yesterday, including those connecting Bali to cities in Australia, Malaysia, India and China, according to the Web site of Bali's I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport.

Volcanic ash can pose a risk to plane engines.

The cancelations and delays affected thousands of travelers.

Australian carrier Jetstar, which flies daily between the tourist hot spot and several Australian cities, said that the ash cloud was forecast to clear by late yesterday and its services would be rescheduled.

The 1,584m Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki has had several eruptions, and its danger level and no-go zone have changed several times before being raised again to the highest level on Tuesday.

An eruption of the volcano in November last year killed nine people and injured dozens. It also erupted in March.

At least 28 people have been killed and 140 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17.

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported on June 18 that search and rescue operations in the Solomianskyi district lasted more than 39 hours, involving over 400 State Emergency Service rescuers and 200 pieces of equipment.

Initial data from Ukraine's National Police cited 15 dead and 124 injured, but the death toll was revised several times — first down to 10, then up to 16 by the State Emergency Service.

Early on June 18, more victims were found under the rubble of one residential building, raising the number of fatalities to 23. After completing the operation, Klymenko confirmed a total of 28 deaths from the attack.

The almost nine-hour-long strike saw Moscow's forces launch large numbers of kamikaze attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine's capital.

Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported the sounds of drones, missiles, and multiple rounds of explosions throughout the night.

The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia launched 472 aerial weapons overnight, including nearly 280 Shahed-type attack drones and two Kinzhal ballistic missiles. The strike primarily targeted Kyiv.

Ukraine's air defense forces reportedly destroyed 428 air targets, including 239 Shahed drones and 15 Kh-101 cruise missiles. Air defenses also intercepted one Kinzhal missile, while another was reportedly lost from radar tracking.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault ""one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv,"" saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. 

""Such attacks are pure terrorism,"" he said in a statement on social media. ""And the whole world, the U.S., and Europe must finally respond as civilized societies respond to terrorists.""

Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block.

In a video posted on Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said cluster munitions had been found in one area of the city. He later added that June 18 would be an official day of mourning in Kyiv.

Many of the deaths and injuries occurred when a Russian missile hit a nine-storey residential building in the Solomianskyi district, ""completely destroying"" one section, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said.

""I saw the missile because it was low,"" Olena Kushnirova, a 46-year-old  nurse who lives in a neighboring building to the one that was hit, told the Kyiv Independent.

""I grabbed my daughter by the hand and shouted 'run!' It was literally 15 seconds. We ran to the toilet, and then there was a very powerful explosion.""

During the attack on the capital, a 62-year-old U.S. citizen died in the Solomianskyi district in a building across from where medics were assisting the injured, Klitschko reported. Medical personnel confirmed biological death.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a ""massive and brutal strike"" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit.

""Putin does this on purpose... He sends a signal of total disrespect to the United States and other partners who have called for an end to the killing,"" Sybiha said. ""Only strong steps and real pressure on Moscow can prove him wrong.""

A Russian drone also hit a multi-storey building Darnytskyi District.

""At first there was shock,"" Tatiana Bratus, a 50-year-old resident of the building told the Kyiv Independent.

""People started running outside, shouting, some in panic, because the attack wasn't over yet. They said there were still rockets flying. People ran to the bomb shelter.

A kindergarten in the Darnytskyi district was also damaged, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration said. No casualties were reported at the site. 

The upper floors of residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts were also damaged.  

A dormitory at the Kyiv Aviation Institute was hit by drones during the attack, the news outlet Suspilne reported. Drones struck the institute's 10th floor and broke windows on three other floors.

Outside the capital, the attacks also caused damage and injured civilians in Kyiv Oblast towns. At least one woman was injured and multiple homes were damaged, according to the regional administration. 

The Russian strike damaged the production facility of Fahrenheit, a Ukrainian clothing manufacturer that supplies apparel and undergarments for both civilians and the military. The company announced it was forced to cancel all current orders and suspend new ones indefinitely following the destruction of its Kyiv site.

Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) freight train carrying grain. Several railcars overturned, temporarily halting operations and spilling grain from the damaged wagons. Ukrzaliznytsia said the damage would be ""promptly repaired"" and train traffic would not be affected.

Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, reported the destruction of two of its branches in Kyiv during the attack, according to CEO Ihor Smiliansky. The company's team is working to ""quickly restore services,"" he said. 

The attack followed a series of drone strikes overnight on June 16 targeting Kyiv Oblast, including both the capital and surrounding settlements. In the Obukhiv district, a 60-year-old man was injured, according to regional authorities.  

Russian attacks against Ukraine have intensified in May and June, with Moscow launching several record-breaking mass strikes against Kyiv and other cities. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Australia has, for the first time, imposed sanctions on Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet"" of oil tankers, targeting 60 vessels used to circumvent international sanctions and sustain the Kremlin's war effort in Ukraine, the Australian government said on June 18.

The move aligns Canberra with similar measures introduced by the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union. 

Australia's Foreign Ministry said the sanctioned vessels operate under ""deceptive practices, including flag-hopping, disabling tracking systems and operating with inadequate insurance,"" enabling illicit Russian oil trade that undermines international sanctions.

""Russia uses these vessels to circumvent international sanctions and sustain its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine,"" the ministry said in a statement.

With this move, Australia has now sanctioned more than 1,400 Russian individuals and entities since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, the government said.

The step comes amid the continued operation of Russia's shadow fleet. According to a recent study by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), Russia currently operates 435 tankers outside the control of Western regulators to evade sanctions such as the G7-EU price cap on Russian oil. 

These vessels are typically un- or underinsured and pose a rising environmental risk due to their age and operational opacity.

KSE estimates that as of April 2024, 83% of Russia's crude oil and 46% of its petroleum product exports were shipped using shadow fleet tankers. The study warns that this undermines the effectiveness of Western sanctions and increases the likelihood of maritime disasters, as many of these ships fall outside international safety and insurance standards.

The EU formally adopted its 17th sanctions package against Russia in May, sanctioning nearly 200 vessels tied to the shadow fleet. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the new measures also target hybrid threats and human rights violations, with more sanctions under consideration. 

Some EU member states and observers have criticized the package for lacking stronger provisions to disrupt Russia's sanction evasion schemes.

Now, the EU seeks to approve its 18th sanctions package, which will add 77 more shadow fleet vessels to comply with the cap to prevent Russia from circumventing sanctions and propose imposing a ban on imports of petroleum products made from Russian oil.

The United States has signaled reluctance to pursue additional sanctions despite Moscow's continued aggression in Ukraine and rejection of ceasefire proposals supported by Western allies.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

David Rosenberg says fraudsters used his name in a scheme that involved luring victims through professional-looking ads on social media.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

A Bay Street veteran and financial commentator is speaking out after finding himself at the centre of an alleged online “pump and dump” scam that used his identity to defraud some investors out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

David Rosenberg, an economist and founder of Rosenberg Research, said ads appearing on Facebook and Instagram as early as March have promoted a fake investment program falsely listing him as its administrator. 

Since then, he's heard from several individuals who lost money to the scheme, a sum Mr. Rosenberg said he believes exceeds $1-million, though the total amount is unknown. 

“We've been flooded with people coming to us and actually asking, is this for real?” Mr. Rosenberg said.

He said alarm bells rang for him when he received a message in April from a close friend asking how to invest through his new “Wolfpack program.”

“They said to me, ‘Is this something that small fish like us can invest in, or is it just for the big fish?'” Mr. Rosenberg said. 

How underground brokers use their connections inside Meta to profit from hacked accounts

Rosenberg Research offers ETF-based model portfolios that clients can mirror, but the firm doesn't offer any investment programs under that name.

In the weeks that followed, Mr. Rosenberg heard from dozens of friends, acquaintances and strangers who were caught up in what appeared to be a pump-and-dump “pig butchering” scam. 

“It's a very vivid visual for a very devastating kind of victimization,” said Vanessa Iafolla, an anti-fraud consultant based in Halifax.

In these types of scams, victims are typically slowly lured over time, often through social media, and persuaded to invest increasingly larger sums through some form of misrepresentation. 

“You're getting this person to trust you,” she said. 

Syed Hasan said he fell prey to the scam in April after stumbling on a Facebook ad for a program that recommended stocks that promised quick returns of 30 to 70 per cent. 

After being added to a WhatsApp group called (03) Rosenberg Investment Strategy, which appeared to include dozens of other investors, Mr. Hasan was recommended to trade in specific stocks. 

The first stock he was pushed to buy had a recommended buy price of $2.91. After investing a small amount in the stock, it skyrocketed to $10 a month later – a 300-per-cent return, which gained his trust.

“You get greedy and think these guys know what they're doing,” he said in an interview.

Emboldened by the first win, Mr. Hasan said he invested in another stock recommended by an administrator of the group pretending to be David Rosenberg. It plummeted from $1.27 to 20 cents during the first 15 minutes of trading hours, resulting in an 80-per-cent loss. 

The first stock that they recommended also tanked 80 per cent at the same time. In total, Mr. Hasan estimated losing $16,000 over the course of the scam. 

Mr. Rosenberg says he and his family tried unsuccessfully to stop the fraud by reporting it to authorities, including the local police and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

While significant, it was still less than other alleged victims who spoke with The Globe. One investor said she lost half a million dollars in just one week after clicking on an ad on Facebook and joining the WhatsApp group. 

Another victim alleged that he lost his life savings of $450,000 after falling for the scam. “At nearly 60 there will be no way to recover from this,” he wrote in an e-mail to Rosenberg Research. 

The Globe is not identifying the alleged victims as they expressed concerns for their safety or professional reputation. 

Mr. Rosenberg said all the investors were lured in by professional-looking ads posted to social media, which then redirected them to a WhatsApp group. 

“They start by doing a proof of concept,” said Jacob Rosenberg, executive vice-president of client relations and operations at Rosenberg Research and Mr. Rosenberg's son.

The scammers presented obscure securities that swung dramatically in price, creating an illusion of quick profits, he said. Once investors handed over money and saw a positive return, they were lured into sending more, Jacob Rosenberg claims.

For the past two months he has been fielding calls and messages from people reporting major losses. “I would be absolutely shocked if this isn't in the millions,” he said. 

Efforts by Mr. Rosenberg and his family to report the fraud to authorities, including local police and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, largely went nowhere, he said. “It was a shrug of the shoulders.” Mr. Rosenberg added that the response prompted him to go public. 

But although investors reported their experiences to Mr. Rosenberg, they have not filed complaints with the police. Det. David Coffey from the Toronto police financial crimes unit said that law enforcement officials need victims to come forward in order to investigate. “We haven't had any victims report it,” he said.

Perpetrators behind these types of scams are often located outside the country and tracing a notoriously “murky” crime requires a wider effort involving telecom and social media companies, Det. Coffey said. 

“Investment fraud, it's the most prominent, most financially damaging, most profitable fraud,” he said. “There is a lot of money to be made, they're making billions and billions.”

Investment scams in Canada were responsible for about $311-million in reported losses in 2024, and 3,866 reported victims, up 6 per cent from the previous year, according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. The agency estimates that 90 to 95 per cent of fraud goes unreported.

President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday and speculated about appointing himself to lead the U.S. central bank.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday knocked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for what he expected would be a decision not to lower interest rates and said the man he put in the role during his last term had done a poor job.

Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, mused about appointing himself to lead the U.S. central bank, based on his dissatisfaction with Powell.

“Maybe I should go to the Fed,” Trump said. “Am I allowed to appoint myself at the Fed? I'd do a much better job than these people.”

Tariff threats put the Federal Reserve in ‘uncomfortable purgatory'

Trump has long criticized Powell and sparked market concern earlier this year when he suggested the central bank chief's termination couldn't come fast enough. Trump has since walked back from that rhetoric, saying he would not fire Powell before his term as chair ends next year, but he has not held back on his broader criticism and has made clear that he will not ask Powell to stay on as the central bank's leader.

“What I'm going to do is, you know, he gets out in about nine months, he has to, he gets fortunately terminated ... I would have never reappointed him, [President Joe] Biden reappointed him. I don't know why that is, but I guess maybe he was a Democrat ... he's done a poor job,” Trump said.

The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday as its policy makers weigh signs of a cooling economy, the risk of higher inflation from U.S. import tariffs, and the escalating crisis in the Middle East.

Trump expressed disappointment in advance of the decision and underscored his belief that the Fed had been too late at cutting rates.

“I call him 'too late Powell' because he's always too late. I mean, if you look at him, every time I did this I was right 100 per cent, he was wrong,” Trump said.

Two oil tankers collided in the Strait of Hormuz, an important shipping gateway in the Gulf of Oman. British maritime security firm Ambrey said  the incident wasn't security related.

The crew from an oil tanker was rescued on Tuesday following a collision involving two such vessels near the Strait of Hormuz.

The United Arab Emirates National Guard said the evacuation took place on Tuesday after the crude oil tanker, Adalynn, struck another ship — understood to be the Front Eagle oil tanker — managed by the Anglo Eastern shipping firm which is headquartered in Hong Kong.

The Adalynn was bound for Egypt's Suez Canal at the time of the incident in the Gulf of Oman.

""The ship's crew was evacuated from the incident site, located 24 nautical miles off the country's coast, to the Port of Khor Fakkan using search and rescue boats,"" the Emirati National Guard said in a post on X. 

British maritime security firm Ambrey said the cause of an incident, 22 nautical miles east of Khor Fakkan, was not security-related.

Shipping company Frontline said its oil tanker Front Eagle had been involved in a collision and described the event as a navigational incident that was not related to the ongoing regional conflict between Israel and Iran.

""Following the incident immediate action was taken to extinguish a fire on deck of the Front Eagle. We are aware of reports of a fire onboard the Adalynn following the collision,""  a Frontline statement said.

The company went on to say that it was ""closely monitoring the situation and is cooperating fully with the relevant authorities as emergency response efforts continue.""

The strait is a vital maritime entry point to the Persian Gulf, accounting for the passage of around a fifth of the world's oil, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

Since the escalation in hostilities between Israel and Iran, there has been growing concern the waterway could be blocked.

On Friday, the Financial Times reported that Frontline would turn down new contracts to sail into the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz due to the deteriorating situation in the region.

Honda says growing expectations of a ""data system in outer space"" are going to increase the demand for rockets to launch satellites. So, the Japanese automaker quietly built one and tested it successfully.

Japan's second-largest carmaker, Honda, has successfully tested an experimental reusable space rocket on the nothern Japanese island of Hokkaido, the company said in a surprise announcement.

""The test was completed successfully, the first time Honda landed a rocket after reaching an altitude of nearly 300 meters (1,000 feet),"" the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

The carmaker aims to achieve suborbital space flight in 2029. In 2021, Honda said it was studying space technologies such as reusable rockets but made no announcements prior to Tuesday's test.

""Honda has chosen to take on the technological challenge of developing reusable rockets by utilizing Honda technologies amassed in the development of various products and automated driving systems,"" it said.

The company said it has made no decisions regarding the commercialization of this technology but that it has ""the potential to contribute more to people's daily lives by launching satellites with its own rockets, that could lead to various services that are also compatible with other Honda business.""

It added that growing expectations for a ""data system in outer space"" will likely increase the demand for satellite launch rockets in coming years. 

NASA was the first to successfully test a reusable spacecraft with the Space Shuttle beginning in the 1980s. The booster rockets could be salvaged from the ocean and refurbished, while the Shuttle itself was designed to land like an airplane.

More recently, Elon Musk's SpaceX which is known for commercializing reusable rockets that land safely back on Earth. This has been used to establish the global satellite internet network Starlink.

Japan's space agency JAXA is also on a mission to become a major player in satellite launches. Japan's government has set up a multibillion-dollar space venture fund to subsidize private rockets, encouraging several Japanese startups to work on the reusable technology.

Meanwhile Honda's rival Toyota, which is the world's biggest automaker by sales, announced its investment in Japan's rocket maker Interstellar technologies, earlier this year.

This is the first time India's Prime Minister Modi has brought up the highly contentious issue directly with US President Donald Trump. Their phone call lasted longer than half an hour, according to India's government.

India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, told US President Donald Trump in a phone call that May's ceasefire between India and Pakistan was achieved through direct talks between the militaries and not with US mediation.

That's according to leading Indian diplomat Vikram Misri, who released a video statement after the phone call on Wednesday.

The call was the first conversation between the two leaders since April 22, when Trump called Modi to express condolences for the 26 civilians killed in the Pahalgam attack in Indian-Administered Kashmir, the Foreign Secretary said.

""PM Modi told President Trump, in clear terms, that there was no talk of an India-US trade deal or any US mediation at any point during the time frame between the April 22 attack and the ceasefire on May 10. Ceasefire talks took place directly between the militaries of India and Pakistan, through their existing channels. That too, at the request of Pakistan,"" Misri said in the statement.

""PM Modi strongly emphasized that India has never accepted third-party mediation and nor will it in the future.""

As for Trump's response, the diplomat said the US President ""understood"" the points put forward by Modi during the 35-minute conversation and extended his support to counter terrorism. He did not give further details about what Trump said.

Last month, Trump said the nuclear-armed neighbors had agreed to a ceasefire after a four-day conflict after talks mediated by the US.

Since then, he has claimed several times that the hostilities ceased after he urged the leaders to focus on a trade deal with the US.

Trump's claims were vehemently denied by India, which maintains a no-interference policy in all matters concerning the disputed region of Kashmir.

Meanwhile, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for his ""pathbreaking leadership and commitment to global peace"". He said the ceasefire was agreed upon after thePakistani military responded to a call from the Indian military.

The somewhat contradictory narratives not only caused confusion, but have also been a point of anger among Indians in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack. 

As per Misri's statement, Modi told Trump that India now considers cross-border terrorism as an act of war, not as a proxy war. The prime minister added that the operation against terrorists was still ongoing.

Trump reportedly asked if Modi would stop by Washington after his trip to the G7 summit in Canada. The two leaders were set to meet on the final day of the summit, but the meeting was canceled after Trump left early due to tensions in the Middle East.

Modi declined the invitation as he is due in Croatia for the third leg of a European diplomatic outreach. The two leaders agreed to meet in person, soon, Misri said.

TV chef Anne Burrell, the platinum blonde star of Worst Cooks in America, died Tuesday at her New York home. She was 55.

The Food Network, where Burrell began her two-decade television career on Iron Chef America and went on to other shows, confirmed her death. The cause was not immediately clear, and medical examiners were set to conduct an autopsy.

Police were called to her address before 8am Tuesday and found an unresponsive woman who was soon pronounced dead. Officers did not release the woman's name but records show it was Burrell's address.

She was on TV as recently as April, making chicken Milanese cutlets topped with escarole salad in one of her many appearances on NBC's Today show. Burrell also faced off against other top chefs on the Food Network's House of Knives earlier in the spring.

“Anne was a remarkable person and culinary talent — teaching, competing and always sharing the importance of food in her life and the joy that a delicious meal can bring,” the network said in a statement.

Known for her bold and flavourful but not overly fancy dishes, and for her spiky platinum-blonde hairdo, Burrell and various co-hosts on Worst Cooks in America led teams of kitchen-challenged people through a crash course in self-improvement.

On the first show in 2010, contestants presented such unlikely personal specialties as cayenne pepper and peanut butter on cod, and penne pasta with sauce, cheese, olives and pineapple.

The accomplished chefs had to taste the dishes to evaluate them, and it was torturous, Burrell confessed in an interview with The Tampa Tribune at the time.

Still, Burrell persisted through 27 seasons, making her last appearance in 2024.

“If people want to learn, I absolutely love to teach them,” she said on ABC's Good Morning America in 2020. “It's just them breaking bad habits and getting out of their own way.”

Burrell was born Sept. 21, 1969, in the central New York town of Cazenovia, where her parents ran a flower store. She earned an English and communications degree from Canisius University and went on to a job as a headhunter but hated it, she said in a 2008 interview with The Post-Standard of Syracuse.

Having always loved cooking, she soon enrolled in the Culinary Institute of America, for which she later taught. She graduated in 1996, spent a year at an Italian culinary school and then worked in upscale New York City restaurants for a time.

“Anytime Anne Burrell gets near hot oil, I want to be around,” Frank Bruni, then-food critic at the New York Times, enthused in a 2007 review.

By the next year, Burrell was hosting her own Food Network show, Secrets of a Restaurant Chef, and her TV work became a focus. Over the years she also wrote two cookbooks, Cook Like a Rock Star and Own Your Kitchen: Recipes to Inspire and Empower, and was involved with food pantries, juvenile diabetes awareness campaigns and other charities.

Burrell's own tastes, she said, ran simple. She told The Post-Standard her favourite food was bacon and her favourite meal was her mother's tuna fish sandwich.

“Cooking is fun,” she said. “It doesn't have to be scary. It's creating something nurturing.”

Survivors include her husband, Stuart Claxton, whom she married in 2021, and his son, her mother and her two siblings.

“Anne's light radiated far beyond those she knew, touching millions across the world,” the family said in a statement released by the Food Network.

Even in cities where police decline to work with ICE, local law enforcement still bolster the deportation machine.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

This story was co-published and supported by the journalism nonprofit the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.

In the last week, local police have played a central role in enabling the arrests and detention of immigrants, suppressing protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and defending federal detention facilities at the front lines in several major cities, including Omaha, Nebraska; Los Angeles, California; and New York City.

While many mayors of major U.S. cities claim to oppose ICE actions — and have even implemented formal “sanctuary city” policies — local police often act as a “force multiplier” for ICE, even when they aren't directly involved in detaining migrants themselves. That is, even in sanctuary cities that claim to support their immigrant residents and restrict collaboration between ICE and local police, the police are essential to ICE's success.

The roots of this seeming contradiction can be found in the decision of these mayors to rely on local police to criminalize anything they deem disorderly, with devastating consequences for our poorest communities and the right to protest.

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

On May 28, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) violently arrested two dozen people for demonstrating against ICE detentions during immigration court proceedings in Manhattan. The protests were motivated in part by the detention of a Venezuelan high school student the previous week during his scheduled visit to immigration court. We have seen this pattern of courthouse arrests — in which immigrants are following the directives of the Department of Homeland Security — increasing all over the country, further fomenting distrust among migrants in the immigration system.

On June 7, several hundred demonstrators attempted to block ICE agents from exiting the Federal Building in Lower Manhattan. It was the NYPD, not federal police, who attacked the protesters, making nine arrests.

On June 9, it was Dallas police that violently dispersed a protest, forcing people out of the roadway using batons and pepper spray.

On June 10, it was Philadelphia police who broke up a peaceful protest that was blocking traffic, making 15 arrests and causing more than a dozen injuries.

And these are just the cases that were reported by national media. Every day, in communities throughout the U.S., local police enable the arrest, detention, and deportation of immigrants, often by entering them into the “traffic stop-to-deportation pipeline” or by collaborating with ICE on immigration home raids.

Many “sanctuary cities” have policies prohibiting police from directly assisting ICE. Some of these policies instruct police not to ask about immigration status when they interact with the public during traffic stops or taking a crime report. Sanctuary cities attempt to reassure immigrant residents that local police are not a part of what historian Adam Goodman calls “the deportation machine” in hopes that members of the community will come to police in a time of crisis, send their children to school, and access essential services like hospitals without fear of being asked about their immigration status.

But even in these cities, we see police departments acting as force multipliers for ICE. In a recent multiagency federal enforcement action in Minneapolis, local police were seen engaging in traffic enforcement and crowd control following arrests by ICE, FBI, and other agencies at a local restaurant. Local officials attempted to reassure the public that local police were not coordinating their actions with ICE or other federal agencies, and that their role was strictly to “maintain public safety” during the ICE actions. When ICE removed more than 70 workers from a meatpacking plant last week, the Omaha Police Department (OPD) claimed to play only a peripheral role, directing traffic and “maintain[ing] safety,” and emphasized that the community could continue trusting the OPD. These statements from police — of being completely uninvolved in immigration enforcement yet directing traffic and managing crowds around it — are not new; they can be seen both now and in 2018, when the Trump administration resumed worksite raids. For example, when ICE detained 146 workers during a raid on Fresh Mark in Salem, Ohio, in 2018, the Salem police chief said that officers were on the scene to direct the flow of traffic and help identify the children of those detained.

This indirect assistance is still assistance. As Peter Mancina documents in his forthcoming book, On the Side of ICE: Policing Immigrants in a Sanctuary State, this assistance frees ICE resources that would otherwise be used to manage crowds. In addition, “crowd control” is often simply the management of those protesting ICE arrests. Local police assist ICE in these instances by keeping people concerned about the arrests of immigrants away from ICE officers and preventing them from directly interfering or documenting what is happening. In this way, local police are facilitating ICE's raids.

When resistance becomes more active, as we have seen in the last week in New York City and Los Angeles, local police are tasked with the suppression of that resistance, both when directly protesting ICE's presence and later when disrupting the larger deportation machine. For example, police clashed with protesters attempting to prevent ICE vans from driving away from a courthouse in Seattle. During last weekend's protests, it was Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers using projectile weapons and tear gas to disperse protesters, and it was NYPD officers who arrested 80 people outside the Federal Building in New York on June 11.

In Los Angeles, there were well-documented incidents of LAPD officers intentionally firing projectile weapons at reporters, legal observers, and lawyers. In one incident, a video shows an LAPD officer turn toward Australian TV reporter Lauren Tomasi, take aim, and directly fire at her, even though she was away from the protesters and had not been given any warning to disperse — a direct violation of LAPD policy on the use of projectile weapons.

In another incident, an LAPD officer fired projectile rounds at several peaceful demonstrators, hitting one of them in the groin. When well-known civil rights attorney Shakeer Rahman attempted to obtain the badge number of the officer, he too was shot, despite being separated from the officer by a glass barrier. The officer had removed his badge number from his helmet and justified the shooting by saying that Rahman was “taking up his focus.” In 2024, the City of Los Angeles paid out $1.5 million in damages for shooting someone in the groin with a projectile weapon, implying a violation of LAPD policy.

On June 7, longtime photojournalist Nick Stern was shot with a projectile weapon by an LA County Sheriff's Deputy. The projectile lodged in his leg, causing extensive damage and requiring surgery. A spokesman for the National Press Club asserted that journalists were intentionally targeted and called on the LAPD to respect the rights of journalists to cover protests.

During the June 8 anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, a local LAPD helicopter buzzed over a demonstration, announcing, “I have all of you on camera. I'm going to come to your house.” This act of taunting demonstrators suggests a mindset among police that meshes with the imperatives set out by political leaders: The job of the LAPD is not to facilitate peaceful protest or protect immigrant communities from unlawful ICE actions. Instead, the police exist to suppress “disorder” in its many forms, including protest activity. The LAPD, and police more broadly, have come to see protests as inherently disorderly and therefore, inherently undesirable. And the journalists who cover those protests and the lawyers who defend the demonstrators are considered legitimate targets because of their role in facilitating, and at times legitimizing, this disorderly dissent.

If cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis assert that they don't cooperate with ICE, then why do we see a massive outpouring of local police resources to assist their raids indirectly and directly suppress protests? One part of the answer is that local officials have come to rely on their police for order maintenance, a central feature of urban policing directed at a range of “quality of life issues” tied to growing inequality and social exclusion.

Austerity policies at the local level have exacerbated social insecurities that are being systematically labeled “problems of disorder” to be managed by ever-more intensive and invasive policing. And when people on the losing end of these arrangements protest, their acts of dissent are met with increasingly militarized local policing. The widespread and indiscriminate criminalization of homelessness, mental illness, and poor youth of color have set the stage for a politics of order maintenance that relies on the mobilization of police violence to manage the failures of local economic policies to provide broad prosperity.

Every disruptive behavior has become framed as an outrage to be managed by ever more police enforcement. This intolerance and criminalization of disorder has spilled over into the policing of protests as well. Massive sums have been poured into beefing up protest units such as the NYPD's Strategic Response Group and L.A.'s Metro Division so that they can more effectively suppress disorderly political behavior.

After witnessing the protests in Los Angeles, New York City Mayor Eric Adams sought to instill fear among potential demonstrators: “I understand that some New Yorkers may be angry, afraid and ready to express that. New York City will always be a place to peacefully protest, but we will not allow violence and lawlessness,” he stated.

These views were echoed by NYPD Police Commissioner Jessica S. Tisch, who said:

We have no tolerance for violence, none. We have no tolerance for property damage. We have no tolerance for people blocking entrances to buildings or blocking driveways or blocking cars from moving. Any attacks against law enforcement will be met with a swift and decisive response from the NYPD. We are responsible for public safety and maintaining order in this city and we will never abdicate that responsibility.

It was Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass who ordered a nighttime curfew for the city's downtown, not federal officials. The curfew played into the hands of federal officials who were attempting to depict Los Angeles as out of control and in need of federal troops to restore order.

For these big city mayors, the suppression of disorderly protest is much more important than defending the well-being of immigrant communities or the right to protest. Using police to violently suppress protests in order to keep traffic moving is a political decision rooted not in public safety but in a profound intolerance of disorder. As long as we continue to allow these mayors to pander to fears of disorder by further empowering policing, we are enabling the deportation machine and the broader Trump agenda.

The Trump administration is attempting to make good on its promise of mass deportation. Police departments — many of which claim not to collaborate with ICE — are essential cogs in this deportation machine, spending resources to control both traffic and public dissent.

A spokesperson for Walz said the governor “wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans.”

President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday that he wouldn't call Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) following a series of shootings targeting Democratic lawmakers in the state.

Trump's comments — riddled with insults directed at Walz, who ran as vice president on the Democratic Party's presidential ticket last fall — represent a stark departure from presidential norms, as presidents typically disregard partisanship and reach out to state or local leaders to express their condolences or offer assistance after tragedies.

On Saturday, an individual named Vance Boelter impersonated a police officer and appeared at the homes of two lawmakers from the state's Democratic-Farm-Labor Party. He shot and killed Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman (D) and her husband; he also shot State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, who are expected to survive their injuries.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

According to a manifesto discovered by authorities, Boelter had a “hit list” of several other Democratic lawmakers he intended to assassinate. Police captured him on Sunday. 

Trump was blunt in his message to media following the shooting, saying he saw no reason to call the Minnesota governor.

“Why would I call him? I could call and say, ‘Hi, how you doing?' The guy doesn't have a clue,” Trump claimed, mocking Walz just days after the shootings took place. “He's a mess. So I could be nice and call, but why waste time?”

The blatant disregard for the governor of a state that is dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic and emotional tragedy has drawn criticism, including from members of Trump's own party.

“People have lost their lives, you make the call, you show the empathy,” former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) said in response to Trump's words. 

Walz has largely avoided commenting on the president's insults, though he has expressed disappointment through a spokesperson over the matter.

“Governor Walz wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans, but this tragedy isn't about Trump or Walz,” said the governor's spokesperson, Teddy Tschann. “It's about the Hortman family, the Hoffman family, and the State of Minnesota, and the Governor remains focused on helping all three heal.”

In a Minnesota Public Radio interview on Monday, before Trump publicly mocked Walz, the governor said he wasn't surprised that the president hadn't contacted him after the tragedy.

“I think I understand where that's at,” Walz said at the time.

While it is widely known that American progressives overwhelmingly oppose the war on Iran at which President Donald Trump is increasingly hinting, new polling published Tuesday revealed that a thin majority of respondents who voted for the Republican president are also against U.S. involvement in the widening Israel-Iran war.

According to the Economist/YouGov survey of 1,512 U.S. adults conducted between June 13-16, 60% of all respondents oppose U.S. involvement in the war, while just 16% supported military action and 24% were unsure. Among those who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris for president last year, 71% opposed war on Iran.

So did 53% of Trump voters. In fact, a majority of respondents across all gender, race, age, and income categories opposed military action against Iran.

The survey also found that more Republican-identified respondents supported U.S. negotiations with Iran than did Democrats, 61% to 58%. Fifty-six percent of all those surveyed back talks, while 18% oppose negotiations.

Reflecting disenchantment among people who voted for Trump because they believed his claim to be a “peace president,” Trump's favorite pollster, Rich Baris, director of Big Data Poll — who calls neoconservative Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) “war whores” — warned of dire electoral consequences should the U.S. go to war.

Kiss the Republican majority goodbye…For the next decade.If he pulls the trigger, it's all over for MAGA.

The National Iranian American Council also partnered with YouGov to ask 585 Iranian Americans how they feel about a possible U.S. war on Iran. Fifty-three percent of overall respondents said they “strongly” or “somewhat oppose” such action, while 36% strongly or somewhat back war. Strong opposition — 37% — was 20 points higher than strong support for an attack on Iran.

The poll also found that a strong majority of Iranian Americans want a new nuclear agreement that prevents Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The Trump administration — which, like multiple preceding ones concluded that Tehran is not seeking nukes — unilaterally withdrew from the landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, in 2018.

While there were hopes of a renewed deal during the tenure of former U.S. President Joe Biden, no agreement was reached, and Iranians continue to suffer under economic sanctions that critics have said are killing people and crippling the country's economy.

“We expect that Israel's military operations have only tilted opinion further against war in recent days,” NIAC president Jamal Abdi said in a statement. “Regardless, these results reinforce what we already know — our community is overwhelmingly against war and demands a foreign policy rooted in diplomacy, not destruction. We will share additional results from this timely survey next week.”

Trump, who has been threatening to attack Iran since his first term, earlier this year sent a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei in which he claims to have written, “I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing.”

“If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump said during a March NBC News interview.

A poll commissioned by Demand Progress and conducted by the Bullfinch Group recently found that 53% of registered voters — including 58% of Democrats, 47% of Independents, and 56% of Republicans — want Trump to “obtain congressional authorization before striking targets in other countries.”

Legislation that would compel Trump to get congressional approval to attack Iran under the War Powers Resolution of 1973 was introduced Tuesday by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and co-sponsored by at least 14 mostly progressive Democrats, while Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have introduced similar measures in the Senate.

On June 12, Israel unleashed a series of strikes that damaged Iranian nuclear facilities and missile sites, destroyed gas depots, and, critically, killed scores of top regime officials. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei remains alive. But his most important deputies—including Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of the armed forces, and Hossein Salami, the commander in chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—are dead.

A few years ago, the sudden, near-simultaneous killing of Bagheri, Salami, and a host of other senior leaders would have been unthinkable. Over three decades, the hard-liners who control Iran's regime had built up what seemed like a formidable system of deterrence. They stockpiled ballistic missiles. They developed and advanced a nuclear enrichment program. Most important, they established a network of foreign proxies that could routinely harass Israeli and U.S. forces.

But Iran's hard-liners overplayed their hand. After Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, the regime's leaders opted for a campaign of maximum aggression. Rather than letting Hamas and Israel fight it out, they unleashed their proxies at Israeli targets. Israel, in turn, was compelled to expand its offensive beyond Gaza. It succeeded in severely degrading Hezbollah, the most powerful of Tehran's proxy groups, and eviscerating Iranian positions in Syria—indirectly contributing to the collapse of the Assad regime. Iran responded to this aggression by unleashing the two largest ballistic missile attacks ever launched against Israel. But Israel, backed by the U.S. military and other partners, repelled those attacks and incurred little damage. It then struck back.

With that, the foundation of Iran's deterrence strategy crumbled. Its ruling regime became more vulnerable and exposed than at any point since the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. And Israel, which has dreamed of striking Iran for decades, had an opportunity it decided it could not pass up.

Since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, leaders in Tehran have cultivated a web of proxies—Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and militias in Iraq—and developed ties with the Assad regime in Syria. These regional alliances, paired with Tehran's robust ballistic missile program, allowed Iran to threaten adversaries directly and from afar, giving hard-liners core sources of power. The country's leadership wasn't immune to pressure: it pursued nuclear negotiations with the United States in 2015, for example, to help alleviate the economic pain created by sanctions. But even these talks facilitated Iran's rise as a regional power. The resulting Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action provided Tehran with extensive sanctions relief without limits on its defense, other than temporary guardrails on enrichment. In 2018, the United States withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed sanctions. But Iran's consequent nuclear provocations served as a lightning rod to absorb outside pressure and insulate the regime's other malign behavior.

In October 2023, the Islamic Republic was peaking. It exerted heavy influence over a wide swath of land, from Iraq to the Mediterranean. It had bullied neighboring Arab rivals, namely Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, into submission. And Iranian proxies, armed with rockets, missiles, and drones, were keeping constant pressure on Israel.



The October 7 attacks seemed, at first, to only further empower Iran. After all, Tehran's primary regional adversary was suddenly enmeshed in an all-consuming conflict. Iran thus encouraged its proxies to join the fight against Israel, creating a united, regionwide front under Tehran's leadership. Hezbollah's persistent rocket fire into northern Israel forced civilians there to flee the towns near the border with Lebanon. In Yemen, the Houthis expanded their attacks to commercial shipping in the Red Sea, putting a severe strain on global commerce and compelling the United States to concentrate significant naval power and resources on countering their aggression. By mid-2024, Iran and its proxies were seriously testing the U.S.-led regional order.

Yet within a few short months, Iran's regional framework all but collapsed. Israeli military offensives eviscerated Hamas in Gaza and devastated Hezbollah in Lebanon—key nodes in Iran's decades-long pressure campaign against Israel. Then came the surprising fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, in December. Syria had been vital to Iran's larger deterrence architecture not only because it presented another front against Israel but also because Syrian territory—which shares a long border with Lebanon and northern Israel—contained the main route through which Iran supplied weapons to Hezbollah and to Palestinian militants in the West Bank.

In the face of these setbacks, Iran could have opted to regroup. Instead, it opted to escalate the conflict with Israel by directly striking the country in April and October 2024. By taking such action, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had hoped to showcase its military might and reestablish deterrence. Instead, the IRGC exposed the limitations of its missile capabilities. Even though the April and October strikes were the largest-ever ballistic missile attacks against Israel, Israel's vaunted air defenses, combined with those of the United States and its regional partners, intercepted almost all of Iran's drones and missiles. The small handful that did strike Israeli territory either missed their targets or did insignificant damage.

The attacks exposed Iran as weak. They also prompted Israel to hit back against Iran directly, using its superior airpower to destroy key Iranian air defense batteries and military facilities in October, shattering the final barrier that had previously prevented Tehran's adversaries from using military force against its territory. Iranian deterrence collapsed.

Despite the setbacks the Iranian regime had suffered, its leadership and military commanders were far from admitting defeat at the beginning of 2025. In a March 2025 speech, Salami rejected the idea that Iran had lost its competitive edge, touting the Islamic Republic's very survival as proof of the effectiveness of its grand strategy. The regime, after all, had been at war not with small powers but with large ones that had the most advanced weapons, equipment, and militaries. “It is miraculous that our nation has been able to stand up to arrogant powers,” Salami said. He struck a similar tone in a May speech, stating, “A nation [that] is not captive, a nation [that] raises the banner of resistance and acts on the words of its supreme leader with all its heart, such a nation will never be defeated.”

Now, of course, Salami is dead, and it is harder than ever for Iran to claim it has won its engagements. In just a few days, Israel has done significant damage to Tehran's military and nuclear program. Although the true scale of the destruction is known only to Iranian leaders, it is unlikely that the country will easily rebound from this low ebb. Perhaps most significant, Iran has lost nearly all of its ability to defend its skies from adversaries. Its once hailed air defenses have been destroyed or made inoperable across most of the country. Its missile stockpiles have been depleted, many of its mobile launchers have been destroyed, and the facilities it used to manufacture missiles and process their fuel lie mostly in smoldering ruins. Finally, much of Iran's nuclear enrichment program has been damaged or destroyed. Iran may still possess a stockpile of highly enriched uranium and some underground cascades of centrifuges. But in the near term, nuclear enrichment no longer provides deterrent value.

Added to this is the loss of the defense establishment's brain trust. The assassinations of numerous veteran commanders and military officials, including General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the IRGC's Aerospace Force and the architect of its missile strategy, will leave a gaping hole in the regime and erase knowledge built on decades of experience. The regime has already replaced these commanders, but what cannot be duplicated so quickly is the trust that their predecessors had earned from Khamenei, the commander in chief, and the influence that they held over the regime's grand strategy.



Faced with such a defeat, the regime could accept defeat, cut its losses, and seek compromise with Israel and the United States. That path, at the very least, would require the regime to abandon enrichment. It could also mean that Tehran has to give up its missile program, end support to proxies, and renounce its goal of destroying Israel. But as much as the Iranian people would prefer this outcome, for the regime it would be tantamount to total surrender, viewed as a solution that would portend the eventual collapse of Iran's ruling theocratic system.

To avoid a total surrender, Khamenei could also keep the fight going. That might include going for a nuclear breakout. Assuming Iran still possesses its stockpile of highly enriched uranium and retains the know-how, the regime could still try to test a nuclear device, hoping that becoming a nuclear state will restore a measure of its lost deterrence. Tehran could also continue to wage war, aiming to either exhaust Israel's will to fight or increase support for the regime among the Iranian people. The regime may even hope that Israel expands its strikes, or aim to draw in the United States, believing that if more Iranian civilians are killed, Iranian society will become more sympathetic toward the country's only defenders: the regime. That “rally around the flag” effect is, at this point, the regime's last remaining hope to get Iranians on its side.

But increased aggression is a very dicey bet and could leave the regime isolated and broke. The longer the war continues, the greater the destruction the country will face, which would reduce the regime's capacity to simply operate. If there is no rally around the flag effect, or if it eventually passes, the Islamic Republic's citizens could ultimately turn on the regime. And if the government secures a nuclear weapon in order to safeguard its hold on power, Iran could end up looking quite a lot like North Korea—a scenario no Iranian would want.

Whatever happens, the Iranian regime has doubtless lost its decades-long conflict with Israel. It will either have to give up its foundational political ideology and seek integration with the rest of the region through diplomatic and economic engagement, or it will need to double down on its beliefs, drawing further into itself. Ali Khamenei and the IRGC have lost; the regional status quo they established is finished.

Next week, when European and North American leaders gather in The Hague for the NATO summit, the main topics of discussion will be familiar: transatlantic burden sharing and national defense spending targets. Leaders will compare their efforts, tout increased budgets, and perhaps commit to the mutual goal of spending the equivalent of five percent of GDP on defense. This focus on dollars and euros is understandable given U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for more European contributions, but it misses a more profound question. Once it is paid for, who will oversee and take responsibility for Europe's defense?

To truly shift the burden from Washington to its allies, increased spending is necessary but not sufficient. NATO also needs to change the distribution of leadership and responsibility within the alliance. For over 75 years, NATO has operated under an implicit bargain: the United States leads, and Europe follows. The clearest manifestation of that arrangement is that the post of supreme allied commander for Europe, NATO's top military position, has always been held by an American.

During the Cold War, that practice made sense. The United States had the leading role in European security and so its general should lead the alliance. But today, a changing strategic landscape and the direction of U.S. domestic politics mean that the United States will not fill that role much longer. Europe now needs to lead the alliance, and to do that, a European needs to take the position of supreme allied commander.

Not long ago, this would have been considered a fringe position. For NATO's European members, it still is. But according to NBC News, the Trump administration considered whether to give up the commander's role, known as SACEUR, as part of a broader restructuring and cost-cutting initiative. In preparing for the Hague summit, the United States ultimately decided to retain the position, but it cannot continue to do so indefinitely. Europe and the United States should use this summit to prepare for a European SACEUR.

Opponents of such a move raise several concerns, including the legal and cultural difficulties of putting a European in control of the tens of thousands of U.S. forces still in Europe; the risk that the U.S. nuclear deterrent in Europe may not seem as credible to adversaries if Washington is not in command; and the general lack of European readiness to assume command. But there are solutions to overcome each of these obstacles—and now is the time to start applying them.

The original transatlantic bargain was built on the simple midcentury reality of American preeminence and European weakness. In 1949, Europe lay in ruins, and the United States provided not just military leadership but also economic lifelines and political cohesion. NATO's architecture of command reflects that asymmetry. Today, the political and economic reality is very different, and yet the asymmetric command structure persists, preventing Europeans from assuming the role they need to take in defending their own continent. The combined economies of European NATO members dwarf that of Russia. And European militaries, albeit uneven and lacking in key capabilities, are becoming more well funded and reform-minded. The threat landscape has also evolved. The challenges NATO faces today are ones that Europe, with the right structures and commitments, can and should take the lead in confronting. The United States, meanwhile, is changing its strategic focus away from Europe. A bipartisan consensus in Washington holds that China is the country's principal long-term challenge, and as a result, American attention and resources are flowing to the Pacific.

Perhaps more fundamentally, Americans increasingly believe that Europe should be able to take care of itself. The success of Trump's “America first” movement, not to mention his frequent threats to abandon the defense of Europe, should send a clear message that no matter what steps European governments take regarding defense, the era of U.S. leadership on the continent is coming to an end.

European leaders can either prepare for such a change or remain dangerously dependent on a partner whose attention tends to wander. Appointing a European supreme allied commander would be a key step in that preparation. It would be a tangible expression of Europe's willingness to assume responsibility for its own defense. A European commander would not require ending the U.S. role in NATO. It would signal, instead, that Europeans are ready to lead, not just passively follow American commands.

This would likely appeal to parts of the United States government—at least the parts outside of the uniformed military. As the United States looks to move its focus and resources toward Asia, giving up the commander position would allow the United States to remain part of NATO while also increasing Europe's responsibility for its own defense. The U.S. nuclear umbrella could continue to protect Europe, but the burdens of leadership would be shifted.

Currently, the supreme allied commander wears two hats; he also serves as the head of U.S. European Command, which oversees all U.S. forces in Europe. Because a European commander would lack that authority over the U.S. military presence in Europe, some fear that there would be friction in crisis scenarios. Before directing U.S. forces, for instance, the SACEUR would have to negotiate military responses with the U.S. political leadership.

But this is not an insurmountable problem. NATO's history is full of examples of shared command structures, such as the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. One possible solution would be for a European commander to be supported by a U.S. deputy commander who would retain authority over American forces, manage nuclear coordination, and ensure compliance with U.S. law.

Some argue that only an American general or admiral can effectively command U.S. troops. Yet U.S. troops have often served under non-American commanders, including in the UN operations in East Timor and Lebanon, in NATO operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan, and even in the EU-led mission in Bosnia. As in those cases, while a European commander could exercise NATO operational authority, the United States would retain the ultimate authority over its forces. A carefully structured arrangement, including a formal role for the U.S. deputy commander, could ensure compliance with U.S. legal frameworks while maintaining integrated NATO operations.

Concerns about nuclear deterrence are similarly overstated. The worry is that NATO's opponents would not believe that the U.S. government would ever support a European supreme allied commander's request for nuclear support. But what matters for nuclear deterrence is the credibility of the alliance's nuclear posture, which relies on both political will and operational clarity regardless of the nationality of the SACEUR. That credibility could be preserved under a European commander with a clear division of responsibilities: the European commander would oversee conventional operations, while nuclear responsibilities remained firmly under U.S. purview through the deputy commander. NATO's established protocols for the use of nuclear weapons would remain fundamentally unchanged. Adversaries would understand that NATO's deterrent remained intact, even as its military leadership evolved.



Another objection is that no European exists who has the talent and experience to fill the post of supreme allied commander. American four-star generals and admirals are groomed to lead combatant commands such as the European Command usually after overseeing tens of thousands of forces and handling large-scale multinational and joint operations. By contrast, no European officer today has commanded multinational forces on that scale in decades. No British general, for example, has commanded even a single deployed division (roughly 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers) since 2003 in the Iraq war.

This is a reasonable concern. But the only way to create European experience is to assign European responsibility. To accept the argument that Europeans have become incapable of rising to this level of leadership is to essentially condemn NATO to American leadership in perpetuity—and the United States will not accept that task forever. The leadership needs to change, and individual Europeans will need to grow into the role.

The process does not need to be rushed. To ensure a smooth transition, NATO could take a phased approach. The current supreme allied commander, U.S. General Christopher Cavoli, assumed the role in July 2022 and will likely hand over the reins to U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Alexus Grynkewich sometime this summer. Coincident with his appointment, the allies should agree at next week's summit that the next SACEUR will be European, as part of the expected progress in European capability development. A multiyear road map could include increased European command roles in NATO operations, expanded joint exercises, and a formal restructuring of the command hierarchy to accommodate shared leadership.

TRUST AND EVOLVE

The real barrier to a European supreme allied commander is not the lack of capability, doctrine, or personnel—it is the lack of political will. For decades, Europe has relied on American leadership not only because of U.S. power but also because doing so absolved Europeans of having to make difficult command decisions, resolved internal European disputes over who would lead within Europe, and helped cement the U.S. presence in Europe.

That dynamic is changing. France, Germany, Poland, and others are boosting defense budgets. EU initiatives are fostering greater defense cooperation. NATO's own defense planning process is pushing members to close capability gaps. The pieces of a more capable European pillar in NATO are slowly falling into place. What's needed now is a strong signal to adversaries and allies alike that Europe is both paying more and ready to lead.

The appointment of a European commander would be that signal. It would reflect Europe's progress while also accelerating it. It would place Europe at the center of its own defense while preserving U.S. engagement in a more sustainable form.

Ultimately, this is a question not just of power but of trust. Do Americans trust Europeans to command the alliance? Do Europeans trust themselves to command, and can they trust one another to agree on who should be the commander? If the answers to those questions are no, then the future of the NATO alliance will be bleak. After all, how can Europeans lead if they can't even take command? A NATO that evolves into a partnership of equals, however, will be stronger, more cohesive, and more resilient in the face of future threats. The time to start that evolution is now.

Since launching its military operation against Iran last Friday, Israel has dealt a devastating blow to the country's nuclear program, its ballistic missile arsenal, and its military leadership. But Israel is unlikely to be able to fully destroy Iran's nuclear program by itself. It does not have the bombers or heavy ordnance it would need to penetrate the fortified, underground Fordow enrichment facility. It has also evidently avoided striking fuel-storage facilities for fear of unleashing a public health crisis.

The United States has the aircraft and so-called bunker-buster bombs to cripple Fordow. That means that the outcome of the war will depend as much on decisions made by U.S. President Donald Trump as it will on further Israeli airstrikes. Israel has urged the United States to join the war, and if Trump decides to do so, Iran would almost certainly suffer a strategic defeat serious enough to push its nuclear capabilities back years and conceivably threaten the viability of the regime—which would quickly become a U.S. goal, owing to the logic of escalation.

But Trump should not enter the war as a combatant on Israel's side. The United States does have an interest in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. In 2015, it secured an agreement with Iran that would have blocked the Islamic Republic's quest for that for at least a decade, if not longer. Washington believed that negotiating an outcome in which Iran had a stake would be a more durable solution, and much less expensive than opting for war. Israel did not agree withthis approach, nor did Trump.

In 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement, an act that facilitated Iran's impressive accumulation of highly enriched uranium. It is no more in Washington's interest now than it was in 2015 to go to war for a result that could be achieved with far less risk through negotiations. That means that it is not in the U.S. interest to go to war to neutralize Fordow militarily, either, and it would be a mistake to do so. If Israel is determined to substantially damage Fordow, the Israel Defense Forces could do so by sending troops to Iran or by making it impossible to enter the facility or relocate centrifuges there. Achieving either goal, however, would be tricky and costly, and it is understandable that Israel would want to outsource the job to the Americans.

But subcontracting the Fordow job would put the United States in Iran's sights. Iran would almost certainly retaliate by killing American civilians. That, in turn, would compel the United States to reciprocate in an iterative process. Soon enough, the only targets left for Washington to hit would be the Iranian regime's leaders, and the United States would again go into the regime-change business—a business in which exceedingly few Americans want to be involved any longer.

U.S. involvement would pose risks for the president's political agenda, as well. To avoid both the international and domestic dangers, it is incumbent on Trump to develop a strategy that brings the war to an end by ensuring that Iran cannot immediately reconstitute its military nuclear program and allows both Iran and Israel to save face. This won't be easy, but it can be done. And the U.S. president needs to act strategically if he wants to save any portion of his substantial investments in Middle East peace—and prevent the war from incapacitating the United States' ability to meet other consequential challenges in Europe and Asia.

For days, the Trump administration failed to display any coherent strategy toward the war. Then, on Tuesday, Trump debuted much more hawkish language, calling for Iran's “unconditional surrender,” threatening to kill Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and using “we” when describing Israel's attacks. What he has not acknowledged, however, is that if the United States actually joins Israel's aerial campaign, the Islamic Republic has threatened to strike American targets: for example, naval assets in the Arabian Sea and U.S. military and diplomatic installations along the Arab side of the Gulf. Trump is preternaturally cautious about taking military action, and even the prospect of U.S. casualties on these ships or bases—and opposition from Gulf monarchies who will become targets themselves—will give him pause. But Iran's conventional response options are dwindling fast, and more direct U.S. involvement would likely lead Tehran to undertake asymmetric actions—terrorist attacks—against Israelis, Jews, and Americans worldwide.

Influential elements of Trump's MAGA base, such as the broadcaster Tucker Carlson, are already warning him not to reverse course on his “America first” policy. These supporters do not want him to supply Israel with arms, let alone send U.S. forces or aircraft to fight in the Middle East alongside Israel. Trump has pushed back against these critics, but they are not conceding the point; a cadre of Republicans in Congress are also counseling restraint. And once his conservative opposition senses broader public support, the free pass Trump has enjoyed from congressional Republicans may well be revoked on other issues important to him. If a rancorous debate breaks out over Middle East policy, Republican discord could, in particular, threaten the passage of Trump's signature “big beautiful bill.” And it would revive concerns about the United States' military adventures in the region.

Even if the Trump administration helps Israel incapacitate the Fordow facility, it will be immensely difficult to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop his military campaign before he is convinced that Iran's nuclear program cannot easily or quickly be reconstituted. In the past, Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies have estimated that after intense attacks against Iran's key nuclear facilities, the Islamic Republic could reestablish its program in about a year. Netanyahu has talked about destroying the program entirely, but in the absence of U.S. intervention, he has not defined a realistic and realizable way to achieve that goal. It is thus unclear whether even a medium to long-term disabling of Iran's nuclear program would satisfy Netanyahu.

Trump's best option, therefore, is to try to help bring the Israel-Iran war to an end in a way that preserves what Israel has accomplished militarily but also allows Iran to save enough face to return to negotiations. To do this, he will need to mobilize a multilateral effort to keep nuclear-related material out of Iran's hands, develop a negotiating strategy that takes advantage of the weakness that Iran has shown in the recent fighting, and conclude a credible agreement that effectively ends Iran's quest for a nuclear weapons capability.

All this will be far easier to propose than to achieve. If Trump puts outright pressure on Israel to stop its aerial strikes, Israel's supporters in both U.S. political parties will rise in protest, imperiling the rest of his political agenda. But if Trump attempts to simply sit the war out, it will grind on with unpredictable consequences. Iran may descend into civil war or societal collapse, creating a terrible humanitarian crisis; at the other end of the spectrum, an extended war of attrition would expose the combatants to costs that will be difficult to recover in the foreseeable future—and prolong Israel's efforts to draw the United States into the conflict.

Until now, Trump has combined tough rhetoric and threats with the demand that Iran return to the negotiating table and accept a deal that excludes any uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. This bob-and-weave approach will not be enough. Much more precise U.S. diplomatic intervention is required even as the Israeli aerial campaign maintains pressure on Iran in the background. Only a determined American president can pull off this complex, coercive diplomatic effort.

First, the president's senior military and intelligence advisers need to engage with Israel and seek agreement on a battle damage assessment that would judge whether enough damage has been done to Iran's nuclear program to justify stopping Israel's attacks. This assessment would factor in the Israeli assassinations of key Iranian military leaders, nuclear scientists, engineers, and administrators, as well as the damage inflicted on infrastructure. The fact that even future Israeli strikes are likely to leave Fordow's centrifuge halls and Iran's uranium hexafluoride storage site more or less intact will make this a difficult conversation. But the Trump administration must persuade Israel that Iran's capabilities can be adequately hobbled without destroying Fordow or continuing its attacks indefinitely.



Second, Trump must work with Netanyahu to define an end goal for the war that can be achieved quickly: a significant and specific measure of destruction of Iran's existing nuclear facilities and stockpile. Netanyahu's goals, thus far, appear much broader—the total destruction of Iran's nuclear program and, increasingly, regime change. Netanyahu must be advised that he cannot expect U.S. support for a policy aimed at regime change.

Third, with the help of U.S. allies in the Gulf, Iran's rulers will have to be convinced that accepting the bitter chalice of greatly diminished access to enrichment is better than economic strangulation, continued pounding from the air, and the possible loss of control over their country. Trump needs to enlist like-minded states such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to commit to a sustained multilateral effort to deny Iran the new nuclear-related equipment it would need to reconstitute its program and sprint for a bomb. An all-out effort along the lines of Operation Staunch—an embargo launched in the 1980s that weakened Iran's hand in its war with Iraq—would probably be required.

If progress can be made on these elements of the strategy, the United States should then draft a UN Security Council resolution proposing a cease-fire plan. The plan must include verifiable conditions related to Iran's nuclear program, such as the immediate return of nuclear inspectors, removing all barriers to those inspectors' access to the facilities they seek to examine, an embargo on the importation of components needed to reconstitute the program, the immediate export of any enriched uranium remaining in Iran, and a call to renew negotiations toward a nuclear deal.

If negotiations toward a deal do resume, Trump needs to take a realistic approach, accepting that his deal may end up looking more like a strengthened version of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement than something brand new. Insisting that Iran forgo enriching any uranium at all on its soil—a stance Trump's negotiators had taken after much back and forth—makes sense at the outset of resumed talks. But it will be very difficult for Trump to sustain that position given Iran's entrenched stance on enrichment. It will also be enormously difficult for Netanyahu—who has exposed Israel to punishing Iranian missile barrages with the aim of destroying Iran's program altogether—to concede both the survival of the Islamic Republic and any prospect of enrichment in Iran.

One way to deal with this concern—a proposal that is already on the table—would be for the United States to lead the setup of a regional consortium for enrichment under strict supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Such a solution could offer Iran a face-saving way of obtaining low-enriched uranium for medical and other benign purposes. And the presence of other parties, presumably some Arab states, and the location of this consortium outside Iran would go far in assuaging some of Israel's concerns.

This diplomatic effort by Trump carries political risks. A major multilateral push to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions will divert intelligence resources important to other targets, especially China and Russia, and probably necessitate a reversal of planned cuts to the U.S. intelligence apparatus. And any nuclear deal with Iran that allows the country to participate in uranium enrichment even outside its own territory will require Trump to spend political capital with his base. But these risks are worth it to avoid renewed war.

Israel's attack has already created a strategic shift in the Middle East. The country has again proved that its intelligence prowess and military dominance can redefine the region's politics. Once this war is over, Trump can turn his attention to a goal he has already articulated: translating that strategic transformation into the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states. This is a task the United States is best positioned to carry out.

But if Trump dithers—or, worse, fully joins Israel's war—he will destroy his ability to broker a more peaceful Middle East, an aim he has repeatedly stressed is precious to him. He must act, and in the right way, before Israel's appetite for regime change leads to another “forever war”—and before the logic of escalation leads Iran to shift from launching missiles to launching terror attacks, including against Americans.

Follow:


            It might be happening again.
    


            A president is being driven – by events, fear of proliferating weapons of mass destruction and the need to back up his own words – toward a shock-and-awe entry into a Middle East conflict with no guaranteed way out.
    


            Expectations are growing in Washington that Donald Trump will soon heed Israeli calls to try to strike a decisive blow against Iran's nuclear program, using bunker-busting weapons that only the US can deliver.
    


The president's rhetoric took a sharp turn following the apparent success of Israel's early barrage that wiped out top military leaders and nuclear scientists and severely degraded Iran's capacity to defend itself.
    


            And CNN reported Tuesday that Trump was warming to the idea of using US military assets to strike Iranian nuclear sites and was souring on his previous unsuccessful attempt to settle the issue through talks with Iran.
    


            As always with Trump, we must ask whether his tough talk is for real. Perhaps he is trying to bully Iran back to diplomacy and the “unconditional surrender” he demanded on social media.
    


            This looks like a pipe dream.
    


            “As long as President Trump is trying to capitalize on Israeli aggression against Iran, to get the Iranian leadership to surrender, it is just simply not going to work,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, told Becky Anderson on CNN International's “Connect the World” Tuesday. “What they see at the end of this slippery slope is basically full capitulation and regime collapse.”
    


            And since Israel's preemptive attack on Iran seems partly motivated by the desire to derail US diplomacy, who's to say a president who has recently been ignored by Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping could stop Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu?
    


            But Trump may be on the brink of a huge gamble that would repudiate his own political principles.
    


            His own scathing contempt for US presidents who pushed regime change played a huge role in the former reality star's dive into politics in 2015. If he goes to war in Iran, Trump will be ignoring a loud sector of his MAGA movement. The “America First” president would become the kind of interventionist he despised.
    


            Still, there is a loophole in Trump's isolationism. He's always insisted that Iran, given its threats to eradicate Israel and sworn enmity with the US, would never be allowed to get a nuclear weapon.
    


            Trump is deliberating whether to use 30,000-pound “Massive Ordnance Penetrator” guided bombs to destroy Iran's nuclear plant at Fordow, which is entombed below several hundred feet of concrete in a mountain.
    


            But something important is missing: any public talk by top officials about what might happen next.
    


            This is an extraordinary omission given Washington's 21st-century misadventures, when it started wars and spent the best part of 20 years trying to get out.
    


            “Anyone who is cheerleading the United States into a war with Iran has very quickly forgotten the disasters of the Iraq war and the Afghanistan war,” Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. The Connecticut Democrat recalled those conflicts “became a quagmire that ultimately got thousands of Americans killed and created new insurgencies against US interests and against our allies in the region.”
    


            The United States rolled into Iraq in 2003 and quickly toppled the tyrant Saddam Hussein. But it collapsed the Iraqi state and unleashed a vicious insurgency that ultimately ended in a US defeat. Fragile stability has only now returned to Iraq more than two decades later.
    


            In Afghanistan, President George W. Bush's post 9/11 invasion drove out Taliban leaders harboring Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda. But two decades of failed nation-building led to a humiliating US withdrawal in 2021 that shattered then-President Joe Biden's claims to be a foreign affairs guru.
    


            President Barack Obama had his own debacle. He was persuaded by European allies and some of his own aides to overthrow Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to protect civilians in 2011. “We came, we saw, he died,” then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in an interview. US hubris over Libya faded long ago. But it remains dangerous and impoverished.
    


            Trump knows all this.
    


            The moment it became clear that he'd change the hawkish Republican Party forever occurred when he slammed primary rival Jeb Bush in a 2016 debate over his brother's wars. “The war in Iraq was a big fat mistake” Trump said.
    


            And he hasn't forgotten. He reminded the world of it just last month in a major speech in Saudi Arabia.
    


            “The so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionalists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” Trump said. “They told you how to do it, but they had no idea how to do it themselves.”
    


            Is Trump now going to become one of his own examples?
    


            Iran is not Libya, Iraq or Afghanistan. History doesn't have to repeat itself. Maybe the hawks are right this time that a devastating, contained US military strike can destroy Iran's nuclear program and remove an existential threat to Israel and national security risk for the United States.
    


            But Iran's clerical regime would almost certainly have to respond, if only to protect its own authority. Depending on its remaining military capacity after the Israeli onslaught, it might attack US personnel and bases in the region. Trump would have to respond in a cycle of escalation with no clear endgame.
    


            It's easy to draw up nightmare scenarios. Iran might shut down the Strait of Hormuz to choke the flow of oil to trigger a global energy crisis. Or it might target oil fields of its regional rivals, such as Saudi Arabia. Only one nation could lead a response: the United States, as it got sucked deeper into a regional war. Then there's the possibility of mass Iranian cyber-attacks that could bring war to the homeland.
    


            Few Americans would mourn Iran's regime if Israel's push for regime change or encouragement for Iranians to revolt against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pays off.
    


            But political forces likely to be unleashed by the fall of the Islamic revolution, or the regime's crown jewel – its nuclear program – could cause immense upheaval.
    


            Anarchy or worse could be the result if a nation of 90 million people – which includes ethnic and sectarian fault lines among Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Baloch, Turkmen, Turk and Arab tribes – is suddenly leaderless.
    


            A failed-state meltdown could send millions of refugees into the Middle East and Europe when immigration is already straining societal cohesion and fomenting extremism. A sudden security vacuum could lead to civil wars, or a brutalist takeover from the military or elements of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya know how quickly terror havens can spring up. Unrest could spread throughout the region and threaten already unstable nations like Pakistan.
    


            It's also worth asking how the US and Israeli governments would secure stocks of nuclear material left exposed by raids on Iran's atomic plants to prevent them falling into the hands of terrorists or rogue states.
    


            As dire as these possibilities sound, they may be immaterial to Israel's thinking. After all, Netanyahu says the prospect of an Iranian nuclear bomb could lead to the eradication of his country and the Jewish people.
    


            But history, current and distant, challenges the idea a joint US and Israel effort would be short and conclusive. Israel still hasn't eradicated Hamas despite many months of bombardments in Gaza that have inflicted a terrible toll on tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians. Iran is likely to be a bigger challenge. And US efforts to shape Iran – including a CIA-backed coup in 1953, support for the repressive Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi that led to the Islamic revolution, and Washington's backing for Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s – almost always made the situation worse.
    


            So why has Trump apparently shed his earlier reticence over foreign wars?
    


            If he gives the go-ahead for a US attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, he could end up in a spot that any president might have reached. All his recent predecessors warned that Iran could never be allowed to get the bomb – although Trump may be blamed for failing with diplomacy to stop it happening on his watch.
    


            But if Israel's warnings that Tehran was racing toward a nuclear weapon were accurate, no US president could stand by and risk a second Holocaust – especially one who in his first term trashed a nuclear deal that Iran was respecting.
    


            It probably not coincidental that Trump's thinking evolved given the apparent success of early Israeli operations. He revealed on Tuesday that “we” now have “complete and total control of the skies over Iran.” A potential low-risk environment for US bombers might tempt a president who worships Gen. George Patton. He might sense a quick foreign policy win to make up for his failures to be the peacemaker he promised. And he'd love to crow that he – and not Bush, Obama or Biden – eradicated the threat from Iran.
    


            Still, he's a problematic war leader, having done nothing to prepare the country for a possible new escapade in a region stained by American blood and lost treasure. And Trump's strategy of governing as a divisive strongman may deprive him of the bipartisan public trust all warrior presidents need to succeed.
    


            Suddenly, a man who took great pride in never starting new wars has landed in a familiar place.
    


            He's a president debating whether to send Americans into a new Middle East conflict based on possibly questionable intelligence about weapons of mass destruction.
    


            The fallen from the Iraq and Afghan wars lie in Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery. The very least they are owed is an explanation of what happens next, if the first US bombs start dropping in Iran.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump would not say Wednesday whether he has decided to order a U.S. strike on Iran, a move that Tehran warned anew would be greeted with stiff retaliation if it happens.

“I may do it, I may not do it,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters at the White House . “I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do.”

Trump added that it's not “too late” for Iran to give up its nuclear program as he continues to weigh direct U.S. involvement in Israel's military operations aimed at crushing Tehran's nuclear program.

“Nothing's too late,” Trump said. “I can tell you this. Iran's got a lot of trouble.”

“Nothing is finished until it is finished,” Trump added. But “the next week is going to be very big— maybe less than a week.”

Trump also offered a terse response to Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's refusal to heed to his call for Iran to submit to an unconditional surrender.

“I say good luck,” Trump said.

Khamenei earlier Wednesday warned that any United States strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them” and that his country would not bow to Trump's call for surrender.

Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told lawmakers Wednesday that the Pentagon was providing possible options to Trump as he decides next steps on Iran.

Trump said Tuesday the U.S. knows where Khamenei is hiding but doesn't want him killed — “for now.”




“He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump said. 

Trump's increasingly muscular comments toward the Iranian government follow him urging Tehran's 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his participation in an international summit earlier this week to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team.

Trump said that the Iranian officials continue to reach out to the White House as they're “getting the hell beaten out of them” by Israel. But he added there's a “big difference between now and a week ago” in Tehran's negotiating position.

“They've suggested that they come to the White House— that's, you know, courageous,” Trump said.

Iran's mission to the United Nations refuted Trump's claim in a statement on social media. “No Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House. The only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to ‘take out' Iran's Supreme Leader. ”

The U.S. president said earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to serve as a mediator with Iran. But Trump said he told Putin to keep focused on finding an endgame to his own conflict with Ukraine.

“I said, ‘Do me a favor, mediate your own,'” Trump said he told Putin. “I said, ‘Vladimir, let's mediate Russia first. You can worry about this later.'”

The comments were a shift from Trump who earlier this week said he was “open” to Putin's offer to mediate.

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said earlier Wednesday that Moscow has cautioned Washington against offering direct military assistance to Israel.

“We are warning Washington against even speculative, hypothetical considerations of the sort,” Ryabkov said, according to the Interfax news agency. “That would be a step drastically destabilizing the situation as a whole.”

The Russia-Iran relationship has deepened since Putin launched a war on Ukraine in February 2022, with Tehran providing Moscow with drones, ballistic missiles, and other support, according to U.S. intelligence findings.

Trump is also facing deep skepticism about deepening U.S. involvement in the Mideast crisis from some of his most ardent supporters. Trump during his 2024 run for the White House promised voters he would quickly end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and keep the U.S. out of costly conflicts.

Steve Bannon, who served as a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration, on Wednesday said the administration should tread carefully.

“This is one of the most ancient civilizations in the world, ok?” Bannon told reporters at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. “With 92 million people. This is not something you play around with. You have to think this through. And the American people have to be on board. You can't just dump it on them.”

Bannon and other Trump allies, including Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk and conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, have raised concerns that direct U.S. involvement in the conflict could be seen as a betrayal to some members of Trump's coalition and potentially cause a schism in MAGA world.

Trump pushed back at the notion that deepening U.S. involvement could impact his standing with bis base.

“My supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them more than they were even at election time when we had a total landslide,” Trump said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, a stunning setback to transgender rights.

The justices' 6-3 decision in a case from Tennessee effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump's Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to Tennessee's.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a conservative majority that the law does not violate the Constitution's equal protection clause, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.

“This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound,” Roberts wrote. “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.”

In a dissent for the court's three liberal justices that she summarized aloud in the courtroom, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims. In sadness, I dissent.”



The decision comes amid other federal and state efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use. In April, Trump's administration sued Maine for not complying with the government's push to ban transgender athletes in girls sports.







The Republican president also has sought to block federal spending on gender-affirming medical care for those under age 19 — instead promoting talk therapy only to treat young transgender people. And the Supreme Court has allowed him to kick transgender service members out of the military, even as court fights continue. The president signed another order to define the sexes as only male and female.

Trump's administration has also called for using only therapy, not broader health measures, to treat transgender youths.



Several of the states where gender-affirming care has not been banned for minors have adopted laws or state executive orders seeking to protect it. But since Trump's executive order calling for blocking federal funding for the treatment for those under 19, some providers have ceased some treatments. For instance, Penn Medicine in Philadelphia announced last month it would not provide surgeries for patients under 19.

The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Susan Kressly, said in a statement the organization is “unwavering” in its support of gender-affirming care and “stands with pediatricians and families making health care decisions together and free from political interference.” 

Five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled transgender, gay and lesbian people are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace. That decision is unaffected by Wednesday's ruling.

But the justices Wednesday declined to apply the same sort of analysis the court used in 2020 when it found “sex plays an unmistakable role” in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate. Roberts joined that opinion written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was part of Wednesday's majority.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett also fully joined the majority but wrote separately to emphasize that laws classifying people based on transgender status should not receive any special review by courts. Barrett, also writing for justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that “courts must give legislatures flexibility to make policy in this area.”

Chase Strangio, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued the case for transgender minors and their families, said in a statement that the ruling “is a devastating loss for transgender people, our families, and everyone who cares about the Constitution.”

Mo Jenkins, a 26-year-old trans woman who began taking hormone therapy at 16, said she was disheartened but not surprised by the ruling. “My transition was out of survival,” said Jenkins, a Texas native and legislative staffer at the state capitol in Austin.

Texas outlawed puberty blockers and hormone treatment for minors in 2023. The legislature in May also passed a bill that tightly defines a man and a woman by their sex characteristics.

“Trans people are not going to disappear,” Jenkins said.

Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti on social media called the ruling a “Landmark VICTORY for Tennessee at SCOTUS in defense of America's children!”

There are about 300,000 people between the ages of 13 and 17 and 1.3 million adults who identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute, at think tank at the UCLA School of Law that researches sexual orientation and gender identity demographics.

When the case was argued in December, then-President Joe Biden's Democratic administration and families of transgender adolescents called on the high court to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans. 

They argued the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. 

Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors but allows the same drugs to be used for other purposes.

Soon after Trump took office, the Justice Department told the court its position had changed.

A major issue in the case was the appropriate level of scrutiny courts should apply to such laws. 

The lowest level is known as rational basis review, and almost every law looked at that way is upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures.

The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, which applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show the law helps accomplish it.

Roberts' 24-page majority opinion was devoted almost entirely to explaining why the Tennessee law, called SB1, should be evaluated under the lower standard of review. The law's restrictions on treating minors for gender dysphoria turn on age and medical use, not sex, Roberts wrote.

Doctors may prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapy to minors of any sex to treat some disorders, but not those relating to transgender status, he wrote.

But in her courtroom statement, Sotomayor asserted that similar arguments were made to defend the Virginia law prohibiting interracial marriage that the Supreme Court struck down in 1967. 

“A ban on interracial marriage could be described in the same way as the majority described SB1,” she said. 

Roberts rejected the comparison.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel said Wednesday they have finalized their “historic partnership,” a year-and-a-half after the Japanese company first proposed its deal to buy the iconic American steelmaker for nearly $15 billion.

The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, delaying the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it. It also forced Nippon Steel to expand the deal, including adding a so-called “golden share” provision that gives the federal government a say in some matters.

“Together, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel will be a world-leading steelmaker, with best-in-class technologies and manufacturing capabilities,” the companies said.

The combined company will become the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, and bring what analysts say is Nippon Steel's top-notch technology to U.S. Steel's antiquated steelmaking processes. In exchange, Nippon Steel gets access to a robust U.S. steel market, strengthened in recent years by tariffs under President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, analysts say.

Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel did not list the full terms of the deal, and did not release a national security agreement struck with Trump's administration.

But in a statement Wednesday, the companies said the federal government will have the right to appoint an independent director and “consent rights” on specific matters. Those include reductions in Nippon Steel's capital commitments in the national security agreement, closing or idling of U.S. Steel's existing domestic facilities and changing U. S. Steel's name and headquarters.




Nippon Steel announced in December 2023 that it planned to buy the steel producer for $14.9 billion in cash and debt, and committed to keep the U.S. Steel name and Pittsburgh headquarters. 

The United Steelworkers union, which represents some U.S. Steel employees, opposed the deal, and Biden and Trump both vowed from the campaign trail to block it. 

Biden used his authority to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel on his way out of the White House after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

After he was elected, Trump changed course and expressed openness to working out an arrangement and ordered another review by the committee. That's when the idea of the “golden share” emerged as a way to resolve national security concerns and protect American interests in domestic steel production.

As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel also made a series of bigger capital commitments in U.S. Steel facilities, tallying $11 billion through 2028, it said.

PUERTO ESCONDIDO, Mexico (AP) — Hurricane Erick was nearing Mexico's Pacific coast on Wednesday on a forecast track to bring heavy rain, strong winds, storm surge and possible mudslides to its southern coastal region, forecasters said.

Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lighter amounts in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain.

The Category 1 storm on Wednesday morning was located about 130 miles (205 kilometers) south-southeast of Puerto Ángel, Mexico, and had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph). It was moving northwest at 8 mph (13 kph).

The hurricane center said Erick is rapidly intensifying and is expected to be at or near major hurricane status as it approaches the Mexican coast on Thursday, where it could make landfall. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher and wind speeds of at least 111 mph (180 kph).

Erick is forecast to be a major hurricane by Wednesday night or Thursday morning.

The storm's projected path would take its center near the resort of Acapulco, which was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared.

At least 52 people died in Otis and 32 were missing, after the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort's hotels.




Down the coast in Puerto Escondido near the southern edge of Erick's possible path, some fishermen began pulling their boats out of the water under a drizzling sky Wednesday. 

Even though the wind had yet to pick up at the Zicatela beach, red flags were up to warn people to stay out of the water. But some surfers ignored them as they continued to ride waves.

Laura Velázquez, Mexico's national civil defense coordinator, said Wednesday that Erick was forecast to bring “torrential” rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico.

The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides and there are numerous rivers that could jump their banks.

Thousands of troops were being deployed to the area, Velázquez said.

Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado said Wednesday that all schools were closed and the state had alerted all of the fishing and tourism operators of the risk of the coming storm and recommended they prepare their boats. Acapulco's port closed Tuesday evening. She said 582 shelters were prepared to receive people who might evacuate their homes.

One of the criticisms of the government's handling of Hurricane Otis was that authorities did not give sufficient warning about the threat posed by the rapidly intensifying storm. Many boats sank in Acapulco's harbor.

President Claudia Sheinbaum during her daily news briefing Wednesday warned residents in the hurricane's path to listen for government instructions and to wait it out in their homes or government shelters.

A hurricane warning was in effect from Acapulco to Puerto Ángel. A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected in the area, and preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, according to the hurricane center advisory.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Emergency workers pulled more bodies Wednesday from the rubble of a nine-story Kyiv apartment building demolished by a Russian missile, raising the death toll from the latest attack on the Ukrainian capital to 28.

The building in Kyiv's Solomianskyi district took a direct hit and collapsed during the deadliest Russian attack on Kyiv this year. Authorities said that 23 of those killed were inside the building. The remaining five died elsewhere in the city. 

Workers used cranes, excavators and their hands to clear more debris from the site, while sniffer dogs searched for buried victims. The blast blew out windows and doors in neighboring buildings in a wide radius of damage.

The attack overnight on Monday into Tuesday was part of a sweeping barrage as Russia once again sought to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Russia fired more than 440 drones and 32 missiles in what Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was one of the biggest bombardments of the war, now in its fourth year.

Russia has launched a summer offensive on parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and has intensified long-range attacks that have struck urban residential areas.

At the same time, U.S.-led peace efforts have failed to grain traction. Also, Middle East tensions and U.S. trade tariffs have drawn world attention away from Ukraine's pleas for more diplomatic and economic pressure to be placed on Russia.




The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said the attack clashed with the attempts by the administration of President Donald Trump to reach a settlement that will stop the fighting.

“This senseless attack runs counter to President Trump's call to stop the killing and end the war,” the embassy posted on social platform X.

Kyiv authorities declared Wednesday an official day of mourning. Mourners laid flowers on swings and slides at a playground across the street from the collapsed building. On Tuesday, a man had waited hours there for his 31-year-old son's body to be pulled from the rubble.

Psychologists from Ukraine's emergency services provided counseling to survivors of the attack and to family members of those who died.

“Some people are simply in a stupor, they simply can't move,” Karyna Dovhal, one of the psychologists, told AP. “People are waiting for their sons, brothers, uncles ... Everyone is waiting.”

Valentin Hrynkov, a 64-year-old handyman in a local school who lived on the seventh floor of a connected building that did not collapse, said he and his wife woke up to the sound of explosions followed by a pause, and then another blast that rattled their own building.

He said his wife had shrapnel injuries in her back and his legs and feet were cut by broken glass. The damage trapped them in their apartment for around 30 minutes before rescue workers could free them, he said.

He felt an overwhelming sense of “helplessness and primal fear” during the attack, he told The Associated Press. 

“I was especially scared to sleep last night,” Hrynkov said. “A car drives by and I cover my head. It's scary.”

By dawn on Tuesday, residents of buildings in the densely populated neighborhood could be seen huddled in ground-floor entryways to seek shelter from the ongoing drone assault.

Drones were striking every few minutes within hundreds of meters of the building hit by the missile. The continuing attack forced firefighters and rescue teams to delay the rescue operation.

Relatives and friends of the destroyed building's residents later gathered outside in shock, many crying and calling out names, hoping survivors might still be found beneath the rubble.

It was the second public appearance by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since the strikes began, and came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” in a social media post and warned Khamenei that the U.S. knows where he is but has no plans to kill him, “at least not for now.”

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected U.S. calls for surrender in the face of blistering Israeli strikes and warned that any military involvement by the Americans would cause “irreparable damage” to them.

“Wise individuals who know Iran, its people, and its history never speak to this nation with the language of threats, because the Iranian nation is not one to surrender,” he said in the low-resolution video, his voice echoing. An Iranian diplomat had earlier warned that U.S. intervention would risk “all-out war.”

Some of the strongest moves on Wall Street were again in the oil market, where crude prices dropped after Trump said it's not “too late” for Iran to give up its nuclear program. 

Oil prices have been yo-yoing for days because of rising and ebbing fears that Israel's fighting with Iran could disrupt the global flow of crude.

During his 2024 run for the White House, Trump promised voters he would quickly end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and keep the U.S. out of costly conflicts.

Steve Bannon, who served as a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration, on Wednesday said the administration should tread carefully.

“This is not something you play around with,” Bannon told reporters. “You have to think this through. And the American people have to be on board. You can't just dump it on them.”

Trump has pushed back at that notion, saying: “My supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them more than they were even at election time when we had a total landslide.”

Trump says Iranian officials continue to reach out. “They've suggested that they come to the White House — that's, you know, courageous.” 

Iran's mission to the United Nations refuted Trump's claim in a statement on social media: “No Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House. The only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to ‘take out' Iran's Supreme Leader.”

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday that Moscow has cautioned Washington against offering direct military assistance to Israel.

“We are warning Washington against even speculative, hypothetical considerations of the sort,” Ryabkov said, according to the Interfax news agency. “That would be a step drastically destabilizing the situation as a whole.”

Trump said earlier this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to serve a mediator with. But the U.S. president said he told Putin to keep focused on finding an endgame to his own conflict with Ukraine.

Carrie Best-Lary was among hundreds of Jews who had traveled to Israel on a trip that was supposed to be about culture and Jewish roots, only to find herself fleeing on a cruise ship to Cyprus. She is in one of two groups that have converged on the Mediterranean island — one leaving Israel and the other trying to get back in.

At a scary time, the two groups that never expected their paths to cross are coming together, seeking shelter and sharing kosher meals.

Cyprus has become a transit point for those being evacuated from Israel or Israelis wishing to return home after being stranded abroad, with thousands now in Cyprus trying to reach Israel.

Witnesses say there have been more than 10 powerful explosions in central Tehran as Israel continues its campaign, with white smoke rising into the air. Iranian officials did not immediately acknowledge the strikes.

The Israeli military urged people to head to shelters after it said it identified missile launches in Iran on Wednesday evening.

Israel had eased some restrictions for civilians earlier in the day, as Iranian missile attacks have been waning.

There were no immediate reports of injuries, according to Israel's emergency rescue service.

“I may do it, I may not do it,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters at the White House . “I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do.”

Iran's supreme leader issued a fresh warning Wednesday that U.S. direct involvement in Israel's military operations be greeted with stiff retaliation.

The “bunker-buster” bombs believed necessary to significantly damage Iran's underground nuclear sites would have to be dropped from an American aircraft.

The denial by Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei comes after three planes flew to Muscat, Oman, from Iran on Wednesday, despite Iranian airspace being closed.

The U.S. State Department is making plans to evacuate American citizens from Israel by flights and cruise ships, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said on Wednesday.

In a post on X, he said Americans interested in leaving Israel should enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) for updates. The link is: https://t.co/rXymPRTQJJ

Huckabee's post comes just a day after the State Department said it had stood up a special task force to assist Americans wanting to leave Israel and other Mideast countries.

There are some 700,000 Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, now in Israel and thousands more in other Mideast countries, including Iran.

A top leader of the Houthi rebels in Yemen, one of Iran's allies, say they will keep up their support for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip until Israeli “aggression stops, and the siege is lifted.”

“Our operations in support of Gaza will not cease, no matter the sacrifices,” said Houthi-backed president Mahdi al-Mashat in a statement Wednesday.

The Houthis are the last militant group in Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.

They've been firing long-range missiles at Israel in the months since it resumed the war in Gaza, setting off air raid sirens but generally causing few casualties. They're also been attacking shipping in Mideast waters.

Republican U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, whose district covers Iowa's capital and suburbs, said the U.S. would back up nuclear negotiations with firm consequences.

“This is something that needs to be on the negotiating table to make the Iranians aware: that there's a real threat here if they refuse to negotiate a peaceful end to their nuclear program, the U.S. has the ability to eliminate it for them,” Nunn told the AP in Dubai on Wednesday.

He's one of four U.S. representatives — two Democrats and two Republicans — visiting wealthy Persian Gulf allies, including Saudi Arabia.

Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider said they're working to get a sense of the challenges facing the so-called Abraham Accords, in which four Arab countries normalized relations with Israel in 2020.

The members of the U.S. House of Representatives are visiting the United Arab Emirates, a key ally in the Gulf, as the conflict between Israel and Iran has frozen nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran.

“A nuclear-armed Iran is an existential threat,” Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider told the AP in Dubai.

Schneider represents northern Illinois' wealthy and working-class communities along Lake Michigan and is a classic swing district with a large number of Jewish voters.

Highlighting deterrence, Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said: “If Iran attacks our forces, I will guarantee you that there will be a very hard response.”

Bacon also hails from a swing district that includes Omaha and which voted for Kamala Harris last fall while sending the Republican back to Congress.






Speaking to the faithful gathered in St. Peter's Square for a general audience, Pope Leo XIV urged: “We must not get used to war. On the contrary, we must reject as a temptation the allure of powerful and sophisticated weapons.” 

The pope said Tuesday that “the heart of the church is torn by the cries rising from places of war, especially Ukraine, Iran, Israel and Gaza,” and appealed for peace “in the name of human dignity and international law.”

In the year and a half before his death, Leo's predecessor Pope Francis became increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the Israeli military's harsh tactics in Gaza. Francis also advocated freeing the hostages held by Hamas, meeting with their families.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An Iranian semiofficial news agency has denied “rumors” that an Israeli airstrike targeted the home of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 

It's the first time media in Iran has explicitly acknowledged the Islamic Republic's paramount leader was a target.

The report came from the Fars news agency, believed to be close to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.

Fars described the rumors as showing “the U.S. and the Zionist regime's anger and confusion in the face of the supreme leader's firm statements made today.”

Three aircraft took off from Iran for Muscat, Oman's capital, on Wednesday. The flights come as Iranian airspace has been closed for days. Their flight trackers all turned on in southeastern Iran, meaning it wasn't immediately clear from where the aircraft took off. 

Iran offered no explanation for the flights and Oman did not immediately acknowledge any arrival of Iranian officials to the sultanate. 

Oman has been a key mediator between Iran and the United States during their five rounds of talks over Tehran's nuclear program.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier Wednesday warned that the United States that strikes targeting Iran will “result in irreparable damage for them” and that his country would not heed to Trump's call for surrender.

“I say good luck,” Trump said when asked about the supreme leader's refusal to surrender.

“Nothing's too late,” Trump said when asked about whether direct U.S. involvement in Israel's military operations against Iran was becoming inevitable. He added. “I can tell you this. Iran's got a lot of trouble.” 

Trump's comments came as during an event on the White House South Lawn to watch the raising of a new flagpole.

NetBlocks, a group which monitors government-caused internet interference, said Iran was “in the midst of a near-total national internet blackout.”

“The incident follows a series of earlier partial disruptions and comes amid escalating military tensions with Israel after days of back-and-forth missile strike,” it said in a post on the social media platform X.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Raja Khatib, whose wife and two daughters were killed in a strike Saturday, said his tragedy showed Jews and Arabs had a shared destiny on the land.

“We have a common future. We need to understand that we have a common destiny,” said Khatib, whose home in the Palestinian city of Tamra in northern Israel was struck. “So let's end all the wars ... and live in peace.”

Israel has roughly 2 million Palestinian citizens.

Khatib described a scene of devastation in his home the night of the strike.

“I heard a huge, big bomb. Then, it became completely dark and dusty,” Khatib said. He tried to ascend to the top floor where his loved ones were killed, “but everything was destroyed.” Khatib's sister-in-law was also killed in the strike.

The Israeli military is urging members of the Iranian security services to contact Israel's Mossad intelligence service, claiming they had been receiving messages from officials worried about Iran's “uncertain future.”

There was no immediate way to independently verify the claim.

In a post on the social platform X in Farsi, the Israeli military provided a website and urged users to employ a virtual private network before attempting contact.

“Even those who identify themselves as members of the regime's security institutions express their fear, despair, and anger at what is happening in Iran and ask us to contact Israeli authorities - so that Iran does not suffer the same fate as Lebanon and Gaza,” the message added.

The message did not elaborate. However, it comes as Iran is in a frenzy over spies, prompting warnings to officials to abandon certain devices, apps and web services.

Late Wednesday afternoon, internet access across Iran crashed. Authorities offered no immediate explanation.

Just after 4 p.m. local time, a likely Israeli airstrike sent a giant plume of gray smoke skyward in the eastern reaches of Tehran. 

It wasn't immediately clear what was targeted.

Israel is easing some restrictions for civilians that have frozen the country in place over the past week, the military announced on Wednesday, six days into the confrontation with Iran. 

While schools are still closed, people will begin returning to workplaces where there is access to shelters.

Restrictions are being eased further in areas along Israel's periphery, which have been targeted fewer times than the country's center. 

“This decision to gradually open the economy in the various regions is a message of victory over the Iranian enemy,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday. Iran has fired fewer missiles as the conflict has worn on, allowing Israeli air defense systems greater accuracy with interceptions.

State television has aired footage of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei giving a statement that was read out by a TV anchor a short while ago. 

The footage strikingly contrasted against the high-quality recording typically produced of his speeches, with his voice echoing as he sat in a room with beige curtains behind him. 

A portrait of Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who Khamenei succeeded, was over his left shoulder, with an Iranian flag to his right.

Khamenei warned the United States that joining the Israeli strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them.”

Germany's foreign minister has underlined European countries' willingness to talk to Iran about a solution to the crisis over its nuclear program. But he says there needs to be movement from Tehran.

Johann Wadephul said Wednesday that “it is never too late to come to the negotiating table, if you come with honest intentions.” 

He spoke two days after he held a call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi along with his French and British counterparts and the European Union foreign policy chief.

Wadephul said the European officials made clear that their countries –- which were part of Iran's 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers –- “still stand ready to negotiate on a solution.”

But he added that “Iran must now move urgently. Iran must take confidence-building and verifiable measures,” including a credible statement that Tehran is not striving for a nuclear weapon.

The European Union says it has helped evacuate about 400 of its citizens out of Israel via Jordan and Egypt as part of its efforts to coordinate emergency response to the conflict within the 27 nations of the bloc.

“Up till now, we have an estimate that over 400 EU citizens were repatriated via this civil protection mechanism of the EU,” said Eva Hrncirova in Brussels on Wednesday. 

She said the EU was fielding requests by Slovakia, Lithuania, Greece and Poland for assistance in evacuating from the Middle East.

“Member states coordinate the list and we co-finance these flights up to the 75% of the transport costs,” she said. 

In the message, Khamenei also urged officials to “continue their work with strength and trust in God.”

“God will certainly and surely make the Iranian nation ... victorious,” he said.

State television said that a video of Khamenei giving the same address would be aired later.

Khamenei's last message to the nation, which was released late Friday after the start of the Israeli campaign, was also first read out on television before he appeared himself reading it a while later. It may be a security measure to protect Khamenei, whose exact location isn't public knowledge.

Iran's supreme leader has warned the United States that joining the Israeli strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them.”

The comments by 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came in a statement read out by a state television anchor against a still image of the leader. It wasn't clear why Khamenei did not appear himself on screen, as he has done earlier since the Israeli attacks began on Friday.

“Any military involvement by the U.S. in this field will undoubtedly result in irreparable damage for them,” the statement said.

Greece's Foreign Ministry says the evacuees included citizens of Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. 

They were flown to Athens early Wednesday from Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh on board two military transport planes, the ministry said.

Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said Bank Pasargad had been targeted, along with Bank Sepah, Iran's first bank, which found its online services disrupted Tuesday.

She said experts are working to resolve the problem.

Iran has been cutting off access to the wider world for Iranians via the internet and blocking landlines from receiving and making international calls.

A group of hackers calling itself “Gonjeshke Darande,” or “Predatory Sparrow,” claimed the cyberattack on Bank Sepah. It wasn't immediately clear if the Bank Pasargad attack was also their work.

The group has claimed hacking a major steel mill in 2022 and disrupting gas stations in 2023.

Iran, long sanctioned by the West, faces difficulties in getting up-to-date hardware and software.

Israel's military said it has destroyed five Iranian AH-1 attack helicopters at a base in western Iran in the Kermanshah area.

The Israelis published black-and-white video of the bombing destroying the helicopters.

Iran did not immediately comment.

Iran under the shah purchased some 200 of the Bell AH-1 SuperCobras, which remain in service as Iran is sanctioned internationally and broadly unable to purchase new weaponry.

Thailand's government has advised Thai nationals were advised to leave Tehran at the earliest chance possible, although there is no immediate plan for an evacuation from Iran.

Nikorndej Balankura, spokesperson of the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said there are about 350 Thais in Iran and no one has been reported injured. He said only five people have expressed their wish to return to Thailand.

The Thai embassy in Tehran has set up a temporary shelter for Thais in Amol, and has temporarily relocated its office to Kordan to ensure safety of those who need to travel for its services. 

Streets in Iran's capital, Tehran, again were deserted Wednesday amid the Israeli attacks.

Occasional cars and men on scooters sped past the closed shops and stores.

Telecom worker Ghulam Mustafa Ijaz said he was advised to leave Tehran with his family because the situation was becoming dangerous. 

“We left everything behind and carried just one bag containing some necessities and food items,” Ijaz said. “We are five family members, but we carried just one bag. We just left, and left everything else there.”

Iran and Pakistan share a 900-kilometre (560-mile), largely lawless border where smugglers and militants roam freely. Although Pakistan has shut some of the formal crossings, the ones at Taftan and Gabd-Rimdan in southwest Balochistan province remain open for nationals seeking to return home.

Pakistan has strongly condemned Israel's attacks. It has denied that it will provide military assistance to Iran, including nuclear weapons.

Iran's ambassador in Geneva is deriding as “hostile” and “unwarranted” U.S. President Donald Trump's comments calling for Iran's “unconditional surrender.”

Ambassador Ali Bahreini told reporters the Israeli campaign “has not been able to bring big damage to our nuclear facilities” because it had taken precautions to protect them.

Bahreini insisted that Iran has no intention to produce nuclear weapons, a top concern for Israeli authorities. He said “we will continue to produce the enriched uranium as far as we need for peaceful purposes.”

The ambassador rejected any talk of a “setback” on Iran's nuclear research and technological activities caused by Israel's military action, saying “our scientists will continue their work.”

Both the semiofficial Fars and ISNA news agencies reported Wednesday that a replacement system had been installed to replace its Soubashi radar site in western Iran.

The original Soubashi radar, located in the heights of Kaboudarahang County in Iran's Hamedan province, played a crucial role in Iran's air defense network, providing extensive coverage for western, northwestern, and southwestern Iran. 

Hamedan has been repeatedly targeted in Israeli strikes since Israel's campaign began Friday.

“The IAEA has information that two centrifuge production facilities in Iran, the TESA Karaj workshop and the Tehran Research Center, were hit,” the International Atomic Energy Agency wrote on the social platform X.Karaj is a city just outside of Tehran.“At the Tehran site, one building was hit where advanced centrifuge rotors were manufactured and tested,” it added. “At Karaj, two buildings were destroyed where different centrifuge components were manufactured.”

A top Iranian diplomat says his country will “respond strongly” to Israel's “aggression” and will do so likewise against the United States if U.S. forces join the conflict between the rival Middle East powers as it moved into a sixth day on Wednesday.

Ali Bahreini, Iran's ambassador in Geneva, sought to project a defiant message from Tehran and defended its nuclear program as purely peaceful and designed for civilian use at a long-planned news conference with the United Nations press corps in the Swiss city.

Overnight, the United States moved air force refueling tankers and C17s to European bases in Prestwick, Scotland, and Aviano in Italy, according to Aurora Intel, a group that reviews open source information in real time in the Middle East.

This comes as the U.S. is shifting military aircraft and warships into and around the Middle East to protect Israel from Iranian attacks as President Donald Trump warns Tehran to step back from the conflict.

On Tuesday, the U.S. relocated a dozen F-16s from the Italian base to Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, said the group.

A spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry issued a warning Wednesday that an American intervention in the ongoing Israeli strikes targeting his country would spark “an all-out war.”

Esmail Baghaei made the comments in an interview live on Al Jazeera English. It was his first in the ongoing conflict.

“I think any American intervention would be a recipe for an all-out war in the region with very, very bad consequences for the whole international community,” he said.

Baghaei's comments suggested that Iran believes that Gulf Arab countries wouldn't allow the U.S. to launch attacks from any bases in their countries. 

However, the U.S. has aircraft carriers and long-range bombers it could employ for any attack.

Asked if he thought the U.S. could control Israel, Baghaei grimaced and said “Not really.”

Iranian state television has aired its first footage of a downed Israeli drone during Israel's campaign against the Islamic Republic.

In the footage aired Wednesday, a state television reporter stands next to the large drone he identifies as a Hermes 900.

Other footage aired showed what appeared to be the drone going into a tailspin before crashing in a farm field.

Writing in Hebrew appeared on the components of the drone.

The wreckage corresponded to photographs of the Hermes 900, which is a long-endurance drone.

Israel's military did not respond to questions about the alleged drone shootdown.

Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East “as soon as possible” and said China is “deeply worried as Israel's military operation against Iran has caused a sudden escalation of tensions in the Middle East.”

Xi, on a visit to the Kazakh capital Astana late Tuesday, added that China “opposes any actions that infringe upon sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of other countries.”

He added that “China is ready to work with all parties to play a constructive role in restoring peace and stability in the Middle East.”

China has already called on all its nationals to leave Iran, with whom it has long maintained close trade and political ties.

Two flights from Larnaca, Cyprus, landed at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport Wednesday morning, an airport spokesperson said, marking the first flights to bring Israelis abroad back home since the Israel-Iran conflict began.

Footage showed the first plane gliding down the tarmac after landing in Tel Aviv.

Israel's minister of transportation, Miri Regev, greeted the captain in the airport's control tower.

“We are waiting for you here with great anticipation,” she told her in Hebrew. “Very excited, first rescue flight.”

Israel closed its airspace to commercial flights because of the multiple volleys of ballistic missiles launched toward the country each day by Iran.

Tens of thousands of Israelis are stranded abroad, according to Israeli media reports.

Egypt's top diplomat has held calls with both Iran's foreign minister and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, Cairo and Tehran say.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty held the calls Tuesday with Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Witkoff.

Abdelatty reportedly stressed “the necessity of working toward de-escalation in the region and resorting to diplomatic and political solutions that contribute to containing the escalating situation and averting the risk of a widespread conflagration in the Middle East.”

Abdelatty “underscored the imperative of achieving an immediate ceasefire and returning to the path of negotiations as the only means to reach a sustainable agreement regarding the Iranian nuclear program,” his office said in a statement.

A social media account associated with Araghchi confirmed the calls took place.

U.S. officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Baltimore Orioles minor league infielder Luis Guevara has died, the team announced in a statement late Tuesday. He was 19.

Guevara was a victim in a jet ski crash in Lido Key, Florida, FOX 13 Tampa Bay reported, citing team officials. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said two jet skis with two people on board collided with each other. All four people were sent into the water.

Guevara joined the Orioles in January 2023 as an international free agent from Venezuela. He was playing shortstop, third base and second base as he worked his way through the Orioles' farm system.

He played for Orioles Orange in the Dominican Summer League for two years. He got his start in 2025 in Double-A with the Chesapeake BaySox of the Eastern League but moved down to the Delmarva Shorebirds of the Single-A Carolina League and later the Orioles' Florida Complex League team.

Fox News' Alexandria Hoff reports on the government findings regarding the risks associated with gender surgeries on ‘Special Report.'

The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a Tennessee law banning specific transgender medical treatments for adolescents in the state is not discriminatory, ruling 6-3 to uphold the law.

At issue in the case, United States v. Skrmetti, was whether Tennessee's Senate Bill 1, which ""prohibits all medical treatments intended to allow 'a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex' or to treat 'purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity,'"" violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

That law prohibits states from allowing medical providers to deliver puberty blockers and hormones to facilitate a minor's transition to another sex.

It also targets healthcare providers in the state who continue to provide such procedures to gender-dysphoric minors— opening these providers up to fines, lawsuits and other liability. 

Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that the law question is not subject to heightened scrutiny ""because it does not classify on any bases that warrant heightened review.""

""This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,"" he said. ""The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound.""

SUPREME COURT APPEARS DIVIDED OVER STATE BANS ON GENDER TRANSITION 'TREATMENTS' FOR MINORS

United States v. Skrmetti was one of the most closely watched cases of the Supreme Court's term, with potential ripple effects for ongoing legal battles over transgender rights – including bathroom access and participation in school sports.

The ruling could also serve as a legal pretext in future cases involving LGBTQ+ protections, including whether sexual orientation qualifies as a ""protected class"" on par with race or national origin.

""The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,"" he added. ""Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us … but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.""

All three liberal justices notably dissented in the case.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent that cited a long history of laws discriminating against others, noting that transgender persons in the U.S. make up less than 1% of the country's population. There are an estimated 1.3 million adults and 300,000 adolescents aged 13 to 17 who identify as transgender, according to the UCLA law school's Williams Institute.

She noted that SB1 ""expressly classifies on the basis of sex and transgender status, so the Constitution and settled precedent require the Court to subject it to intermediate scrutiny.""

""The majority contorts logic and precedent to say otherwise, inexplicably declaring it must uphold Tennessee's categorical ban on lifesaving medical treatment so long as ‘any reasonably conceivable state of facts' might justify it,"" Sotomayor said, adding: ""By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims.""

""In sadness, I dissent,"" she said.

The court's ruling comes after many other states have moved to ban or restrict medical treatments and procedures for transgender adolescents, drawing close attention to the case. 

During the December oral arguments, justices on the Supreme Court appeared reluctant to overturn Senate Bill 1, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting that state legislatures, rather than courts, are best equipped to regulate medical procedures.

Roberts noted at the time that the Constitution leaves such questions ""to the people's representatives,"" rather than to nine justices on the Supreme Court, ""none of whom is a doctor.""

Justice Samuel Alito cited ""hotly disputed"" medical studies on the alleged benefits of such medical treatments, and told the government's attorney that those studies ""found a complete lack of high-quality evidence showing that the benefits of the treatments in question here outweigh the risks."" 

""Do you dispute that?"" Alito asked during oral arguments.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, however, countered that with evidence from underage individuals who were denied treatment. 

""Some children suffer incredibly with gender dysphoria, don't they? I think some attempt suicide?"" she asked. 

""The state has come in here and, in a sharp departure from how it normally addresses this issue, it has completely decided to override the views of the parents, the patients, the doctors who are grappling with these decisions and trying to make those trade-offs,"" she said then.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had asked the Supreme Court to hear the case on behalf of the parents of three transgender adolescents and a Memphis-based doctor who treats transgender patients. 

The Biden administration had previously joined the petitioners in the case via a federal law that allows the administration to intervene in certain cases certified by the attorney general to be of ""general public importance.""

However, the Trump administration notified the Supreme Court in February that the government would be changing its stance on the constitutionality of the law, saying the Tennessee law does not violate the equal protection clause. 

Also at issue was the level of scrutiny that courts should use to evaluate the constitutionality of state bans on transgender medical treatment for minors, such as SB1, and whether these laws are considered discriminating on the basis of sex or against a ""quasi-suspect class,"" thus warranting a higher level of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. 

That was another focus of the oral arguments in December, as petitioners and respondents battled for more than two hours over the level of scrutiny that the court should apply in reviewing laws involving transgender care for minors, including SB1. 

Tennessee argued then that its law can still withstand even the test of heightened scrutiny, contending in a court brief that it does have ""compelling interests"" to protect the health and safety of minors in the state, and ""in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.""

SUPREME COURT CAN TAKE MASSIVE STEP IN PREVENTING TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS' SPORTS WITH HISTORIC HEARING

Speaking to reporters after oral arguments in December, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said that the Constitution ""allows the states to protect kids from unproven, life-altering procedures based on uncertain science.""

The high court's decision comes at a time when transgender rights are a hotly contested topic. 

President Donald Trump cracked down on the issue almost immediately after being sworn in to his second White House term in January. Just weeks after his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order preventing biological men from competing in women's sports.

The order, titled ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,"" was signed on National Girls and Women in Sports Day. It prohibits schools and colleges that receive federal funds and are subject to Title IX from allowing transgender-identifying biological men onto women's sports teams and into women's locker rooms and restrooms.

The Trump administration's policies on transgender rights have inevitably become the targets of legal challenges launched by advocacy groups, medical organizations and individuals who claim they are discriminatory. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the Supreme Court ruling on social media Wednesday. ""This Department of Justice will continue its fight to protect America's children and parental rights,"" she said on X. ""I encourage other states to follow Tennessee's lead and enact similar legislation to protect our kids.""

Plenty of golfers had their fair share of displeasure at this past weekend's U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania.

Shane Lowry outwardly proclaimed, ""f--- this place"" after missing a putt, and on Sunday, despite J.J. Spaun's late charge to take home his first major, only three people finished under par in the final round.

One of those three players was Xander Schauffele, whose +6 overall was tied for 12th in the tournament. The conditions were brutal from the jump, but the two-time major champ thought the course was ""very fair.""

""Everyone had to play the same course,"" Schauffele told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. 

Schauffele admitted there were ""weird breaks"" that occurred throughout the weekend when golfers toed the line with danger. However, ""You don't have to hit it in the bunkers or the rough – you can just hit it in the fairways.""

""I thought the course was fair. I thought it was more playable because it rained a little, and the fairways and greens were more forgiving,"" he added. ""You had to golf extremely well, which is what you're supposed to do to win a U.S. Open. You saw J.J. take control out of that rain delay, which is what you're supposed to do to win and be a major champ there.""

Schauffele will be one of several major champs at TPC River Highlands in Cromwell, Connecticut, this weekend for the Travelers Championship, where the last seven winning scores have been -22, -23, -19, -13, -19, -17, and -17, a polar opposite to U.S. Open scores.

The 2024 PGA and Open champion won the Travelers in 2022, and while everybody wants to shoot lower, Schauffele said having both types of golf is a good balance.

""A mixture of both is nice. It's healthy. I've never shied away from the U.S. Open challenge, and I've never shied away from -25 winning a tournament,"" Schauffele said. ""If you had to play Oakmont in U.S. Open conditions every week for 20 weeks, you'd wear yourself out, and vice versa. If you had to play a course where 25-under is winning for 20 weeks, you'd also wear yourself out. I think having a split and a little variety is nice for us.""

This year's Travelers has exactly what Schauffele wants as he aims to catch fire ahead of The Open, the FedEx Cup, and the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in what's been a ""weird"" season for him.

""They definitely have done some things to make TPC River Highlands more difficult,"" Schauffele said. ""Used to be lower rough, fairways used to be wider, they changed a couple holes to make it more difficult and less scoring-friendly… You're rewarded for really good shots, but there's water on a lot of holes, there's deep rough on some short-sided pins, a guy next to you can be shooting low, but you can be at even par not feeling great. I wouldn't call it a layup – you still have to be playing really good golf.""

However, it will be a stark difference from what went down in western Pennsylvania.

""It'll be weird to be able to make seven or eight birdies in a round versus at Oakmont.""

Republican Senator Jim Banks explains why Indiana Fever fans deserve an apology after the league's latest investigation during an appearance on OutKick's ""Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich.""  

Chicago Sky star Angel Reese was caught up in an intense moment on Tuesday night as the team fell to the Washington Mystics, 79-72.

Reese finished with 17 points, 10 rebounds and five assists and was an efficient 7-of-13 from the floor. However, she had a brief dustup with a Mystics player following a Sky player missing a shot.

As the players began to run back down the floor, Reese swiped at Mystics rookie Kiki Iriafen with her right hand. Iriafen fell to the floor after the contact. The play continued on, and it did not appear any fouls were given on the play.

Iriafen got the last laugh after the incident.

Washington was up three points with 35 seconds remaining in the game. As the shot clock wound down, Mystics guard Brittney Sykes missed a shot fading to her left when Iriafen was there to clean up the miss and put the ball in the basket.

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., explains how to 'deter' the Iranian terror regime on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.'

While the U.S. weighs its future involvement in the conflict between Iran and Israel, many leaders are looking with fresh eyes at Iran's activities targeting Americans worldwide over four decades. 

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., posted on Tuesday, ""The forever war is the war that Iran has waged against the U.S., Israel, and the civilized world since 1979."" 

The examples of Iran's involvement in attacks on Americans include direct and proxy attacks on U.S. forces, support for terror groups, and assassination efforts.

IRAN OFFICIAL ADMITS COUNTRY'S ROLE IN TERROR BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 US MILITARY MEMBERS: REPORT

In the early days of the Islamic revolution in 1979, radical Islamic students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's first supreme religious leader, took hold of the situation, spurning international appeals to release the hostages. The last U.S. hostages were released 444 days later.

In 2023, Sayyed Issa Tabatabai, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's representative in Lebanon, admitted during an interview with the state-controlled Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) that the Islamic Republic was involved in two 1983 bombings that killed Americans in Lebanon. 

The bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 63 victims, including 17 Americans. When two suicide truck bombs exploded at the barracks of multinational forces in Lebanon, 220 Marines, 18 U.S. Navy sailors and three U.S. Army soldiers were killed, and 58 French troops were murdered.

In the IRNA interview, Tabatabai said ""I quickly went to Lebanon and provided what was needed in order to [carry out] martyrdom operations in the place where the Americans and Israelis were."" He also stated that he received a fatwa from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordering him to carry out the attacks, though the IRNA removed the assertion ""shortly after publication,"" according to a report and translation of the interview from the Middle East Media Research Institute.

On June 25, 1996, 19 U.S. Air Force members were killed when a truck bomb exploded outside the Khobar Towers. Al Jazeera reported that in 2006, a U.S. court found the Iranian government responsible for the attack, committed by Saudi members of Hezbollah. The court ordered Iran to pay $254 million to victims of the attack. 

According to a 2019 Pentagon report cited by the Military Times, Iran bears responsibility for the deaths of 603 U.S. service members in Iraq between 2003 and 2011. This figure accounted for 17% of U.S. deaths in the country during the period.

In 2022, surviving family members and victims won a case against the Islamic Republic of Iran, using the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to hold the regime accountable for its support of terror actors who killed or injured 30 U.S. personnel in Afghanistan.

Bill Roggio, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and editor of the Long War Journal, testified in support of the victims. He told Fox News Digital that ""Iran's support for the Taliban and al Qaeda and the impact it had on the deaths and injuries to American soldiers and civilians is incalculable. Iran provided money, weapons, training, intelligence, and safe haven to Taliban subgroups across Afghanistan, including in the heart of the country in Kabul."" In Roggio's estimation, ""Iran's support for the Taliban was only rivaled by that of Pakistan. I would argue that Iran's extensive support facilitated nearly every Taliban attack on U.S. personnel.""

In 2022, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., found that Iran likewise owed damages to the families and victims of 40 U.S. service members who were injured or killed in Iraq due to Iran's support of terrorism in the country.

In attempted retribution for the murder of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran targeted two U.S. bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq with surface-to-surface missiles in 2020. 

In January 2024, three Americans were killed, and 25 others were wounded in a drone attack on an outpost in Jordan near the border with Syria. Two Iranians, one of whom had dual U.S. citizenship, were charged in connection with the attack.

At the time of the attack, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex) said that Iranian proxies had ""launched over 150 attacks on U.S. troops"" following Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks.

Roggio reported that on June 14, Iranian-backed militias ""launched three drones"" at Ain al Assad, a U.S. base in western Iraq. The drones were shot down before reaching their target. 

Roggio said that the drone attack ""appears to be an unsanctioned strike by an unnamed Iranian militia. Unlike past attacks, no group has claimed credit, and there have been no follow-on strikes."" He believes Iran ""wants to keep the U.S. out of the fight, as the U.S. military has the capability to hit the underground nuclear facility at Fordow.""

Between October 2023 and August 2024, Iranian-backed Islamic Resistance in Iraq militias launched 180 attacks against U.S. forces in Syria, Iraq and Jordan. Throughout their ""decades of experience,"" Roggio says Iraqi militias ""are estimated to have killed more than 600 U.S. service members.""

Just last year, Iran executed Jamshid Sharmahd. Sharmahd survived an assassination attempt in California in which an Iranian agent was convicted of the planned murder. He was then kidnapped by the Iranian regime in Dubai in 2020 as part of a business trip.

The history of prisoner exchanges between Iran and the U.S. dates back to 1979. The most recent prisoner exchange of five Americans imprisoned in Iran for five Iranians detained in the U.S. occurred in September 2023. As part of the deal, the U.S. released $6 billion in frozen assets in South Korea.

Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., spoke with Fox News Digital about his bipartisan bill to codify oversight of foreign adversaries, including China, buying American farmland.

EXCLUSIVE: Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts is leading the charge with Democrat Sen. John Fetterman to codify oversight on foreign countries buying American farmland.

The bipartisan Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure (AFIDA) Improvements Act seeks to implement recommendations published by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2024, which found the AFIDA was ill-equipped to combat foreign ownership of American agricultural land. 

""Communist China is our greatest geopolitical threat,"" Ricketts told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview, adding, ""This is a way for us to improve the disclosure that's going on with regard to the purchase of this agricultural land, so we can take other action if necessary to make sure we're not giving Communist China the opportunity to buy agricultural land.""

The bill's proposal comes as two Chinese nationals – a University of Michigan post-doctoral research fellow, Yunqing Jian, and Huazhong University of Science and Technology student Chengxuan Han – were held in federal custody after they were accused of smuggling biological materials into the United States.

The suspects have been charged with ""smuggling a fungus that has been described as a ""potential agroterrorism weapon"" into the heartland of America, where they apparently intended to use a University of Michigan laboratory to further their scheme,"" interm U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Jerome Gorgon said in a statement. 

AFTER UKRAINE'S SURPRISE DRONE ASSAULT ON RUSSIA, NEW ATTENTION DRAWN TO SENSITIVE SITES STATESIDE

The fungus causes a ""head blight,"" described as a disease of wheat, maize, rice and barley, and is responsible for billions of dollars of economic losses throughout the world each year, according to the Department of Justice. If ingested by humans, the substance can cause vomiting, liver damage and ""reproductive defects in humans and livestock."" 

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital that the Trump administration is focused on ""keeping our homeland secure"" through enhanced border screenings. 

""Protecting America's food supply and national security remains a top priority. Last week's smuggling attempt by Chinese nationals of Fusarium graminearum, a dangerous crop-destroying fungus, posing a significant bioterrorism threat, only highlights this imperative to combat this threat,"" McLaughlin said. 

""That could potentially be very damaging to agriculture,"" Ricketts told Fox News Digital. ""We also know that Chinese nationals have been trying to steal our biotechnology with regard to agriculture. They've also been crashing gates of bases. Supposed Chinese tourists have been flying drones around bases. Of course, the Chinese flew a surveillance balloon over our country when the Biden administration just let that happen.""

Ricketts said China has been aggressively buying American agriculture, ""which is why we need to have a heightened sense of vigilance around protecting our homeland.""

Foreign investors own over 40 million acres of agricultural land in the United States, and between 2010 and 2021, Chinese ownership of American agricultural land increased from 13,720 acres to 383,935 acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 

""It's not just about the number of acres that they own, but the fact that they own it around Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota or Fort Liberty in North Carolina. They're buying it around sensitive military installations,"" Ricketts said. 

The bill, also co-sponsored by Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, John Cornyn of Texas, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, requires AFIDA reporting for foreign persons holding more than 1% interest in American agricultural land.

The AFIDA Improvements Act aims to increase information-sharing between the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the USDA. It also requires updates to the AFIDA's handbook and establishes a deadline for USDA to set up an online AFIDA system.

Based on the GAO's recommendations, the bill seeks to update the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 to better equip the USDA to combat foreign adversaries' ownership of American agricultural land. 

""We are at the most dangerous point in our history right now since World War II,"" Ricketts said. ""We have to be investing in our military. We have to be supporting our friends around the world that are pushing back on these dictators. Communist China is one of them.""

Additionally, the bill comes as conflict in the Middle East reaches a boiling point between Iran and Israel, reigniting concerns about national security. Israel successfully coordinated attacks against Iran from inside the country, and Ricketts pointed to Ukraine's success in targeting a Russian air base.

""What Ukraine was able to do against Russia with their operation that destroyed some of their strategic bombers, and they placed trucks with drones close to an air base and had those drones attack their squadrons. We could be vulnerable to the same thing if China did that here. They've owned farmland close enough to our air bases to be able to launch a drone strike. That should be very concerning to us,"" Ricketts said. 

Ricketts added that American farmland should not be a ""tool that our adversaries, like Communist China, can use to attack us from inside our own country.""

There has been little movement on the bill since it was just recently introduced. That is largely because Senate Republicans are narrowly focused on advancing Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","How JD Vance's defense of Trump is different from other VPs backing their boss","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3445355/how-jd-vance-defense-trump-different-other-vice-presidents/","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 13:17:38 GMT","

When Vice President JD Vance weighed in to defend his boss, President Donald Trump, on Iran, he was coming from a different place than many of his predecessors.

Unlike Dick Cheney under George W. Bush, Vance isn't more hawkish than his senior partner or viewed as pushing for war behind the scenes. 

When Vance endorsed Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, the Ohioan said he was doing so in part because there were no new wars in Trump's first term. In the Signalgate controversy earlier this year, Vance was the most skeptical of the Yemen strikes of Trump's senior national security team. On the same day he defended Trump, Vance denied his staff was leaking information to the press that contradicted the administration's foreign-policy line. 

Unlike George H.W. Bush under Ronald Reagan, Vance isn't seen as less of a true believer than the boss or a throwback to an older form of Republicanism. Vance is seen as a more consistent and committed populist, even if Trump started the MAGA movement a decade ago.

During Trump's first term, Mike Pence was also a throwback to an earlier Republican era and a bridge between MAGA and the mainstream conservative movement. That is much less necessary in the second term, when Trump is the unquestioned leader of the party and the former vice president has taken to defending pre-Trump conservatism from populism.

Unlike Dan Quayle under Bush the elder, Vance isn't seen as a lightweight. Yes, he is much younger than Trump and was only a freshman senator when he was elected vice president. But Vance has written an acclaimed book, Hillbilly Elegy, and many articles about wonkish policy topics. He has proven an effective messenger for their successful 2024 campaign and the Trump administration.

Vance is an important figure in a political movement indisputably spawned by Trump. He is also serving as vice president under a term-limited president, giving him as big a stake as anyone in the administration's success ahead of the 2028 elections.

The vice president had been a Trump critic early on, and sometimes a harsh one. This did not stop Trump from endorsing Vance in a crowded, competitive Republican Senate primary in Ohio. Months after Vance won that primary and the general election as other Republican Senate candidates struggled in the 2022 midterms, he returned the favor by endorsing Trump's renomination, while Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) was still seen as a threat. Vance's endorsement also came before the first Trump indictment. 

Vance leapfrogged many more established Republicans to become Trump's running mate, including Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), Marco Rubio, the former Florida senator who is now secretary of state, Doug Burgum, the former North Dakota governor who is now secretary of the interior, and Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the first term who now appears to be on the outs with the vice president.

You would certainly expect the vice president to defend the president. Kamala Harris went down with the ship last year defending Joe Biden. But Vance is doing so from an unusual vantage point, as an important movement leader in his own right who by all appearances is being actively groomed as a successor. (Trump has downplayed, and sometimes even denied, 2028 succession plan talk.)

That's why Vance is in a position to try to reassure MAGA dissenters about any perceived Trump apostasies, though it may involve the expenditure of political capital the vice president will need later.

“President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads,” Vance said when the Trump-Musk feud began to spiral out of control. “I'm proud to stand beside him.”

When MAGA influencers began speaking out against Trump's support of Israel's military strikes on Iran and any U.S. involvement, Vance said, “I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue.”

TRUMP TESTS SUPPORTERS' FAITH A DECADE INTO HIS LEADERSHIP OF MAGA AND GOP 

Many of these same MAGA influencers had vouched for Vance over other potential VP picks or lobbied Trump to add him to the 2024 Republican ticket.

Vance has more credibility as a Trump defender than other subordinates in the administration. He also has a lot more riding on the outcome.

Burgeoning disagreements among Senate Democrats regarding the conflict between Israel and Iran have presented themselves as the latest challenge facing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). 

The New York lawmaker has experienced declining popularity in his own caucus amid myriad challenges this year following devastating results for Democrats, including in the Senate, during the 2024 elections.

Israel's recent attack on Iran has only served to intensify Schumer's troubles. As someone who has embraced pro-Israel stances, he now faces divisions among his ranks on the country's decision to attack Iran, as well as whether the United States should aid a war against the regime.

Schumer has remained silent on a war powers resolution that Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee, introduced on Monday. The resolution would require congressional debate and a vote before the U.S. takes any offensive measures to help Israel fight against Iran. 

And when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who caucuses with Democrats, introduced a bill this week seeking to bar funding for military force against Iran, Schumer declined to sponsor it, despite backing the same legislation in previous years. 

Despite Kiane and Sanders's outspoken stance, Schumer has yet to offer a public statement on the conflict since Trump signaled that military involvement could be coming earlier this week. Senior members of his administration have also declined to rule out such options.

Schumer's muted positioning over the past few days comes as his views on Israel differ sharply from members of his caucus, such as Sanders, making it difficult for the increasingly unpopular Senate minority leader to navigate politically as he seeks to hold on to power.

When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week launched a series of strikes against Iran directed at destroying its nuclear program, ballistic missile capabilities, and military leadership, Schumer initially issued a strong statement affirming the Jewish nation's right to defend itself from nuclear threats, while calling for diplomatic solutions to de-escalate the situation, similar to the Trump administration's approach.

“The United States' commitment to Israel's security and defense must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran's response,” he wrote. 

“The Iranian regime's stated policy has long been to destroy Israel and Jewish communities around the world. I have long said that Israel has a right to defend itself and that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,” the Senate's Democratic leader continued.

Such language has already set Schumer up for likely conflicts with conference members such as Sanders, who said, “This attack was specifically designed to sabotage American diplomatic efforts: Israel assassinated the man overseeing Iran's nuclear negotiating team, despite the fact that further talks with the United States were scheduled for Sunday. Whatever you think of the corrupt and authoritarian Iranian regime, this attack clearly violates international law and the United Nations Charter.”

Schumer's latest troubles add to a trend of aging establishment figures falling out of favor with their colleagues and struggling to corral raucous liberal elements of the party. 

Voters have also handed Schumer a searing report card as he seeks to lead the minority in the Senate, with an April poll of younger voters revealing just 23% approve of the job congressional Democrats were doing. 

Amid the dismal numbers, the Senate leader faces a tough path in boosting Democrats' power in the upper chamber ahead of the 2026 elections. An unfavorable 2026 Senate map could become even more challenging as Democratic incumbents keep retiring, with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) continuing this trend in April.

After losing the majority in the Senate to the GOP last November and more recently acquiescing to Trump's demands to move a key government spending bill forward, Schumer has faced calls to step down as leader. Some Democrats have proposed that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) should challenge him for his Senate seat. 

US MILITARY BOLSTERING MIDDLE EAST PRESENCE AMID ISRAEL-IRAN WAR

The turmoil in Schumer's corner echoes chaos in national Democratic quarters and the dismal view voters across the country have of the party.

Intra-party struggles with David Hogg at the Democratic National Committee illustrate tensions between the progressive and establishment wings of the party, as well as growing calls for younger leadership as aging power players, including Schumer, grapple to retain authority. Earlier this year, the GOP took its largest-ever advantage over Democrats in favorability ratings. As Democrats shed support, particularly from male and Hispanic voters, another poll this spring put the party's favorability rating at a record low of 29%.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Senate Republicans will put the focus back on former President Joe Biden with their first hearing Wednesday on his cognitive status while in office and whether ex-White House officials shielded his health decline.

The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear testimony from former first-term Trump administration officials, including Sean Spicer, while Democrats will boycott proceedings they deride as a “political undertaking” unworthy of the panel's time.

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE: WHAT TO KNOW AS TRUMP ORDERS AN INVESTIGATION INTO HIS PREDECESSOR

Here's what to expect from the GOP-led hearing titled “Unfit to Serve: How the Biden Cover-Up Endangered America and Undermined the Constitution.”

The hearing will feature three Republican witnesses, two of whom served in Trump's first term.

The witnesses are Spicer, former Trump White House press secretary and communications director; the Claremont Institute's Theodore Wold, former acting assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy under Trump and former deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy; and the University of Virginia School of Law's John Harrison.

Democrats declined to call any witnesses as part of their snubbing the hearing, which will be led by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Eric Schmitt (R-MO).

In a preview of his message to senators, Spicer suggested he planned to criticize media coverage of Trump's first term compared to how the press treated Biden's presidency.

“The scrutiny that was baselessly directed at President Trump during his first term was wholly absent from the media coverage of the Biden White House,” Spicer told the Washington Examiner. “The media lacked any sense of curiosity that would naturally stem from what the public could see with their own eyes. Even in the face of deeply concerning — and public — signs of President Biden's mental and physical decline, legacy media outlets were silent.”

The hearing will center more on the constitutional and procedural implications of Biden's perceived unfitness and center less on medical testimony or direct claims of cognitive impairment.

The focus is expected to lean toward questions of executive authority, such as whether officials were making decisions in the White House during key moments of Biden's presidency rather than the commander in chief, as well as what role aides or advisers may have played in concealing his limitations.

“I think we're going to be very forward-looking,” Schmitt told the Washington Examiner. “I think it's important that people have faith that they actually have a president who makes decisions and not by autopen or a bunch of nameless staffers, which is what was happening. … It's just exploring all aspects of the failure and making sure it doesn't happen again.”

Cornyn said he has questions about the Cabinet's ability to remove a sitting president via the 25th Amendment, such as who is “accountable when the Cabinet fails to do its duty?” and “are there penalties for failing to act?”

“Most importantly, as part of our legislative responsibilities, should Congress consider amending the 25th Amendment further to further clarify responsibilities and protocols in case this disaster befalls our nation again?” Cornyn said in Senate floor remarks. 

Republicans plan to use the hearing to explore the alleged internal “cover-up,” not just within the administration but also the media, regarding Biden's capacity. GOP senators are likely to highlight concerns about whether anyone else was effectively calling the shots during periods when Biden appeared visibly unaware or when he was out of the public eye.

Last week, Trump briefly attempted to link former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco to the immigration crisis and Biden's use of an autopen in office. The device, used by presidents for decades for signatures on letters and other superlative purposes that House investigations have zeroed in on, is traditionally less used for executive orders or pardons.

“We're moving murderers out of our country that were put here by Biden or the autopen. The autopen really did it. I mean, the people — whether it's Lisa Monaco or whoever operated the autopen — these are criminals,” Trump said. “People are criminals who allow criminals into our country. And I don't think that Biden knew what the hell he was doing. I don't think he even knew about it.”

While Trump's reference to Monaco and the autopen were vague, his remarks came as he and other Republicans, including an outside government watchdog group, have accused the former president of handling multitudes of official acts using the device.

The Oversight Project, formerly an extension of the conservative Heritage Foundation, claims to have uncovered three separate autopen signatures used during Biden's presidency. It further alleges that there were at least eight separate occasions that the device was used on days when Biden was already signing separate legislation from the White House with an in-person signature.

It “raises serious questions about why the autopen was used so frequently when the President was readily available to sign these critical documents personally,” the Oversight Project said in a statement.

Biden, who is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, has denied that his staff acted without his direction. His legal team has said the use of an autopen is a well-established legal practice, though Republicans and Trump have questioned whether Biden was aware of all the executive agenda items and pardons that were signed using the device.

“I made the decisions during my presidency,” Biden said in a statement earlier this month.

Judiciary Committee Democrats will skip out on the hearing, designed by Republicans to offer a table-setter for ensuing GOP-led inquiries on Biden. Their absence is part of a broader strategy by Democrats to ignore what they consider dubious political fishing expeditions by Republicans.

“We have so many important topics to consider, and this is a totally political undertaking by several of my colleagues,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), the panel's top Democrat. “It is a waste of the Senate Judiciary Committee's time.”

Durbin will offer opening remarks and then depart.

Other Judiciary Committee Democrats either declined to comment on whether they would participate or appeared inclined to skip out also.

“I think the hearing is more performative and theatrical than anything else,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told the Washington Examiner. “I'm not super interested in going to it. It's not an issue that really involves what I view as my job as a United States senator.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) chastised Republicans for being “unrelenting in diversionary actions,” accusing them of trying to divert focus from President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill being debated in Congress by the GOP.

“It's one of their many circus-like diversions that is a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing,” Schumer told reporters, borrowing a line from William Shakespeare's play Macbeth.

Schmitt, the hearing's Republican co-chairman, said that “even the Democrats can't defend Joe Biden's shadow presidency.”

“It's a shame Democrats are once again turning a blind eye and refusing to confront the truth — that Biden was unfit to govern, and those closest to him knew it all along,” Schmitt told the Washington Examiner.

The hearing offers a preview of what may come from other ongoing, more in-depth GOP-led investigations into Biden.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) is conducting his own inquiry behind the scenes. He has contacted more than two dozen current and former aides seeking “voluntary” interviews about Biden's health in office, a debate that was reignited last month with the former president's cancer diagnosis.

DEMOCRATS TO SNUB SENATE GOP HEARING ON BIDEN MENTAL DECLINE ‘COVER-UP'

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) is running a parallel but far more aggressive investigation that has homed in on his use of the autopen. Comer recently subpoenaed Biden's physician for a deposition.

And the Justice Department, at the direction of Trump, will conduct a vast investigation into Biden's health, the alleged cover-up, and whether someone else may have been secretly in control of the Oval Office.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stood defiant in the face of President Donald Trump's threats, saying any intervention would be met with “irreparable damage.”

In a televised address, Khamenei sought to reassure Iranians amid increasing signals that the United States could join Israel in its assault on Iran. He turned to Iranian history to wave off Trump's threats, warning of retaliation if any actions were taken against Tehran.

“Intelligent people who know Iran, the nation, and the history of Iran will never speak to this nation in the language of threats, because the Iranian nation cannot be surrendered,” Khamenei said. “The Americans should know that any U.S. military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage.”

He added that Iran “will stand firm against an imposed war, just as it will stand firm against an imposed peace.”

“This nation will not surrender to anyone in the face of imposition,” Khamenei added.

His remarks about an imposed peace were primarily a reference to Trump's Tuesday Truth Social post that said, “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”

Other Iranian officials echoed Khamenei's comments. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Iran's Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said, “Any American intervention would be a recipe for an all-out war in the region.”

Intervention “would be extremely reckless, extremely irresponsible,” he continued while signaling an openness for continued diplomacy.

“Diplomacy never ends,” Baghaei remarked.

Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Ali Bahreini said Trump's calls for unconditional surrender were “very hostile,” and he promised that Iran was ready to “respond very firmly” if the U.S. intervened.

“There is a line which, if crossed, there should be a response on our side. And that line will be defined by our relevant authorities, including military forces,” he said.

A response from Iran could include attacks on vulnerable U.S. bases scattered across Iraq, Syria, and other Middle Eastern countries. Though considerably weakened by Israeli strikes since Oct. 7, 2023, Iran still has hundreds of thousands of militiamen it can call upon through its proxy forces, primarily based out of Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen.

Trump signaled a change in rhetoric over the past several days following Israel's success in its decapitation strikes against Iran. On Tuesday, he taunted Khamenei by suggesting the U.S. knew where he was hiding and may choose to assassinate him in the future.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” he said in a post on Truth Social, referring to Khamenei. “He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

The U.S. has moved military assets to the Middle East in preparation for a possible strike against Iran, including refueling aircraft and naval vessels. Israel is relying on the U.S.'s 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs to hit Iran's underground Fordo nuclear enrichment facility, buried hundreds of feet underground in the side of a mountain.

Reports increasingly indicate that Trump may soon order limited strikes against Iran's nuclear program.

“The movement right now is away from diplomacy and toward U.S. involvement,” a Trump administration official told Politico's Dasha Burns. “We are moving toward taking out Iranian nuclear facilities.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Texas Republican Party is looking to close its primaries, setting up a legal battle in court.

Texas has open primaries, allowing any voters to vote in party primaries, including voters who align with the opposing party. The practice favors centrist candidates, who can rely on independent and Democratic centrists to support them over more partisan candidates. The Texas Republican Party, among the most conservative in the country, is looking to end the practice in order to favor more conservative candidates.

“As Chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, I am fully committed to upholding the rules, priorities, and platform adopted by our delegates,” Chairman Abraham George said in a statement after a motion to close the primaries was overwhelmingly passed by the State Republican Executive Committee. “This is not just about a rule change — it's about protecting the integrity of our elections and defending the voice of our conservative base.”

“Our primaries should reflect Republican values — not outside interference,” George added. “The grassroots are demanding action, and the SREC is delivering. We are putting Texas Republicans back in charge of Texas Republican elections.”

A press release from the party said the decision “reflects the will of Texas grassroots conservatives” and reflects the vote of delegates in the 2024 State Convention. It further warned that open primaries allowed “Democrats and progressive activists to manipulate Republican outcomes, weakening our candidates and diluting our values.”

“With this amendment, the Republican Party of Texas sends a clear message: we will not allow our nomination process to be hijacked,” the release said, adding that it was part of a broader conservative mission to protect election integrity and party sovereignty.

The move would all but seal incumbent Sen. John Cornyn's (R-TX) fate in the 2026 Senate primary. The senator is far behind in polls to state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Trump ally looking to oust the long-serving centrist.

Open primaries could also spell trouble for Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) and Tony Gonzales (R-TX), both relative centrists who have faced tough primary challengers in the past.

Though the preferred move of most Texas Republicans, it is likely to set up a lengthy legal battle.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The future of the struggling car company rests on Elon Musk more than ever before.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Before DOGE, there was Twitter. In 2023, Elon Musk seemed too distracted by his latest venture to run the world's most valuable car company. Tesla was faltering as he focused on remaking (and renaming) the social-media network. So at Tesla's investor-day event in Austin that March, Musk responded with a rare show of force. He was joined onstage by a cadre of more than a dozen of the company's top executives, all to signal that even if he was extremely busy, Tesla was run by a world-class team: “We've obviously got significant bench strength here,” Musk said. Sure enough, Tesla closed out 2023 with the best sales it's ever had.



Musk is in bad need of a similar comeback right now as he returns from Washington to focus on his struggling car company. In recent months, Tesla sales have plummeted as the chain-saw-wielding, far-right centibillionaire has turned off traditionally liberal electric-car buyers. The MAGA faithful never stepped up to take their place, and they're less likely to do so now that the Trump-Musk bromance is over. Musk has other problems: Tesla created the modern electric car as we know it, but now the automaker is falling behind the competition while Musk is more focused on AI and robots than selling cars. And on top of everything else, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act working its way through Congress could cost Tesla billions each year.

This time around, however, Musk can't lean on that aforementioned bench even if he wants to. Something similar to DOGE's steep staffing cuts has been playing out at Tesla. About a third of the executives who stood onstage with him two years ago have left Tesla or been ousted. Many other high-profile company leaders have resigned. Just since April, Tesla has lost its head of software engineering, head of battery technology, and head of humanoid robotics. Tens of thousands of rank-and-file employees left last year amid waves of mass layoffs. At the end of the day, Tesla is the Musk show: The company is the biggest source of his wealth, and is core to his reputation as a tech genius. Now, after all of the pivots and attrition, the future of Tesla rests singularly on Musk more than it ever has.

Read: The Tesla revolt

To longtime Tesla chroniclers such as myself, the chaotic, rapid-fire cuts that defined Musk's tenure at DOGE felt familiar from the very beginning. The playbook was pioneered at Tesla. When Musk took over as CEO in 2008, Tesla was a start-up struggling to build its first car. His early infusions of personal cash, ruthless approach to cost cutting, and, in his words, “hardcore” work environment are widely credited with getting the automaker up and running. He has a famous approach to any type of problem: Get rid of preconceived notions, tear everything down, and rebuild from there. If things break, so be it. They can probably be repaired later on. At one point, the company got rid of the traditional turn-signal switch on some cars before later putting them back. (Tesla and Musk did not respond to my requests for comment.)



For a long time, the strategy worked. In the span of a decade, Tesla rose from a start-up to an auto giant worth more than Ford, Toyota, and GM combined—despite selling just a fraction of the cars its rivals did. That's why investors still back Musk today. He's made them a lot of money before, so if things get bad, he's the man to figure it out, right? Musk himself has helped promulgate the idea that he has all the answers. At one point, he said he would personally start approving some of his employees' expenses amid a “hardcore” round of cost cutting. “He has always been the kind of person who says, ‘I am the only one who can do this,'” Sam Abuelsamid, an auto-industry analyst at the research firm Telemetry, told me. In 2018, when I was the editor in chief of the auto publication Jalopnik, Tesla's now-defunct communications team frantically admonished us for reporting that Doug Field, the company's top engineer, had left the company. He was merely the top vehicle engineer, a spokesperson said. Musk—despite not being trained as an engineer—was the top engineer.

In 2019, an analysis from the financial firm Bernstein put Tesla's executive-turnover rate at nearly double the average of comparable Silicon Valley companies; the number was “dramatically higher” among Musk's direct reports as well. Layoffs and firings have sometimes felt more mercurial than anything else. Consider the team behind Tesla's charging network. In June 2023, I wrote that Tesla's fast and reliable “Superchargers” were its secret weapon; other automakers had begun building cars using Tesla's proprietary charging port to give their customers Supercharger access. About a year later, Tesla laid off the entire 500-person team. Many of the staffers were later rehired and returned, but not all: Rebecca Tinucci, Tesla's head of charging, left for good. The Supercharger network has grown since then, though not without a period of chaos for the automaker and the entire car industry that bet on it. The cuts to Tesla's charging workforce were part of a bigger reduction in headcount last year: Within the first six months of 2024, Tesla had shed nearly 20,000 employees, according to internal data viewed by CNBC. And Tesla's latest quarterly SEC filing, released in April, boasts of “a $52 million decrease in employee and labor costs” compared with last year. (In reporting this story, I reached out to roughly a dozen current and former Tesla staffers. None would talk with me on the record.)



Last year's layoffs, Musk said, were designed to position the company for its “next phase of growth.” Based on everything he's said so far, that means AI. He has promised that robots and driverless cars will eventually deliver “a trillion dollars of profit a year.” Several top executives and engineers have resigned after they reportedly clashed with Musk on his pivot. This month, Tesla is tentatively set to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, starting with what Musk has said will be “10 to 12” self-driving Teslas that can also be remotely operated by humans if needed. In other words, the company has a long way to go before it's anywhere close to something like a driverless Uber. For now, the company still makes its money from selling cars, and Tesla has lost many of the smart people who helped create what was once an innovative automotive juggernaut. Musk still does have several long-standing deputies at the company, including Tom Zhu, a senior vice president who previously led Tesla's operations in China, and Lars Moravy, who leads vehicle engineering. But the departures put more pressure on Musk: He doesn't have the workforce he once did to build to make groundbreaking electric vehicles.



The silver lining for the future of electric vehicles is that these former Tesla staffers are fanning out to the rest of the car industry. Take Field, the former head Tesla engineer (or “head vehicle engineer,” in Tesla's telling). He now leads advanced vehicle software at Ford, as well as a program tasked with making an affordable EV. Tinucci, the former head of Tesla's charging team, is now overseeing Uber's shift to electric vehicles. “I think we'll see kind of a Tesla diaspora,” Kristin Hull, the founder of Nia Impact Capital, an investment firm with a stake in Tesla, told me. “The rest of the world is catching up. And I think that's also playing a part in why the talent is moving on.” (Field and Tinucci didn't respond to requests for comment.)



Musk's detractors might easily fall into schadenfreude. His actions might finally be catching up with him. But if Tesla continues to slide, there will be ramifications beyond Musk and his investors simply losing money. Tesla remains one of the very few companies outside of China that is making money by selling electric cars, which makes it uniquely capable of making a super-affordable EV. Every day that goes by without cheaper options, Americans who might be inclined to go electric are instead buying gas-burning cars that could be on the road for a decade or more. Meanwhile, other carmakers have spent years racing to build cleaner cars in large part to keep up with Tesla. Without the company's continued dominance, it's easy to see a heavily polluting industry fall back on old habits. The risk is particularly high right now as the Trump administration is betting big on fossil fuels.

Whether Tesla can rebound will test something truly scarce—not Musk's wealth but the faith that others have in him. Musk has already alienated people on the left and right, but many people still fiercely believe in his ability to make them rich. At some point, even they might start to vanish.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Backing the most anti-Western Middle Eastern power was convenient until it wasn't.

Sign up for Trump's Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.



Iran is suffering blow after blow, and Russia, its most powerful supporter, is apparently not prepared to do much of anything about it.

Not long ago, backing the West's least-favorite power in the Middle East had its uses. In prosecuting his war of attrition in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has made confrontation with the West the organizing principle of his foreign policy. In that context, edging closer to Iran and its partners in the “Axis of Resistance” made sense.

Tehran was also an important supplier: It delivered Shahed drones for Russian use in Ukraine at a moment when these were particularly crucial to Moscow's war-fighting capacity. Then came the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, followed by Israel's brutal war in Gaza. Leaning into pro-Palestinian and anti-Western sentiment allowed Russia to score points with global public opinion.

But dynamics that initially seemed to benefit Russia quickly became a strategic headache. First, Israel devastated Iran's partners Hamas and Hezbollah; then, in April and October 2024, Iran attacked Israel directly with strikes that yielded only minimal damage, suggesting that Iran's missile capabilities were not all that formidable. Israel retaliated, impairing Iran's missile production and air defenses, including its Russian-made S-300 missile systems. Suddenly, Iran looked weak, and Russia had a choice: It could shore up its Middle Eastern ally, or it could cut its losses in a troubled region.

That Moscow could not or would not intervene decisively on behalf of its anti-Western partners in the Middle East became obvious in December 2024, when Syrian rebels ousted Bashar al-Assad, Russia's longtime ally. Iran and Russia continued to cooperate in areas such as electronic warfare and satellite development, and they even signed a strategic-partnership treaty in January. But Russia declined to give Iran the support it would have needed—say, advanced fighter jets or sophisticated air defenses—to deter or better defend itself against further Israeli attacks.

Read: ‘This war is not helping us'

The truth is that Russia has always had limits as to how far it would go in supporting Iran. The Kremlin's obsessive anti-Western agenda elevated the Islamic Republic's importance as a partner, but Putin still has other interests in the region—a long-standing, if complicated, relationship with Israel and a need to coordinate with OPEC on oil prices, for instance—and so remained mindful of Israeli and Gulf State red lines when it came to defense cooperation with Iran. What's more, Russia was never going to risk military entanglement on behalf of its partner, especially not while it has had its hands full closer to home.

Finally, Russia may no longer have much appetite for cooperating with Western states in curbing the spread of nuclear weapons, but it has never wanted Iran to cross the nuclear threshold. The Kremlin takes American warnings on this score seriously and has sought to avoid U.S. military action against Iran. And it has never wished for Iran to acquire the global status that nuclear weapons would confer—among other reasons, because Moscow knows that it would lose leverage over a nuclear Iran.

Russia stands to gain some advantages from a protracted war between Iran and Israel. The fighting would torpedo President Donald Trump's attempts to broker a nuclear deal with Iran—making the United States look weak and highlighting its inability to keep Israel on a leash. Oil prices would stay elevated, especially if Iran were to close the Strait of Hormuz. This would relieve some pressure on Russia's state finances. U.S. missile interceptors—and world attention—would be diverted from Ukraine to the Middle East. Sure, Iran would have to stop sending Russia weapons for an indefinite period. But Russia has already succeeded in localizing the production of Iranian-designed drones and sources the components from elsewhere.

Still, Iran's humiliation at the hands of a U.S. ally can hardly please Russia's leaders. Israel has already claimed freedom of movement in the skies over Iran. Russia may also worry that a long war in Iran could destabilize the South Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), where Russia has interests but for which it has had precious little bandwidth during the war in Ukraine. Nor would Moscow welcome unrest that hastens the end of the Iranian regime.

A cornered Iran could also lash out, leave the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or dash for the bomb, laying bare the limits of Moscow's leverage over Tehran. Russia would probably like to avoid having Iran go nuclear—but it would also prefer not to see the U.S. sweep in with military action that further weakens Iran.

Read: What Trump knew about the attack against Iran

On Saturday, Putin congratulated Trump on his birthday and offered to support U.S. efforts to negotiate with Iran (he had made a similar offer in early March). Ever since the inauguration, Moscow has been signaling its appetite to work with Washington on geopolitical dossiers—in part to stall on a Ukraine cease-fire. Iran presents a rare opportunity for Putin to return to the stage of great-power diplomacy by negotiating an issue of global consequence. The question is: What can Russia bring to the table?

A defenseless Iran will not respond well to Russian sticks, and in any case, Moscow is unlikely to take a punitive approach to Tehran. Russia may not have shown up as Iran's knight in shining armor, but the two countries are still partners, and they are fundamentally united in an anti-Western agenda. Russia also has few meaningful carrots to offer Iran at this point and will be cautious about providing military equipment in a moment when Israel is systematically destroying it. And Putin is not someone who likes to openly side with what appears to be the losing party.

Russia can potentially play a practical role in a future agreement, having offered to remove Iran's highly enriched uranium and convert it into civilian-reactor fuel for Tehran. But Russia's technical schemes cannot bridge what is a fundamental political divide between a U.S. administration that insists on zero enrichment and an Iran that views such a demand as a call to surrender.

Strategically isolated and acutely vulnerable, Iran will be even more distrustful of the United States than it was before Israel's attack, and it will want Russia involved for at least the appearance of balance. But Russia has little influence over the outcome of the war, Iran's next steps, or Washington's decision as to whether it will engage militarily.

When it comes to shaping events far from Russia's borders, Moscow is only so interested and only so able, particularly given its deep investment in the war in Ukraine. Having anti-Western partners in the Middle East serves its purpose. But no one should hold their breath waiting for Russia to come to the rescue of Iran.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Learning to yap could solve the male loneliness epidemic

What does it mean to be “good” at gossip? 

A good gossip doesn't just tell you that Sally broke up with Joe, they tell you that Sally broke up with Joe just a week after posting a bunch of (now deleted) romantic international vacation pics to Instagram. They don't simply say “Brittany's a bad coworker,” they tell you that no one at the office likes Britt because she microwaves her asparagus-heavy meal preps. They don't mention that Mary is having a tough time with her sister-in-law and then drop it, they explain that her brother's wife is a Disney adult who arranged for the entire family to spend their next Thanksgiving at Epcot and already sent out Venmo requests for a couple thousand dollars worth of Mickey Mouse breakfasts.

According to stereotype, this is a skill men — particularly straight men — just don't have. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Their supposed inability to spin a good yarn has been a point of internet mockery, with memes and gags usually coming from the women in their lives who are forced to parse through the driest, most unsatisfying stories ever told. Like a hungry person fighting their way through a well-done steak, these tea-seekers must suffer to find a semblance of sustenance. 

It's hard not to laugh at the tension these skits and jokes highlight between the person wanting the entire story and the person giving them absolutely nothing. But underneath the comedy are deeper questions about the ethics, the stigma, and the history of gossip, especially who gets to participate. The way that the women who poke fun at their partner's reticence online seek (and are denied) connection speaks to larger concerns. What does dude's inability to share secrets — especially with other bros — mean for the much-discussed “loneliness crisis” among men? 

When people say that men are bad at gossiping, it might come with the assumption that men don't gossip. They can't be good at it, because they don't or only rarely partake. But that train of thought is built on a fallacy. 

That fallacy begins with how we define gossip. For a long time, it's had a negative connotation, the act of talking poorly about someone behind their back. But more and more recently, researchers and social scientists like Megan Robbins have begun reassessing the term, broadening it to define all the ways we talk about other people, good, bad, and neutral. 

Robbins and her team conducted a 2019 study that examined the rates at which men and women gossip and if men and women had any differences when it comes to positive (e.g., “John bought a pair of nice shoes!”), negative (“John bought a pair of ugly shoes!”) and neutral (“John bought a pair of shoes.”). They found that men and women gossip positively and negatively at similar rates, but that women gossip neutrally more than men. 

“It really corresponds with past evidence that women talk more about social topics than men,” Robbins, an associate professor in psychology at the University of California Riverside, says. “So there's this practice element to talking about social topics, talking about people, even just in a neutral way, and men are just not doing it as much in the evidence that we have.” 

Robbins's study helps explain a few things. It debunks the trope that women are more inclined to disparage someone, and, at the same time, explains why people may perceive that women are better at gossiping or sharing information — if they're gossiping neutrally at a higher rate, so they have more practice. The project also shows that despite the stereotypes, men do gossip, positively and negatively. 

More than that, men enjoy gossip, even (and especially) when they're at the center of it. A 2025 study from professor Andrew Hales and his research team found that men, more than women, “were consistently more open” to being talked about. 

“I mean it, maybe it's as simple as men just like attention,” Hales, who teaches at the University of Mississippi, tells me. Hales's study focused on the targets of gossip, setting up a theoretical scenario in which a person leaves a party and then is asked whether they want the people who stayed to talk about them. Hales and his team found that people who were male and/or narcissistic were the most likely to want to be spoken about, even if the gossip was going to be negative.

“If you were to control for narcissism, men still are more comfortable being talked about than women are — so it's not just that men are more narcissistic, although they are,” Hales says, noting that the findings contradicted the popular ideas about how men don't enjoy gossip nor particularly like being the targets of it. 

The population who have been thought to like gossip the least, actually enjoy its existence as much, if not more, than everyone else. But if that's the case, why are they notoriously awful at it?

Comedian and podcaster Jared Freid intuitively believes what Robbins's study proves: that uninspired male gossips just haven't put in the work, like weight lifters who regularly skip leg day. 

“I just don't think there's as many reps for men hearing a crazy story, and there's a lot more reps for women,” Freid, a man, tells me. “We're just not trained, you know?” 

Freid primarily attributes men's unskillful gossip to a lack of cultural opportunities to yap freely. He sees things like weekend brunches, group chats, and the ample discussion fodder provided by Bravo's various reality shows as opportunities that mostly women have to sharpen their storytelling tools and observe how drama works firsthand. These conversations teach a person how to gab and, perhaps more importantly, how to respond to spicy information. Gossip is a two-way street; a question or quip can enrich the entire tale. 

Straight men, he says, don't have an equivalent. 

While men do hang out, it never gets too chatty. Freid explains that gossip feels “messy” and, even something as simple as being curious about a story or a rumor could be construed as stirring the pot (men, he says, do not want to be seen as pot-stirrers). It's not that straight men are inherently bad at gossip, it's that they won't allow themselves to openly partake in or enjoy it. 

“I don't think guys are really allowed to be messy and still have social credibility,” Freid says. 

Kelsey McKinney, the author of You Didn't Hear This From Me: (Mostly) True Notes on Gossip and the founding host of the Normal Gossip podcast, sees this fear from men, too. “Straight men seem to have the perception that gossip isn't talking about other people,” McKinney says. “Gossip, to them, is a tone of voice that they avoid at all costs.” 

This attitude grows out from a misogynistic idea that gossip is a negative thing that women do, something Robbins, the social scientist, considered during her research. 

“There's a stereotype that women [negatively] gossip more than men, but there hasn't been a whole lot of evidence for that,” Robbins tells Vox. “And I feel like having the stereotype that women gossip more than men, you know, serves to keep them in their place, right?”

Robbins believes that social skills are valuable, and being able to discuss social topics is a necessary piece of that puzzle. Yet historically, those abilities haven't always been prized. Dismissing all social talk as gossip was a way to dismiss the women who possess those talents. 

Now, so many men see gossip as unbecoming as well as unmanly, they don't allow themselves to really relish the juicy morsels, nor do they tease out the savory bits. 

Curiously, Freid is the co-host of the Betches media-produced podcast U Up? It's a show devoted to decoding dating and relationships. His professional life revolves around piquing people's interests and recounting people's stories in hilarious ways. Does that mean the careers Freid's chosen are at odds with his manhood? 

“I had to learn to be a better storyteller,” Freid tells me. To do that? He talked to women; friends, his co-host, his coworkers at Betches. A lot of women.

Okay, so men might be less adept at gossip. Do they really need to be good at it?

As Robbins indicated, continuing research shows that gossip can be a helpful social tool. Talking about other people isn't just “not all bad,” it can be actively good. McKinney says that social scientists and psychologists have been reassessing the tropes, narratives, and stigma surrounding gossip and gossipers, and they've found that gossip brings people closer together. The idea is that the individual piece of gossip is less important than the bond that's forged when someone shares information with another person. 

Maybe the true measure of a friendship is the “Can I be a bitch for a second?” texts we sent along the way. 

We share stories with people we think we are close to, and sharing things with other people creates intimacy. The gossip we share, arguably, is as much about our own values and beliefs and dislikes as it is about other people. 

At the same time, over the past half-decade or so, much has been made of what's known as the male loneliness epidemic — the idea that men are lonelier than ever and that their friendships are dwindling. 

If intimacy is defined, in part, by the idea of sharing stories with one another, it's not that difficult to see men who are bad at gossip hit with a lose-lose situation. They don't have the close friendships that facilitate gossip and the bond-building that comes with it, and they don't get good enough at gossip to initiate the bond-building. That's a problem, because men are disadvantaged when it comes to intimacy and communication from an early age.

“Research shows that by the time little boys are 3, we talk to them less and touch them less,” Alexandra Solomon, a relationship psychologist at Northwestern University, tells me. Solomon says that fewer conversations and less physical affection in childhood have long-lasting social effects.

As boys grow up, many will tend to see communication as transactional, or directive, or a means to solving problems instead of an avenue that builds relationships. Those men see the sharing of gossip and storytelling in general as uncomfortable or a taboo, instead of intimately sharing and engaging with a story. 

“I really think there's a male fear of incriminating yourself.”

“I really think there's a male fear of incriminating yourself,” Freid, the comedian and man, tells me. “I don't hear someone telling me their story and go, Oh, good. I can tell them all my stories.” 

Freid says he sees male friendships and female friendships as fundamentally different, echoing Solomon's explanation of the divergent ideas about communication. Female friendships, he says, involves a give-and-go, a trading of shoulders to cry on. That “trading” allows for deeper friendships among women — but, he suspects, also opens the door for potential rifts when someone doesn't hold up their end of the bargain. Fried takes some comfort in the idea that he never has to worry about hypothetically disappointing his buddies. 

“I just have no friends where I'd be like, I can't believe they haven't called recently,” he says. 

It's not too hard, though, to link not expecting anyone to check in with a larger, existential problem with loneliness. Is that lack of expectation worth the lack of support? If Saturdays are proverbially for the boys, why not mix in some yapping? If straight men (statistically) gossip anyway, is there real harm in openly enjoying it, seeking it out, using it to build connections? As easy as that seems, it's asking men to share things about themselves in ways that go against how they've been conditioned. 

“I would actually be out of a job if men could do that,” Solomon, the psychologist at Northwestern, tells me. “If the trade-off is not having a career, but men talked and shared more? I would do it.” 

Not to tell tales out of school, but from what I've heard, Solomon's job security isn't in danger.

Lindsey Graham (SC) who want the United States to impose its will on the world by force. On the other, you have the “America First” crowd — like Tucker Carlson and Vice President JD Vance — who want the US to withdraw from international commitments and refocus its attention on domestic concerns.

The big question, as always, is where President Donald Trump lands. If Trump says that the MAGA foreign policy is one thing, then that's what it is — and the rest of the party falls in line.

On one read, Trump's early response to the Israel-Iran war settles the debate in the hawks' favor. After months of opposing an Israeli strike, Trump rapidly flipped after the attack looked more and more successful. Since then, his rhetoric has grown increasingly heated, opening the door to possible US involvement. And he has publicly attacked Carlson for criticizing the war, writing on Truth Social that “somebody [should] please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that, ‘IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!'”

And yet, I think the factional debate remains far less settled than it seems. In fact, I believe it will remain unsettled as long as Trump is in power.

Trump's own foreign policy thinking does not align neatly with either of the two main camps. The president does not do systematic foreign policy, but rather acts on the basis of a collection of impulses that could never amount to anything so grandiose as a doctrine. Those gut instincts include a sense that the United States should look out for itself only, ignore any rules or norms that might constrain it, use force aggressively without regard to civilian casualties, and seek “deals” with other states that advantage the United States and/or make Donald Trump look good personally.

It looks, in effect, like an internationalized version of Trump's approach to New York real estate in the 1980s and 1990s.

This isn't a new observation: I've been making versions of this case since his 2016 campaign, and it's been well-supported by both his first term and early second-term record.

But its significance for US policy is widely underappreciated. His lack of ideology does not mean that he can be permanently persuaded by one faction or the other, but rather produces volatility. The president has teetered back and forth between interventionism and isolationism, depending on the interplay between Trump's idiosyncratic instincts and whoever he's talking with on a particular day.

Given the near-dictatorial power modern presidents have over foreign policy, this will likely produce something worse than ideological rigidity: an incoherent, mutually contradictory policy that ends up undermining itself at every turn. At a moment of acute geopolitical peril, when Trump's ascendant hawkish allies are calling for yet another war of regime change in the Middle East, it's easy to see how that could end in true disaster.

Foreign policy analysts like to talk a lot about “grand strategy.” What they mean by this is a vision that identifies the objectives leaders want to accomplish in world politics — like, say, protecting American territories from physical threats — and then develops a series of specific policies designed to work together in accomplishing that goal.

Both the right's hawks and the America First crowd have distinct visions of grand strategy.

The hawks start from the premise that the United States benefits from being the world's dominant power, and from there they develop a series of policies designed to contain or eliminate threats to that dominance from hostile powers like Russia or China. The America Firsters, by contrast, believe that remaining a globe-spanning power costs the United States too much in blood and treasure — and that the American people will be both safer and more secure if the US reduces its involvement in non-essential conflicts and lets other countries settle their differences without American help.

When you start from each of these grand strategic premises, you can basically deduce where most members of each bloc land on specific issues. The hawks love Israel's war in Iran, while the America Firsters fear it might pull in the United States more directly. The hawks believe in aggressively trying to contain Chinese influence in East Asia, while the America Firsters seek accommodations that don't risk a nuclear war over Taiwan. The hawks (mostly) support arming Ukraine against Russia, while the America Firsters are overwhelmingly against it. 

On all of these issues, Trump's actual policy is all over the map.

He first tried to negotiate a nuclear agreement with Iran, which the hawks hated, but swiftly flipped to supporting Israel's war. His China policy has been inconsistent, pairing initially harsh tariffs and talk of trade “decoupling” with a negotiated climb-down and vagueness on Taiwan. On Ukraine, where Trump cozies up to Russia's Vladimir Putin and berates Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, the policy substance is even more muddled — he has cut US aid to Ukraine while simultaneously extending President Joe Biden's sanctions on Russia, and even threatened new ones if Putin won't make a ceasefire deal.

Trump's second-term record, in short, is a tangle of incoherent policies and whiplash-inducing policy shifts. There is no consistent vision of the world, just whatever Trump decides policy should be in the moment — regardless of how much it contradicts what he's said or done previously. And while all presidents have to develop new policies based on events, the Trump administration makes confusing and radical policy shifts over the course of very limited time periods (Exhibit A: the still-fluctuating tariff rates).

This foreign policy ping-pong can only be understood if you see Trump as someone who is allergic to foreign policy doctrine. You can spin his allergy positively (he's pragmatic) or negatively (he knows nothing and doesn't care to learn). Perhaps both are true to a degree, but the evidence — like his refusal to read briefing documents — tilts heavily in the latter direction.

What we get, in place of doctrine, are Trump's instincts about interests, deals, and strength.

We know he thinks about current US policy in zero-sum terms, such as that NATO and trade agreements cannot benefit both sides. We know he's indifferent to legal constraints from domestic and international law. We know he's willing to use force aggressively, authorizing attacks against terrorist groups in his first term that produced shockingly high civilian body counts. And we know he sees himself as the consummate dealmaker, with much of his policy seemingly premised on the idea that he can get leaders like Putin and China's Xi Jinping onside.

Sometimes, of course, these instincts combine and crash into each other — with Iran as a case in point.

Trump spent quite a lot of effort in his second term trying to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran. In both April and May, he explicitly warned Israel not to attack Iran. Yet now he seems fully on board with Israel's war, posting bellicose Truth Social posts suggesting Iranians should ​​“immediately evacuate Tehran.”

Trump's jumping from negotiations to cheerleading war is not a result of him changing his foreign policy worldview. It's that he wanted to be the dealmaker and then was persuaded, by a combination of Israeli pressure and his own lack of patience, that the talks weren't working. Hence, Trump decided, war would be the order of the day.

“Now Mr. Trump is seriously considering sending American aircraft in to help refuel Israeli combat jets and to try to take out Iran's deep-underground nuclear site at Fordo with 30,000-pound bombs — a step that would mark a stunning turnabout from his opposition just two months ago to any military action while there was still a chance of a diplomatic solution,” the New York Times reports.

But even amid said deliberations, Trump pines to be the dealmaker — suggesting in an ABC News interview this weekend that war “had to happen” for talks to succeed, and that it “may have forced a deal to go quicker.” His more hawkish allies see Israel's offensive as the opening shots in a war of regime change; Trump sees it as the art of the deal.

It is, in short, a category error to try to align Trump with one GOP foreign policy faction or the other. He's just Trump — a man with a long track record of endorsing and ordering armed violence, but also a deep faith in his near-magical dealmaking powers. 

So, if Trump's guide is his instincts, why do the factional disagreements splitting the GOP matter? 

Because we know for a fact that Trump can be easily influenced by the people around him. While he has some fixed and unchangeable views, like his peculiar idea that trade deficits are inherently bad, there are many areas on which he doesn't have a strong opinion about the facts — and can be talked in one direction or another. This is the well-known phenomenon of Trump making public pronouncements based on whoever he spoke to most recently.

In Trump's first term, this ended up having a surprisingly stabilizing effect on policy. He was surrounded by more establishment types like Jim Mattis and Mark Milley, who would frequently talk him out of more radical policies — or else quietly make policies on their own that were consistent with longstanding bipartisan consensus.

There were still many Trumpian moments — everyone forgets that we were shockingly close to war with North Korea in 2017 — but the overall foreign policy record wasn't as radical as many feared.

As we all know, the second term is different. The Mattis types are gone, replaced instead by loyalists. The factional disputes are not between Trump's allies and establishmentarians who wished to check him, but rather between different strains of MAGA — some more hawkish, others more dovish. But neither is big on stability, in the sense of wanting to ensure Trump colors within the longstanding lines of post-Cold War US foreign policy. 

This creates a situation where each faction is trying to persuade Trump that their approach best and most truly embodies his MAGA vision. The problem, however, is that no such vision exists. Each will have successes at various times, when they succeed at tapping into whichever of Trump's instincts is operative at the moment. But none will ever succeed in making Trump act like the ideologue they want him to be.

What this means, in concrete policy terms, is that the chaos and contradictions of Trump's early foreign policy is likely to continue.

In the post-9/11 era, presidents have accrued extraordinary powers over foreign policy. Even explicit constitutional provisions, like the requirement that Congress declare war or approve treaties, no longer serve as meaningful checks on the president's ability to use force or alter US international commitments.

This environment means that the twin factors shaping Trump's thinking — his own jumbled instincts and his subordinates' jockeying for his favor — are likely to have direct and immediate policy consequences. We've seen that in the whiplash of his early-term policies in areas like trade and Iran, and have every reason to believe it will continue for the foreseeable future.

In a new Foreign Affairs essay, the political scientist Elizabeth Saunders compares US foreign policy under Trump to that of a “personalist” dictatorship: places where one man rules with no real constraints, like Russia or North Korea. Such countries, she notes, have a long track record of foreign policy boondoggles.

“Without constraints, even from elites in the leader's inner circle, personalist dictators are prone to military misadventures, erratic decisions, and self-defeating policies,” she writes. “A United States that can change policy daily, treat those who serve its government with cruelty, and take reckless actions that compromise its basic systems and leave shared secrets and assets vulnerable is not one to be trusted.”

So long as Trump remains in office, this is the way things are going to be. American foreign policy will be primarily determined not by strategists or ideologues, but by the confused and contradictory whims of one unstable man.

Too bad it's now sabotaging it.

If there's anything the Trump administration has gotten unequivocally right (besides inadvertently helping Mark Carney become prime minister of Canada), it's this: Modern science, for all its remarkable capabilities, still remains far too dependent on one of the most primitive research methods there is — harming and killing animals. 

That was the message underlying a groundbreaking initiative unveiled in April by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the chief funder of university biomedical research in the US. The agency promised to reallocate funding away from animal experimentation and toward cutting-edge alternatives, with the aim of pushing American science toward a more technologically advanced, less bloody future.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Viewed on its own merits, that plan makes all the sense in the world. Few Americans, I think, would say that their vision of scientific progress includes inflicting suffering on animals forever. 

But there's a catch. While the NIH's initiative is, to my knowledge, being run by people genuinely invested in improving science by advancing animal-free methods, that mission is unfolding within an administration whose broader science policy has consisted mostly of laying waste to research funding across the board and attempting to destroy some of the country's top research universities. These are objectives that one generally wouldn't expect to be conducive to the flourishing of research on animal testing alternatives — or on any other topic. 

It was in this contradictory context that the NIH last month announced it had defunded a set of controversial studies on baby monkeys run by Harvard Medical School neuroscientist Margaret Livingstone. 

To study the development of vision, Livingstone's lab separates newborn rhesus macaques from their mothers and then uses various techniques to manipulate their vision while they're growing up — in the most disturbing case in 2016, two baby monkeys had their eyelids sewn shut for their first year of life. 

The animals' skulls are later surgically opened, electrodes are implanted into their brains, and researchers show them visual stimuli (images of faces, for example) to examine how the sensory deprivation or other visual manipulations affected their neurodevelopment. 

To put my own cards on the table, I think these experiments are pretty much impossible to justify. They're emblematic of an archaic paradigm of primate experimentation that is untroubled by the ethical implications of causing extreme suffering, and overly presumptuous that its contributions to human knowledge will outweigh whatever costs are borne by animals. It's exactly the kind of work that the federal government — whoever controls it — ought to stop funding as part of an effort to change American science for the better. 

It's an immense shame, then, that what could be a genuinely game-changing, science-based initiative to reduce animal experimentation is taking place during a wholesale war on science in general, and on Harvard in particular. The timing of Livingstone's grant terminations suggests the decision had less to do with ethics than it did with simply defunding Harvard, which was happening simultaneously (neither the NIH nor Livingstone granted my requests for an interview). And included among the more than $2 billion in grants to Harvard that the Trump administration has cut or frozen is the work of one of the world's pioneers in scientific alternatives to animal models.

From an animal ethics perspective, the defunding of Livingstone's monkey research looks as close as it gets to an unambiguous win. It's hard to conclude, though, whether it signals a real reconsideration of the use of animals in science, given that it's coming from an impatient administration that seems more interested in shredding institutions than actually directing them. 

Meaningfully rethinking the role of animal experimentation requires the ability to, well, think. Sound judgment about what kind of research actually deserves public funding requires institutional capacity to reason clearly about both science and ethics. And under the Trump administration, that capacity is being systematically dismantled.

Humans have been using our primate cousins as experimental material for over a century. European colonialism made monkeys native to South and Southeast Asia and Africa readily available to Western scientists, who in the early- to mid-20th century began to use them in a wide range of biomedical and psychological research. 

In the postcolonial period, that access became more complicated: By 1978, India banned the export of rhesus macaques for research after public concern over their use in military and radiation experiments. The US responded in part by investing in breeding programs that rear the animals in captivity (as opposed to plucking them from the wild, although wild-caught monkeys are still used in American labs), helping create a network of breeders, researchers, and trainees using monkeys as tools in an ever-evolving array of research questions.

Today's lab macaques are still generally housed in small metal cages — the size of telephone booths, as neuroscientist Garet Lahvis has put it for Vox — inside windowless rooms with little opportunity for free movement. They often show signs of psychological distress, engaging in strange, self-harming behaviors. Many of them, born in captivity, have never seen the outdoors. 

Beyond the undeniable ethical issues, some scientists have called into question whether experiments on monkeys driven insane by extreme confinement and social deprivation can even produce knowledge transferable to humans. 

Livingstone's experiments in particular have provoked a storm of condemnation, not just from groups like PETA, which has campaigned to get her research shut down, but also from fellow scientists. In 2022, over 250 primatologists, animal behaviorists, and other academics, appalled by Livingstone's separation of macaque mothers from their newborns — which is known to cause intense distress in both animals and abnormal social and cognitive development in the infants — signed a letter urging the retraction of one of her articles from the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Even Livingstone's Harvard colleagues at the university's Animal Law and Policy Clinic called on the NIH to defund her research. 

The Livingstone lab's work constitutes what's known in the scientific community as “basic science” — research whose purpose is to advance our knowledge of how the world works in general, without necessarily having a direct medical application. “These are not experiments designed to develop a new treatment or cure for humans. These are not experiments that are ever going to develop a new treatment,” Katherine Roe, a neuroscientist and the chief scientist for PETA's laboratory investigations department, told me. “They're curiosity-driven.”

Of course, exploratory basic science research can lay the foundation for practical applications in the future, and federal funding certainly ought to have a role in funding it. Basic science involving invasive experimentation on animals derives its social license to operate, at least in theory, from its ability to articulate concrete benefits to humans — Livingstone, for example, has argued that her work on monkeys offers insights into the organization of the brain that could prove useful in helping people with autism or other conditions. 

The problem is that these benefits are highly theoretical, and hardly begin to make up for either the ethical problems of experimenting on animals or the scientific problems of treating them as viable proxies for humans. As Lahvis, who used to study mice, argued in Vox in 2023, the same cramped, psychologically damaging conditions that make animal research ethically problematic can also undermine its translatability to humans. 

This research carries on not because anyone is doing a rational weighing of its costs and benefits, but because in the eyes of the law and of biomedical science, animals are morally invisible and thoroughly disposable. 

There's no single way to make meaning out of the whirlwind of garbage that is the Trump administration's science policy. But biomedical science is overdue for a paradigm shift on animal research. Even former NIH director Francis Collins has referenced “the pointlessness of much of the research being conducted on non-human primates” in a private email sent in 2014. The current NIH, unencumbered by loyalty to scientific or institutional tradition, now offers a rare opportunity to speed up that transition. 

Still, the breadth of the administration's attacks on science may make it impossible for career NIH officials to reach independent judgments about which research is worth public support. “Everyone admits that animal models are suboptimal at best, and highly inaccurate more commonly,” Harvard bioengineer Don Ingber told me. Yet Ingber's own research funding for his work on organs-on-chips, a leading alternative to animal models, was frozen by the Trump administration in April.

Harvard is now suing the administration to restore its science funding, and the indiscriminate, politically motivated nature of the cuts will be harder for Trump officials to defend than if the NIH had simply made narrowly targeted reductions to animal studies. 

For animal advocates, this moment poses an exceptionally hard challenge: advocating intelligently for a transition away from animal research, and holding the Trump administration accountable for its promises, without allowing themselves to be recruited into a nihilistic war on universities. But scientists, too, ought to be honest with themselves about why the cruelty of animal experimentation has been so effectively weaponized for anti-science populism. 

Ending sensory deprivation research on our social, curious, intelligent monkey relatives, if it holds, represents one meaningful, if tainted, shard of justice. As for American science as a whole, “I'm worried. And maybe hopeful,” psychologist John Gluck, who built his career on primate research and later repudiated it, told me. And if the NIH really is serious about moving away from the mass sacrifice of animals, he said, “It's about goddamn time.”

Francis Collins led the NIH for a decade before its dismantling. He's still searching for answers.

Francis Collins has overseen some of the most revolutionary science of the last few decades. He led the Human Genome Project that sequenced the entire human genome by 2003, and then in 2009, he became director of the National Institutes of Health, where he served under three presidents and led the agency's research on a Covid-19 vaccine.

But nothing in his years leading biomedical research for the US government could have prepared him for the disruption at NIH over the past few months. Over 1,000 employees at the NIH were suddenly fired at the beginning of April. (Those firings are still being challenged in the courts, but as of now, the employees remain out of work.) Trump administration officials have barred researchers from studying certain topics like vaccine hesitancy or the health effects of wildfires.

“I had experienced transitions before, and those were bumpy sometimes,” Collins told me in a recent interview. “But I didn't expect science to be under this kind of full-bore attack, which is really what happened almost immediately after inauguration day.”

In the past few months, Collins saw scientists placed under communications gag orders, restrained from speaking freely even when no media were present. “You were effectively muzzled,” he says.

Collins, who had stepped down as NIH director in 2021 and had taken over a lab studying diabetes, soon felt he could no longer do his job as a scientist should. He started to worry he might be pushed out. “So I pulled my folks together in a conference room. They didn't know what was coming. And I told them, ‘By tomorrow night, I'm no longer gonna be here.' And we all cried. I never thought it would end this way. My wife came to pick me up on that last Friday, and I just walked out of the building and got in the car and said, ‘I guess this is it. That's how it ends?'”

Just four years ago, Collins was President Donald Trump's NIH director. Now, in Trump's second term, he's resigning under pressure. How did we get from a world where the NIH was universally recognized as a jewel of scientific research to a world where the government is essentially tearing it down from the inside?

I spoke to Collins on Vox's Unexplainable podcast about how so many Americans lost trust in science and how we might be able to get it back. Our interview has been edited for clarity and length.

I'm constantly hearing that Americans have lost trust in science. Is that fair to say?

I think it's totally fair. You can look at all the surveys about trust. Americans have lost trust in almost every institution. 

But I think it was more than that. I think Covid did a lot of harm to people's trust in science because, first of all, it was a huge, disastrous experience for the world. There were days where thousands of Americans were dying. As one of those people who was communicating with the public about what we knew about the virus and what they might do to protect themselves, we were doing the best we could with the information we had, but the information was incomplete. So we often had to change recommendations over time because we learned more about the virus and about the pandemic, and people began to wonder, do these guys know what they're talking about?  

So suddenly this has become such a target for an attack: whether science is something that's good for our country or not.

Your most recent book, The Road to Wisdom, is all about trust. If you were telling the story of the loss of trust and everything going on in the science agencies today, how far back would you start?

It depends on the particular demographic you're talking about. I'm a person of faith, and certainly people of faith have tended to be among the most skeptical of science, and that goes back 150 years or more — the sense that maybe science is trying to do damage to our Christian faith. That was there certainly well before Covid. 

But what group was most resistant to accepting the vaccines? It was white evangelical Christians. I'm a white evangelical Christian, so those are my people, but it broke my heart to see how that happened. And I think Covid did something, took what had been a tendency for science to be political and turned it into a really big deal. If you were a Democrat, you're much more likely to get vaccinated than if you were a Republican. Does that make sense? Not in the slightest, but that's how it was.

When it's becoming clear that more than 50 million Americans aren't getting the vaccine, one of the most remarkable scientific achievements in human history, did that tell you anything about the pursuit of science and how it works?

It certainly woke me up to the fact that we apparently had not done a very good job in explaining to people that when science is tackling some really hard problems and occasionally gets the wrong answer, it's going to get self-corrected because science is about truth. Science is not just a bunch of people who are coming up with answers that they like. These are answers that aren't gonna be sustainable unless they're actually true. And maybe here's also where I began to realize 

That's another problem that society has that I was unaware of in terms of its severity: the importance of truth, the fact that there is such a thing as objective truth. Not everybody shared that: “That might be true for you, but it's not true for me.” I would hear people say that about things that were established facts, and that's a road to destruction of a society if it becomes widespread. Unfortunately, it seems to be doing so right now.

It seems like you believed that all you had to do was develop the vaccine, get to the thing that worked, and then people would take it? Then there's this whole other piece of convincing people that you and the scientific community at large didn't do.

Yep. I was naive about science communication and how it works. And I was, without knowing to call it this, an adherent to the knowledge deficit model.

What does that mean? 

That means that if you're trying to communicate science to get somebody to make a decision, it's because they're missing knowledge, and you're gonna provide that. You're gonna fill their deficit, and then everything will be fine.

You just tell them: Here's a fact. And now they believe the fact?

I'm an expert, here's the fact, and then they'll make the right decision. 

But no, it doesn't work that way, especially when there's already skepticism and distrust. You're seen as an elitist who maybe has an ax to grind or something you're trying to put over on them, and you may even do more harm than good by going after somebody's misunderstandings head-on. They're just gonna dig their heels in more thoroughly. 

I guess what I've learned is we need to do a lot more listening and really understand where people are coming from, and also be prepared to tell stories instead of going down the road with statistics. But that's challenging: For a scientist, that sounds like an anecdote and I would never get away with that in the seminar room. 

But this is not the seminar room, people. We need to actually find better ways to help people understand what we do.

You were in charge of the NIH during Covid. You were often the one communicating to the public. Are there things that you would do differently if you could do it over again?

I wish every time that myself or anybody who was putting forward a public health message would have started off saying, “Look, this is an evolving situation. We still don't know answers to a lot of things we need to know about this pandemic. So what I'm gonna tell you today is the data we've got, but we might have to change that later when we get more information.” We almost never said that.

The other thing is  our one-size-fits-all approach just didn't feel like it made any sense to the public. People in rural communities, who were far away from the carnage that was happening in New York City or Washington, DC, as the virus was running wild, were left wondering: “Why do I have to close my business? I haven't even seen any cases here yet.” I think we lost a lot of people in states that didn't necessarily have heavy academic research centers, who couldn't quite imagine how they should believe us because we didn't seem like we understood what life was like on a small farm in Nebraska. 

During Covid, my number one goal was to save lives. I'm a physician. I took the Hippocratic Oath. I assumed there were other people worrying about the economic effects of this and the effects on children's learning when they were kept out of school. It didn't feel like that was my thing. My thing was to try to keep people from dying. But it became clear to me that that may have been something I was a little bit wearing blinders about. Maybe those other factors about economic harms and harms to children's learning should have been a bit more front and center to the conversations that I was part of.

So I understand looking back on it and saying, “Okay, it would've been more accurate to communicate the level of uncertainty.” To say to people, “This is evolving. We don't know.” Do you think that would've led to a different outcome?

I don't know. I wish we could do the experiment, and maybe we could figure out a way to do it in some controlled space. 

But  I would say 20 percent of the problem was the less-than-perfect communication of the science, and 80 percent of it was the deluge of misinformation and disinformation that contaminated the conversation to the point where a lot of people stopped listening to the actual facts. 

There didn't seem to be any penalty for stating something that's absolutely false, though, and I haven't heard anybody apologize for that.

When I think about your willingness to have difficult conversations, to accept responsibility for mistakes, it seems like this is something that most people are not doing. I've heard you mention maybe we could have something like a truth and reconciliation commission. Or a pandemic amnesty on a larger level, where people could really be open about their mistakes. Do you think that could have any effect?

You know, I proposed the idea of amnesty at an event and the audience blew up. They were not there. People are too angry. 

On both sides? 

On both sides. They're feeling too hurt, too much harm has been done to them. So amnesty, I don't think we're there. Truth and reconciliation, people were okay with that. Because they can imagine that other people are gonna have to ask for forgiveness for what they did. 

But right now, we're so dug in. I hope that this truth and reconciliation option is out there right now. It doesn't quite feel like people are ready to go there. 

It seems to me like what we need is more people embracing uncertainty, more people talking about their mistakes. Whether it's people with their friends who they disagree with, or whether it's the highest scientists in our scientific agencies. How do we get there?

We're a long way from there. When you're in this circumstance where there seems to be a real pitch battle between the various tribes, it makes it hard for anybody to say, “I might be wrong.” The fact that I've been willing to say that has resulted in a lot of attacks, even from people who I thought were my friends. They said, “Oh no, you can't show weakness like that.” 

Well, yeah, we really do need to do that, but we need to all do it and not just expect a few people who are then gonna get whacked for it. It's hard right now, and you don't see a lot of that in our country.

If I were a young scientist and I wasn't sure whether I should stay in the field, what would you say to me?

I would say you're at a really paradoxical time because this is the most incredibly exciting moment for biomedical research. So many things are becoming possible that I would not have dreamed would happen in my lifetime. We're on this exponential curve of gathering insights. So if that's your dream to be part of, don't give it up. 

Now, the paradox is right at the moment, there's a lot of negative things happening in the United States that seem to be threats. But the case here is so compelling that I don't believe those facts can be suppressed for very long. You can already look at polls in which the American public says, “I don't think they should be harming medical research.” That's right there. Seventy-seven percent of Americans raise that point in one poll. 

That's people on both sides of the aisle. There's some momentum there.

Even America's richest farmlands can't outrun climate collapse. That's everyone's problem.

Globally, humanity is producing more food than ever, but that harvest is concentrated in just a handful of breadbaskets.

More than one-third of the world's wheat and barley exports come from Ukraine and Russia, for example. Some of these highly productive farmlands, including major crop-growing regions in the United States, are on track to see the sharpest drops in harvests due to climate change.

That's bad news not just for farmers, but also for everyone who eats — especially as it becomes harder and more expensive to feed a more crowded, hungrier world, according to a new study published in the journal Nature. 

Under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario, six key staple crops will see an 11.2 percent decline by the end of the century compared to a world without warming, even as farmers try to adapt. And the largest drops aren't occurring in the poorer, more marginal farmlands, but in places that are already major food producers. These are regions like the US Midwest that have been blessed with good soil and ideal weather for raising staples like maize and soy. 

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

But when that weather is less than ideal, it can drastically reduce agricultural productivity. Extreme weather has already begun to eat into harvests this year: Flooding has destroyed rice in Tajikistan, cucumbers in Spain, and bananas in Australia. Severe storms in the US this spring caused millions of dollars in damages to crops. In past years, severe heat has led to big declines in blueberries, olives, and grapes. And as the climate changes, rising average temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are poised to diminish yields, while weather events like droughts and floods reaching greater extremes could wipe out harvests more often. 

“It's not a mystery that climate change will affect our food production,” said Andrew Hultgren, an agriculture researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “That's the most weather exposed sector in the economy.”

Farmers are doing what they can — testing different crop varieties that can better withstand changes in the climate, shifting the timing of when they sow, tweaking their use of fertilizers and water, and investing in infrastructure like water reservoirs.

The question is whether these adaptations can continue to keep pace with warming. To figure this out, Hultgren and his team looked at crop and weather data from 54 countries around the world dating back to the 1940s. They specifically looked at how farmers have adapted to changes in the climate that have already occurred, focusing on maize, wheat, rice, cassava, sorghum, and soybean. Combined, these crops provide two-thirds of humanity's calories. 

In the Nature paper, Hultgren and his team reported that in general, adaptation can slow some crop losses due to climate change, but not all of them. 

And the decrease in our food production could be devastating: For every degree Celsius of warming, global food production is likely to decline by 120 calories per person per day. That's even taking into account how climate change can make growing seasons longer and how more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can encourage plant growth. In the moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario — leading to between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100 — rising incomes and adaptations would only offset one-third of crop losses around the world. 

“Looking at that 3 degrees centigrade warmer [than the year 2000] future corresponds to about a 13 percent loss in daily recommended per capita caloric consumption,” Hultgren said. “That's like everyone giving up breakfast … about 360 calories for each person, for each day.”

The researchers also mapped out where the biggest crop declines — and increases — are likely to occur as the climate warms. As the world's most productive farmlands get hit hard, cooler countries like Russia and Canada are on track for larger harvests. The map below shows in red where crop yields are poised to shrink and in blue where they may expand: 

The results complicate the assumption that poor countries will directly bear the largest losses in food production due to climate change. The wealthy, large-scale food-growers may see the biggest dropoffs, according to the study. However, poor countries will still be affected since many crops are internationally traded commodities, and the biggest producers are exporters. A smaller harvest means higher food prices around the world. Less wealthy regions are also facing their own crop declines from disasters and climate change, though at smaller scales. All the while, the global population is rising, albeit much more slowly than in the past. It's a recipe for more food insecurity for more people. 

Rice is an exception to this trend. Its overall yields are actually likely to increase in a warmer world: Rice is a versatile crop and unlike the other staples, it benefits from higher nighttime temperatures. “Rice turns out to be the most flexibly adapted crop and largely through adaptations protected from large losses under even a high warming future,” Hultgren said. That's a boon for regions like South and Southeast Asia. 

Decreasing the available calories isn't the only way climate change is altering food, however. The nutrition content can change with shifts in rainfall and temperature too, though Hultgren and his colleagues didn't account for this in their study. Scientists have previously documented how higher levels of carbon dioxide can cause crops like rice to have lower levels of iron, zinc, and B vitamins. So the food we will be eating in the future may be more scarce and less nutritious as well. 

And while climate change can impair our food supply, the way we make food in turn harms the climate. About one-third of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions stem from food production, just under half of that from meat and dairy. That's why food production has to be a major front in how we adapt to climate change, and reduce rising temperatures overall.

What the hell did the Court just do to equal protection law?

It was obvious, if you listened to the Supreme Court's oral argument in United States v. Skrmetti last December, that the Court would vote — most likely along party lines — to uphold state laws banning many forms of transgender health care for minors. So nothing about Chief Justice John Roberts's majority opinion in Skrmetti is really surprising. All six of the Court's Republicans voted to uphold these laws, and all three of the Court's Democrats dissented.

But, as a matter of judicial craftsmanship, Roberts's opinion is disappointing even by the standards of the Roberts Court. It draws incoherent distinctions. It relies on old and widely criticized precedents to undermine legal principles that are well established by more recent cases. At times in his opinion, Roberts seems to misread statutory language that he just quoted a paragraph or two earlier.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

It appears, in other words, that the six justices in the majority started with the outcome that they wanted — bans on transgender health care for minors must be upheld — and then contorted their legal reasoning to fit that result.

Even if you share that goal, the decision in this case was unnecessary. As Justice Elena Kagan points out in a brief dissenting opinion, the issue before the Supreme Court Skrmetti concerned a threshold question: whether the Tennessee law at issue in this case should receive a heightened level of scrutiny from the courts before it was either upheld or discarded. The ultimate question of whether to uphold Tennessee's law was not before the justices.

The Court's Republicans, in other words, could have applied existing law, sent the case back down to the lower courts to apply this “heightened scrutiny,” and then ruled on the bans in a future case. Instead, Roberts's Skrmetti opinion went further to rule on the legality of the bans, and consists of about two dozen pages of excuses for why the Court's previous anti-discrimination decisions somehow do not apply to Tennessee's law.

One virtue of this approach is that it minimizes the broader implications of Skrmetti. At oral arguments, several justices suggested that, in order to uphold Tennessee's law, they might make sweeping changes to the rules governing all sex-based discrimination by the government — Roberts, for example, floated giving the government broad authority to discriminate on the basis of sex in the medical context. Roberts's actual opinion contains some language suggesting that the general rule against sex discrimination is weaker when the government regulates medical practice, but those sections of his opinion are so difficult to parse that they fall short of the broad changes he discussed at oral argument.

Ultimately, Roberts's Skrmetti opinion largely reveals something that close observers of this Supreme Court already know. The Court's Republican majority is impatient. They are often so eager to reach ideological or partisan results that they hand down poorly reasoned opinions and incomprehensible legal standards. 

Because the Skrmetti opinion is so incoherent, it is difficult to predict its broader implications for US anti-discrimination law. One thing that is certain, however, is that this decision is a historic loss for transgender Americans.

To understand why the Skrmetti opinion is so difficult to reconcile with the Court's previous decisions, it's helpful to understand the precise legal questions before the Supreme Court.

The first of two questions is whether Tennessee's ban on trans health care for minors classifies patients based on their sex assigned at birth. In United States v. Virginia (1996), the Supreme Court held that “‘all gender-based classifications today' warrant ‘heightened scrutiny.'” “All” means that all laws that classify people based on their sex must receive additional scrutiny from the courts, not just some laws that do so.

About half of the states have laws targeting transgender health care, but the Tennessee law at issue in Skrmetti is among the strictest. It prohibits people under the age of 18 from receiving many medical treatments to treat gender dysphoria or other conditions related to their transgender status — including bans on puberty blockers and hormone therapy.

Significantly, Tennessee's law is also quite explicit that the purpose of this law is to ensure that young people do not depart from their sex assigned at birth. The law declares that its purpose is to “encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex” and to prevent young people from becoming “disdainful of their sex.” That is an explicit sex-based classification. Patients who Roberts refers to as “biological women” are allowed to fully embrace femininity in Tennessee. But a child who is assigned male at birth may not.

Under Virginia, in other words, Tennessee's law — which relies on a sex-based classification — must be subject to heightened scrutiny.

To be clear, the mere fact that courts must give heightened review to Tennessee's law does not mean that the law will necessarily be struck down. As the Court held in Craig v. Boren (1976), “to withstand constitutional challenge…classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.” Some laws do survive this level of scrutiny.

Roberts's opinion raises several policy arguments for Tennessee's law, claiming that the procedures targeted by Tennessee are “experimental,” that they “can lead to later regret,” and that they carry “risks.” A court applying heightened scrutiny could consider these arguments and whether they justify upholding the law.

But Roberts bypasses this inquiry altogether, instead denying that the Tennessee law engages in sex-based classifications at all. The law, Roberts claims, only “incorporates two classifications.” It “classifies on the basis of age” by banning certain treatments only for minors. And it “classifies on the basis of medical use” by prohibiting doctors from prescribing those treatments to address gender dysphoria or similar conditions affecting transgender people, while simultaneously permitting those treatments to address other conditions.

Roberts is correct that Tennessee's law does draw lines based on these two classifications. But a law can do more than two things at once. And this law explicitly states that it exists to classify every child as either a boy or a girl, and then to lock them into that classification until their 18th birthday. Under Virginia, that classification demands heightened scrutiny.

The second legal question before the Court in Skrmetti was whether all laws that discriminate against transgender people are themselves subject to heightened scrutiny. Roberts, however, dodges this question by claiming that Tennessee's law “does not classify on the basis of transgender status.” Instead, he argues, the law classifies people based on whether they have conditions such as “gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence.”

Gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence are among the defining traits that make someone transgender. Roberts might as well have argued that Jim Crow laws do not discriminate on the basis of race, but instead discriminate based on the color of a person's skin.

To justify this distinction, Roberts points to the Court's decision in Geduldig v. Aiello (1974), which held that discrimination against pregnant people is not a form of sex discrimination because not all women become pregnant. But, even if it is true that not all transgender people experience gender dysphoria or a similar condition, post-Geduldig decisions have long held that the government cannot evade a ban on discrimination by claiming that it is merely discriminating based on a trait that closely correlates with a particular identity.

As the Court said in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic (1993), “a tax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews” — even though many Jews do not wear yarmulkes.

That said, the Court's decision not to rule on whether laws that classify on the basis of transgender status must receive heightened review is probably a blessing for transgender people, even if it is a small one. While Roberts's reasoning on this question is muddled, his opinion leaves open the possibility that a future Court may resolve this question in favor of transgender people — although that is highly unlikely to happen unless the Court's membership changes significantly.

Notably, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who is close to the center of the current Court, wrote a separate concurring opinion arguing that discrimination against trans people does not trigger heightened scrutiny.

For the most part, Skrmetti is a disaster for transgender people, and especially for transgender youth. It twists the Constitution in knots to uphold Tennessee's law. And the decision is likely to ensure that many parents of transgender children must move to blue states if they want their child to receive appropriate medical care.

The once-hypothetical cuts are coming, whether employees are ready or not.

On Tuesday, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, confirmed the fears of many workers in the age of artificial intelligence: He said he expects the technology will lead to job cuts at the tech giant.

In his memo, which was posted online, Jassy did not announce immediate layoffs. He said that, in the next few years, ""efficiency gains"" from AI would translate to a smaller corporate workforce.

Marlo Lyons, a certified executive coach, told Business Insider that jobs will inevitably change — including outright disappearances. ""So is your job at risk? Absolutely. If you don't get on board with AI, yes, absolutely, you're going to lose your job.""

Amazon is now one of the largest companies to explicitly state that AI will impact its employees' jobs.

BI previously reported that roles that include tasks that AI can perform are disappearing from job boards faster than positions that have fewer tasks that AI can accomplish.

Shopify's CEO said in April that, before hiring anyone new, employees must prove AI can't do the job better. Duolingo plans to phase out contractors and replace them with AI. And Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, has said that the company might not hire engineers in 2025 because those already on the payroll are getting so much more done thanks to AI tools.

The industry you're in matters. Office workers appear to be particularly at risk. In late May, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, suggested AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said earlier this month that he expects the impact of AI on white-collar jobs to be so significant that it will lead to a recession.

Christian Schneider, the CEO of New York-based startup fileAI, told BI that he's already seeing job losses in corners of the tech industry, and he expects AI to exacerbate the trend.

""I'm totally expecting a tightening,"" he said. ""I think when we look into tech layoffs, it's so apparent that something is changing.""

Melissa Swift, the founder and CEO of work consultancy Anthrome Insight, told BI that productivity hasn't always increased to the same degree as tech advances. It often ""ticks up slowly, like a kiddie roller coaster going up the first big hill.""

Those who aren't keeping up risk being left behind. And refusing to acknowledge the risk doesn't make it go away, Lyons said.

""So if you're redesigning the workplace, and how things are getting done — whether it's a workflow or structures of teams, or the same thing with AI — you can hold on with white knuckles, but it's still going to happen around you,"" Lyons said.

Of course, not all the jobs affected by advancements in AI will mean the workers filling them will be laid off. Jassy acknowledged in his statement that Amazon will ""need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.""

Schneider said some jobs will change so that typical back-office, rote tasks will fall to AI and allow more workers to take on people-facing roles. Or, officegoers once responsible for pulling and preparing data might now move to the end of the process to, for example, check the quality of the results AI produces.

While some jobs will disappear and others will evolve, Schneider said, workers are often good at adapting.

""Honestly, I wouldn't want to underestimate people's drive,"" he said.

Chinese jewelers are snapping up platinum as they seek to bounce back from a slump in gold jewelry sales, an industry group said.

Surging gold prices, which hit a record high above $3,500 an ounce in April, have deterred even buyers from China, who have a cultural attachment to the yellow metal.

In the first quarter of the year, gold jewelry sales in China tanked nearly 27% from a year ago to 134.5 tons, according to the China Gold Association.

Meanwhile, gold bar and coin consumption surged nearly 30%, showing that investor demand for haven assets remains strong.

""Jewelry fabricators and distributors are trying to save themselves because gold jewelry sales are falling off a cliff. They need to find a new metal for jewelry so that they can survive,"" Weibin Deng, the regional head for Asia Pacific at the World Platinum Investment Council, told Business Insider.

China imported 11.5 metric tons of platinum in April, its highest monthly intake in a year.

That demand has helped push global platinum prices up around 40% year-to-date, with spot prices near $1,265 per ounce. Spot gold prices have also surged, up roughly 30% over the same period.

The price of platinum is still about one-third of gold, making the white precious metal a compelling proposition for Chinese consumers. In China, jewelry is generally priced by weight rather than on a per-piece basis, said Deng.

""It cannot be too expensive, otherwise people wouldn't buy it,"" he said of the price-sensitive Chinese market.

Goldman Sachs analysts wrote on Tuesday that platinum's blistering rally lacks fundamental support. They said the metal's issues include price-sensitive Chinese demand, slowing auto demand, and the expectation that there will be no significant decline in supply.

The analysts attributed strong gains in the platinum market to speculative demand and high gold prices, which are keeping investors away from trading in the yellow metal.

""This hesitancy likely stems from investors believing they missed the initial rally,"" wrote the Goldman analysts, referring to the blistering gold rally earlier.

""Instead, interest has shifted to other precious metals as investors seek catch-up opportunities,"" they wrote.

The WPIC is stepping up marketing and public education to position platinum as a precious metal that has investment value and room to run, Deng said.

Deng said the council is also working with Chinese jewelers to be more efficient in terms of fabrication and market operations to lower prices for consumers

Deng said it's more expensive to work on platinum than gold as it requires more energy to melt the white metal. But reducing production costs is key to making platinum jewelry more accessible to consumers, he added.

Another challenge: The gold market is far more liquid. It's easier for consumers to sell or trade in gold jewelry with a small discount.

WPIC is partnering with jewelers in China to develop similar resale channels for platinum pieces.

Platinum isn't just for jewelry. It's used in everything from car parts to electronics. That broad demand helps support its value.

But according to Deng, it's platinum's visibility in jewelry that plays a crucial role in how consumers perceive it as a precious metal.

""Gold and silver have long been seen as currencies and stores of value around the world. To make the platinum jewelry market sustainable, consumers need to view platinum the same way — as a store of value,"" he said.

Deng acknowledged that gold is likely to remain the ultimate store of value in the eyes of the consumer, but even a small demand switch from gold to platinum would be significant.

The BofA analysts wrote last week that even a 1% switch in gold to platinum jewelry could help double the white metal's supply deficit to 1.6 million ounces, which would help support prices.

Nippon Steel Corp. closed its $14.1 billion takeover of United States Steel Corp., concluding an 18-month saga that became heavily politicized before the deal finally won US President Donald Trump's support.

Nippon Steel's $55-a-share acquisition creates the world's second-largest steelmaker and turns the combined entity into a formidable competitor within the American steel industry. The Japanese steelmaker also gets an important foothold in the US that helps avoid Trump's 50% steel tariffs.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Apollo has been a major backer of Wolfspeed since at least 2023.

Struggling chipmaker Wolfspeed Inc. will be taken over by creditors including Apollo Global Management Inc. under a proposal that would put it into bankruptcy just long enough to slash billions in debt, according to people familiar with the plan.

The company will soon announce a deal with lenders for a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information is private. In the weeks after that restructuring support agreement is signed, the company would ask creditors to vote on the deal and then file a Chapter 11 case, according to one of the people.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Nobitex, was hacked for more than $90 million Wednesday, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.

The funds were drained from platform wallets into addresses bearing anti-government messages explicitly referencing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, pointing to a politically motivated cyberattack, Elliptic said.

Blockchain research firm Chainalysis said the stolen crypto included bitcoin, ethereum, doge, ripple, solana, tron, and ton.

Pro-Israel hacking group Gonjeshke Darande, or ""Predatory Sparrow,"" claimed responsibility for the attack and said it would release the exchange's source code. Elliptic said the exchange was offline at the time of its post.

Predatory Sparrow also claimed credit for a separate cyberattack on Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah this week.

Fighting erupted between Israel and Iran on Friday and the countries have continued to trade missile fire. Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened the U.S. with ""irreparable damage"" Wednesday in response to President Donald Trump's demand that the country surrender.

Though the stolen assets have not been conclusively attributed to the group, Elliptic said the funds were sent to cryptographic addresses the hackers likely cannot control — suggesting the money was intentionally destroyed as a symbolic act rather than stolen for profit.

""Our analysis reveals that the addresses used in the attack were burner addresses where the attackers do not possess the private keys, meaning that the motive for stealing the $90+ million in funds is for other than financial gain,"" said Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, in a statement.

Elliptic's research linked the Nobitex exchange to the IRGC, a powerful branch of the Iranian military designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and Canada.

Past investigations have connected the platform to sanctioned IRGC-linked ransomware operatives and individuals close to Khamenei.

Blockchain data also shows activity between the Nobitex exchange and wallets associated with Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Houthis.

Elliptic said it's continuing to monitor virtual asset flows tied to Iranian entities and has updated its compliance tools to reflect emerging threats in the region's crypto ecosystem.

U.S. Steel shares stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday after Japan's Nippon Steel completed its acquisition of the iconic American industrial name.

President Donald Trump has insisted for weeks that the companies would form a ""partnership"" in which U.S. Steel would remain American-owned.

But the New York Stock Exchange notified the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday that U.S. Steel's shares would be removed from listing, after the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America.

U.S. Steel shares stopped trading at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday after Nippon completed its acquisition, according to a notice from the NYSE. The delisting will be effective on June 30, NYSE said.

Trump opposed Nippon's bid to acquire U.S. Steel in the runup to the 2024 presidential election, but he changed his stance after he took office, ordering a new review of the deal in April. Former President Joe Biden had blocked Nippon's acquisition in January, citing national security concerns.

Trump announced a ""partnership"" between U.S. and Nippon in a May 23 post on his social media platform Truth Social, causing confusion among investors and union members about whether the structure of the original deal had changed somehow.

U.S. Steel and Nippon started adopting the president's ""partnership"" language, though they never backed off from the terms of the original December 2023 merger agreement in their filings with SEC. U.S. Steel will continue to operate under its name.

Trump did compel U.S. Steel and Nippon to sign a national security agreement with the U.S. government as a condition for him clearing the deal.

The U.S. president will wield a ""golden share"" under the terms of the agreement. U.S. Steel said Wednesday that the golden share gives the president veto power over the following decisions:

A majority of U.S. Steel's board members and its CEO will be U.S. citizens, according to the terms of the national security agreement. Nippon also agreed that U.S. Steel will remain incorporated in the U.S.

Nippon will invest $11 billion in U.S. Steel by 2028, including $1 billion in initial spending on a greenfield project that will be completed after 2028, according to the agreement.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he gave Iran an ""ultimatum"" as he considers whether to order a U.S. strike against the country, amid its ongoing conflict with Israel. 

Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem began preparing for large-scale evacuations of Americans who want to leave Israel.

""I may do it, I may not do it,"" Trump told reporters at the White House when asked if he would order that strike in support of Israel's ongoing bombardment of Iranian nuclear and military targets.

""I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you this, that Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate.""

Asked if he gave Iran an ultimatum, Trump said, ""You could say so. Maybe you could call it the ultimate ultimatum.""

About an hour later, U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said evacuation flights and cruise-ship departures are being arranged for American citizens seeking to leave Israel.

A U.S. strike against Iran is one option among a range that Trump is weighing after meeting with his top national security advisors in the Situation Room on Tuesday afternoon.

Earlier that day, Trump had called for Iran's surrender and threatened its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling him an ""easy target.""

In his remarks Wednesday morning, Trump also claimed that Iran had reached out to the U.S., and had even offered to send a delegation to the White House for talks.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations quickly denied this, and rejected the prospect of accepting a peace plan in the midst of hostilities with Israel.

""No Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House,"" the mission said on its official X account. ""The only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to 'take out' Iran's Supreme Leader.""

""Iran shall respond to any threat with a counter-threat, and to any action with reciprocal measures,"" the mission added.

Earlier Wednesday, Khamenei threatened the U.S. with ""irreparable damage"" if Washington followed through with a military strike against nuclear facilities in the regional power. 

""Any American military entry will undoubtedly be met with irreparable damage,"" Khamenei said, according to NBC News reporting. He added that America's potential involvement in Iran ""will 100% backfire"" and that ""the damage they suffer will be far worse than anything Iran may face. If they enter militarily, they will face harm that they cannot recover from.""

CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment.

Iran and Israel have been trading missile fire since Friday, when the Jewish state launched what it called a preemptive attack on Iran's nuclear program and other military sites. 

The International Atomic Energy Agency on Wednesday said two nuclear centrifuge production facilities in Iran were hit.

Trump on Tuesday warned that the patience of the U.S. — a historically close ally and weapons provider of Israel — was ""wearing thin.""

""We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform, stressing the White House does not want missiles ""shot at civilians, or American soldiers"" but nevertheless aims for Tehran's ""UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!""

Khamenei responded Wednesday, saying ""the Iranian people are not a people who can be forced into surrender.""

Under Trump's second administration, the White House has been attempting to broker a deal over Iran's nuclear program, with talks so far yet to bear fruit. 

Washington has previously insisted it was not directly involved in the hostilities, but Trump's latest comments have stoked speculation over a change in strategy — and a potential direct U.S. military attack against Iranian sites.

""From the beginning, it was suspected that America was involved, and now, with their own officials' words, this suspicion is growing stronger,"" Khamenei said.

Tensions between the two historical Middle Eastern foes have been running high since the October 2023 attack on Israeli territory carried out by Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas. Israel has since accused Iran of offensives undertaken through its network of regional allies that also include Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi groups. Tehran denies involvement.

Amid ongoing fire exchanges, Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, on Wednesday said in a Google-translated social media update that ""a tornado passes over Tehran"" and ""this is how dictatorships collapse.""

Earlier in the week, leaders of the world's Group of Seven most advanced economies had labeled Iran a ""principal source of regional instability and terror"" in the Middle East and jointly called for ""broader de-escalation of hostilities"" regionally. Speaking on the sidelines of the G7 summit, Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said that Israel is doing ""the dirty work"" for the Western world, according to Google-translated comments carried by German outlet ZDF.

Markets have been avidly watching developments in the conflict, which threatens to envelop the broader oil-rich Middle East region and has driven investors to safe-haven assets, such as gold.

The U.S. and European Union are running out of time to strike a deal on trade tariffs — and analysts say several key sticking points could make an agreement impossible.

Negotiations have been slow since both the U.S. and EU temporarily cut duties on each other until July 9. If a deal is not agreed by then, full reciprocal import tariffs of 50% on EU goods, and the bloc's wide-spanning countermeasures are set to come into effect.

""We're talking, but I don't feel that they're offering a fair deal yet,"" U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday, further dashing hopes of an imminent agreement.

So what's holding things up between the two sides, which had a relationship worth 1.68 trillion euros ($1.93 trillion) in 2024?

One bone of contention flagged by experts was the EU's regulation of especially Big Tech companies. The bloc has faced regular criticism from the U.S. after imposing landmark rules on tech giants regarding transparency, competition and moderation.

""Trump's administration actively seeks to use trade negotiations to force the EU to capitulate and weaken the regulatory environment,"" Alberto Rizzi, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CNBC.

""However, to Europeans any interference into its domestic regulation of digital platforms is not acceptable and would run counter to its commitment to fight disinformation and hate speech,"" he added.

Philip Luck, director of the economics program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), echoed the concerns, but said the EU could potentially surrender some ground without undermining their principles.

But the parties ""haven't gotten down to that level of conversation yet,"" he said.

Taxes are another major area of disagreement between the U.S. and the EU, Rizzi said, noting that Trump sees tariffs as accounting for supposedly unfair taxes placed on U.S. companies and goods by European countries.

That includes so-called value-added taxes, or VAT, which are levied on each stage of the supply chain as a product's value changes. While very common globally, the U.S. doesn't operate VAT, and Trump has billed it as a trade barrier — and a justification for tariffs.

""However, the EU value-added tax treats domestic and foreign goods exactly in the same way and in Europeans' eyes, taxation is a purely domestic issue that should not be part of any trade discussion,"" Rizzi said. ""Taxation is a red line for the EU in trade discussions.""

A much broader issue between Washington and Brussels appears to be a fundamental lack of trust and alignment on negotiations and their goal.

Jacob Kirkegaard, non-resident senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, went as far as saying that ""there's only really one sticking point, which is that Trump wants tariffs on the EU, and the EU is not having it.""

CSIS's Luck struck a similar tone, flagging that, philosophically, the U.S. and EU have starkly different views going into the talks.

""This [U.S.] administration views these negotiations through a lens of how partners can concede to concessions to help us. They do not view this as a traditional reciprocal trade conversation, where we give something and they give something,"" he explained.

The EU has a much more traditional view, he said, as demonstrated by its zero-for-zero tariffs suggestion — which faced pushback from the White House.

European politicians are ""proud people who think of themselves as being on a equal footing to the United States"" who can't make ""constant"" concessions, nor do they feel like they should have to, Luck said.

The U.S. appears unlikely to accept a zero-for-zero agreement or one where tariffs are lowered for both parties, Luck said.

It's also doubtful the EU can secure a deal like the U.K., which agreed to certain quotas and tariffs on some critical sectors.

That's because firstly, the bloc would likely not accept similar conditions to the U.K., Luck added, but also ""because this [U.S.] administration has much bigger, sort of fundamental complaints about European policy.""

He does, however, see a scenario where the EU may agree to a lower tariff, such as the 10% currently in place — but only because it has to.

Rizzi also suggested that perhaps a ""limited deal that scales back or freezes tariffs on specific sectors"" could happen. But, he noted, this does not mean a broad agreement is imminent.

Others are even more pessimistic.

""I'm very skeptical that a deal will happen,"" Kirkegaard, who is also a senior fellow at Bruegel, said.

""I think it is much more likely that there's no deal, the EU then retaliates, and then we'll have to see whether Trump does with what he did with China: that he retaliates again, and maybe the EU retaliates again.""

He warned that de-escalation — and a deal — might only be possible when a certain, very high, threshold of economic pain is met.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran is staring down the possibility of seeing its most important nuclear facilities hit by a 30,000-pound American bomb.

White House officials on Tuesday told NBC News that U.S. President Donald Trump is considering a range of options including striking Iran directly, after the American leader repeatedly asserted that his administration would not allow Iran to continue its nuclear program or reach bomb-making capability.

Trump called for Iran's ""unconditional surrender"" and wrote in a post on Truth Social that the U.S. has the ability to assassinate Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 

""He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,"" Trump wrote shortly after declaring ""total control"" over Iranian airspace.

Khamenei on Wednesday responded, threatening the U.S. with ""irreparable damage"" if Washington follows through with a military strike. ""The damage they suffer will be far worse than anything Iran may face. If they enter militarily, they will face harm that they cannot recover from,"" the Iranian leader said, according to NBC News reporting.

The rapidly escalating conflict, triggered by Israel's surprise attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities on June 13, has sent oil prices surging and put a region on edge. Initially encouraging of diplomatic talks with Tehran, Trump's statements have become increasingly threatening as populations across the Middle East brace for what comes next. 

But destroying Iran's nuclear program — which Tehran asserts is for civilian energy purposes only — is no easy feat.

Iran's most advanced and hardened nuclear facility, the Fordo plant in the country's northwest, is a fortress. 

Built inside a mountain some 300 feet underground and reinforced by layers of concrete, the plant — which is the most likely target of a potential American strike — is impenetrable by any bomb except the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). The U.S. is the only country in the world that has this ""bunker buster"" weapon, as well as the only country with the aircraft capable of transporting and deploying it: the B2 Spirit stealth bomber. 

This is in part why Israel has been so eager for U.S. involvement in its offensive operations against Iran in addition to its defensive ones.

But a strike in itself would not be a one-and-done job, military experts say.

""So you have two challenges. You would have to drop two of these penetrators at the exact same site"" and likely need multiple bombing rounds, according to David Des Roches, a professor and senior military fellow at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C. 

""And then you would never be precisely sure how much of the facility you've damaged,"" he added, meaning personnel may need to be deployed on the ground. 

""This leads me to believe that for those facilities, Israel will ultimately gain control of the air and then land forces on the ground, force their way into the facility by detonating the doors, and then go and place explosive charges, exfiltrate whatever intelligence they can get, and just detonate it from the inside,"" Des Roches told CNBC.

Iran's military capabilities have been severely degraded over the past few days by Israeli attacks, which have taken out substantial parts of its air defenses, ballistic missile batteries, command-and-control nodes and dozens of top commanders.  

Still, such a strike by the U.S. could trigger Iran to respond by striking at U.S. assets in the region like embassies and military bases. Trump has made clear that any attack on U.S. personnel would draw a fierce American response, which would then pull the world's most powerful military more deeply into a regional conflict. 

""The Iranians have signaled that they are ready to attack U.S. bases in the region in the event of a U.S. attack on their domestic soil,"" said Gregory Brew, senior analyst on Iran and energy at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, noting that American bases in Iraq are particularly vulnerable. 

""There are risks in that environment that an Iranian retaliation causes U.S. casualties, kills U.S. servicemen, and potentially compels President Trump to expand the scope of U.S. action and order additional strikes on Iran and that, of course, would threaten general escalation and drag us into not just a single operation, but potentially a protracted air campaign."" 

Despite its enormous scale, the GPU-57 bunker buster would not create wide-scale damage beyond the area of the facility, Des Roches said. But it would have a ""profound psychological effect on the Iranians,"" he added, who have already seen significant damage and radioactive contamination risk wrought to the infrastructure of several of their nuclear sites in other parts of the country. 

A further critical question remains whether the Trump administration will limit itself to targeting nuclear sites, or whether it will expand operations beyond that — something Israel's government has also been urging, as it conveys its desire to see regime change for its longtime adversary.

""I think the conflict will end when Israel is confident that Iran has lost, for a significant period of time, the ability to make a nuclear weapon, and that its defenses are weakened enough that Israel will be able to go back and effectively disrupt any further effort by Iran to make a nuclear weapon,"" Des Roches argued.  

If Fordo remains operational, Israel's attacks would barely slow Iran's ability to build a bomb, nuclear analysts say. The decisions from the While House in the coming days will therefore prove decisive not only for the trajectory of Iran's nuclear program, but for the survivability of the Islamic Republic's regime as a whole.

Ali Vaez, Iran project director at nonprofit Crisis Group, believes that ""Iran can survive and rebuild its nuclear program,"" even without a diplomatic avenue for a deal with the U.S. 

""The U.S. entering the war will close the door on diplomacy,"" Vaez told CNBC. ""Trump might be able to destroy Fordow, but he won't be able to bomb away the knowledge that Iran has already acquired.""

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

""Do you need a U.S. warehouse?""

""Do you need a Mexico warehouse?"" ""Shipping to Europe?""

Salespeople, speaking in Mandarin Chinese, weren't shy about pushing their logistics services when I attended the 10th Shenzhen International Cross-Border E-Commerce Expo this week. One logistics company even hired foreign-looking models in glittery silver dresses to parade around the venue.

It's one of the biggest events of the year for companies selling from China to the U.S. and other countries via the internet. In the midst of a tepid truce in the U.S.-China tariff war, many companies appeared eager to enter the U.S. market.

But the game to survive has changed.

""The past 30 years have helped Chinese companies to become very mature in supply chain integration,"" Tina Hsu, partner at startup AIGC Empower, told me in Mandarin at the expo. ""Today, if there is a tool that can help [businesses] tell a story better, resonate with users … they could go overseas with the identity of a brand to operate in a healthier manner that's longer term and with higher profits.""

AIGC Empower claims it has those tools. At a joint launch with Amazon and Wayfair in Zhuhai, China, last month, Hsu said AIGC introduced two generative AI-powered products: a system for quickly researching local markets to understand consumer needs, and a tool for producing images for product advertisement. The service starts at 10,000 yuan ($1,390) per product per year — and has already received around 100 orders, Hsu said.

""To be honest, it's not every customer here who can appreciate the value"" of our product and the need for branding, she said, noting it's Chinese entrepreneurs who studied abroad that understand it best. But she warned that without inherent differentiation, Chinese companies will find it hard to survive overseas in the next 30 years.

While a few companies with Chinese roots such as Temu and Shein have grabbed the most attention when it comes to cross-border e-commerce, several smaller Chinese businesses have also been tapping the internet to sell directly to overseas consumers, as competition at home has intensified.

""The U.S. consumer market is still the world's largest, and the destination for most cross-border e-commerce sellers,"" said Li Xiaoming, distribution manager at Miao Shou, which sells software that allows merchants to analyze data from multiple e-commerce platforms in one place. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.

Although companies have turned to other countries, they're still holding onto some resources for deploying into the U.S. market — if conditions improve in the next few months, he said.

Regardless, Chinese sellers are piling into the cross-border e-commerce trend.

Miao Shou claimed that it had a total of 800,000 customers as of June, with around 200,000 companies joining the platform in the past six months. Li said the company aims to double clients' sales transaction volume on its platform this year.

To stand out in such a competitive environment, these companies need better branding and marketing, especially in the current trade climate.

""We believe tariffs this time mark a process of complete market reshuffling,"" pushing out companies that previously only relied on price, not product quality, to compete, Bear Huo, China general manager at fintech startup FundPark, said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.

With $750 million in financing from Goldman Sachs and HSBC, FundPark lends money to smaller Chinese businesses selling their wares overseas. Huo, who used to work at Alibaba, said that the startup has become an official loan provider for certain Chinese sellers on Walmart, and aims to reach a similar partnership with sellers on Amazon later this year.

Huo said FundPark is lending more to businesses for advertising as clients have ramped up their marketing spend to up to 20% of the product transaction value — a jump from 3% to 5% in 2023.

While ad spending can lead to short-term spurts in sales, building a brand is a longer-term process, and a far more challenging task. Even advertising legend John Hegarty has described the difficulties of getting companies to make bold, transformational moves in order to stand out in the market. But if Chinese exporters are to compete globally, they need to focus on the hard task of building a brand.

It's similar to what's playing out in China's cut-throat electric-car industry. Companies have been slashing prices and offering more high-tech features, but to stand out over the longer-term, they need to create brands that resonate with consumers.

Some Chinese companies believe they already have what it takes to build a brand, but lack the legal resources to protect themselves — especially as market incumbents launch targeted lawsuits that can force a Chinese seller to go out of business.

It's become such a pressing challenge that a group of Chinese merchants have backed a new platform that uses a low-cost insurance structure for litigation services that can otherwise be quite expensive, according to Jack Zhang, secretary-general at the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association's legal insurance division. He's leading the project with a team of about 30 people.

His plan is to group lawsuits into the thousands or tens of thousands, thereby negotiating a lower rate with law firms in the U.S. or another market. It's far from an operating service, and Zhang hopes he can reach the 1,000-case threshold around this time next year.

Several companies at the expo also advertised services from compliance to business registration — getting a U.S. trademark will cost the equivalent of $485, now available at a $150 discount, one flyer said. But as many of the vendors appeared to mimic each other's style, only attempting to undercut others on price, it's clear the concept of a brand has yet to take off.

Xiaopeng He, founder of Xpeng, talks about pressures and competition in the Chinese EV market: over-capacity, price wars, and technological innovations. He says the Turing chip is a necessary invention to help Xpeng transition to a large tech company.

Hong Hao, managing partner, at Lotus Asset Management, talks about where he's seeing opportunities in the China markets: biotech, bubble tea, and Pop Mart.

Nicholas Burns, former ambassador to China, joins ""Closing Bell Overtime"" to talk the role China could play in the Iranian-Israel conflict.

China's retail sales sharply beat expectations in May. Sales recorded their largest jump since December 2023, boosted by government subsidies and surging online shopping as a major e-commerce sales event started early. Industrial output and fixed-asset investment both saw growth soften from the prior month and missed expectations.

U.S.-China renewed trade truce left military-grade rare-earth issue unresolved. That's according to a Reuters report, citing two people briefed on the London bilateral meeting. Beijing has yet to loosen its grip on exports of some specialized rare-earth magnets, while U.S. maintains curbs on exporting cutting-edge AI chips to China.

China resumed Boeing's jet deliveries. Boeing delivered a new 787-9 aircraft to China's Juneyao Airlines on Saturday, months after Beijing had suspended the U.S. aerospace giant's deliveries amid tit-for-tat retaliation against Washington. That delivery comes after China agreed on dialing back some punitive measures against the U.S. with more trade negotiations underway.

Would you be bothered if your coat was officially classified as a windbreaker or a raincoat, or your shoes as slippers? Businesses do care though, as classifications under a preferred category can help them pay lower tariff rates.

As U.S. President Donald Trump imposes duties on friends and foes alike, manufacturers are increasingly rethinking the classification of their products and resorting to ""tariff engineering"" to incur lower duties, several customs lawyers, supply chain and shipping experts told CNBC.

Tariff engineering — a practice that precedes Trump — involves changing an item's materials, altering its dimensions or compositions so that the finished products can be justified to fit in a different ""harmonized system code,"" legal experts said.

Although most new tariffs added during Trump's second term are broad-based, the U.S. government has carved out exemptions for certain products, leaving doors open for companies to benefit through tariff engineering, trade lawyers pointed out.

After Trump unveiled sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs in April, several overseas manufacturers moved to bundle steel and aluminum elements into their final products to qualify a lower 25% duty under Section 232, said David Forgue, a partner at Chicago law firm Barnes, Richardson & Colburn.

Things, however, changed quickly in June as Trump jacked up tariffs on all steel, aluminum products and derivatives to 50%, except those from the U.K. ""Now that the duties are reversed, we're now seeing companies remove those elements and ship them separately again,"" Forgue said.

There is ""nothing inherently illegal or even untoward about leveraging strategic design choices that result in creating different products that are subject to different tariff classification and duty rates,"" said John Foote, a customs lawyer at Kelley Drye & Warren in Washington D.C. ""Tariff engineering is one of the few things you can do to try to get it right and reduce your duty liability.""

There are over 5,000 different product classification codes that U.S. customs authority uses while assessing tariffs. These tariff classifications were determined through decades of negotiations between governments and industry bodies, often varying by product category.

Winnebago Industries, an American manufacturer of motorhomes, or recreational vehicle, said in its quarterly earnings call in March that it planned to ""work with outside experts to develop and implement effective [tariff] mitigation strategies, including tariff engineering and deferrals.""

Aneel Salman, chair of economic security at Islamabad Policy Research Institute, described the act as ""clever art of outsmarting customs,"" as importers and manufacturers tweak products ""just enough"" to qualify for lower duties.

""I was talking to somebody recently and they were showing me their lapel pin,"" said Kelley Drye & Warren's Foote. The pin, tacked onto the person's suit, featured a ""festive design"" with pieces of cubic zirconia at the back, Foote said.

The inclusion of cubic zirconia helped the company that manufactures those pins avert a 14% tariff, as the item no longer fell under festive article category but got classified as jewelry, Foote subsequently learnt.

""The value attributable to the cubic zirconia was significant enough [and] it was a relatively easy manufacturing change,"" Foote said.

The practice of tariff engineering can be traced back to 1882, when an importer coated sugar with molasses to avoid higher duties imposed on lighter-colored sugar. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court ruled the act perfectly legal: ""so long as the goods are truly invoiced and freely and honestly exposed to the officers of customs for their examination, no fraud is committed.""

Since then, companies, big and small, have continued to play chess with the U.S. tariff classification system, with several household names successfully implementing strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs.

For instance, Columbia Sportswear has never been shy about its use of tariff engineering. ""I have a whole team of people that work together with designers and developers and merchandisers and with customs, and to ensure that during the design process that we're considering the impact of tariffs,"" Jeff Tooze, the company's vice president of global customs and trade, told Marketplace during Trump's first term.

Among its alterations, the company added small zippered pockets below the waist on women's shirts, allowing them to be exempted from higher duties under the U.S. customs rules.

Similarly, footwear maker Converse adds fuzzy-felt fabric to the soles of its signature All Stars sneakers, rather than the typical full-rubber one, to be categorized as slippers rather than athletic shoes, helping it cut tariff drastically.

Snuggies, the fluffy blanket with sleeves imported mainly from China, nearly halved its tariff costs by winning a lawsuit in 2017 classifying it as a blanket, not an item of clothing.

Fast-moving consumer good and garments, apparel and footwear sectors can find it relatively easy to implement tariff engineering, said Andrew Wilson, supply chain strategist at consultancy Supplino Inc.

For more sophisticated and ""heavily-regulated"" sectors such as automotive, aerospace, electronics and medical devices, ""it's especially challenging ... because even minor changes may require extensive validation and approval,"" Wilson said.

""You might be looking at another 12 to 24 months of testing, certification and validation in order to get that done,"" Wilson added, as it requires extensive collaboration across departments including design, engineering and legal team.

Companies have to tread a fine between between redesigning their products and fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications.

A case in point illustrating the challenges with tariff engineering is Ford Motor. The automaker had for years imported its Transit Connect van as a passenger van, then removed the second row seats to sell them as cargo vans. In doing so, Ford circumvented a hefty 25% tariff and only paid a 2.5% import duty.

The U.S. Justice Department said in its ruling last year that Ford was ""misclassifying cargo vans"" and that the back-row seats ""were never intended to be, and never were, used to carry passengers.""

""The article must be a 'commercial reality' at importation. The risk is that customs [may] find the changes to be ""fraud or artifice,"" [that case] the tariff engineering may be rejected,” said Forgue.

""In some cases changing certain things about a product doesn't change the essential character of what the good is,"" said Derek Scarbrough, founder of Global Logistical Connections. ""If you add something to a shopping cart, it's still a shopping cart,"" he added.

U.S. Customs and Border Control has developed a so-called ""binding ruling"" system where companies can obtain official determinations on product classifications and HTS code before importing.

Adam Lees, an attorney at law firm Harris Sliwoski, who has helped clients prepare such ruling letter requests, described it as ""a way for companies to get CBP's official blessing"" before shipment. 

Some companies, however, may be deterred from seeking such official rulings, as a potential unfavorable ruling could be constraining. ""You're stuck using whatever they said, and if they disagree, all of a sudden, you can't go under the radar anymore,"" Scarbrough said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Sam Altman says Meta offered OpenAI staff $100 million bonuses, as Mark Zuckerberg ramps up AI poaching efforts","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/18/sam-altman-says-meta-tried-to-poach-openai-staff-with-100-million-bonuses-mark-zuckerberg.html","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 05:03:06 GMT","



Meta Platforms tried to poach OpenAI employees by offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million, with even larger annual compensation packages, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said.

While Meta had sought to hire ""a lot of people"" from OpenAI, ""so far none of our best people have decided to take them up on that,"" Altman said, speaking on the ""Uncapped"" podcast, which is hosted by his brother.

""I've heard that Meta thinks of us as their biggest competitor,"" he said. ""Their current AI efforts have not worked as well as they have hoped and I respect being aggressive and continuing to try new things.""

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

The Meta CEO is personally trying to assemble a top artificial intelligence team for its ""superintelligence"" AI lab and has invested heavily in AI through its Meta AI research division, which also oversees its Llama series of open-source large language models.

The moves come after Meta had once again delayed the release of its latest flagship AI model due to concerns about its capabilities, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

Meanwhile, sources have previously told CNBC that Zuckerberg has become so frustrated with Meta's standing in AI that he's willing to invest billions in top talent. 

Last week Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, announced he was leaving for Meta as part of a deal that saw the Facebook parent dish out $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the AI startup. Wang added that a small number of Scale AI employees would also join Meta as part of the agreement. 

The Times had previously reported that Wang would head a research lab pursuing ""superintelligence,"" an AI system that surpasses human intelligence.

The company has also recently poached other top talent, including Jack Rae, a principal researcher at Google's AI research laboratory DeepMind, according to a report from Bloomberg. The report added that Zuckerberg had been directly involved with the recruitment efforts. 

Speaking on the podcast, which was released on Tuesday, Altman said that Meta's strategy of offering a large, upfront, guaranteed compensation would detract from the actual work and not set up a winning culture.

""I think that there's a lot of people, and Meta will be a new one, that are saying 'we're just going to try to copy OpenAI,'"" he added. ""That basically never works. You're always going to where your competitor was, and you don't build up a culture of learning what it's like to innovate.""

However, spending big on startups and their talent is nothing new to the AI space. Former Apple chief design officer Jony Ive joined OpenAI after the company acquired Ive's AI devices startup io through a $6.4 billion all-equity deal last month.

Some tech analysts have also pushed back against the notion that Meta has been missing the mark on AI.

""They basically built the rails for open source AI development, and so much of what is happening in AI is being built on Meta,"" Daniel Newman, CEO at Futurum Group, told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" last week. 

Open-source generally refers to software in which the source code is made freely available on the web for possible modification and redistribution. Llama's open-source characteristics have allowed many third-party applications to be built on top of it.  

Newman added that Meta's massive investments, such as in ScaleAI, will continue to push it forward in training its behemoth models.

Hopes of a quick ceasefire between Israel and Iran were dashed by several social media posts from U.S. President Donald Trump. As he took an early departure from the Group of Seven summit, Trump said it ""certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire"" and that he was involved in something ""much bigger than that.""

What's bigger than a ceasefire? An escalation in conflict on the prospect of the U.S. joining the hostilities in the Middle East. Trump, on his social media platform Truth Social, threatened Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that he is an ""easy target"" and wants him to ""surrender.""

Trump's posts on Truth Social brought U.S. stocks lower and caused oil prices, which were on the retreat Monday, to shoot up more than 4% during Tuesday's trading session in America. A weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales report in May also added to the heavy sentiment in markets.

The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting will conclude Wednesday. While central bankers are expected to leave interest rates unchanged, the committee will release updated projections of where they see rates going. Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions from the media at this press conference. All of those are market-moving events — so it's a relief, at least, they come from official communiques.

Trump weighs strike on IranA U.S. military strike against Iran is one of the options Trump is considering, after meeting with his top national security advisors on Tuesday afternoon, current and former administration officials told NBC News. Earlier in the day, Trump wrote on Truth Social that the U.S. knows ""exactly"" where the Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is ""hiding,"" and demanded ""UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!""

U.S. markets fell while Asia trades mixedU.S. stocks retreated Tuesday as Trump's rhetoric on Iran ramped up. The S&P 500 fell 0.84%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.91%. Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Wednesday. At 1:30 p.m. Singapore time, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.77% even as the government reported a drop in exports in May, while South Korea's Kospi added 0.56%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, however, lost 1.23%.

Exports from Japan fall in MayJapan exports in May declined 1.7% year over year, according to data from Japan's trade ministry released Wednesday. While that drop fares better than the 3.8% decline expected from a Reuters poll of economists, it's still the steepest fall since September 2024 and reverses the 2% growth in April. Exports to the U.S. dropped 11.1% from a year earlier, much worse than than the 1.8% fall in April.

Meta trying to poach OpenAI staff: AltmanOn a podcast released Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Meta had sought to hire ""a lot of people"" from the artificial intelligence company, and had offered signing bonuses as high as $100 million — but ""so far none of our best people have decided to take them up on that."" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is frustrated with his firm's standing in the AI space, sources told CNBC.

U.S. passes landmark crypto billThe U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark crypto bill that establishes federal guardrails, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. It also opens the door to a range of issuers, including banks, fintechs, and major retailers looking to launch their own stablecoins or integrate them into existing payment systems.

The Fed is likely to keep rates the same but give a forecast that moves markets. What to expect

While any immediate movement on interest rates seems improbable, the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes Wednesday, will feature important signals that still could move markets.

Among the biggest things to watch will be whether Federal Open Market Committee members stick with their previous forecast of two rate cuts this year, how they see inflation trending, and any reaction from Chair Jerome Powell to what has become a concerted White House campaign for easier monetary policy.

As things stand heading into the meeting, markets are pricing in the next cut to come in September, which would be the one-year anniversary of a surprisingly aggressive half-percentage-point reduction the FOMC instituted amid concerns over the labor market. The committee added two more quarter-point moves by the end of the year and has been on hold since.

Hopes of a quick ceasefire between Israel and Iran were dashed by several social media posts from U.S. President Donald Trump. As he took an early departure from the Group of Seven summit, Trump said it ""certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire"" and that he was involved in something ""much bigger than that.""

What's bigger than a ceasefire? An escalation in conflict on the prospect of the U.S. joining the hostilities in the Middle East. Trump, on his social media platform Truth Social, threatened Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that he is an ""easy target"" and wants him to ""surrender.""

Trump's posts on Truth Social brought U.S. stocks lower and caused oil prices, which were on the retreat Monday, to shoot up more than 4% during Tuesday's trading session. A weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales report in May also added to the heavy sentiment in markets.

The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting will conclude Wednesday. While central bankers are expected to leave interest rates unchanged, the committee will release updated projections of where they see rates going. Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions from the media at this press conference. All of those are market-moving events — so it's a relief, at least, they come from official communiques.

The S&P 500 fell 0.84%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.91%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index lost 0.85% as regional bourses slipped. Israel's Tel Aviv 35 index, however, touched an all-time high during the day, though it pared some gains.

Oil supply chains might get strainedThe CEOs of TotalEnergies, Shell, and EnQuest told CNBC on Tuesday that further attacks on critical energy infrastructure in Iran could have serious consequences for the global supply and prices of oil. Some shipowners are already steering clear of the strategically important Strait of Hormuz, according to the world's largest shipping association, reflecting a growing sense of unease as the Israel-Iran conflict rages on.

Revenue-less Regencell worth billionsShares of Regencell, an early-stage, Hong Kong-based bioscience company with no revenue, spiked 30% Tuesday, rocketed 280% Monday, and have risen more than 58,000% in 2025 to hit $36 billion in market value. Regencell — which develops traditional Chinese medicine formula — is the latest example of a speculative international stock attracting attention during summer trading.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets ended the trading day lower as investors monitored the latest developments in the Middle East.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 provisionally closed 0.34% lower, with healthcare stocks leading the decline.

Germany's DAX index and the French CAC 40 both ended the trading day around 0.4% lower, while the  FTSE 100 bucked the trend to close 0.1% higher.

A spate of interest rate decisions from central banks are due tomorrow, including the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank. Traders are also bracing for the Federal Reserve's latest rate policy decision, due later today.

British lender TSB has attracted acquisition interest from larger rivals NatWest and Santander, according to two media reports.

Spanish financial news outlet Vozpopuli reported overnight that TSB's parent Sabadell had been approached by U.K. bank NatWest, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland, expressing takeover interest.

According to the news outlet's sources, NatWest is expected to make a 2.3 billion euro ($2.65 billion) offer for TSB.

British broadcaster Sky News also reported that Santander had approached Sabadell with similar intentions for TSB.

Earlier this year, NatWest also reportedly made a £11 billion offer ($14.8 billion) to acquire Santander's U.K. banking division.

Shares of a little-known Swedish company Bambuser are up around 75% this morning after it revealed details of a deal with China's Alibaba.

Bambuser said it has partnered with Alibaba Cloud, the technology subsidiary of the Chinese giant, to make its live video shopping technology available in the Chinese market.

Livestream shopping is a phenomenon that originated in China in 2016, where companies and individuals market their wares over a live video stream. Consultants McKinsey say the trend is growing in the U.S. and Europe as well, helped by the growth of social media app TikTok in those markets.

""To support its entry into the Chinese e-commerce market, Bambuser leverages Alibaba Cloud's secured cloud infrastructure and innovative video solutions to bring its complete video commerce platform to the brands in the market,"" the company said in a statement.

The deal with Alibaba is expected to help Bambuser gain access to a large market in China —  where 55% of users engage in live video shopping, the most globally.

""As a leading cloud service provider, we aim to collaborate with Bambuser to foster retail business growth in China, the largest e-commerce landscape in the world,"" said Esmie Wang, general manager of the EU at Alibaba Cloud Intelligence.

The share price surge partly reverses a long-term decline in the share price of Bambuser. The company's stock has given up nearly all the gains it had accumulated during the pandemic.

The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will give an update on its key interest rate on Thursday, a day after U.K. inflation cooled slightly to 3.4%.

""Make no mistake: despite the still elevated levels of inflation, this will be welcome news for the MPC,"" Deutsche Bank's Sanjay Raja said in a note after the print was released. ""The Bank's preferred measure (excluding indexed and volatile components, rents, and foreign holidays) [dropped] below 4% y/y for the first time since February 2022.""

Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, noted that the conflict between Israel and Iran could also impact inflation moving forward.

""The price at the [gasoline] pump played a big part in the slight fall in headline inflation but the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has impacted the oil price in the past week, with UK motorists already bracing themselves for hikes and airfares also expected to soar,"" he said.

Deutsche Bank's Raja agreed that policymakers will be monitoring the situation in the Middle East, which would ""undoubtedly complicate the MPC's task.""

""The focus now will turn to geopolitical events and the rise in energy prices,"" he said. ""Higher energy prices will mean higher inflation expectations. The trump card? The labour market data. The ongoing labour market loosening should give the MPC a little more confidence in its 'gradual and careful' approach to dialling down restrictive policy.""

Jordan Rochester, head of FICC strategy at Mizuho Bank EMEA, agreed that the British labor market could influence sentiment at the Bank of England.

""It is the labour market news that has provided the recent dovish surprise and could prove to be the justification for a dovish shift in voting/language tomorrow,"" he said.

Sweden's central bank cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday to 2% amid weakening inflation, but pointed to geopolitical risks ahead.

""The economic recovery that began last year has lost momentum, and inflation is expected to be somewhat lower than in the previous forecast,"" it said in a press release, noting ""favourable conditions for stronger economic activity in Sweden,"" partly because of increasing real household wages.

Annual Swedish inflation most recently came in at a cooler-than-expected 2.3% in May, according to the country's statistics office. The central bank — known as Riskbank — aims to keep inflation at a lower 2%.

Looking ahead, the central bank warned ""there are substantial risks linked to trade policy and the geopolitical tensions, not least as a result of the escalating conflict in the Middle East, which could affect economic developments abroad.""

We're around 25 minutes into Wednesday's trading session, and so far there's no consensus movement among regional stocks. 

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen marginally lower, with sectors in mixed territory. 

Major bourses are also pointing in different directions, with Germany's DAX index slightly below the flatline while the FTSE 100 and the French CAC 40 last seen up by around 0.1%.

Ahead of a business update on Wednesday, Airbus raised the upper end of its dividend payout ratio and confirmed its full-year guidance.

The company said that it would extend ""the upper range of the dividend payout ratio to 30-50% from the current payout ratio of 30-40%.""

Shares were last seen trading 1.4% higher.

— Chloe Taylor

U.K. government bonds, known as gilts, strengthened slightly after inflation came in in line with analysts' expectations.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt was around 2 basis points lower by 7:07 a.m. in London. Yields on 2- and 20-year gilts were down by around 1 basis point, while 5- and 30-year gilt yields remained unchanged.

Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.

— Chloe Taylor

U.K. inflation cooled slightly to 3.4% in the year to May, data from Britain's Office for National Statistics showed on Wednesday.

The reading was in line with analyst expectations.

A month earlier, inflation unexpectedly surged to 3.5%.

Good morning and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering European financial market action and the latest regional and global business news, data and earnings.

Futures data from IG suggests sharp falls across European markets at the open, with London's FTSE looking set to open 52 points lower at 8,827, Germany's DAX down 245 points at 23,447, France's CAC 40 down 75 points at 7,665 and Italy's FTSE MIB 329 points lower at 39,568.

Global investors continue to assess ongoing fighting between Israel and Iran tensions after continued missile attacks and airstrikes on Monday.

Oil prices have risen on supply worries, and the price of gold has also increased amid a flight to safe haven assets after the conflict erupted last week.

Those prices rose further overnight, and U.S. stock futures turned lower, after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a further escalation in attacks could be coming as he urged Iranians to evacuate Tehran.

— Holly Ellyatt

The U.S. Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision is due Wednesday afternoon. Fed funds futures are pricing in an almost 100% likelihood that the central bank will keep rates unchanged, as per CME's FedWatch tool, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's continued pressure on Fed Chief Jerome Powell for a rate cut.

Investors will be keeping a close eye on Powell's post-meeting comments and for the central bank policymakers' forecast on rate policy, as the Federal Open Market Committee will be sharing members' ""dot plot"" of rate expectations.

In Europe, U.K. investors will be keeping a close eye on inflation data from the U.K. for May, with economists expecting the consumer price index to have risen 3.4% in the year to May. Elsewhere, Sweden's Riksbank publishes its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday.

There are no other data or major earnings reports due.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin below $100K now ‘less likely' as BTC price eyes liquidity at $106K","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-below-100k-less-likely-btc-price-liquidity-106k","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 09:42:41 GMT","

 Bitcoin price hovers around $105,000 on Wednesday and shows staying power as BTC's chance of falling to $100,000 appears to be decreasing, new analysis suggests. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin price consolidates around $105,000 as liquidity builds up above the spot price.

A support/resistance flip at $106,00 is a must for the bulls as $100,000 remains a key level.

Bitcoin fell alongside the broader crypto market during Tuesday's late New York trading hours, dropping by as much as 4% to $103,400 after US President Donald Trump's comments on the Iran-Israel conflict. 

After tapping the liquidity around $103,000, traders said a correction to areas below $100,000 was unlikely as liquidity builds up above $106,000. 

Bitcoin's price has held successfully above the $100,000 psychological level since reclaiming it on May 8. This has remained a critical level on traders' radars and has not received a convincing retest recently.

MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe spotted Bitcoin hovering at $104,400, saying that after being rejected from the $106,000 level, BTC may drop lower to take the liquidity between $100,000 and $103,000. 

An accompanying chart shows $100,000 as the key level to watch on BTC's four-hour time frame. Losing this level would see traders look for entry positions below $100,000.

Van de Poppe added:

Pseudonymous analyst CrypNuevo shared a chart showing Bitcoin “looking good” as it holds above $100,000 after successfully retesting it on June 6. 

“All we need is this support level to hold, and to flip $106,000 into support to push the price higher,” the trader said.

As reported by Cointelegraph, the $100,000 level is an important psychological boundary with implications for sentiment should it fail to hold.

Several traders eye a potential upside liquidity grab with ask orders clustering above $106,000.

The latest data from monitoring resource CoinGlass showed price eating away bids around $105,000, with ask-orders clustering between the spot price and $109,000.

The chart above shows ask orders worth $70 million building up around $106,500, with the $109,000-$110,000 cluster being another potentially significant liquidity area. 

If the $106,000 level is broken, it could spark a liquidation squeeze, forcing short sellers to close positions and driving prices toward $110,000, which is the next major liquidity cluster.

Written By:Gopal Solanky

As the financial markets feel heavy amid the escalating geopolitical tension—largely due to the Israel and Iran conflict—the US Federal Reserve will be adding more fuel to market uncertainty as it is set to announce the outcome of its two-day policy meeting (FOMC) today, on June 18 at 2 p.m. eastern time (ET).

The cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, is bracing for potential volatility as market data and betting platforms overwhelmingly suggest the Fed will maintain current rates.

Market analysts are predicting that the Fed will conclude the meeting while keeping rates unaltered today. After the initial announcement, the subsequent press conference will be hosted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m., where he will share the results of discussions.

According to the CME FedWatch tool, there is a 99.9% probability that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged, a stance echoed by Polymarket, a decentralized betting market, where bets heavily favor no rate adjustment. 

This decision comes amid a stable yet pressured economic landscape, with inflation at 2.4% in May 2025 and a labor market showing an unemployment rate of 4.2% (Federal Reserve Board). The Summary of Economic Projections, due at 2:00 PM ET, will also provide critical insights into the Fed's outlook, potentially influencing market sentiment further.

Due to its infamous volatile nature, the crypto market is particularly more sensitive to FOMC outcomes. While it's hours to the Fed's decision, Bitcoin is already showing signs of increased volatility, with it hovering near the $105,000 mark, risking a significant pullback to $100K if the Fed signals a hawkish stance or delays rate cuts. 

Ethereum has also slipped below $2,500 in a loosening move, reflecting caution among investors, while XRP faces additional pressure due to the ongoing Ripple-SEC case, with a recent deadline extension fueling uncertainty. 

Analysts suggest that a dovish hint from Powell could spur capital flows into altcoins, potentially pushing XRP toward $3 and Ethereum above $2,600, as seen in January 2025 when rates held steady at 4.5% at the time. Conversely, a hawkish policy could trigger larger sell-offs and extend current losses.

The Fed's decision today is further complicated by rising oil prices, which some argue may necessitate rate hikes rather than cuts. As Powell's cautious approach—rooted in his tenure since 2018 and past quantitative easing policies—suggests a focus on inflation control over stimulus, market reactions are expected to be stiff, with traders anticipating sharp movements in both traditional and digital assets post-announcement.

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.

As Asia begins its trading day, ETH$2,483.68 is trading above $2500 as the U.S. Senate passes the GENIUS Act with bipartisan support.

While the Senate was busy passing the GENIUS Act, Vivek Raman, founder of Ethereum advocacy firm Etherealize, was even busier, making the rounds on Wall Street to explain why ETH is suddenly at the center of institutional finance.

Of course, Ethereum is nothing new. It's almost a decade old. But finally, in its almost 10 years of existence, Wall Street is starting to pay attention, and they really want to talk about it.

“It's an amazing job… running around from bank to bank, buy side to buy side, telling them what Ethereum tokenization means, how L2s work, and why it all flows through ether,” he told CoinDesk during an interview in between meetings from the lobby of Wall Street's Brookfield Place.

As founder of Etherealize, Raman leads the firm's efforts to educate Wall Street on ETH as neutral collateral and to help institutions tokenize assets and build on Ethereum.

Raman says that Ethereum's core value proposition, its role as the settlement and collateral layer behind stablecoins and tokenized assets, is finally resonating with institutional investors.

“Every action is powered by ether,” he said. “Eventually, it's going to be viewed as just as pristine as bitcoin. It'll be the neutral asset for the whole ecosystem.”

The turning point, Raman says, was regulatory clarity.

“Ethereum's potential hasn't been allowed until now,” he said, pointing to the GENIUS Act and broader U.S. policy momentum. “For years we didn't know if it was a security or a commodity.""

That's why, despite the headlines around the ETH ETF, Raman says the real unlock for Ethereum came from regulatory clarity, not a ticker symbol.

“The ETH ETF cleared the way by signaling that ether is a commodity, but it still wasn't explicit,” Raman said. “With clear market structure, the utility of Ethereum gets completely unleashed. Now ETH permeates everything: every tokenized asset transfer, every stablecoin transfer, every Layer 2, they all flow through ETH.”

And while Circle's IPO and the rise of tokenized treasuries have brought new visibility to the sector, Raman says savvy investors will want more than equity exposure to stablecoin brands.

Circle may get the IPO, but Ethereum gets the flows,” he said. “ETH is what secures this whole ecosystem, and it's the only neutral, non-censorable collateral that can route value between all these tokenized assets.”

VanEck's proposed Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) has been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website under the ticker symbol VSOL, a procedural step that typically signals readiness for electronic clearing and settlement.

VanEck's DTCC listing comes amid growing institutional interest in Solana, following the blockbuster success of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs.

However, just like with those ETFs, Canada has beaten the U.S. in the race to get listed.

Four Canadian issuers, Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ, launched their Solana ETFs in April, following approval from the Ontario Securities Commission.

OKX has officially launched regulated crypto exchanges in Germany and Poland, marking a strategic expansion into two of Europe's most active digital asset markets.

The company now offers spot trading, staking, automated trading bots, and over 60 crypto-Euro pairs to users in both countries, supported by localized platforms with Euro onramps.

""Germany and Poland are key growth markets in the EU, and our license allows us to tailor our products and services to meet the specific needs of users in each country, delivering greater value, enhanced security, and more efficient access to customers,"" Erald Ghoos, CEO of OKX Europe, said in a release.

In the release, OKX emphasized its regulatory positioning, highlighting its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) compliance and ongoing transparency efforts, including 31 consecutive months of Proof of Reserves reports.

Picture a four-lane highway suddenly upgraded with a government-built bullet train. Commuters who once tolerated toll roads and traffic will board the shiny new line the moment it starts running. The same dynamic may be coming for crypto. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are edging closer to launch in the world's largest economies, promising 24/7, fee-free settlement backed by the state.

If that rail goes live, why would ordinary people keep routing payments through privately issued cryptocurrencies that charge gas fees and carry protocol risk? That question should be front of mind for anyone holding payment-focused altcoins today. Let's investigate this issue in closer detail.

Image source: Getty Images.

Early evidence already hints at the risk of total replacement of many altcoins by CBDCs.

As an example, consider that the Bahamas rolled out its Sand Dollar, the world's first nationwide retail CBDC, in late 2020. Why might that be a problem for altcoins?

In short, because the Sand Dollar offers near-instant transfers with no foreign exchange spread, while merchants avoid interchange fees entirely. Programmability matters too, as regulators can flag suspicious transfers, which is a feature that is now appearing in U.K. digital-pound proofs of concept. And though the European Central Bank (ECB) insists its coming digital euro ""would not be programmable money,"" it still plans automated rules for tax refunds and social payments if users opt in.

The U.S. is inching forward in evaluating the impacts of CBDCs as well, despite an executive order earlier this year banning their implementation.

A bipartisan congressional brief concluded in April that CBDCs are more likely to compete directly with cryptocurrencies used for payments than with speculative, novel, or other decentralized finance (DeFi) assets, laying the intellectual groundwork for a retail digital dollar pilot.

If central banks can deliver near-free transfers with compliance baked in, the core selling proposition of many payment-rail altcoins, which is to say cheaper, faster movement of value, would evaporate. Tokens such as XRP (XRP -0.33%) derive a large share of their thesis from cross-border settlement efficiency. Should CBDCs interoperate across borders, a feature that's in active testing in numerous examples, that advantage shrinks further.

Not every crypto project lives or dies on raw payments.

Ethereum underpins thousands of decentralized finance contracts that price risk, provide leverage, and tokenize real-world assets. Solana is courting developers building on-chain games and high-throughput AI data feeds. Such ecosystems offer utility that CBDCs will not replicate soon.

Before buying or holding any altcoin while CBDCs loom, investors should trace the real demand, keeping in mind that if volume spikes coincide with airdrops or liquidity mining, usage could disappear once state-owned digital cash is live. Investors should also model fee compression, as programmable CBDCs will cost users nearly zero, raising the question of whether an altcoin can drop its fees without gutting validator incentives.

Assuming CBDCs gain mainstream traction by the late-2020s, tokens that fail those tests face shrinking addressable markets. The ECB aims for a political deal on the digital euro by early 2026, then a two- to three-year rollout. Others are likely to follow.

That does not guarantee crashes in altcoins; meme coins thrived in 2024 despite lacking utility altogether, capturing a large amount of crypto narrative attention. Still, betting on speculative enthusiasm to outpace structural competition from sovereign money is not a viable strategy. And the threat to altcoins, particularly those without real capital backing, is undeniable.

Therefore, tilt your preference to invest toward scarce on-chain capabilities that CBDCs cannot easily match. For example, while XRP's use as a medium of exchange may be threatened by CBDCs, its use as a platform for on-chain financial infrastructure catered to institutional investors is not, as its positioning is unique within the sector on that front.

Other cryptocurrency sectors and capabilities like decentralized compute, verifiable storage, permissionless derivatives, or culture-driven digital collectibles will probably survive. Keep your position sizes in pure-payment tokens modest, and demand compelling value propositions before investing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altcoin ETF applications surge as SEC softens crypto stance","https://cointelegraph.com/news/etf-filings-2025-altcoin-summer","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 16:49:58 GMT","

 This year has seen an uptick in the number of altcoin ETF applications, with at least 31 filed in the first half of 2025, Cointelegraph Research found. 

Regulatory optimism in the US has led to at least 31 altcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in the first half of 2025. 

The SEC has approved futures and spot ETFs for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), but past attempts to list altcoin-related instruments have withered on the vine. Now, renewed optimism after the 2024 elections has led to several new applications that are expected to be approved.

The list includes filings from familiar names such as VanEck, which applied to list ETFs in BNB (BNB) and Avalanche (AVAX). WisdomTree and Franklin Templeton both have XRP (XRP) ETFs pending. Memecoins are also represented, with REX-Osprey applying to list an ETF of US President Donald Trump's token.

ETF and crypto analysts are optimistic that at least 10 applications will pass muster with the SEC, which has onlookers hyped about an “altcoin summer.”

Spot Bitcoin ETFs were first approved in the US in January 2024. Months later, in July, spot Ether ETFs followed.

This nod was seen as a pivotal moment for the adoption of cryptocurrencies, as it gave institutional investors exposure to the market through a financial instrument they were already comfortable with: an ETF. 

Now, altcoins (any crypto that isn't Ether or Bitcoin) may be getting their shot at institutional adoption.

As shown by Cointelegraph Research, there have been at least 31 spot altcoin ETF filings in 2025. Among the applications, ETFs containing Ripple's payments-focused crypto, XRP, and the seminal memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) appear most prominently. 

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, a “potential Alt Coin summer” is on the way, with a Litecoin (LTC) ETF likely to be the first approved — although Solana (SOL) could be close behind. 

“[A Litecoin ETF is] def among the most likely to be out first, but Osprey forcing their Solana 40 act filing effective may have sparked the SEC to act faster on the Solana ones,” he said.

“Commission staff continues to have unresolved questions about whether the Funds, if structured and operated as proposed, would be able to meet the definition of ‘investment company' under the Investment Company Act,” the SEC stated. 

Still, Balchunas said that REX-Osprey lawyers are certain they can work things out with the commission, and the fund's legal team is pushing the envelope in an effort to be first to market.

Analysts showed further cause for optimism after the SEC reportedly asked would-be Solana ETF issuers to update and clarify filing language regarding in-kind redemptions and staking. This supposedly shows that the SEC is open to staking — a key component of many altcoin ecosystems. 

According to a Bloomberg Terminal snapshot shared by Balchunas, chances for altcoin ETF approval are good overall, tipping approval changes for 10 ETFs at 60% or above. 

Still, ETF approval does not guarantee prices going to the moon. Nearly a year after approval, ETH's price has not seen the same meteoric price action as its counterpart, Bitcoin. 

Last month witnessed positive inflows and not a single day of net outflows to ETH ETFs, but critics and observers are concerned about relatively low network fees and the Ethereum network losing ground on decentralized exchanges. 

Related: SOL price toward $300 next? Solana ETF approval chances jump to 91%

Demand for altcoin ETFs may be even less than for ETH ETFs, as Balchunas stated, “Nothing will compare to bitcoin. We have a little saying on the team: ‘The further away you get from btc, the less assets there will be.'”

Dreams for an “altcoin summer” may further dampen as altcoins' dominance wanes. Crypto market observer Daan Crypto Trades wrote in February about decreasing altcoin dominance but noted that “the decline was quicker and more severe” than previous cycles.

Two independent “altcoin season indexes” from Blockchain Center and CoinMarketCap show the indicator firmly in “Bitcoin season.” 

Still, others see an opportunity. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe wrote on June 1 that the altcoin market hasn't even begun: “The biggest bull market ever on crypto is about to happen, as the expansion after such a long bear market is going to be bigger than before.”

Even as Israel's attack on Iran shook crypto prices on June 13, van de Poppe remained optimistic of upward momentum, stating that gold breaking downward was a signal for altcoin growth. 

“Buying the dip for opportunities. This should quickly fade away,” he said in a subsequent post. 

On April 10, the SEC got its new chairman, businessman Paul Atkins, following a lengthy confirmation process in the Senate. 

Atkins' priorities were to reverse the actions of his predecessor, Gary Gensler, whom the crypto industry accused of stifling its potential.

Atkins' SEC has wasted no time reversing a number of policies and implementing new, crypto-friendly rules.

On June 12, the SEC announced that it would be “withdrawing certain notices of proposed rulemaking” made under Gensler. Among them was Rule 3b-16, which expanded the definition of the term “exchange” to include DeFi protocols. 

Related: SEC to shape crypto policy with ‘notice and comment,' says Atkins

It also axed a rule that required investment firms to hold client assets with a “qualified custodian,” a definition from which crypto exchanges and wallet providers were typically excluded. 

Atkins has also directed staff to work on a so-called “innovation exemption.” This new exclusion for certain crypto- and blockchain-related financial products would supposedly allow new onchain products to come to market more quickly. 

The SEC chair's new approach of “notice and comment” rather than “regulation by enforcement” has been lauded not just by the crypto industry but by fellow regulator Caroline Pham, acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 

With regulatory restructuring just getting started — be it from new laws to agency shakeups — the crypto industry is optimistic for future growth in the US. ETFs may be set to take off in this changing landscape.

The acquisitions bring The Blockchain Group's total Bitcoin holdings to 1,653 BTC, purchased at an average price of €90,081 ($104,000) per coin. The company reported a “BTC Yield” – measuring Bitcoin holdings relative to fully diluted shares – of 1,173.2% year-to-date, significantly outpacing other major corporate holders.

The company's latest purchases were executed through Swissquote Bank Europe and Banque Delubac, with custody provided by Swiss infrastructure provider Taurus. Additional funding came from the conversion of share warrants into 2.98 million ordinary shares, raising €1.6 million.

We're seeing unprecedented growth in corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies. The Blockchain Group's success has created a model for European companies, with new organizations announcing Bitcoin purchases almost weekly.

The company indicated potential plans to acquire an additional 70 BTC through ongoing transactions, which could bring its total holdings to 1,723 BTC. This follows recent Bitcoin treasury announcements from companies including Metaplanet, which now holds 10,000 BTC, and Strategy's latest acquisition of 10,1000 BTC.

At press time, Bitcoin trades at $104,021, down 1.26% over the past 24 hours, as markets continue to process the implications of growing institutional adoption. The Blockchain Group's shares were down 3.9% to €4.80 on Wednesday, trading on Euronext Paris.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) posted a memo yesterday detailing a meeting between its Crypto Task Force and JP Morgan. While the task force primarily handles cryptocurrency issues, it also oversees tokenization matters that increasingly affect traditional finance (TradFi) companies.

JP Morgan's meeting agenda revealed three key discussion points: an overview of its existing digital finance services including repo solutions and debt platforms, analysis of how capital markets activity might migrate to public blockchains, and plans for future regulatory engagement.

The discussion likely centered heavily on tokenized collateral, an area where multiple regulators are actively involved. The CFTC is currently running tokenized collateral pilots for derivatives margin posting, and the DTCC is launching its own platform. The CME is also participating in this space.

Traditional margin requirements involve initial margin at trade inception and variation margin over time. Securities typically serve as initial margin while cash covers variation margin due to settlement delays. This creates market risks during volatile periods when institutions must sell assets to generate cash.

Tokenization offers a solution by allowing institutions to transfer tokenized securities directly to meet margin requirements without selling underlying assets. JP Morgan's recent announcement of JPMD deposit tokens on the Base public blockchain further addresses cash collateral needs, providing an alternative to stablecoins.

The bank already operates a tokenized collateral solution on its permissioned blockchain, Kinexys, alongside an intraday repo solution called Digital Financing and a bond issuance platform called Digital Debt Services. However, using permissioned blockchains creates integration challenges that public blockchains can ease.

While BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have tokenized money market funds on public blockchains, so far their usage has primarily attracted crypto institutions rather than traditional finance companies. JP Morgan sees an opportunity to serve the latter market.

The meeting was led by Scott Lucas, JP Morgan's Head of Markets Digital Assets since early 2021, who serves on the boards of blockchain firms Ownera (interoperability) and HQLAᵡ (digital collateral). He was joined by Justin Cohen, who oversees product development for the equity derivatives group that would potentially automate tokenized collateral posting for the bank's own trading operations.

Stablecoins were used to streamline Feniix Energy's $75 million buyout, bypassing traditional banks.

Feniix Energy, an energy firm based in Latin America, has completed a $75 million acquisition of a live oil and gas operation using blockchain tokenization, according to a statement shared with CryptoSlate on June 17.

Global Settlement, a blockchain firm specializing in real-world assets (RWAs), executed the deal through its GSX Protocol.

The protocol enabled instant settlements, reduced counterparty risk, and lowered transaction fees. It also introduced full transparency throughout the funding and ownership process.

Notably, stablecoins were used to settle the transaction, removing the need for traditional banking intermediaries. This marked a pivotal move in financing capital-intensive projects using decentralized finance tools.

The acquisition was structured entirely through tokenized debt and equity. An unnamed leading commodity trading company provided the debt portion, making this the first known instance of a fully tokenized capital structure used to purchase an active energy asset.

Feniix Energy's Director, Alejandro Uribe, described the deal as a milestone in energy financing. He said that blockchain brought unmatched speed, visibility, and trust features that were often missing in traditional financing.

He said:

“Our collaboration with Global Settlement demonstrates how innovation can bridge traditional finance and the crypto economy, unlocking substantial value for our stakeholders.”

Global Settlement founder Kyle Sonlin added that the deal aimed to showcase the real-world benefits of tokenization. He emphasized that on-chain infrastructure helped streamline capital flows and reduce operational costs.

Industry observers see this acquisition as a breakthrough moment for blockchain adoption in traditional sectors. The use of tokenized capital in live infrastructure deals signals growing confidence in blockchain as a financing tool for institutional-grade projects.

The timing of this deal aligns with rising momentum in the RWA space. A June 16 report by CoinGecko noted that the tokenized treasuries market surged 544.8% in 2024, reaching an all-time high of $5.6 billion by April 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","R0AR introduces unified DeFi platform for token, liquidity, and NFT staking","https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/r0ar-introduces-unified-defi-platform-for-token-liquidity-and-nft-staking","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 10:09:10 GMT","

Sheridian, Wyoming, June 18th, 2025, Chainwire – R0AR has launched its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that integrates token staking, liquidity provision, and NFT-based rewards into a single user interface. Designed to support long-term engagement, the platform streamlines participation while incorporating embedded security measures and time-based reward models.

The R0AR Platform enables users to interact with three primary mechanisms:

Token staking: Users can stake 1R0R tokens for defined durations and earn time-weighted rewards based on lock-up periods.

Liquidity provision: Participants contribute to ETH/1R0R liquidity pools and receive rewards calculated through a dynamic, time-based APY system.

NFT staking: Executive R0AR Society (ERS) NFTs allow holders to access monthly returns that scale with the duration of the stake. The NFTs also interface with governance and future AI-based personalization tools.

All services are accessible via a unified dashboard compatible with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, and additional login methods.

The SmartAPY system employed by R0AR replaces static returns and fixed lock-up models with a time-sensitive structure that increases rewards proportionally with the length of the stake. All liquidity and staking positions are subject to an 11-day minimum engagement window, enforced on-chain, with real-time visibility into countdowns for penalty-free withdrawal.

The platform operates without reliance on third-party routing or aggregator services, reducing exposure to slippage and MEV-related risks. Smart contracts include embedded protections against unauthorized interactions and manipulation. Additionally, users can purchase 1R0R directly using ETH, USDC, or USDT via the platform, bypassing the need for centralized exchanges.

Beyond aesthetic or collectible use, ERS NFTs serve functional roles within the platform. When locked, they deliver increasing monthly payouts and can boost staking rewards when held alongside 1R0R in the same wallet. Bonus incentives are also available for verified users.

The NFTs include metadata designed to integrate with R0AR's upcoming AI tools, allowing the system to adjust experiences based on behavioral patterns without requiring active user input.

Each of the platform's core functions—staking, liquidity, and NFT utilities—contributes to a cohesive ecosystem. Built on the Optimism OP Stack, the R0AR Platform benefits from reduced transaction costs and scalability for future integrations, including real-world asset support and AI-enhanced personalization features.

The R0AR Platform is scheduled for public release on 6-13-2025 . Users will be able to access all staking, liquidity, and NFT functionalities (NFT staking to follow on the r0ar platform in the coming weeks after launch) at https://www.r0ar.io/platform.

R0AR is a decentralized finance platform offering token staking, liquidity solutions, and NFT-based engagement tools. Operating on the Ethereum Blockchain & R0AR's custom OP Stack Layer 2 chain, the platform emphasizes time-based rewards, user protection, and simplified participation across DeFi protocols.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions.

On March 11th, 2021, Beeple's ‘The First 5000 Days' NFT sold for $69 million, kicking off one of the wildest speculative frenzies in the history of an industry synonymous with speculative frenzies.

By April of the next year, the floor price of a Bored Ape NFT neared half-a-million dollars. You couldn't get an Uber in Rochester, let alone Manhattan, without your driver mentioning the latest drop. Mythical brands from Nike to Louis Vuitton were going all in–crypto's mainstream adoption had finally arrived. 

And then, the bottom fell out of the market. 

NFT monthly trading volumes plummeted from a $5 billion peak in January 2022 to $36 million. Earlier this year, Bybit, Kraken and X2Y2 shut down their NFT marketplaces. X2Y2 didn't mince words, citing “the 90% shrinkage of NFT trading volume from its peak” as the death knell.

After years in the NFT trenches as an investor, community member and advisor, I've reached an uncomfortable conclusion: NFTs are structurally designed to fail. Not because their creators are scammers, but because their economic foundations rest on digital quicksand. 

Here's why, and what might save them. 

Building businesses on artificial scarcity is not new. Designer goods have made Bernard Arnault, the CEO of Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, one of the world's richest men. And De Beers diamonds (despite healthy criticism of their market manipulation) is a $35 billion empire. 

And yet NFTs, despite mathematically guaranteed scarcity, haven't held up. The reason? They are caught in a perfect storm of unsustainable economics. Relying on one time drop revenue and fading trading royalties. 

Without a source of recurring revenue and the ongoing expense of a large hype machine, cash reserves inevitably fade, founders move on and the community is left with an empty shell.

Founders aren't always to be blamed especially when global decentralized communities are conditioned to expect incentives, benefits and handouts. They become a liability for sustained engagement burning away the very reserves they helped to establish.  Thus, community alone isn't enough to weather the storm.  The hard truth is that digital interaction cannot replace the power of a functional and engaging product.

Strip away the marketing buzz, and what remains? A digital image that can be right-clicked and saved by anyone. Humans seek fulfillment through beauty, status, and community. Traditional art, fashion, and social clubs have delivered these for centuries without blockchain validation. The novelty of NFT ownership isn't enough to compete with these entrenched alternatives.

However, all is not lost in the NFT world.  New projects are finding success and market share in an industry most collectors have stepped back from.  

The question then becomes: Is it possible to launch a new collection in todays' market?  

The answer: Possibly so, but one should carefully consider the market and strategy before doing so.

Before jumping into NFT production, the most important step is deciding whether to issue an NFT at all. If your goal is simply to sell a profile picture (PFP), avatar, or collectible art, understand the landscape you're entering. The NFT ecosystem is already saturated, with thousands of collections and over ten million unique NFTs already in circulation. Visibility is scarce, and there are arguably more NFTs than active buyers today.  Without meaningful utility and functional value, you're unlikely to find traction in today's market.

If you're still committed to launching a collection, take lessons from the most successful projects. While you can't control factors like being the first to market or launching during a bull run, you can still position yourself for long-term success by focusing on the fundamentals.

Below are the Top 5 aspects shared by the most successful blue chip NFT projects:

The best NFT projects cultivate strong independent communities. While a dedicated Discord gives holders a place to gather, organize, and form identity-based microcultures - the best projects find meaning in their communities through participation-based governance and DAOs. The ability to serve as long-term stewards of the brand, community and capital have the potential to foster interest and advocacy far beyond the initial sale.

NFTs that offer tangible or digital utility consistently outperform those that don't. Whether it's deeper integration into your existing products, conversion to physical assets, or gated access to in real life (IRL) activations, online content, decentralized applications, staking incentives, games, or metaverse environments, giving your NFT holders a reason to engage creates staying power.

Don't overdo it.  While it's tempting to launch and sell multiple collections to raise cash, oversupplying the market means there's no scarcity in the secondary market, causing resale prices to plummet.  This disenfranchises the very community you're trying to preserve.

A fungible token can provide added liquidity and incentive to participate in your ecosystem. When designed properly, these tokens become spendable within your product or service suite, deepening engagement and creating additional economic activity.  Just as importantly, a successful token launch can increase the ecosystem value and provide capital for continued operations well after a bull market has gone.

Visibility matters. The best projects create demand by driving awareness to their project.  Partnering with like-minded brands, or a celebrity influencer who resonates with your audience can create legitimacy and drive demand. Partnerships like these can catalyze attention and build momentum, particularly in the early days post-launch.  Without a vibrant and growing audience, even the best projects will struggle to gain market adoption in an already crowded space.

Be realistic about your economics. Your initial mint will likely be a one-time capital event, and ongoing royalty income should be considered negligible in today's market. Plan accordingly. NFTs should not be treated as a long-term cash cow, but rather as a digital extension of your brand—tools for engagement, not just fundraising.  If you have an existing business with cash flow, you will be less dependent on the collections' revenue to operate.  If you're dependent on the success of the collection to operate - stretch your budget and maximize your capital by spending on awareness.  The community events and parties can wait.

While the broader NFT market remains in a slump, it's far from dead. Newer projects are finding success by prioritizing utility (Courtyard), generating revenue (Metawin), or leveraging established design credibility (Vibes). The next generation of NFT projects will likely succeed not by hype or collectibility, but by thoughtful integration into brand ecosystems and driving real world functional value.

NFTS x Sean Connery Talent Lab in Glasgow

EXCLUSIVE: Edinburgh International Film Festival (EIFF, August 14-20) is set to world premiere six short films made as part of the inaugural NFTS Sean Connery Talent Lab.

The six shorts are Ryan Pollock's Gowk, Josefa Celestin's Nora Can't Score, Catriona Macleod's Lady Maclean, Alex Salam's Twenty Twenty, Miranda Stern's Static and Mairead Hamilton's Checkout.

Launched in 2023, the Talent Lab gave 25 filmmakers the opportunity to create their own short film with financial support and creative guidance from BBC Film. Each team received a £25,000 production budget and the 12-month programme was led by The Inbetweeners producer Chris Young.

To ensure the course was accessible, 70% of the fees were underwritten by the Sean Connery Foundation. Further supporters of the course include The Dana and Albert Broccoli Foundation, FirstStage Studios, Blazing Griffin, DNA Films, Hartswood Films, Juniper Trust, LS Productions, the Rank Foundation, Synchronicity Films, Baillie Gifford and Progressive Broadcast Hire.

The ICO found 23andMe has failed to implement inadequate security measures following a 2023 cyberattack that exposed the personal data of over 155,000 UK residents.

The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has levied a £2.31m fine against genetic testing company 23andMe for inadequate security measures following a cyberattack in 2023. The ICO, in collaboration with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, conducted a joint investigation that revealed significant security shortcomings.

The breach, occurring between April and September 2023, involved a credential stuffing attack that exploited reused login credentials from previous data breaches. This led to unauthorised access to personal information of 155,592 UK residents, including names, birth years, locations, and genetic data. The extent of data accessed varied depending on the information stored in each user's account.

“This was a profoundly damaging breach that exposed sensitive personal information, family histories, and even health conditions of thousands of people in the UK,” said the Information Commissioner, John Edwards. “As one of those impacted told us: once this information is out there, it cannot be changed or reissued like a password or credit card number.”

Edwards went on to castigate 23andMe for failing to take basic steps to protect the personal data of its customers. “Their security systems were inadequate, the warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond,” said the commissioner. “This left people's most sensitive data vulnerable to exploitation and harm. We carried out this investigation in collaboration with our Canadian counterparts, and it highlights the power of international cooperation in holding global companies to account.”

The investigation uncovered that 23andMe did not implement additional verification steps for users seeking to access and download their raw genetic data. The company failed to adopt essential security protocols, including mandatory multi-factor authentication, secure password practices, and unique usernames. Furthermore, it lacked effective systems for monitoring, detecting, and responding to cyber threats targeting sensitive customer information.

Despite early indications of unauthorised activity in July 2023, 23andMe dismissed a claim in August 2023 that data affecting over 10 million users had been stolen, labelling it a hoax. The company had conducted isolated investigations into the unauthorised activity, but only initiated a comprehensive investigation in October 2023. This was prompted by a 23andMe employee discovering that the stolen data had been advertised for sale on Reddit. The breach was only confirmed after this discovery.

By the end of 2024, 23andMe had made sufficient security improvements to address the breaches identified in the ICO's provisional decision. These enhancements are aimed at preventing future incidents and aligning with UK data protection laws.

In a similar incident, the ICO fined Advanced Computer Software Group £3.07m in March this year for a ransomware attack in 2022 that compromised the personal data of 79,404 individuals, including NHS patients. The attack targeted Advanced's health and care subsidiary through a customer account lacking multi-factor authentication, disrupting services such as NHS 111 and hindering access to patient records.

Adam Casey, the director of cybersecurity consultancy tmc3, said that the episode highlighted important lessons for firms handling large volumes of highly sensitive personal data. “To avoid making the same mistakes, businesses must identify high-risk users and enforce strong controls like MFA,” said Casey. “They also need proactive defence through robust security controls, regular patching, vulnerability management, and comprehensive employee training. Additionally, effective monitoring and detection capabilities are essential to identify breaches early and minimise damage.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","ICO fines 23andMe £2.31m over 'profoundly damaging' data breach","https://www.computing.co.uk/news/2025/legislation-regulation/ico-fines-23andme-2-31m","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 09:46:13 GMT","












The ICO has fined 23andMe £2.31 million due to its failures in responding to a 2023 data breach.

The UK's data protection watchdog has fined DNA testing company 23andMe £2.31 million for failing to safeguard sensitive user data in a 2023 cyberattack that exposed the more than 150,000 UK residents' personal information.

While substantial, the penalty is almost half the £4.59 million fine the regulator had initially intended to level.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) concluded that 23andMe lacked adequate security protocols and failed to implement necessary safeguards, particularly for its most sensitive data.

The breach, which the regulator described as ""profoundly damaging,"" exposed names, birth years, locations, ethnicity, family trees and in some cases health reports.

While DNA data itself was not stolen, the nature of the compromised information raised alarm due to its deeply personal nature.

The attack, which unfolded between April and September 2023, was carried out via credential stuffing, a method where hackers exploit login credentials previously leaked in unrelated data breaches.

By October, attackers had infiltrated 23andMe's platform and accessed data linked to 155,592 UK users.

The ICO's investigation, conducted jointly with Canada's Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC), revealed multiple failings.

Most notably, 23andMe lacked robust login verification systems and did not enforce secure password practices or require additional verification for downloading sensitive genetic information.

Under UK data protection laws, genetic data is classified as ""special category data"", warranting enhanced security protocols due to the potential for misuse.

The ICO found that 23andMe had not adhered to these requirements and breached legal obligations by neglecting to put appropriate technical measures in place.

""23andMe failed to take basic steps to protect this information. Their security systems were inadequate, the warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond. This left people's most sensitive data vulnerable to exploitation and harm,"" UK Information Commissioner John Edwards said.

""Data protection doesn't stop at borders, and neither do we when it comes to protecting the rights of UK residents.""

In response to the joint probe, 23andMe says it had resolved the identified issues by the end of 2024, though the remedial actions came too late to avoid regulatory penalties.

Complicating the situation is 23andMe's ongoing bankruptcy.

Initially set to be acquired by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for $256 million, the company announced last week that it had instead agreed to sell its assets to the TTAM Research Institute, a non-profit biotech organisation founded by 23andMe co-founder and former CEO Anne Wojcicki.

The revised $305 million deal includes binding privacy commitments.

TTAM Research Institute has pledged to enhance data protections and preserve consumer rights, including the ability for users to delete their accounts, remove genetic data, and opt out of research programmes.

A US bankruptcy court is scheduled to hear the case on Wednesday to approve the sale.

Both UK and Canadian regulators have urged TTAM to uphold the strongest possible safeguards for customers during the transition.

Commenting on the ICO's fine of 23andMe, Max Vetter, VP of Cyber at Immersive, said: ""The truth is that the majority of breaches happen because the most simple and basic security practices are not followed. The ICO's fine is substantial; however, it is justified. When an organisation is responsible for such personal and sensitive data, the security basics cannot be ignored.""","{'href': 'https://www.computing.co.uk', 'title': 'Computing UK'}","cryptocurrency"

The Governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, announced the establishment in Shanghai of an international operations center for the digital RMB, its central bank digital currency (CBDC). He also discussed the expansion of international trade finance, with industry pundits suggesting this aims to improve financing for Chinese goods that are finished in other countries to sidestep sanctions.

A speech published by the central bank did not cover these operational details, but instead urged changes in global currencies and cross border payments. 

The governor strongly criticized the US, although semi-indirectly. He said that international dominant currencies are like public goods. When the country that controls the currency starts using the currency for its own self interest it undermines that public good feature. He warned that accumulated domestic fiscal and structural issues in that country could spill over into an international financial crisis. Additionally, the Governor complained about the weaponization of currency for geopolitical purposes.

Hence, he called for greater diversification in currency usage worldwide. That's certainly not the first time a Chinese central bank governor has pushed for that. It's also not new for a governor to suggest a greater take up of the IMF's special drawing rights (SDR) in international trade. Beyond currency, he also addressed payment systems.

The topic of blockchain and DLT in cross border payments was discussed in the context of both central bank digital currencies and stablecoins. He only alluded to mBridge, the international cross border CBDC originally developed by five Asian and Middle Eastern central banks with help from the BIS. The BIS withdrew from the project saying it had graduated, around the time of talk of sanctioned countries such as Russia or Iran participating.

The central banker said these technologies have greatly shortened the payment chain, but also pointed to the supervision risks of stablecoins. For now, with Hong Kong passing stablecoin legislation, it seems that island is being used as a learning and observation ground for mainland China.

“Technologies such as smart contracts and decentralized finance will also continue to promote the evolution and development of the cross border payment system,” he said.

The Senate passed legislation Tuesday, 68-30, that would establish regulations for stablecoins, concluding weeks of work on the bill and marking a significant step in cryptocurrency policy.

Democrats were divided on the bill, with 18 voting in favor of it but a large faction remaining steadfast in opposition due to concerns over what they called weak protections for consumers, national security and financial stability.

Supporters said the bill would bring regulatory clarity to the stablecoin market, catalyze a key advance in the payment system and strengthen the dollar's position as the global reserve currency.

Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to a reserve asset — in this case, the U.S. dollar. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., would require issuers to maintain liquid reserves of safe investments such as U.S. Treasury debt, insured deposits and overnight Treasury repurchase agreements. Depending on the nature of the issuer, the regulator could be a federal or state supervisory agency.

“Today, on a bipartisan basis, the Senate will pass its first major digital assets legislation ever, the Genius Act,” Hagerty said on the Senate floor before the vote, referring to the nickname for the bill titled the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act. “With this bill, the United States is one step closer to becoming the global leader in crypto. Today will be remembered as an inflection point for innovation in the United States of America.”

The bill is similar but not identical to a stablecoin bill the House Financial Services Committee approved on April 2.

The stablecoin legislation is one part of establishing cryptocurrency policy. The other piece is to set rules for the offering, sale and oversight of digital assets, which is known as market structure.

House Financial Services approved a market structure bill on June 10.

“Congress must pass comprehensive market structure legislation in the coming months that draws a line between a security and commodity and creates a pathway for digital asset exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,” Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo. and a co-sponsor of the stablecoin bill, said on the Senate floor.

After a weekslong effort to accumulate enough Democratic support to overcome procedural hurdles on the stablecoin bill, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he wants the measure to be the foundation for House action.

“The leader would like the House to take up the Senate-passed bill,” a Thune spokesperson wrote in an email. “He also finds it important to do market structure separately.”

Many Democrats raised concerns that the bill is a gift to the cryptocurrency industry and both ignores and facilitates President Donald Trump's crypto conflicts of interest. The Trump family has stakes in a memecoin and a stablecoin. They objected to Thune's not allowing votes on amendments.

“If the Senate passes this legislation, it would give Congress' blessing for President Trump and his family to further enrich themselves with very little protection for consumers,” Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., said in a Monday floor speech.","{'href': 'https://rollcall.com', 'title': 'Roll Call'}","cryptocurrency"

 A bipartisan bill regulating and promoting ""stablecoin"" cryptocurrencies passed in the Senate Tuesday in a 68-30 vote, giving a boost to the legitimacy of digital currencies.
The bill would set standards for companies issuing stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency. A stablecoin's value is meant to stay the same as an actual state-issued currency, usually the U.S. dollar, in contrast to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, whose value fluctuates wildly. The bill has yet to be passed by the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Donald Trump.
The bill could give a boost to stablecoins, which are meant to solve one of the problems with cryptocurrencies in general: they are rarely used to buy and sell things, due to how much their price changes from day to day. The bill could encourage the U.S. dollar stablecoin market to grow nearly eightfold to $2 trillion over the next 10 years, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Senators last week.
The bill requires companies creating stablecoins to hold actual dollars, Treasurys, or assets considered safe equal to the value of the coins they've issued, as a safeguard against cryptocurrencies collapsing and leaving customers with worthless bits of data, as happened with the infamous Terra-Luna stablecoin in 2022.


 Senators passed the bill despite concerns about corruption raised by Democrats.


 Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, noted that President Donald Trump and his family are heavily invested in cryptocurrency trading and criticized the bill for doing nothing to rein in the many potential conflicts of interest that poses.


 Trump has a stake in World Liberty Financial, a company that launched its own stablecoin, USD1. Critics of Trump have argued the coin could be a convenient way to bribe the president, among Trump's other crypto entanglements.
""If Congress passes this bill, USD1 won't just be a coercive tool to pay off a corrupt President,"" Warren said on the Senate floor last month. ""It will be a financial instrument blessed by the United States Government. And this bill provides even more opportunities to reward buyers of Trump's coins with favors like tariff exemptions, pardons, and government appointments.""
The bill prohibits members of Congress and the Executive Branch, but not the president and Vice President, from owning stablecoins.
Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, was among the 18 Democrats who joined Republicans to pass the bill. (Two Republicans voted against it.)


 “For too long, stablecoins have operated in a regulatory gray area, putting consumers, markets, and national security at risk,"" he wrote in a statement. ""The GENIUS Act changes that by creating guardrails for responsible innovation, setting high standards for issuers, and reining in potential abuses by big tech and bad actors.""

The conflict between Israel and Iran is spilling over into the digital world, inflaming a decades-long campaign of hacks and espionage between two nations renowned for their cyber prowess. 

On Tuesday, a pro-Israel hacking group claimed responsibility for a disruptive cyberattack against a major Iranian bank, and Iran's state-run IRIB News reported that Israel had launched a full-scale cyberattack on the country's critical infrastructure.

Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex has been hacked for $90 million by Israel-linked hacking activist group Gonjeshke Darande, according to a blog post from blockchain security firm Elliptic.

The group said in an X post: “After Bank Sepah, it was Nobitex's turn,” referencing their Tuesday cyberattack on Iran's state-owned lender. They warned that Nobitex's internal data and source code would be released within a day, and any assets left on the exchange would be “at risk.”

The stolen funds were traced to a wallet using a provocative vanity address: TKFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXy2r7mNX.

bypassing sanctions doesn't pay @nobitexmarket pic.twitter.com/JPo0xmTBB2

Estimates of funds stolen was later updated to over $82 million, with funds stolen across Bitcoin, Dogecoin and EVM chains from addresses including""0xffFFfFFffFFffFfFffFFfFfFfFFFFfFfFFFFDead,"" ""1FuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXaAovLX,"" and ""DFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXWLW65t.""The group called Nobitex a “core part of the regime's terror financing network,” accusing it of helping Iran evade international sanctions by enabling crypto-based payments.

Nobitex, Iran's largest exchange, confirmed the attack in an X post but did not mention or confirm stolen funds.

The hack also does not appear to be financially motivated, Elliptic said. 

The funds were sent to vanity addresses created through ""brute force"" methods - involving the creation of large numbers of cryptographic key pairs until one contains the desired text. 

""But creating vanity addresses with text strings as long as those used in this hack is computationally infeasible. This means that Predatory Sparrow would not have the private keys for the crypto addresses they sent the Nobitex funds to, and have effectively burned the funds in order to send Nobitex a political message,"" Elliptic said.

At the time of writing, it is unclear what attack method was used by Gonjeshke Darande to conduct the exploit.

The hack comes amid a flurry of cyber and physical attacks between Iran and Israel.

Gonjeshke Darande, believed by cybersecurity analysts to have ties to Israeli intelligence, has previously claimed responsibility for coordinated infrastructure attacks on Iranian steel factories and gas stations.

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest sold a combined 300,108 shares of Circle Internet Group   on Tuesday across three of its ETFs, continuing to take profit for a second day in a row, this time to the tune of $44.7 million.

The move came as CRCL closed in New York Tuesday at $149.15 as it continues to maintain investor momentum after a monster rally during its first days of trading earlier this month. 

ARK's trimming of its CRCL position coincided with a major policy milestone: the U.S. Senate's bipartisan passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate stablecoin issuers like Circle. 

The Act is considered an industry win, and was welcomed by Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who called it a ""genius"" piece of legislation in an X post.

An investor notice indicates that as ARK sold CRCL, it increased its positions in chip designer AMD, which has been described as an undervalued AI play following the release of its recent roadmap, as well as Taiwan Semiconductor, a chip manufacturing company.

A key indicator is flashing red for shiba inu (SHIB) as the recent price drop to two-month lows has shaken out leveraged bullish bets.

The indicator in consideration is the long-short ratio derived from the perpetual futures market. It measures the number of active longs or bullish bets relative to shorts, providing cues on market sentiment.

The ratio has dropped to 0.9298, indicating bearish sentiment among traders, according to CoinDesk's AI insights. This follows the forced closure or liquidation of long positions worth over $1.8 million since June 12, according to data source Coinglass. Exchanges liquidate positions due to margin shortages. The dollar value of the shorts squeezed out during this period is less than $500,000.

Over the past 24 hours, the derivatives market has exhibited growing caution, with open interest decreasing by 2.14% to $145.33 million and long liquidations surging to $244,000, compared to just $57,000 in short liquidations.

SHIB's price has dropped by 10% to $0.00001164 since June 12, according to data source CoinDesk. The minor recovery from Tuesday's two-month low of $0.00001134 is providing bullish hints on short-duration price charts.

 Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT — producing over 99% of global Bitcoin mining ASICs — are launching US-based production units in response to tariffs. 

Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT — which collectively produce most of the world's Bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs — are bringing production to the US, according to a Wednesday report by Reuters.

The shift comes in response to hefty reciprocal tariffs imposed on China by US President Donald Trump. Tariffs currently stand at 25% on products imported from China, after previously exceeding 100%.

An April study by the University of Cambridge shows that Bitmain is responsible for 82% of Bitcoin (BTC) ASIC production, MicroBT for 15%, and Canaan about 2%, giving the three companies a combined 99% share of the global market.

“The digital mining hardware market exhibits an oligopolistic structure, with the top three manufacturers — Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan — commanding over 99% market share,“ the study reads.

The companies have not answered Cointelegraph's press inquiry by press time.

Related: Trump tariffs squeeze already struggling Bitcoin miners — Braiins exec

With Bitcoin being a global network, this is not the first time geopolitics has played a role in mining the world's first cryptocurrency. Hashlabs Mining CEO Jaran Mellerud stated in early April that the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs could lead to a collapse in US demand for Bitcoin mining rigs.

According to Mellerud, the tariffs would benefit mining operations outside the US, as manufacturers would look to sell their surplus inventory abroad at a lower cost. Still, with a booming US Bitcoin industry, these companies have opted to enter the country as a way to mitigate the economic impact of the tariffs.

It remains to be seen whether US-based production will be able to produce Bitcoin mining ASICs at a price comparable to those made in China.

The world's top Bitcoin mining ASIC producer, Bitmain, may also be looking to prevent further issues with US customs. Back in late November 2024, the US Customs and Border Protection Agency halted the delivery of thousands of Bitmain ASICs.

This followed an October investigation by US authorities into Chinese chip designer Xiamen Sophgo over an alleged business relationship with US-sanctioned company Huawei. The firm supports Bitmain's ASIC manufacturing business, which is what led to actions being taken against the mining giant.

Only in early March was the mining hardware released after about 10,000 ASICs had been seized.

 3iQ's new XRP ETF, backed by Ripple, begins trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange with zero management fees for the first six months. 

Canadian asset manager 3iQ launched a new XRP-focused ETF for North American users. The 3iQ XRP ETF (XRPQ) began trading today on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), offering investors direct exposure to the fourth-largest digital asset by market cap.

Ripple, the blockchain company behind the XRP Ledger and the XRP (XRP) cryptocurrency, is an early investor in the fund, 3iQ said in a Wednesday announcement. To mark the occasion, the 3iQ team will ring the TSX's closing bell this afternoon.

The ETF debuts with a six-month 0% management fee. It invests exclusively in long-term XRP positions acquired from reputable exchanges and OTC platforms, with all holdings kept in cold storage, per the announcement.

“The launch of XRPQ marks another milestone in our mission to provide investors with convenient, cost-effective access to digital assets within a regulated framework,” said Pascal St-Jean, president and CEO of 3iQ.

XRPQ is available to Canadian investors through registered accounts and is accessible to qualified international investors, depending on local rules.

“XRP has demonstrated significant growth potential over the past decade, and this groundbreaking strategy offers Canadian and qualified global investors a transparent, low-cost and tax-efficient way to securely access that opportunity,” St-Jean added.

The launch comes as institutional appetite for crypto exposure continues to grow, particularly in products with regulatory clarity and secure custody structures.

Earlier this year, 3iQ launched the Solana Staking ETF. According to the company, the fund is now the largest Solana (SOL) ETF, with over $120 million in assets under management. 3iQ was also the first to launch Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) funds in the North American country.

3iQ's latest ETF arrives alongside another XRP-focused launch from Purpose Investments, which also began trading its spot XRP ETF this week.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a public comment period for two proposed ETFs from Franklin Templeton, including the Franklin XRP ETF and the Franklin Solana ETF, both aiming to list on the Cboe BZX Exchange.

Although Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have already been approved, firms are now competing to launch the first spot ETFs for other major tokens, including XRP and Solana.

 The crypto market dropped after US President Donald Trump said he knows where Iran's leader is hiding and that he is an “easy target.” 

Bitcoin and the broader crypto market tumbled after US President Donald Trump sparked macroeconomic uncertainty with his remarks threatening Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social on Tuesday.

“We don't want missiles shot at civilians or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump added. He also called for Iran's “unconditional surrender.”

It comes amid the ongoing geopolitical tension between Iran and Israel, which was reignited after Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes on Iran on Thursday night. Iran has since retaliated with a series of drone and missile strikes against Israel.

After Trump's post was published, Bitcoin (BTC) dipped from $104,310 to $103,553 within the hour before recovering to $105,450 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Ether (ETH) fell 1.3% to $2,462, while XRP (XRP) dipped 1.3% to $2.14 over the same period.

Crypto market sentiment also took a downturn. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures overall crypto market sentiment, fell 16 points from “Greed” to “Neutral” for the first time in 11 days, scoring 52 out of 100.

This isn't the first time Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have reacted to Trump's remarks. 

It has been the case since Trump returned to the White House at the beginning of this year. 

On Feb. 2, just days after his inauguration, Bitcoin fell below $100,000 for the first time in six days after he signed an executive order imposing import tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Yet, it was his election win in November 2024 that many believe triggered a major rally, with Bitcoin hitting $100,000 for the first time ever just a month later, on Dec. 5.

Some analysts believe that the ongoing tensions will soon cause Bitcoin to retest the psychological $100,000 price level.

Crypto analyst Doctor Profit said, “Bitcoin will drop below $100,000 in the coming days.”

He said he expected it to go as low as $93,000 and that the stock market would follow.

“SP500 will follow with a 7-10% drop as well. More red candles ahead of us,” he added.

Other traders see Bitcoin's sustained position above $100,000 in recent times as laying the groundwork for a stronger upward trend.

Crypto trader Jelle said, “Once again, much more sustainable than a rapid climb without any structure being built.”

On Tuesday, Bitfinex analysts said that “Bitcoin is still at risk of falling further, and it must hold above $102,000 to stay on track for a potential rebound.”

 BBVA is advising affluent clients to allocate up to 7% of their portfolios to crypto just months after it received permission to offer crypto trading. 

Spain's second-largest bank, BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria), has advised its affluent clients to allocate some of their investment portfolio to invest in crypto.

BBVA told its wealthy clients to invest between 3% to 7% of their portfolio into crypto and Bitcoin (BTC), depending on their desired risk exposure, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing a company executive.

“With private customers, since September last year, we started advising on Bitcoin,” Philippe Meyer, head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland, said at a conference in London. He added that the portfolio allocation has now been increased for riskier profiles.

Meyer said clients had been receptive to the bank's advice and dismissed concerns that the asset was too risky. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, if you introduce 3%, you already boost the performance. At 3%, you are not taking a huge risk,” he said. 

BBVA's move comes amid continued warnings from European Union regulators and the bloc's central bank on crypto risks, and while 95% of EU banks are avoiding crypto activities according to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

BBVA has been executing crypto trades since 2021 and moved to active advisory in late 2024, positioning itself ahead of most traditional banks.

In March, Spain's securities regulator allowed the bank to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) trading in the country.

BBVA's crypto offerings were launched in a phased rollout to select clients first, and will enable users to buy, sell, and manage digital assets through its mobile app in the coming months.

BBVA's expansion into crypto came as the European Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) reached full implementation at the end of 2024.

EU crypto companies have until July 2026 to fully comply with its stringent requirements under an 18-month transitional phase.

Other banks that are offering select crypto trading include Santander, which is mulling the issuance of its own stablecoin and expanding retail crypto services. 

The bank is considering offering both dollar and euro-pegged stablecoins, according to a May report.

Exercise Isn't Just for Your Muscles—It's Great for Your Gut, Too

We've all heard the saying “you are what you eat”—especially when it comes to gut health. But what if your workout matters just as much as your diet?

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

Over the last couple of decades, few science topics have made a bigger mainstream splash than the microbiome. Our growing understanding of the microbes that live on us, in us and around us has scientists analyzing—and trying to tweak—colonies from our armpits to our genitals. But when most of us hear the word “microbiome” our minds go first to the diverse ecosystems found within our guts.

The communities of bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi that live in our digestive tracts have a huge impact on us. Research shows that our gut microbiomes influence how well we digest our food and absorb nutrients, and an imbalance in the microorganisms of the gut is associated with conditions such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic liver disease. Some research even suggests that our gut microbiomes are tied to cognitive function and mental well-being: scientists are exploring how autism spectrum disorder, depression, anxiety, PTSD and more could be connected to the tiny creatures that live inside us.

But this relationship isn't one-sided: we also have a lot of power over our gut microbiomes—and that extends beyond our food choices.

Our guest today is Lydia Denworth, a contributing editor for Scientific American. She writes SciAm's Science of Health column. In the magazine's June 2025 issue she reported on the surprising link between gut microbes and exercise. She's here today to tell us more.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today.

Lydia Denworth: It's good to be here.

Feltman: So you recently wrote in your column about the microbiome, which, of course, our listeners have heard a lot about, but I think people tend to think about their microbiome and think about yogurts and probiotics. But you wrote about the connection to exercise. How did you first come across that connection?

Denworth: I was at a science journalist conference, and I heard Marc Cook talk—he's one of the people I interviewed for that column—and he's a researcher at North Carolina [Agricultural and Technical] State University, and he studies exercise in the microbiome, and it was exactly what you just said that got him interested.

I mean, everybody thinks about diet, probiotics, things like that. And back about 15 years ago he was at the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] getting his Ph.D., and the idea that there might be a link between exercise and microbes in your gut was really just not a thing that anybody was thinking about. But he did know that people with inflammatory bowel disease, specifically ulcerative colitis, benefited from exercise. So he thought, “Well, let me investigate, maybe, what that's about.”

So he stuck mice on wheels—you know, mice like to run on wheels—and he found that the mice that voluntarily exercised were protected against a mouse version of colitis and the ones that did not run were not. And so it kinda started there, with this idea that, “Oh, there's more to look at.”

Feltman: So now, you know, more than a decade later, what do we know about the connection between exercise and the gut microbiome?

Denworth: We know a couple of things. So one thing is: in people who are regular exercisers or who are elite athletes the diversity and abundance of microbes in your gut is greater, but more important than that is this question of, “What do the microbes actually do?” And that's where the researchers have really kind of gone down the rabbit hole and said, “Well, why would it be that exercise is improving your fitness?”

And what they found is that exercise boosts the production of microbes that produce something called short-chain fatty acids. And that's a simple molecule, but it's something that helps with your gut health. It helps reduce inflammation. It is part of your healthy metabolism. So the metabolism makes energy, right, and when you exercise and then you boost these short-chain fatty acids, especially one called butyrate, it improves all these processes that your body needs to do to stay healthy.

Feltman: Can you tell us a little bit more about what the functional differences in the microbiomes of people who are getting this boost from exercise versus not? You know, what does that diversity of microbes do for us?

Denworth: There's a lot we don't know yet about exactly what it is that the microbes are doing versus the other benefits of exercise, so there are open questions there. But having this healthy, active microbiome that they see in athletes and from exercise seems to increase your capacity for exercise. It probably works in both directions—it's bidirectional.

So the research on the other side of it is really only in mice so far. But they do find that if, for instance, you give mice antibiotics that kill off the bacteria in their guts, they are less likely to exercise and they reach exhaustion faster. They also find that a healthy microbiome seems to contribute to muscle development—and then vice versa, right: you don't develop as many muscles as effectively if you don't have a healthy microbiome.

And so all of that is in the beginning stages of research, but it—it's intriguing, right?

Feltman: Yeah, and do the researchers behind this have any specific recommendations for what kind of exercise or how much is gonna, you know, help your microbiome out?

Denworth: So far the research doesn't really change what the standard recommendations are, which is that we engage in about 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week or 75 minutes of intense exercise a week. The research does suggest that it's aerobic exercise more than strength training that is having this effect—although it's such early days and there have been so few studies of other kinds of exercise other than aerobic that I think we don't know for sure that it's not happening with other forms of exercise, but aerobic exercise is where it's at. The recommendations are the same; it's just more reason to get out there and gut out your workout [laughs].

Feltman: [Laughs] Absolutely. And remind us what's the general advice for supporting a good, diverse, healthy gut microbiome?

Denworth: Well, diet is the number one thing that affects your microbiome—more powerfully than exercise, I should say that—and fiber in particular is really important for having a good, healthy gut. But then exercise—probably combining a healthy diet that includes a lot of fiber and doing some good aerobic exercise is going to be the best combination that's gonna give you the healthiest gut.

Feltman: Great, so just more motivation to do the things that we already know are good for us [laughs].

Denworth: [Laughs] That's exactly it.

Feltman: Well, thank you so much for joining us today. This has been great.

Denworth: Thanks for having me.

Mysterious Link between Earth's Magnetism and Oxygen Baffles Scientists

The strength of Earth's magnetic field and the amount of oxygen in its atmosphere seem to be correlated—and scientists want to know why

The strength of Earth's magnetic field seems to rise and fall hand-in-hand with the abundance of oxygen in its atmosphere, a study of geological records spanning the last half billion years has found.

Explaining the link could help to reveal fundamental trends in the evolution of life on Earth — and could show astronomers the most promising places to look for signs of complex life on other planets. But it is so far unclear whether Earth's magnetism plays direct a role in keeping oxygen levels high — and sustaining animal life — or whether both are influenced by a third, unidentified mechanism.

Nature; Source: “Strong Link between Earth's Oxygen Level and Geomagnetic Dipole Revealed since the Last 540 Million Years,” by Weija Kuang et al., in Science Advances, Vol. 11, No. 24; June 13, 2025

“We don't really have a good explanation for it,” says Benjamin Mills, a biogeochemist at the University of Leeds, UK, and co-author of the study, published in Science Advances on 13 June. But the study suggests “some potential causes that are exciting and potentially testable”, says Aubrey Zerkle, a biogeochemist at the University of St Andrews, UK.

Knowing how Earth's deep interior could influence the evolution of the atmosphere is “critical to understanding what makes our planet habitable”, says Richard Bono, a geophysicist at Florida State University in Tallahassee who has helped to compile long-term records of geomagnetism.

Oxygen is the main component of Earth's crust and mantle. But molecular oxygen only began to slowly accumulate in the atmosphere after organisms that produce oxygen through photosynthesis began to evolve, around 2.5 billion years ago. And only in the current aeon, covering the last 540 million years or so, has it reached concentrations that are breathable by most animals.

There is no direct way to measure the composition of the atmosphere in the deep past, but geochemists can use indirect clues to reconstruct oxygen levels starting in the Cambrian period, which began around 540 million years ago. For example, oxygen concentration “has a strong relationship with how easy it is to start and maintain wildfires,” says Mills, and the frequency of large wildfires can be worked out by looking at ancient charcoal deposits, among other factors.

Geophysicists can also reconstruct how the strength and direction of the geomagnetic field has varied across even longer stretches of Earth's history, by studying rocks produced by ancient volcanic eruptions. That's because magnetic crystals that form in the solidifying lava align themselves with the field, acting like tiny compasses frozen in time.

To put these two long records side-by-side and compare them, Mills teamed up with geophysicists Weijia Kuang and Ravi Kopparapu, both at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, and with exobiologist Joshua Krissansen-Totton at the University of Washington in Seattle. The authors found a strong correlation — both oxygen levels and geomagnetic intensity have increased over the past million years, and some of the major spikes or drops in both measures occur in the same geological eras (see ‘Long-term trends').

The paper discusses some possible reasons for the correlation. Earth's magnetic field is known to have a protective effect on the upper atmosphere because it deflects solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the Sun that would otherwise cause oxygen and other gases to slowly escape into space. But the team calculated that the loss of oxygen caused by a drastic weakening of the field would still be small compared to the amounts generated by photosynthesis — or to those consumed by other organisms and by geological cycles in which elements are exchanged between the atmosphere, crust and the mantle.

“We don't necessarily think that the magnetic field impacts cycling directly, but it may be a result of the same processes,” says Mills. Over hundreds of millions of years, tectonic motions have repeatedly formed supercontinents, and have subsequently broken them up — releasing vast amounts of nutrients that in turn spurred massive blooms of oxygen-producing algae in Earth's oceans. Tectonics are driven by the slow churn of Earth's mantle, the region between crust and core. This churning could also have impacted the liquid outer core, where the geomagnetic field is produced, says Kuang.

“If things like the spreading rate [of the oceanic crust] influence the magnetic field, the tectonic cycle could be driving oxygenation — but also the magnetic field,” Mills says.

Sanja Panovska, a geophysicist at the Helmholtz Centre for Geoscience in Potsdam, Germany, says that the study is convincing, but it introduces more questions than it answers. “The authors mention a lot of hypotheses, but they are not put to the test in this paper.”

Nevertheless, the discovery could feed into a long-standing debate on whether a strong magnetic field is essential for complex life to evolve on a planet. “It's very expensive to observe exoplanets, and you need to choose which ones to observe,” says Mills. “What this kind of work would inform is the kind of places you'd look.”

How to Grill Meat Safely—According to Science

Food microbiologists explain how to ensure different proteins, such as beef, chicken and pork, are prepared safely

By Amanda Heidt edited by Lauren J. Young

Juicy skewers of marinated meat are grilling alongside a large, raw ribeye steak on a charcoal barbecue. Every type of meat has its own required cooking temperature.

As the days heat up in the Northern Hemisphere, so do meats at summer barbecues. But the amount of heat you use to cook different meats matters—not only for taste but for health.

Each type of protein—beef, pork, poultry and others—has to reach a recommended minimum temperature to be considered safe to eat. A chicken breast, for example, needs to be heated to at least 73.9 degrees Celsius (165 degrees Fahrenheit) throughout, while a steak or pork chop should reach 62.8 degrees C (145 degrees F). Where do these recommendations come from? And why must some meats be cooked to a higher temperature than others?

Temperature thresholds exist because raw foods, including meat, eggs, and even vegetables and other kinds of produce, can sometimes harbor illness-causing microbes, says University of Delaware food microbiologist Kalmia Kniel. Just as the human body houses billions of microorganisms, Kniel notes, animals also “have a naturally occurring community of bacteria that colonizes their gut and skin.” Most of those microbes are harmless to the animals and people, she says, but some bacteria strains can make people sick. Microbes that an animal picks up from its environment or that are introduced during meat processing can also pose health risks, Kniel says.

Food poisoning can be caused by viruses or parasites, but the most common culprits are bacteria such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Listeria and Clostridium—often found on or inside animals. These microbes flourish at temperatures between 4.4 and 60 degrees C (40 to 140 degrees F), often doubling in number in as little as 20 minutes. People who eat foods contaminated with these bacteria often experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps and fever. Most people recover within a few days, but in rare cases, food poisoning can be fatal.

Cooking meat is one way to kill those harmful microbes. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, scientists across multiple U.S. agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, turned laboratories into test kitchens to figure out the meat temperature guidelines we use today, says Donald Schaffner, a food microbiologist at Rutgers University. Researchers inoculated various foods, from roast beef and chicken thighs to eggs and leftover casseroles, with bacteria and then prepared the dishes with different culinary methods—say, grilling versus microwaving or roasting. The final guidelines were based on the time it took for a specific temperature to reduce the bacteria by 90 percent, or to a threshold scientifically considered safe.

Recommendations differ based on factors such as the cut of a given type of meat. Steak or pork, for instance, have dense muscle fibers that are relatively difficult for bacteria to penetrate—and searing the meat kills most microbes lingering on the surface. Ground meat, by contrast, is typically made up of lower-quality cuts from multiple animals, and grinding the meat into bits disperses those surface-dwelling bacteria throughout products such as a burger patty or sausage link. This requires an internal temperature that's a few degrees higher: 71.1 degrees C (160 degrees F). Poultry also needs to be cooked to a higher temperature (165 degrees F) because it is more likely to be contaminated internally, particularly with illness-causing Salmonella strains that are part of the animals' natural microbiome.

Temperature guidance has mostly remained the same over the years, Schaffner says, only changing once: in 2011 the USDA lowered the temperature recommendation for pork from 71.1 degrees C (160 degrees F) to 62.8 degrees C (145 degrees F), following the farming industry's successful campaign to reduce the prevalence of the nematode Trichinella spiralis in pigs. People who ingest the parasite's larvae through undercooked meat can contract trichinosis, also called trichinellosis, a gastrointestinal disease that causes muscle pain as the larvae migrate into muscle tissue.

Beyond safely cooking meats, there are other steps people can take to keep harmful bacteria out of their meals. Using separate cutting boards and utensils for raw and cooked meat, along with washing hands between cooking tasks, minimizes cross-contamination. Avoid leaving foods out in ambient temperatures for long periods to prevent bacteria from proliferating. Kniel also says the spongy absorber (called the “meat diaper”) at the bottom of most meat packages is a major source of bacteria; always use a separate container and throw the meat diaper away with minimal contact.

Kniel and Schaffner agree that using a good meat thermometer is among the best ways to prepare food safely. Specifically, look for digital thermometers that measure the temperature at the tip of the probe rather than dial thermometers, which typically average the temperature across the length of the probe. “You really want to know if the inside of your meat is fully cooked, and so knowing the temperature in the thickest part is most important,” Kniel says. “Someone may not want to add the extra step to use [a digital thermometer], but it's the easiest way to make sure your product is cooked well.”

Researchers at Paul Scherrer Institute PSI have demonstrated an innovative method to control magnetism in materials using an energy-efficient electric field. The discovery focuses on materials known as magnetoelectrics, which offer promise for next-generation energy technologies, data storage, energy conversion, and medical devices. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.

With AI and data centers demanding more and more energy, scientists are searching for smarter, greener technologies. That's where magnetoelectric materials come in -- special compounds where electric and magnetic properties are linked. This connection lets researchers control magnetism using electric fields, which could pave the way for super-energy-efficient memory and computing devices.

One such magnetoelectric material is the olive-green crystalcopper oxyselenide(Cu2OSeO₃). At low temperatures, the atomic spins arrange themselves into exotic magnetic textures, forming structures such as helices and cones. These patterns are much larger than the underlying atomic lattice and not fixed to its geometry, making them highly tuneable.

Neutrons watch as electric fields redirect magnetism

Now, scientists at PSI have demonstrated that an electric field can steer these magnetic textures inside copper oxyselenide. In typical materials, magnetic structures - formed from the twisting and alignment of atomic spins -- are locked in specific orientations. In copper oxyselenide with the right voltage, the researchers could nudge and reorient them.

This is the first time that the propagation direction of a magnetic texture could be continuously reorientated in a material using an electric field - an effect known as magnetoelectric deflection.

To investigate the magnetic structures, the team used the SANS-I beamline at the Swiss Spallation Neutron Source SINQ, a facility that uses beams of neutrons to map the arrangement and orientation of magnetic structures within a solid at the nanoscale. A custom-designed sample environment enabled the researchers to apply a high electric field whilst simultaneously probing the magnetisation inside the crystal with small-angle neutron scattering (SANS).

""The ability to steer such large magnetic textures with electric fields shows what's possible when creative experiments are paired with world-class research infrastructures,"" says Jonathan White, beamline scientist at PSI. ""The reason we can capture such a subtle effect as magnetoelectric deflection is due to the exceptional resolution and versatility of SANS-I.""

From novelphysics to new tech

The newly discovered magnetoelectric deflection response prompted a deeper investigation into its underlying physics. What they found was intriguing: the magnetic structures didn't just respond -- they behaved in three distinct ways depending on the strength of the electric field. Low electric fields gently deflected the magnetic structures with a linear response. Medium fields brought in more complex, non-linear behaviour. High fields caused dramatic 90-degree flips in the direction of propagation of the magnetic texture.

""Each of these regimes present unique signatures that could be integrated into sensing and storage devices,"" says Sam Moody, postdoctoral researcher at PSI and lead author of the study. ""One particularly exciting possibility is hybrid devices that use the ability to tune the onset of these regimes by varying the strength of the applied magnetic field.""

The magnetoelectric deflection response offers a powerful new tool to control magnetism without relying on energy-intensive magnetic fields. The high level of flexibility with which the researchers could manipulate the magnetism makes their discovery an exciting prospect for applications in sustainable technology.

Astronomers from the University of Hawaiʻi's Institute for Astronomy (IfA) have discovered the most energetic cosmic explosions yet discovered, naming the new class of events “extreme nuclear transients” (ENTs). These extraordinary phenomena occur when massive stars—at least three times heavier than our Sun—are torn apart after wandering too close to a supermassive black hole. Their disruption releases vast amounts of energy visible across enormous distances. The team's findings were recently detailed in the journal Science Advances.

""We've observed stars getting ripped apart as tidal disruption events for over a decade, but these ENTs are different beasts, reaching brightnesses nearly ten times more than what we typically see,"" said Jason Hinkle, who led the study as the final piece of his doctoral research at IfA. “Not only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions.”

The immense luminosities and energies of these ENTs are truly unprecedented. The most energetic ENT studied, named Gaia18cdj, emitted an astonishing 25 times more energy than the most energetic supernovae known. While typical supernovae emit as much energy in just one year as the Sun does in its 10 billion-year lifetime, ENTs radiate the energy of 100 Suns over a single year.

ENTs were first uncovered when Hinkle began a systematic search of public transient surveys for long-lived flares emanating from the centers of galaxies. He identified two unusual flares in data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission that brightened over a timescale much longer than known transients and without characteristics common to known transients.

""Gaia doesn't tell you what a transient is, just that something changed in brightness,"" said Hinkle. ""But when I saw these smooth, long-lived flares from the centers of distant galaxies, I knew we were looking at something unusual.""

The discovery launched a multi-year follow-up campaign to figure out what these sources were. With help from UH's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, the W. M. Keck Observatory, and other telescopes across the globe, the team gathered data across the electromagnetic spectrum. Because ENTs evolve slowly over several years, capturing their full story took patience and persistence. Recently, a third event with similar properties was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility and reported independently by two teams, adding strong support that ENTs are a distinct new class of extreme astrophysical events.

The authors determined these extraordinary events could not be supernovae because they release far more energy than any known stellar explosion. The sheer energy budget, combined with their smooth and prolonged light curves, firmly pointed to an alternative mechanism: accretion onto a supermassive black hole.

However, ENTs differ significantly from normal black hole accretion which typically shows irregular and unpredictable changes in brightness. The smooth and long-lived flares of ENTs indicated a distinct physical process—the gradual accretion of a disrupted star by a supermassive black hole.

Benjamin Shappee, Associate Professor at IfA and study co-author, emphasized the implications: ""ENTs provide a valuable new tool for studying massive black holes in distant galaxies. Because they're so bright, we can see them across vast cosmic distances—and in astronomy, looking far away means looking back in time. By observing these prolonged flares, we gain insights into black hole growth when the universe was half its current age when galaxies were happening places—forming stars and feeding their supermassive black holes 10 times more vigorously than they do today.""

The rarity of ENTs, occurring at least 10 million times less frequently than supernovae, makes their detection challenging and dependent on sustained monitoring of the cosmos. Future observatories like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and NASA's Roman Space Telescope promise to uncover many more of these spectacular events, revolutionizing our understanding of black hole activity in the distant, early universe.

""These ENTs don't just mark the dramatic end of a massive star's life. They illuminate the processes responsible for growing the largest black holes in the universe,"" concluded Hinkle.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","These beetles can see a color most insects can't","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250617014210.htm","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 11:25:27 GMT","

Insect eyes are generally sensitive to ultraviolet, blue and green light. With the exception of some butterflies, they cannot see the color red. Nevertheless, bees and other insects are also attracted to red flowers such as poppies. In this case, however, they are not attracted by the red color, but because they recognize the UV light reflected by the poppy flower.

However, two beetle species from the eastern Mediterranean region can indeed perceive the color red, as an international research team was able to show. The beetles are Pygopleurus chrysonotus and Pygopleurus syriacus from the family Glaphyridae. They feed mainly on pollen and prefer to visit plants with red flowers, such as poppies, anemones and buttercups.

Beetles Have Photoreceptors for long-wave Light

'To our knowledge, we are the first to have experimentally demonstrated that beetles can actually perceive the color red,' says Dr Johannes Spaethe from the Chair of Zoology II at the Biocentre of Julius-Maximilians-Universität (JMU) Würzburg in Bavaria, Germany. He gained the new insights together with Dr Elena Bencúrová from the Würzburg Bioinformatics Chair and researchers from the Universities of Ljubljana (Slovenia) and Groningen (Netherlands). The study has been published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.

The scientists used electrophysiology, behavioral experiments and color trapping. Among other things, they found that the two Mediterranean beetles possess four types of photoreceptors in their retinas that respond to UV light as well as blue, green and deep red light. Field experiments also showed that the animals use true color vision to identify red targets and that they have a clear preference for red colors.

New Model System for Ecological and Evolutionary Questions

The researchers consider the Glaphyrid family to be a promising new model system for investigating the visual ecology of beetles and the evolution of flower signals and flower detection by pollinators.

'The prevailing opinion in science is that flower colors have adapted to the visual systems of pollinators over the course of evolution,' says Johannes Spaethe. However, based on the new findings, it is now possible to speculate whether this evolutionary scenario also applies to Glaphyrid beetles and the flowers they visit.

Why do the researchers think this? The three genera of this beetle family (Eulasia, Glaphyrus and Pygopleurus) show considerable differences in their preferences for flower colors, which vary between red, violet, white and yellow. This suggests that the physiological and/or behavioral basis for seeing red and other colors is relatively labile.

The great variety of flower colors in the Mediterranean region and the considerable variation in the color preferences of the beetles made it plausible that the visual systems of these pollinators may adapt to flower colors than is commonly assumed.

A giant, strong-jawed salamander once tunneled through ancient Tennessee soil.

And thanks to a fossil unearthed near East Tennessee State University, scientists now better understand how it helped shape Appalachian amphibian diversity.

The giant plethodontid salamander now joins the remarkable roster of fossils from the Gray Fossil Site & Museum.

The findings appeared in the journal Historical Biology, authored by a team of researchers from the Gray Fossil Site & Museum and ETSU: Assistant Collections Manager Davis Gunnin, Director and Professor of Geosciences Dr. Blaine Schubert, Head Curator and Associate Professor of Geosciences Dr. Joshua Samuels, Museum Specialist Keila Bredehoeft and Assistant Collections Manager Shay Maden.

""Our researchers are not only uncovering ancient life, they are modeling the kind of collaboration and curiosity that define ETSU,"" said Dr. Joe Bidwell, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. ""This exciting find underscores the vital role our university plays in preserving and exploring Appalachia's deep natural history.""

Today, Southern Appalachian forests are renowned for their diversity and abundance of salamander species, especially lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae. Tennessee alone is home to more than 50 different salamanders - one in eight of all living salamander species.

Dusky salamanders, common in Appalachian Mountain streams, likely evolved from burrowing ancestors, relatives of Alabama's Red Hills salamander, a large, underground-dwelling species with a worm-like body and small limbs. Their explosive diversification began around 12 million years ago, shaping much of the region's salamander diversity today.

Dynamognathus robertsoni, the powerful, long-extinct salamander recently discovered at the site, had a bite to match its name. Roughly 16 inches long, it ranked among the largest salamanders ever to crawl across the region's ancient forests.

""Finding something that looks like a Red Hills salamander here in East Tennessee was a bit of a surprise,"" Gunnin said. ""Today they're only found in a few counties in southern Alabama, and researchers thought of them as a highly specialized dead-end lineage not particularly relevant to the evolution of the dusky salamanders. Discovery of Dynamognathus robertsoni here in Southern Appalachia shows that these types of relatively large, burrowing salamanders were once more widespread in eastern North America and may have had a profound impact on the evolution of Appalachian salamander communities.""

Dynamognathus robertsoni is ""the largest plethodontid salamander and one of the largest terrestrial salamanders in the world,"" Gunnin said. Dusky salamanders in the Appalachians today reach only seven inches long at their largest.

Researchers believe predators like this one may have driven the rapid evolution of Appalachian stream-dwelling salamanders, highlighting the region's key role in salamander diversification.

""The warmer climate in Tennessee 5 million years ago, followed by cooling during the Pleistocene Ice Ages, may have restricted large, burrowing salamanders to lower latitudes, like southern Alabama, where the Red Hills salamander lives today,"" said Samuels.

Maden explained the naming of this new salamander.

""This group of salamanders has unusual cranial anatomy that gives them a strong bite force, so the genus name - Dynamognathus - Greek for 'powerful jaw,' is given to highlight the great size and power of the salamander compared to its living relatives,"" said Maden.

The species name robertsoni honors longtime Gray Fossil Site volunteer Wayne Robertson, who discovered the first specimen of the new salamander and has personally sifted through more than 50 tons of fossil-bearing sediment since 2000.

From volunteers and students to staff to faculty, the ETSU Gray Fossil Site & Museum is represented by a dynamic team of lifelong learners and is one of the many reasons ETSU is the flagship institution of Appalachia.

""The latest salamander publication is a testament to this teamwork and search for answers,"" said Schubert. ""When Davis Gunnin, the lead author, began volunteering at the museum as a teenager with an interest in fossil salamanders, I was thrilled, because this region is known for its salamander diversity today, and we know so little about their fossil record. Thus, the possibility of finding something exciting seemed imminent.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","From shortage to supremacy: How Sandia and the CHIPS Act aim to reboot US chip power","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250618033727.htm","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 08:22:25 GMT","

Sandia National Laboratories has joined a new partnership aimed at helping the United States regain its leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.

While the U.S. was considered a powerhouse in chip production in the 1990s, fabricating more than 35% of the world's semiconductors, that share has since dropped to 12%. Today, the U.S. manufactures none of the world's most advanced chips which power technologies like smartphones, owned by 71% of the world's population, as well as self-driving cars, quantum computers, and artificial intelligence-powered devices and programs.

Sandia hopes to help change that. It recently became the first national lab to join the U.S. National Semiconductor Technology Center. The NSTC was established under the CHIPS and Science Act to accelerate innovation and address some of the country's most pressing technology challenges.

""We have pioneered the way for other labs to join,"" said Mary Monson, Sandia's senior manager of Technology Partnerships and Business Development. ""The CHIPS Act has brought the band back together, you could say. By including the national labs, U.S. companies, and academia, it's really a force multiplier.""

Sandia has a long history of contributing to the semiconductor industry through research and development partnerships, its Microsystems Engineering, Science and Applications facility known as MESA, and its advanced cleanrooms for developing next-generation technologies. Through its NSTC partnerships, Sandia hopes to strengthen U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and research and development, enhance national security production, and foster the innovation of new technologies that sets the nation apart globally.

""The big goal is to strengthen capabilities. Industry is moving fast, so we are keeping abreast of everything happening and incorporating what will help us deliver more efficiently on our national security mission. It's about looking at innovative ways of partnering and expediting the process,"" Monson said.

The urgency of the effort is evident. The pandemic provided a perfect example, as car lots were left bare and manufacturers sat idle, waiting for chips to be produced to build new vehicles.

""An average car contains 1,400 chips and electric vehicles use more than 3,000,"" said Rick McCormick, Sandia's senior scientist for semiconductor technology strategy. McCormick is helping lead Sandia's new role. ""Other nations around the globe are investing more than $300 billion to be leaders in semiconductor manufacturing. The U.S. CHIPS Act is our way of 'keeping up with the Joneses.' One goal is for the U.S. to have more than 25% of the global capacity for state-of-the-art chips by 2032.""

Sandia is positioned to play a key role in creating the chips of the future.

""More than $12 billion in research and development spending is planned under CHIPS, including a $3 billion program to create an ecosystem for packaging assemblies of chiplets,"" McCormick said. ""These chiplets communicate at low energy and high speed as if they were a large expensive chip.""

Modern commercial AI processors use this approach, and Sandia's resources and partnerships can help expand access to small companies and national security applications. MESA already fabricates high-reliability chiplet assembly products for the stockpile and nonproliferation applications.

McCormick said Sandia could also play a major role in training the workforce of the future. The government has invested billions of dollars in new factories, all of which need to be staffed by STEM students.

""There is a potential crisis looming,"" McCormick said. ""The Semiconductor Industry Association anticipates that the U.S. will need 60,000 to 70,000 more workers, so we need to help engage the STEM workforce. That effort will also help Sandia bolster its staffing pipeline.""

As part of its membership, Sandia will offer access to some of its facilities to other NSTC members, fostering collaboration and partnerships. Tech transfer is a core part of Sandia's missions, and this initiative will build on that by helping private partners increase their stake in the industry while enabling Sandia to build on its own mission.

""We will be helping develop suppliers and strengthen our capabilities,"" Monson said. ""We are a government resource for semiconductor knowledge. We are in this evolving landscape and have a front row seat to what it will look like over the next 20 years. We are helping support technology and strengthening our national security capabilities and mission delivery.""

Once in a while, scientific research resembles detective work. Researchers head into the field with a hypothesis and high hopes of finding specific results, but sometimes, there's a twist in the story that requires a deeper dive into the data.

That was the case for the University of Colorado Boulder researchers who led a field campaign in an agricultural region of Oklahoma. Using a high-tech instrument to measure how aerosol particles form and grow in the atmosphere, they stumbled upon something unexpected: the first-ever airborne measurements of Medium Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (MCCPs), a kind of toxic organic pollutant, in the Western Hemisphere. Their results published today in ACS Environmental Au.

""It's very exciting as a scientist to find something unexpected like this that we weren't looking for,"" said Daniel Katz, CU Boulder chemistry PhD student and lead author of the study. ""We're starting to learn more about this toxic, organic pollutant that we know is out there, and which we need to understand better.""

MCCPs are currently under consideration for regulation by the Stockholm Convention, a global treaty to protect human health from long-standing and widespread chemicals. While the toxic pollutants have been measured in Antarctica and Asia, researchers haven't been sure how to document them in the Western Hemisphere's atmosphere until now.

MCCPs are used in fluids for metal working and in the construction of PVC and textiles. They are often found in wastewater and as a result, can end up in biosolid fertilizer, also called sewage sludge, which is created when liquid is removed from wastewater in a treatment plant. In Oklahoma, researchers suspect the MCCPs they identified came from biosolid fertilizer in the fields near where they set up their instrument.

""When sewage sludges are spread across the fields, those toxic compounds could be released into the air,"" Katz said. ""We can't show directly that that's happening, but we think it's a reasonable way that they could be winding up in the air. Sewage sludge fertilizers have been shown to release similar compounds.""

MCCPs little cousins, Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (SCCPs), are currently regulated by the Stockholm Convention, and since 2009, by the EPA here in the United States. Regulation came after studies found the toxic pollutants, which travel far and last a long time in the atmosphere, were harmful to human health. But researchers hypothesize that the regulation of SCCPs may have increased MCCPs in the environment.

""We always have these unintended consequences of regulation, where you regulate something, and then there's still a need for the products that those were in,"" said Ellie Browne, CU Boulder chemistry professor, CIRES Fellow, and co-author of the study. ""So they get replaced by something.""

Measurement of aerosols led to a new and surprising discovery

Using a nitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometer, which allows scientists to identify chemical compounds in the air, the team measured air at the agricultural site 24 hours a day for one month. As Katz cataloged the data, he documented the different isotopic patterns in the compounds. The compounds measured by the team had distinct patterns, and he noticed new patterns that he immediately identified as different from the known chemical compounds. With some additional research, he identified them as chlorinated paraffins found in MCCPs.

Katz says the makeup of MCCPs are similar to PFAS, long-lasting toxic chemicals that break down slowly over time. Known as ""forever chemicals,"" their presence in soils recently led the Oklahoma Senate to ban biosolid fertilizer.

Now that researchers know how to measure MCCPs, the next step might be to measure the pollutants at different times throughout the year to understand how levels change each season. Many unknowns surrounding MCCPs remain, and there's much more to learn about their environmental impacts.

""We identified them, but we still don't know exactly what they do when they are in the atmosphere, and they need to be investigated further,"" Katz said. ""I think it's important that we continue to have governmental agencies that are capable of evaluating the science and regulating these chemicals as necessary for public health and safety.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This tiny patch could replace biopsies—and revolutionize how we detect cancer","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250617014219.htm","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 12:45:13 GMT","

A patch containing tens of millions of microscopic nanoneedles could soon replace traditional biopsies, scientists have found.

The patch offers a painless and less invasive alternative for millions of patients worldwide who undergo biopsies each year to detect and monitor diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.

Biopsies are among the most common diagnostic procedures worldwide, performed millions of times every year to detect diseases. However, they are invasive, can cause pain and complications, and can deter patients from seeking early diagnosis or follow-up tests. Traditional biopsies also remove small pieces of tissue, limiting how often and how comprehensively doctors can analyse diseased organs like the brain.

Now, scientists at King's College London have developed a nanoneedle patch that painlessly collects molecular information from tissues without removing or damaging them. This could allow healthcare teams to monitor disease in real time and perform multiple, repeatable tests from the same area - something impossible with standard biopsies.

Because the nanoneedles are 1,000 times thinner than a human hair and do not remove tissue, they cause no pain or damage, making the process less painful for patients compared to standard biopsies. For many, this could mean earlier diagnosis and more regular monitoring, transforming how diseases are tracked and treated.

Dr Ciro Chiappini, who led the research published today in Nature Nanotechnology, said: ""We have been working on nanoneedles for twelve years, but this is our most exciting development yet. It opens a world of possibilities for people with brain cancer, Alzheimer's, and for advancing personalised medicine. It will allow scientists - and eventually clinicians - to study disease in real time like never before.""

The patch is covered in tens of millions of nanoneedles. In preclinical studies, the team applied the patch to brain cancer tissue taken from human biopsies and mouse models. The nanoneedles extracted molecular 'fingerprints' -- including lipids, proteins, and mRNAs -- from cells, without removing or harming the tissue.

The tissue imprint is then analysed using mass spectrometry and artificial intelligence, giving healthcare teams detailed insights into whether a tumour is present, how it is responding to treatment, and how disease is progressing at the cellular level.

Dr Chiappini said: ""This approach provides multidimensional molecular information from different types of cells within the same tissue. Traditional biopsies simply cannot do that. And because the process does not destroy the tissue, we can sample the same tissue multiple times, which was previously impossible.""

This technology could be used during brain surgery to help surgeons make faster, more precise decisions. For example, by applying the patch to a suspicious area, results could be obtained within 20 minutes and guide real-time decisions about removing cancerous tissue.

Made using the same manufacturing techniques as computer chips, the nanoneedles can be integrated into common medical devices such as bandages, endoscopes and contact lenses.

Dr Chippani added: ""This could be the beginning of the end for painful biopsies. Our technology opens up new ways to diagnose and monitor disease safely and painlessly - helping doctors and patients make better, faster decisions.""

The breakthrough was possible through close collaboration across nanoengineering, clinical oncology, cell biology, and artificial intelligence -- each field bringing essential tools and perspectives that, together, unlocked a new approach to non-invasive diagnostics.

The study was supported by the European Research Council through its flagship Starting Grant programme, Wellcome Leap, and UKRI's EPSRC and MRC, which enabled acquisition of key analytical instrumentation.

Metrics details

All contemporary Eurasians trace most of their ancestry to a small population that dispersed out of Africa about 50,000 years ago (ka)1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa10,11,12,13,14,15. These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000 years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70 ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50 ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success.

Genetic evidence, including patterns of interbreeding with Eurasian hominins, indicates that all contemporary human populations outside Africa derive most of their ancestry from a worldwide expansion that began approximately 50 ka (refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). However, the fossil record shows that earlier dispersals also occurred10,11,12,13,14,15,16. These dispersals out of Africa probably took place during repeated humid episodes within the Saharo-Arabian arid belt, most notably during the Last Interglacial, approximately 125 ka (refs. 10,17). An important question, therefore, concerns why these earlier dispersals were not successful enough to contribute any detectable genetic ancestry of non-African populations today, with early Homo sapiens failing to establish long-term viable populations in areas beyond Africa.

Researchers have proposed a range of explanations for the late dispersal of modern humans from Africa. Studies have considered that abrupt climate change in Africa18 and large shifts in human cognition, technology and subsistence permitted the development of new ‘niche-broadening' innovations, such as the distinctly human ability to communicate symbolically or develop projectile weaponry19,20,21,22,23. However, complex weaponry has now been shown to have notable time depth in Africa24,25 and recurrent markers of symbolic behaviour are present at least during Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS 5, 130–71 ka) in both Africa26,27,28,29,30 and Southwest Asia29,30. By around 60 ka, the Middle Stone Age/Middle Palaeolithic archaeological record of Northeast Africa and neighbouring regions of Southwest Asia had become rather generic31,32, with no particularly notable, regionally specific shared characteristics. More broadly, the African archaeological record features complex, nonlinear trajectories of cultural change33,34. These often include long periods of stasis punctuated by relatively brief pulses of innovation in different African regions35,36,37,38,39,40,41 thousands of years before the advent of Eurasian founder populations10,42. Large, cumulative changes in the archaeological record also post-date the 60–50-ka time frame10, suggesting that the success of modern human founding populations in Eurasia did not rest on a particular widespread technological innovation or sudden increased cognitive capacity43. More recent studies have focused on a variety of interrelated explanations rooted in demography. In particular, the apparent geographic expansion of Middle Stone Age archaeological sites in Africa 125–50 ka has been considered to reflect a possible growth in population coupled with an expansion inside Africa of an ancestry similar to the major expansion wave1,44,45,46. This population expansion is also thought to include greater population density47 and increases in connectivity through long-distance social networks48, all of which may have acted as ‘push' factors. Building on quantitative studies of niche changes associated with hominin species49, and with particular Middle Stone Age lithic industries22, the spatial patterning of sites has also been used to suggest a uniquely human adaptation to a ‘generalist–specialist' niche50. However, none of these hypotheses have been quantitatively assessed on a continental scale and few have been examined in terms of the predictions of suitable theoretical models, risking a proliferation of post-hoc explanations51,52. Because human expansion within and out of Africa can be linked to expansions in niche breadth under an ideal free distribution53 model, we explored successful out of Africa in terms of expansions of the human niche. As population densities increase, human settlement in more challenging environments becomes profitable. Under such conditions, in which the critical population mass required for successful out of Africa movements is reached and the ecological resilience of humans increases, expansions can occur54,55.

Here we specifically test whether the niche of Pleistocene H. sapiens expanded or contracted within Africa before major dispersals out of the continent. We define niche as the ensemble of bioclimatic factors determining where the species can survive and reproduce56. To answer this question, we build on previous studies22,57,58,59,60 and use a SDM approach61 to measure changes in the breadth of the Pleistocene human niche within Africa. Our results, tested against two different sets of palaeoenvironmental simulations62,63,64, formally demonstrate that human niche expansion precedes and coincides with successful later dispersal out of Africa.

To reconstruct the human niche in Africa over time, we took a pan-African approach and assembled a comprehensive and curated database of radiometrically dated Pleistocene occupation layers from archaeological sites in the time frame 120–14 ka, excluding any site with an age uncertainty greater than 20,000 years (see Methods for details on the choice of sites and Supplementary Table 1 for sites included here). For each retained occupation layer (Fig. 1), which represents a confirmed presence, we then extracted reconstructed palaeoclimatic variables and biomes62 (based on vegetation simulations with the BIOME4 model) associated with the location and date for a total of 479 radiometrically dated occurrences. We focused on five bioclimatic and vegetation variables that seemed to be the most informative to reconstruct habitat suitability based on our data (see Methods): (1) leaf area index (LAI); (2) temperature annual range (BIO 7); (3) mean temperature of the wettest quarter (BIO 8); (4) mean temperature of the warmest quarter (BIO 10); and (5) precipitation of the wettest quarter (BIO 16). Because of the limited amount of data for each specific biome, the vegetation simulations from BIOME4 were combined into three main classes: forest, savannah and desert (see Methods and Supplementary Table 4). We used two sets of palaeoclimatic simulations based on: (1) the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3 (ref. 62)), with results presented in the main text, and (2) the Transient Community Earth System Model (PCESM63,64), with results shown in Extended Data Fig. 8a. Although the two sets of simulations have a high degree of correlation, the magnitude in fluctuations for both temperature and precipitation differs through time and space (Extended Data Fig. 8a); despite these discrepancies, all of the key results are qualitatively robust to the palaeoclimate model used.

a, Location and time ranges of archaeological sites. b, Density of radiometrically dated archaeological layers per square kilometre used in this study (see Supplementary Table 1). The sample size is 479.

To reconstruct the human niche over time, we used a SDM approach fitted to the five bioclimatic variables. Biome classes were not used as inputs for the SDMs but only to characterize the environment of cells predicted as habitable by the models. Conventionally, niche changes are tested by fitting SDMs to different time periods and comparing the inferred niches. However, data for Pleistocene humans are very sparse and it would not be possible to create several time slices with enough occurrences. Instead, we use generalized additive models (GAMs) to fit the full time series as a single dataset65. With this approach, it is possible to formally test for changes in the niche over time by comparing a GAM in which the effect of each environmental variable in predicting occurrences is constant through time (fixed-niche GAM) against a GAM in which the effect is allowed to vary (changing-niche GAM; formally, by fitting an interaction between each predictor and time; see Methods).

The number of dated archaeological layers in our dataset varies with time, with an increase in abundance towards more recent periods (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This pattern probably results from increased chances of preservation in the more recent past, thus constituting a form of sampling bias that could distort the results. To avoid such a bias, we randomly subsampled the observations to generate a homogeneous distribution in the number of occurrences through time (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We repeated this process 100 times to generate several ‘standard-effort datasets' to explore the stochastic effect of such subsampling (Fig. 2). We took into account the chronological uncertainty associated with each radiometric date as follows: in each of these datasets, we associated each occurrence with a date sampled from its whole available chronological range (following a normal distribution around the mean). Finally, for each standard-effort dataset, we then quantified the background distribution of the climate variables against the occurrences, sampling 200 random locations matched in time for each occurrence. Next, we fitted a fixed-niche GAM and a changing-niche GAM to each set of standard-effort occurrences coupled with the associated pseudo-absence points, giving us 100 repeats of our analysis. Formal model comparisons using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) strongly supported the changing-niche GAM in 91 of 100 repeats (see Methods). To understand the changes in the niche detected by the model, we combined repeats into an ensemble66; specifically, we combined repeats with the AIC supporting a changing-niche GAM and a Boyce continuous index (BCI; a measure of goodness of fit for presence-only data)67 larger than 0.7 and investigated changes over time. We also created an ensemble from the repeats with AIC < 2 (hence not substantially supporting a changing-niche model) using the fixed-niche GAMs, which provides us with a null model of the changes owing to climatic fluctuations over time in the absence of any niche change. A qualitatively similar pattern can be observed on the same analyses performed using the PCESM palaeoclimatic simulations63.

To handle chronological uncertainty of archaeological layers, we resampled dates from the appropriate ranges: the saturation of the points indicates the number of resamples that were attributed to a given location for each MIS (darker points come from layers with low uncertainty for which most dates fall within the same MIS; lighter points represent layers with high uncertainty for which resamples are spread among several MISs). Details of the resampling approach and chronological subdivisions within MIS 4, MIS 3 and MIS 2 are described in Methods.

The ensemble of changing-niche GAMs showed a substantial increase in the habitable geographic range of Pleistocene humans within Africa over time (Fig. 3). The most notable increase was in West, Central and North Africa beginning roughly 70 ka at the onset of MIS 4. This large increase in geographic range around 70 ka was followed by a range expansion encompassing most of Africa beginning about 29 ka, during MIS 2 (Fig. 3). These changes were the result of niche expansion, as the fixed-niche GAM predicted a relatively stable and extensive inhabitation of the whole continent (Extended Data Fig. 2). Qualitatively similar results were obtained performing the same analyses with the PCESM climate simulations (Extended Data Figs. 8b and 10).

Mean ensemble; see Methods. Yellow represents unsuitable areas and the purple colours represent increased suitability from lighter to darker shades. These are calculated as total, peripheral and core areas, encompassing 99%, 95% and 90% of archaeological occurrences, respectively. The maps for each MIS are produced by calculating the mean of the habitat suitability for each individual cell within the time slices of interest. Chronological subdivisions of MIS 4, MIS 3 and MIS 2 are described in the Methods. The climate used is that of Beyer et al.62 with added Heinrich events. See Extended Data Fig. 8b for equivalent results using PCESM63,64.

To better understand the relationship between these changes in geographic range and the realized niche breadth as defined by the ensemble of changing-niche GAMs (Fig. 4a), we investigated the changes in niche breadth for each biome class under both the changing-niche and the fixed-niche models. We created a principal component analysis of the environmental variables used in the GAMs, pooling over all time steps, to generate a synthetic 2D space that describes climatic variability over the period of interest. For each time step, we then measured the area of a kernel fitted over the locations that were predicted as suitable by the respective model in each biome class (Fig. 4b). We also explored the interaction plots (that is, the partial effects of the interaction between each bioclimatic variable and time) of the ensemble of changing-niche GAMs (Extended Data Fig. 3) to understand the exact changes in the niche, as these represent the (theoretical) full niche and are not affected by the availability of different climatic conditions. Figure 4b shows the size of the realized niche for each biome within Africa, allowing the relationship between humans and climate to change (changing-niche model), whereas Extended Data Fig. 4 compares (for both palaeoclimatic simulations used) this pattern with the plot assuming this relationship to be constant (fixed-niche model). As a result, the latter represents how human distribution would have changed only following climatic fluctuations.

a, Homo sapiens suitable habitat (combined core and peripheral areas) subdivided by biome class (desert, savannah and forest). b, Climatic niche area through time. The niche area is calculated on the plot of the first two principal components of the climatic variables by estimating the 2D 99% kernel encompassing the suitable cells (combined core and peripheral areas) for each biome class. Equivalent results using PCESM63,64 are shown in Extended Data Fig. 4a.

As shown in Fig. 4b, after fluctuations around a relatively stable level up to MIS 5a, the potential use of savannah and forest started to increase steadily between MIS 5a and MIS 4. The increase was not linked to an increase in availability of those habitats, as it was not reproduced by the fixed-niche GAM (see Extended Data Fig. 4a for an equivalent plot to Fig. 4b). Rather, use of areas in which the wettest quarter was both warmer (BIO 8) and had greater precipitation (BIO 16; see Extended Data Fig. 3) increased, thus expanding the niche progressively into the forests. The use of deserts was more variable, in part because of fluctuations in the degree of aridity of deserts available. During wetter periods, we found an increase in the niche space of deserts that were suitable for human habitation, as they were less extreme in their climatic characteristics. We observe this effect in the reconstructed realized niche area of the fixed-niche GAM, in which changes through time are only linked to climatic changes affecting available climate conditions (see Extended Data Fig. 4a). The key difference between the changing-niche and fixed-niche GAMs is that, in the former, after a peak during early MIS 5a owing to more favourable climate, deserts remain in greater use than during previous, less favourable dips. This stable expansion into the desert is then maintained until MIS 3, when we see another progressive increase in the use of desert habitats. This was not seen in the fixed-niche GAM. Mechanistically, the increased use of deserts was underpinned by an increased use of regions with larger annual temperature ranges (BIO 7 in Extended Data Fig. 3) and a progressive increase in the ability to survive in areas with low LAI (that is, with sparse vegetation; LAI in Extended Data Fig. 3). Although slightly muted, the same patterns were observed when repeating the analyses using the biome classes based on PCESM64 (Extended Data Figs. 4b and 9).

Our results show that the human niche progressively expanded to include more habitat types beginning around 70 ka and that this expansion peaked at about 50 ka, coinciding with successful dispersals out of Africa. A second expansion was observed starting approximately 29 ka; by MIS 2, humans occupied all African regions and ecosystems, with terminal Pleistocene societies engaging with a range of new behaviours, including semi-sedentism68, evidence of persistent macroscale social networking69 and increased territoriality and interpersonal violence70. Our findings are consistent using two different and independently developed sets of palaeoenvironmental simulations. The expansion of the human niche beginning around 70 ka in Africa is driven by a gradual increase in human preference for forest and desert biomes, allowing them to expand into regions that were previously rarely populated: (1) forests of West Africa, (2) forests of Central Africa and, eventually, (3) arid Saharan regions and semi-arid Sahelian regions of North Africa. This increased ability to adapt to new habitats, ranging from the extremes of equatorial forests to arid deserts, would have allowed these populations of humans the ecological flexibility to tackle a range of new environmental conditions encountered during the expansion out of Africa, allowing them to succeed where earlier migrations out of Africa had previously faltered. The expansion of the human niche in Africa starting around 70 ka, therefore, offers an explanation for the successful worldwide expansion of human populations about 50 ka and is consistent with predictions informed by the ideal free distribution about the consequences of population expansions.

These results also offer insights into changes in the archaeological record between approximately 70 and 50 ka, a time when diverse regions feature distinctive cultural trajectories (see Supplementary Information). In particular, ecosystem engineering through widespread burning71, water storage technology72,73 and expanded diet breadth74 have been previously documented in Africa broadly within this time frame and slightly before. These findings may reflect behavioural preconditions and manifestations of the expansion of the human niche into new habitats. It is important to stress that our pan-African results do not imply a unique, unified process over the whole continent. It is indeed more likely that it is linked to a few specific cultural complexes. More research must be carried out to unravel what drove the changes that we observe.

We emphasize that, although we document a niche expansion, this does not necessarily reflect an increase in overall population size and it may not be possible to distinguish between the effects of population size increase versus increases in density within reduced niche space47. For example, the new human niche in arid regions was unlikely to have sustained large or stable population sizes owing to low carrying capacity75. Instead, the expansion of the human niche indicates that humans were able to move among several habitats and locations, probably increasing the encounter rate between different groups over time. If this were the case, it may explain why the constellation of features that define humans today became fixed in individuals between 100 and 50 ka (ref. 42). It would also provide independent support for the hypothesis that there could have been an expansion inside Africa of an ancestry that is similar to the one that expanded into Eurasia after about 60 ka (refs. 44,45).

The period roughly 70–50 ka is climatically complex. Although the Heinrich Event 6 brings an overall cooler and drier spell owing to the weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation76, the magnitude of this effect differs across regions of Africa. Notably, the proxy record points to repeated shifts between dry and wet spells77, with suggestions of a broader humid period that might have affected a large part of the continent following Heinrich Event 6 (ref. 78). Our runs of HadCM3 (combining Beyer et al.62 and Armstrong et al.79) capture this temporal and spatial heterogeneity (Extended Data Fig. 8a); in PCESM63,64, which does not explicitly include Heinrich Event 6, the pattern is more muted (Extended Data Fig. 8a). The impact of Heinrich Event 6 for human evolution has mostly been framed in terms of its role in dispersals out of Africa. It has been argued that the aridification of Northern and Eastern Africa might have acted as a push event favouring migrations of humans out of Africa80; however, it should also be noted that, because of the cooling effect and its heterogeneous impact, this period potentially provided corridors that might have favoured movement out of the continent81. A similar argument can be made for the onset of MIS 2 around 29 ka, when a period of heterogeneous aridification prompted a further move into more arid habitats. Given our results, it is plausible that the instability of climate in these periods might have favoured the evolution of a broader niche in humans, further enhancing their ability to cope with the diverse habitats that distinguish the genus Homo64.

By modelling the human niche within Africa from 120 to 14 ka, we show that successful expansion into Eurasia and the long-term establishment of populations there were part of a process that fundamentally started within Africa. Essentially, we document the inception of an unquestionably African process originating 70 ka that has resulted in today's unparalleled human ecological plasticity. Our results, therefore, provide a new basis for understanding and investigating our species' global dispersal.

Coordinates of archaeological sites are essential for SDMs, as these models are built on the accurate input of spatial occurrence/presence data. Chronometrically dated archaeological layers are also necessary for linking occurrences to the appropriate local climate simulations used in SDMs. Radiometric dating methods provide age estimations before present that are measured on the basis of physical and chemical changes that occur over time82. Radiocarbon (14C), uranium–thorium (U-Th or U-series), optically stimulated luminescence, thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance—among others—are dating methods that provide age estimates in calendar years before present83. In cases in which the age of an archaeological layer was estimated only by non-radiometric methods, it was excluded from subsequent analyses. Non-radiometric dating methods include biochronology, typology and palaeomagnetism. If an archaeological layer was not dated, it was likewise excluded from subsequent analyses. Following the removal of archaeological layers that were not subjected to radiometric dating techniques, further limits were placed on archaeological occurrences included in distribution models and niche area calculations. Any occurrence was excluded if the minimum age subtracted from the maximum age was greater than 20,000 years. These efforts resulted in a database (Supplementary Table 1) with archaeological layers that have: (1) published coordinates; (2) radiometric dates; (3) an age error range less than or equal to 20,000 years; and (4) mean age ≤120,000 and ≥14,000 years. Archaeological sites and layers were compiled from peer-reviewed journals and books published before 5 May 2021. The Role of Culture in Early Expansions of Humans (ROCEEH) has been integrating archaeological, palaeoanthropological, palaeontological and palaeobotanical information into the ROCEEH Out of Africa Database (ROAD) since 2009 (ref. 84). As of May 2021, the team has compiled information on more than 2,000 localities and more than 12,000 assemblages in Africa and Eurasia dated between three million and 20,000 years before present. The information in ROAD is structured into localities (sites) with dated layers that contain assemblages of finds, including artefacts, human fossils, palaeofauna and plant remains, and bibliographic sources. For this study, A.W.K. and M.W. queried ROAD to create a list of archaeological localities in Africa dating between about 500,000 and 10,000 years and reviewed the output for accuracy. The output also included the ages of the layers, as well as radiometric dating results.

In our database of archaeological sites, all radiocarbon dates were entered as uncalibrated ages, with the exception of Haua Fteah, for which modelled and calibrated 14C radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence/electron spin resonance ages were entered from Douka et al.85. If a single archaeological layer was dated with both 14C and further chronometric dating methods, the uncalibrated radiocarbon ages were entered in a separate column from the extra radiometric dating methods. For all uncalibrated 14C ages entered in our database, a basic IntCal20 (ref. 86) calibration for Northern Hemisphere archaeological localities and a basic SHCal20 calibration for Southern Hemisphere archaeological localities was completed using the rcarbon R package87. The calibrated 14C ages were then used to determine the mean age and age error ranges were calculated to the level of 1σ. If an archaeological layer was dated with 14C and further methods, our calibrated 14C mean age and 1σ error were then combined with the mean age and error range of the other methods to find the mean age used in our models. Note that we did not calibrate 14C ages using marine calibration curves (Marine20 (ref. 88)), nor did we calculate ΔR values for marine carbonates (but see Reimer and Reimer89 for calculation of ΔR for paired marine and terrestrial dates). Marine calibration curves and ΔR values were not included in our 14C calibration for two reasons: (1) for many 14C ages, it is unknown whether dated samples are marine or terrestrial shell and (2) ΔR values are determined regionally based on the nearest samples in the ΔR database but, for much of Africa, the sampling coverage is low. We also did not subtract 180 years before calibration from 14C ages obtained from ostrich eggshell90 (as 180 years is too short a time span to change our models that run in 1,000-year or 2,000-year intervals), nor did we set the northernmost limit for Southern Hemisphere calibration at the Intertropical Convergence Zone, as this boundary is recommended only when seasonal variations are known91. Instead, we set the boundary between Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere calibration at the equator, as seasonal variations are unknown for most of the archaeological sites included in the present study. Extended Data Fig. 5 shows the differences between the calibration applied in the present study, opposite hemisphere calibration that was not applied and marine calibration that was not applied. In all cases, the possible dates based on different approaches to calibration fall within a relatively narrow range that would lead, at most, to moving a site to the adjacent 2-ka time window and would have a minimal effect on the local climate assigned to that occurrence. Supplementary Table 2 shows the number assigned to each archaeological site name and layer for Extended Data Fig. 5, as well as uncalibrated ages and errors, calibrated ages and 1σ errors that were used in the present study and calibrated ages and 1σ errors that were not used in the present study.

To better visualize how the patterns change through time, and better compare different periods, in our figures, we subdivided MIS stages 4, 3 and 2 to create roughly equal time periods. We subdivided MIS stages 5, 4, 3 and 2 following δ18O peaks and lows from Cohen and Gibbard92. We subdivided MIS 5 into MIS 5e (120–116 ka), MIS 5d (116–104 ka), MIS 5c (104–94 ka), MIS 5b (94–85 ka) and MIS 5a (84–71 ka); MIS 4 was subdivided into early (71–64 ka) and late (64–57 ka); MIS 3 was subdivided into early (57–47 ka), middle (47–39 ka) and late (39–29 ka); and MIS 2 was subdivided into early (29–23 ka) and late (23–15 ka).

The palaeoclimatic reconstructions from Beyer et al.62 do not include water hosing to simulate Heinrich events. To include them, we considered simulations from Armstrong et al.79 (although the reference cited focuses on the Northern Hemisphere, the associated simulations of the global circulation model are available on BRIDGE93). In those simulations, Dansgaard–Oeschger and Heinrich events are imposed as a spatial fingerprint with time-varying amplitude to match temperature reconstruction from Greenland ice cores. The spatial fingerprint itself was derived from a freshwater hosing simulation during the Last Glacial Maximum using HadCM3B-M2.1 (ref. 79). As the two runs use slightly different boundary conditions, we computed anomalies for monthly temperature and precipitation between the time slices of interest (that is, with Heinrich events simulated by water hosing) and the simulations for the present, and then added those anomalies to the simulations from the present used by Beyer et al.62, working at the original coarse resolution of HadCM3. We then bias-corrected and downscaled those time slices using the same approach as Beyer et al.62, thus creating a coherent dataset, and recomputed BIOCLIM variables and ran the BIOME4 global vegetation model, modified to include water hosing and Heinrich events. At the end, we had 17 BIOCLIM variables available (BIO 2 and BIO 3 could not be computed as they are based on daily rather than monthly summaries) and two vegetation variables (net primary productivity and LAI).

Variable selection was performed using the R package tidysdm94. The palaeoclimatic reconstructions (Beyer et al.62 with added Heinrich events; see section above) were stored as a netCDF file and were accessed using the R package pastclim95 (dataset = “custom”). We defined which variables to use for our analyses using the equivalent of the plot_pres_vs_bg() and dist_pres_vs_bg() functions in tidysdm94. We used an older version of the function tidysdm::plot_pres_vs_bg() to create a violin plot comparing the distribution over the variable space of the occurrences versus a representative sample of the background. The latter was obtained by randomly drawing 10,000 points from each time slice over the whole area and period considered (Extended Data Fig. 6a). The variables for which humans seemed to occupy the climatic space differently from what was available in the environment suggest non-random use of the variable itself, supporting the idea that they would be more meaningful to reconstruct the distribution of the species (see, for reference, the function tidysdm::dist_pres_vs_bg()). Finally, among these informative variables, we extracted a set of variables that showed a correlation among each other below a threshold of 0.8 (Extended Data Fig. 6b), leaving: LAI, temperature annual range (BIO 7), mean temperature of the wettest quarter (BIO 8), mean temperature of the warmest quarter (BIO 10) and precipitation of the wettest quarter (BIO 16).

Each radiometric date is associated with a specific chronological uncertainty, expressed as a range (most likely date and plus/minus). To take into account such uncertainty, we performed our analyses as follows. We created 100 independent datasets: for each of them, the spatial coordinates of all occurrences (= radiometrically dated archaeological layer) were associated to an age that was resampled from the whole chronological range of the date. Such sampling was performed following a truncated normal distribution identified by the mean and the plus/minus as 2σ (ref. 96).

When looking at the number of our occurrences through time (as exemplified by their mean age shown in Extended Data Fig. 1a), there is a marked increase in the number of layers observed through time. This pattern is most likely the result of a combination of an increasing number of human occupations through time, a conservation bias (with more recent traces of occupation being more likely to have survived than older ones) and the differential use of the available radiometric dating techniques (for example, 14C is only available up to around 50 ka). To account for all of these factors, each of the resampled datasets was randomly subsampled to generate a homogeneous distribution in the number of occurrences available through time (thus giving us constant sampling effort through time) using the following procedure. We identified that, at 78 ka, there is a boundary between an older period with a low number of occurrences (on average between zero and eight per time slice, varying on the basis of the chronological resampling) and a more recent period in which there is much more data available. For each resampling, we then subset each time slice from the more recent period to the number of occurrences observed in a randomly sampled older time slice (Extended Data Fig. 1).

To adequately represent the existing climatic space (that is, background) in our SDMs, each of these resulting, constant-effort datasets was coupled with a random sampling, for each observation, of 200 random locations matched by time. This resulted in n = 100 datasets (= ‘repeats') of randomly sampled and dated occurrences and differently sampled background points. We independently repeated our analyses for each of these datasets, thus accounting for the stochasticity of resolving the time uncertainty, the sampling biases and the choice of background points. From this stage, all analyses were repeated independently using two sets of palaeoclimatic simulations: Beyer et al.62 with Heinrich events and PCESM63,64.

We then used GAMs (mgcv package in R (ref. 97)) to fit two possible models: a ‘changing-niche' model that included interactions of each environmental variable with time (fitted as tensor products) and a ‘fixed-niche' model that included the environmental variables as covariates but lacking interactions with time65. Thus, for the fixed-niche model, the mgcv GAM formula is

gam(obs~ti(bio07, k=4) + ti(bio08, k=4) + ti(bio10, k=4) +

      ti(bio16, k=4) + ti(lai, k=4),

     data=data, family='binomial')

Here human presence/absence (obs) is modelled as the sum of five nonlinear functions (of the four bioclimatic variables and LAI). Each function ti() denotes a tensor product smooth term created using thin plate regression splines, in which each spline is composed of k=4 basis functions. family='binomial' indicates that the response variable (obs) follows a binomial distribution and the link function is the logit function. data denotes the R data frame containing the response and predictor variables.

For the changing-niche model, we have

gam(obs~ti(bio07, k=4) + ti(bio08, k=4) + ti(bio10, k=4) +

      ti(bio16, k=4) + ti(lai, k=4) + ti(time_bp, k=4) +

      ti(time_bp, bio07, k=4) + ti(time_bp, bio08, k=4) +

      ti(time_bp, bio10, k=4)+ ti(time_bp, bio16, k=4) +

      ti(time_bp, lai, k=4),

       data=data, family='binomial')

This model uses an extra five bivariate functions, each of which includes time before present (time_bp) as a second argument, as well as the relevant bioclimatic variable or LAI. Note that both models use bioclimatic and LAI values corresponding to the time and location of the human presence data (obs), but only the second model considers nonlinear interactions between the bioclimatic and LAI variables with time, whereas the first model only includes a univariate time function term. For a formal definition of the univariate and bivariate thin place regression splines, ti(x) and ti(t,x), respectively, we refer readers to Wood98 (specifically section 2, starting on page 1,026, as well as subsection 2.1 ‘Nesting and ANOVA decomposition' on page 1,028, which provides a rationale for how the models are compared). A comprehensive description of how GAMs are fitted in mgcv is given by Wood97.

For all GAMs, we set k = 4 as the maximum threshold for the degrees of freedom of the splines; this value provides a reasonable compromise between allowing the relationship to change through time but avoiding excessive overfitting99.

For each repeat, we performed standard checks on the residuals of the models using the DHARMa package in R (ref. 100), including the following tests: Kolmogorov–Smirnov for correct distribution, dispersion and outliers. Kolmogorov–Smirnov deviation was significant for six repeats in the changing-niche model (numbers 1, 4, 24, 37, 52 and 56) and five repeats for the fixed-niche model (numbers 1, 4, 24, 37 and 56). Outlier test deviation was significant for eight repeats of the changing-niche model (numbers 25, 38, 67, 69, 74, 78, 85 and 95) and 11 for the fixed-niche model (numbers 18, 24, 25, 30, 38, 67, 74, 77, 78, 85 and 95). All other tests and repeats were non-significant. Visual inspection of these deviations revealed that they were mostly capturing patterns of very small magnitude owing to the high power associated with the large size of the datasets (as a result of the large number of background points) and thus were judged not to affect an analysis. A comparison of models with outliers and models without outliers showed that the model effects were qualitatively similar, thus confirming that the outliers were not leading to artefactual conclusions. We also tested for spatial autocorrelation in the residuals calculating Moran's I (ref. 101) with the same package. Moran's I values were statistically significant (P-value < 0.05) but negligible (<0.01 on a scale between 0 and 1) in all cases (Supplementary Table 3).

For each repeat, we compared the fixed-niche and changing-niche models using the AIC and found strong support for the latter in all cases (Extended Data Fig. 7a). We then evaluated the fit of the changing-niche models with the BCI102, which is specifically designed to be used with presence-only data, setting an acceptance threshold of Pearson's correlation coefficient > 0.7 (ref. 67) (Extended Data Fig. 7b).

To achieve more robust predictions66, we calculated the mean and median ensembles across the 100 repeats in the following way. We selected only repeats that had an AIC > 2, hence strongly supporting the changing-niche model (91/100 for Beyer et al.62 with Heinrich events, 95/100 for PCESM63,64; Extended Data Fig. 7a). From them, we kept only repeats with a BCI > 0.7 (which accounted for 70% for Beyer et al.62 with Heinrich events and 55% for PCESM63,64; Extended Data Fig. 7b). From this selection of repeats, we created four ensembles (two for each palaeoclimatic model) by computing the mean and median of the predictions. Then, to estimate the goodness of fit of each ensemble, we computed the mean and median of the BCI estimated for each of their individual repeats (note that each repeat had a different set of occurrences and background points as a result of the random resampling).

As the mean ensemble performed better than the one based on the median, it was used to visualize how the potential distribution of humans changed through time. To incorporate the uncertainty associated with the model, the predicted probabilities of occurrence were transformed into binary (presence or absence) using three different thresholds. The first one (darkest colour in Fig. 3) represents the minimum predicted area encompassing 90% of our occurrences and identifies the ‘core area' suitable for humans (that is, the space most likely occupied). We similarly plotted a ‘peripheral area' encompassing 95% and the ‘total area' encompassing 99% of occurrences. This was done using a modified version of the function ecospat.mpa() from the ecospat R package103, in which no rounding of the digit is performed. To better visualize how the reconstructed potential distribution changed through time, we calculated for each climatic period the mean of the projections from the individual time slides. A similar procedure has been applied to the fixed-niche models, (using only the repeats with AIC < 2), for which the equivalent of Fig. 3 is available as Extended Data Fig. 2).

To visualize the changing impact of different BIO variables through time in the niche-changing model, we used the function draw.gam() from the R package gratia104 following Leonardi et al.65. This function plots the interactions between time and each of the BIO variables. The result is a heat map with time represented on the x axis and the values of the variable of interest on the y axis. Within the plot, the surface colour (‘partial effect') shows the effect on the probability of occurrence: red means an increased and blue a decreased probability compared with what would be expected on the basis of the mean value of other variables (the black lines are isoclines to aid reading the changes in the surface). We created partial effect surfaces for all repeats included in each ensemble and then plotted the mean surface, which captures consistent signals across all randomized sets of background points (Extended Data Fig. 3 for Beyer et al.62 with added Heinrich events and Extended Data Fig. 9 for PCESM63,64).

The analyses described in this section were performed on the regions combining the core and peripheral areas (that is, dark and medium purple in Fig. 3; from now on: suitable habitat). For each time slice, we subdivided the suitable habitat into three different classes of biomes (forest, savannah and desert) based on BIOME4 (ref. 62) reconstructions. Ideally, we would have done it for the finer subdivisions provided by the original model, but the limited number of occurrences in the archaeological record prevents us from performing any formal analysis at this disaggregated level (for example, we only have two points for tropical rainforest). The list of biomes included in each class can be found in Supplementary Table 4. We then aggregated the results by MIS by keeping for each cell the most common biome class within the given period (Fig. 4a).

To visualize how much of the suitable area falls into each biome class (Fig. 4b), we performed the following steps. First, we summarized the five BIO climatic variables by computing the first two principal components, pooling all land cells for all of the time steps (that is, creating a principal component analysis that represents the full climatic space of Africa for the whole period considered in this research). Then, in that 2D space, for each biome class and time step, we calculated the area covered by the 2D kernel that includes 99% of the suitable cells (core and peripheral areas) within that biome class105. We repeated this procedure separately for the changing-niche and fixed-niche models, which are presented in Extended Data Fig. 4).

To correct for the potential biases linked to the specific palaeoclimatic simulations used, we repeated the whole set of analyses described (excluding the standard checks on the residuals and the calculation of Moran's I) with the PCESM63,64 climatic simulations. The AIC and BCI are comparable with the analyses presented here (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), as are the patterns in the response surfaces of the GAMs, in which we consistently observe a change during MIS 4 (Extended Data Fig. 9). Projections of the fixed-niche and changing-niche models and results of the biome analyses are available as Extended Data Figs. 8b, 4 and 10).

The cartographic representation of Africa in Fig. 1 was originally developed on QGIS 3.22 Białowieża with WGS 84 projection. Geolocated archaeological layers were superimposed and colour-coded on the basis of chronology (Fig. 1a). Overlapping sites in Fig. 1a were stacked in ascending chronological order, with older sites overlapping younger sites. A map with archaeological occurrence/layer density per square kilometre (Fig. 1b) was developed using an automated density cluster function on QGIS 3.22 Białowieża. The resulting cartographic representations were exported as .svg format and composed on Adobe Illustrator 2025. Figures 2, 3 and 4 originated as .svg files from R. Cartographic panels were processed in Adobe Photoshop 2023 and subsequently designed and composed using Adobe Illustrator 2023.

Metrics details

Climate change threatens global food systems1, but the extent to which adaptation will reduce losses remains unknown and controversial2. Even within the well-studied context of US agriculture, some analyses argue that adaptation will be widespread and climate damages small3,4, whereas others conclude that adaptation will be limited and losses severe5,6. Scenario-based analyses indicate that adaptation should have notable consequences on global agricultural productivity7,8,9, but there has been no systematic study of how extensively real-world producers actually adapt at the global scale. Here we empirically estimate the impact of global producer adaptations using longitudinal data on six staple crops spanning 12,658 regions, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories. We estimate that global production declines 5.5 × 1014 kcal annually per 1 °C global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise (120 kcal per person per day or 4.4% of recommended consumption per 1 °C; P < 0.001). We project that adaptation and income growth alleviate 23% of global losses in 2050 and 34% at the end of the century (6% and 12%, respectively; moderate-emissions scenario), but substantial residual losses remain for all staples except rice. In contrast to analyses of other outcomes that project the greatest damages to the global poor10,11, we find that global impacts are dominated by losses to modern-day breadbaskets with favourable climates and limited present adaptation, although losses in low-income regions losses are also substantial. These results indicate a scale of innovation, cropland expansion or further adaptation that might be necessary to ensure food security in a changing climate.

Disruptions of the global food system owing to climate change threaten human well-being12,13,14 and social stability10,15, but researchers lack a complete understanding of the magnitude and structure of potential impacts on food systems globally2,16. It is known that changes to the climate will alter the distribution of weather experienced across the planet17 and that biophysical processes in agricultural systems will respond5,7,8. However, the degree to which humans around the world will effectively adapt their agricultural practices in reaction to these changes remains unknown2,3,8,9. For this reason, existing global projections have been unable to account for the adoption rates and efficacy of producer adaptations7,8,18 and it remains unresolved whether the compensatory responses of producers are likely to overcome the challenges posed by climate change4,19.

Here we develop a unified empirical approach to measure the effect of climate change on staple crop production, accounting for the costs, benefits and adoption rates of producer adaptations as they are observed in practice around the world. We study one of the most comprehensive samples of subnational crop yields ever assembled, representing two-thirds of global cropped calorie production, which allows our results to be globally representative. Using high-resolution data from populations across diverse contexts allows us to understand the real-world response of producers to weather events, changes in climate and economic development. We then apply our empirical results to project probabilistic global climate change impacts on yields that account for environmental changes, biophysical processes and the compensatory responses of producers.

Previous analyses using process-based models have provided crucial insights about the potential impacts of climate change on global food systems and have enabled decades of progress in agronomic modelling7,8,9,18. These models explicitly characterize the biophysical processes that generate yields (for example, root depth, evapotranspiration, light utilization) and are calibrated to precisely managed experimental fields7,18, thereby providing detailed insight into the agronomic mechanisms by which climatic changes influence yields. However, these models generally assume that producers optimize yields subject to decision rules formed through modeller expert judgement (for example, ‘no adaptation' or ‘optimal varietal switching'7,18) in contrast to observing the decisions made by producers on the ground16,20,21. These decision rules describe what is theoretically possible but might not reflect actual conditions across diverse socioeconomic contexts, which are influenced by financial constraints, market failures and human error, along with other factors (Methods). Furthermore, because global process-based models are parameterized on the basis of data from scientifically managed experimental fields, concerns have been raised about their ability to represent actual producer decisions in diverse and resource-constrained contexts16,20,21.

To address these challenges, we develop an econometric approach that simultaneously captures the combined impact of biophysical crop responses and producer decision-making. In place of modeller-prescribed adaptation scenarios, our approach empirically recovers the effect of actual adaptations undertaken in response to diverse climatic and economic conditions faced by producers. This reduced-form approach does not attempt the difficult task of identifying and modelling each individual mechanism through which these adaptations occur. Instead, we measure the total impact of adaptive adjustments in response to the climate (for example, changing varietals, altering cultivation windows, adjusting fertilizer) without modelling intermediary processes explicitly (Methods and Supplementary Information, section B). We apply these measurements—which capture the extent, intensity and efficacy of real-world producer adaptations as a function of local climates and economic conditions—in simulations of future crop production under climate change and economic development. The key assumption underlying our approach is that producers facing similar climates, incomes and irrigation infrastructure make similar management decisions, which allows us to estimate the effects of producer decisions, which we do not observe. The weakness of our approach is that, if producers facing similar contexts are not comparable, then our estimates of producer adaptation may be biased (Methods and Supplementary Information, section B).

Previous empirical work has demonstrated how reduced-form econometric approaches can be calibrated to producer behaviour in specific regions2,5,11,22,23, such as maize producers in the USA5. Follow-up work demonstrated that this approach is complementary to, rather than a replacement for, detailed process-based models8,9,20,23,24,25. We build on the literature analysing the variation of weather responses with local climate as an indicator of adaptation4,19,26,27, making use of the method for capturing the benefits of adaptation in ref. 28 and accounting for adaptation costs based on ref. 29. Our work here represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first global analysis of staple crops that: (1) accounts for observed adaptation behaviour and how it varies globally; (2) uses these results to generate global projections of climate impacts on yields over the twenty-first century; and (3) transforms these projections into an empirically derived ‘damage function' that links changes in global calorie production to changes in GMST (ΔGMST). The scale and scope of our projections are comparable with global gridded process-based models, such as those underlying the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP)7. However, unlike those models, our analysis is based on globally representative data and accounts for the adoption rates and efficacy of adaptive behaviours that producers choose to undertake in practice across diverse environmental and economic contexts (for example, varietal switching and optimization of inputs such as fertilizer or irrigation intensity; see Supplementary Information, section B).

We make four contributions that address key challenges when projecting global impacts of climate change on agriculture. First, we assemble one of the largest datasets of subnational crop production available (Ray et al.30 analyse the only comparable dataset we are aware of, containing “~13,500 political units” and four crops, but have not made their data public), covering 12,658 subnational administrative units from 54 countries for six staple crops spanning diverse local climates and socioeconomic contexts (Fig. 1a–c,e, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Second, we systematically select from many correlated aspects of weather affecting crop biophysical processes which have been separately studied2. In our models of crop biophysical processes, we endeavour to ‘let the data speak' and select from this broad set of weather variables using cross-validation over our rich panel data, an approach commonly used in machine learning (Supplementary Information, section C, Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Third, we estimate the degree of producer adaptation, which has been widely debated2,3,4,5,6,19,22,31. Following previous research, we use climate summary statistics (such as average temperature, average rainfall; see bars in Fig. 1d,f) to identify similarly adapted subpopulations4,5,26,28,29,31,32 (Extended Data Figs. 1b, 3 and 4, Methods and Supplementary Information, section D). However, we select crop-specific measures of climate by means of cross-validation (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Further, we account for both the costs29 and the benefits of local adaptations (Methods and Supplementary Information, section H); failing to account for costs overstates the value of adaptation19. Fourth, our model allows for differences in resource access (for example, fertilizer, technology, insurance and credit markets or labour markets) to influence patterns of food production (Methods). This is particularly important in projections, as future economic development is likely to alter agricultural practices in ways that could make agriculture more resilient or vulnerable to weather33.

Region-specific and crop-specific impacts are projected to evolve in the future based on changes to economic conditions (for example, GDP per capita) and climate (for example, average temperature), reflecting economic development and adaptation. a, Fraction of cropped area observed in our subnational administrative data, for example, regions spanning North, Central and South America. b, Example inset regions surrounding Lucas do Rio Verde municipality (black outline) in Mato Grosso state, Brazil. c, Time series of maize yield administrative data from Lucas do Rio Verde. d, Empirically estimated relationship between daily temperature and log maize yields (shaded region: 95% confidence interval) conditional on other factors that include rainfall, climate and access to inputs and technology (Methods). Bars indicate county-specific values for variables used to predict the local, county-level effects of temperature and rainfall (red is average temperature, blue is average precipitation, orange is GDP per capita and green is area equipped for irrigation). Example regions depicted from top to bottom are: Iroquois County, Illinois, USA; La Barca municipality in Jalisco, Mexico; and Lucas do Rio Verde in Mato Grosso, Brazil. e, As in a but for an example region of Asia. f, As in d but for the response of rice to daily temperature in Dongbao district in Hubei, China, the cities of Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu, India, and Sulawesi Utara, Indonesia. g, Expected exceedance degree days over 30 °C projected for each of 24,378 regions in 2090 in a high-emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). Exceedance degree day projections (and other variables) from each model are combined with econometric results, such as d and f, to project crop-specific climate impacts that account for adaptation.

Because our data span climatic zones around the world, we are able to empirically measure how adaptive practices in different climates mediate the influence of environmental conditions (Fig. 1d,f and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). This ‘reduced-form' approach does not provide the granular detail contained in process-based models but it does account for the net consequence of nearly all climate-associated adaptive actions available to producers, without requiring that each is explicitly modelled or observed22. For example, our approach accounts for adaptive actions such as selecting a varietal with an earlier harvest date to avoid late-season heat exposure, adjusting typical fertilizer use conditional on socioeconomic conditions and adjusting typical irrigation water use conditional on access to irrigation, along with many other available adaptive measures. Notably, our approach does not account for altering the area planted to a given crop (that is, crop switching, although we do account for this in our valuation of climate impacts) and shifting the planting date outside present growing season windows (although we do account for varietal selections with earlier harvest dates).

Our final global model for each crop is high dimensional, nonlinear and dependent on the underlying economic and climatic characteristics of each location—but nonetheless fully interpretable. Each crop model includes several measures of weather that are all interacted with several measures of climate, as well as income and possibly irrigation (Extended Data Fig. 1c). This approach allows yields in a given year and location to be computed by (1) weather in that location–year, which is an argument to (2) a location–year function determined by crop-specific measures of climate, income and irrigation. The resulting models are relatively parsimonious compared with global process-based models7,8 because the influence of many other factors not explicitly included in the model (for example, soil type and quality) is captured non-parametrically (Methods and Supplementary Information, section B). However, these parsimonious models are skilful. Our model outperforms process-based model benchmarks globally across crops and regionally over 81% of crop–country pairs (Supplementary Information, section F and Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). Furthermore, in a ground-truth exercise, our model reproduces variation in local yields (R2 values from 0.63 (cassava) to 0.88 (rice); Extended Data Fig. 5), including over localized regions in our data representing both high and low values of average yields and cropping intensity (Extended Data Fig. 6).

We project climate impacts to yields across 24,378 global administrative regions until the end of the century. Projections include a high-emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5; Figs. 1g and 2) and a moderate-emissions scenario (RCP 4.5; Extended Data Fig. 7), each matched to two socioeconomic scenarios, in each of 33 climate models and model surrogates that represent the full range of climate sensitivities (Methods). We account for statistical uncertainty through 1,920 Monte Carlo simulations per crop, following refs. 28,29,34 (Methods).

Wheat shows winter wheat and spring wheat projections combined, weighted by their area share in each region. Estimates in each location are ensemble means across climate and statistical uncertainty. Incomes from SSP3. See Extended Data Fig. 7 for a moderate-emissions scenario (RCP 4.5) and Supplementary Information, section J for results adjusted by CO2 fertilization.

We report results based on where crops are cultivated today, noting that our approach also allows us to estimate theoretical impacts for a crop in locations in which it is not cultivated at present (Supplementary Fig. 7).

The projected effects of climate change on crop yields vary around the world (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). Regions exhibit different initial climates and socioeconomic conditions and they experience different changes in temperature, precipitation and incomes. These in turn alter the environmental factors crops are exposed to and the adaptive decisions of producers. Our projections are deviations from local baseline yield trends, which have historically been positive30,35 and will probably remain generally positive (see the ‘Conclusions and discussion' section).

First, for all crops, temperature changes (through degree days and minimum temperature for rice and wheat) generally dominate the sign of local projected impacts. Precipitation strongly influences inter-annual variability in yields—which is important to producers, consumers and government planners—but does not generally drive overall trends. Global patterns in yield losses reflect the nonlinear response of crops to temperatures, with increasing extreme heat depressing yields and reductions in cold days increasing yields. Adaptive responses to rising average temperature moderate losses to extreme heat (for example, Extended Data Fig. 3a), consistent with producers taking protective measures in response to temperature extremes that are expected19. However, benefits from these protective measures are partially offset by decreased yield gains during moderate temperatures. The trade-off between temperature resilience and average yield has been documented and is understood to reflect physiological compromises across varietals19,36, although its potential global impact on future food production has not been previously demonstrated or quantified.

A second general pattern across several crops applies to equatorial regions of the world with high rainfall, including central Africa, Southeast Asia and South America. In these regions, the benefits of moderate temperatures are amplified by increasing levels of precipitation, driven by an intensifying water cycle37. Although rising temperatures may ultimately reduce yields in these regions, the benefits of high rainfall in these regions partially offset those effects.

Under a high-emissions scenario, our projected end-of-century maize yield losses are severe (about −40%) in the grain belt of the USA, Eastern China, Central Asia, Southern Africa and the Middle East (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). Losses in South America and Central Africa are more moderate (about −15%), mitigated in part by high levels of precipitation and increasing long-run precipitation (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Impacts in Europe vary with latitude, from +10% gains in the north to −40% losses along the Mediterranean. Gains in theoretical yield potentials occur in many northern regions in which maize is not widely grown (Supplementary Fig. 7).

The spatial distribution of soybean yield impacts is similar in structure to maize, although magnitudes are accentuated (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 7b and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11); for example, about −50% in the USA and about +20% in wet regions of Brazil under a high-emissions scenario.

High-emissions rice yield impacts are mixed in India and Southeast Asia, which lead global rice production, with small gains and losses throughout these regions. This regional result is broadly consistent with earlier work1. In the remaining rice-growing regions, central estimates are generally negative, with magnitudes in Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Central Asia exceeding −50% (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11).

Wheat losses are notably consistent across the main wheat-growing regions, with high-emissions yield losses of −15% to −25% in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Africa and South America and −30% to −40% in China, Russia, the USA and Canada (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). There are notable exceptions to these global patterns: wheat-growing regions of Western China exhibit both gains and losses, whereas wheat-growing regions of Northern India exhibit some of the most severe projected losses across the globe.

Cassava is projected to have uniformly negative projected impacts in nearly all regions in which it is grown at present, with the largest losses in Sub-Saharan Africa (−40% on average under a high-emissions scenario). Although cassava does not make up a large portion of global agricultural revenues, it is an important subsistence crop in low-income and middle-income countries. Thus, these yield losses may be a substantial future threat to the nutritional intake of the global poor (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 7e and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11).

Sorghum losses are widespread in almost all of the main regions in which it is grown at present: North America (−40%), South Asia (including India) (−10%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (−25%). Projected gains emerge in Western Europe (+28%) and Northern China (+3%) (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 7f and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11).

We compute aggregated global yield impacts based on the present distribution of global croplands, accounting for adaptation benefits and costs (Fig. 3a). For all crops except rice, we estimate that warming will likely reduce global yields by 2050 (probability of loss ranges from 0.701 (sorghum) to 0.946 (wheat), high-emissions scenario) after accounting for both statistical and climate model uncertainty. Central estimates for global end-of-century losses under the high-emissions/moderate-emissions scenarios (RCP 8.5/RCP 4.5) are −27.8%/−12.0% (P = 0.258/0.308) for maize, −6.0%/−1.1% (P = 0.477/0.475) for rice, −35.6%/−22.4% (P = 0.185/0.206) for soybean, −29.8%/−12.8% (P = 0.179/0.248) for cassava, −21.7%/−5.9% (P = 0.329/0.417) for sorghum and −28.2%/−13.5% (P = 0.038/0.058) for wheat. End-of-century uncertainty ranges may be substantial, with the largest 90% credible range for rice (q5 = −58.6%; q95 = 109.4%; RCP 8.5) and the narrowest range for wheat (q5 = −20.7%; q95 = −10.4%; RCP 4.5). These ranges allow for moderate likelihood that the impact of high emissions on global yields is positive for rice (probability = 0.477), maize (probability = 0.258), cassava (probability = 0.179) and sorghum (probability = 0.329) or more negative than −30% for rice (probability = 0.240), maize (probability = 0.417), sorghum (probability = 0.410), wheat (probability = 0.535), soybean (probability = 0.560) and cassava (probability = 0.481).

Box and whisker plots show total distribution of end-of-century projections accounting for joint statistical and climate model uncertainty (in each subplot: boxes, 25th to 75th percentiles; whiskers, 5th to 95th percentiles). To the right are projections adjusted for the estimated effect of CO2 fertilization from ref. 9 (shaded) and projections for moderate emissions (RCP 4.5) without CO2 fertilization (unshaded). See full results for moderate emissions in Supplementary Fig. 8, CO2 fertilization in Supplementary Information, section J, and uncertainty in Supplementary Figs. 4 (RCP 8.5) and 5 (RCP 4.5). b, Projected end-of-century yield impacts, by deciles of present-day average temperature over 24,378 regions. Impacts across crops weighted within region by cropped area and caloric content; distributions across regions weighted by total cropped area. c, As in b but by decile of present-day income. d, Empirical end-of-century global damage function describing calories (kcal) lost as a quadratic function of global mean surface temperature anomaly (ΔGMST). Each point represents a single climate-model-by-Monte Carlo run for RCP 4.5 (blue) or RCP 8.5 (red) in 2093–2097, including gains from CO2 fertilization. Grey bands indicate 10th–90th and 25th–75th quantile bands, conditional on ΔGMST. Bottom panel shows the distribution of warming under each RCP across 33 climate models and model surrogates (Supplementary Information, section G). Box plots to the right show distribution of damages collapsed to RCP. Right axis describes calorie losses normalized by 2015 global calorie production for the six crops studied here. Projected log(yield) impacts for panels a–c winsorized at the top and bottom 1% of the impacts distribution over all region–GCM–years, by RCP–crop, then converted to percentages.

Although the impact of heat on yields is nonlinear and pronounced for many crops (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4), global aggregate yields are not driven downward most strongly by the hottest regions of the world. Accounting for adaptation, we find that the middle 50% of regions with moderate average temperatures tend to suffer the largest yield losses (Fig. 3b). This is largely because hotter locations are already more adapted to heat, so further warming has a reduced impact, whereas cold locations benefit from warming. Furthermore, high average rainfall, prevalent in many hot locations, is linked to increased gains from moderate warming (Extended Data Figs. 3b and 4b). This finding underscores the importance of accounting for real-world patterns of differentiated adaptation in global-scale analyses.

Our projections suggest that changes in global yields affect populations around the world unequally. We estimate that total calorie production is generally affected more heavily by climate change in regions that are richer today (Fig. 3c), along with the lowest-income decile owing to its reliance on cassava. We estimate average losses of 28% in the lowest-income decile but more moderated losses of roughly 18% across deciles 2–8. In the highest-income deciles, average losses increase to 29% (ninth) and 41% (top). This result is partially because lower-income populations tend to live in hotter climates, in which present adaptation rates are higher, and in the tropics, in which high average precipitation reduces warming impacts (Fig. 3b). This has important implications for global damages, as high-income regions include many of the world's breadbaskets. Because relative yield losses are greatest in regions in which modern agriculture is concentrated, they have amplified influence on global caloric production under climate change.

We combine our projections across all six crops to estimate the total potential impact of warming on global caloric production (Methods and Supplementary Information, sections B and K). Following the approach in refs. 28,29,34, we index lost calorie production against ΔGMST for each climate model. We recover a damage function describing the joint distribution of ΔGMST and lost calorie production for these six staple crops in each 5-year moving window of the twenty-first century (Fig. 3d). We estimate that the magnitude of impacts to present croplands increases nearly linearly at a rate of −5.54 × 1014 kcal (P < 0.001, 95% credible interval −5.63 to −5.44 × 1014 kcal) of calorie production per +1 °C in GMST in 2100 (see Supplementary Fig. 21 for other decades), amounting to approximately −121 kcal per day per 1 °C per person based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3 (SSP3) 2100 global population projections, or −4.4% of present per capita recommended consumption per 1 °C. (For example, warming of 4 °C in GMST in 2100 would correspond to a loss of about 17.6% of present per capita recommended consumption).

In contrast to previous global analyses7,8, projections here account for producer adaptation rates that reflect observed behaviour. We find that accounting for climate adaptation, its costs and rising incomes have substantial impact on high-emissions projections for all crops and regions (Table 1). We estimate that development and adaptive adjustments reduce global calorie impacts (relative to a ‘no adaptation' scenario) by roughly 23% in 2050 (column 1a versus 1b, Table 1, 6% for moderate emissions) and 34% at the end of the century (column 2a versus 2b, 12% for moderate emissions), owing to the growing extent of adjustment under greater climatic change. The relative impact of adaptation is largest for rice (79% reduction of end-of-century impacts, 86% for moderate emissions) and smallest for wheat (statistically unchanged) (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). Adaptation and development exacerbate average wheat losses from climate change (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Tables 10 and 11) because wheat producers are observed to take on further weather-related risk as GDP per capita rises (Supplementary Information, section G), resulting in small losses from adaptation and development for Europe and Oceania (Table 1). By contrast, the largest regional benefits of adaptation accrue to South America (61% reduction of end-of-century impacts, 23% for moderate emissions), mostly from maize and soybean adaptation gains. Our results indicate that producer adaptations are likely to have strong influence over climate change impacts to agriculture, highlighting the critical importance of accounting for these adaptations; however, our central estimates for the overall impact of climate change on potential production of staples remain negative and meaningful, even accounting for the net effects of adaptation. Substantial uncertainty persists in these estimates, originating from both econometric uncertainty and climate model uncertainty, such that overall risks should be assessed across the full range of projected impacts.

The above results do not account for CO2 fertilization, which is challenging to measure empirically. However, we adjust our results post-estimation to incorporate CO2 fertilization using previous estimates9 (Methods and Supplementary Information, section J). Adjusting for CO2 fertilization does not qualitatively alter the structure of our findings (Supplementary Figs. 13–18) but it does reduce the central estimate for end-of-century yield losses by 5.0– 9.5 percentage points (Fig. 3a) and increases the likelihood of positive aggregate effects. We do not account for the decreased crop nutrient content that might result from CO2 fertilization38.

Losses to future global yields can be incorporated into present-day climate policy, for example, by computing the net present value of future economic harms that result from the present emission of an extra ton of CO2, a value known as the social cost of carbon (SCC). We compute a component of the SCC—a ‘partial SCC'—that results from changes in global yields by integrating these projections into the Data-driven Spatial Climate Impact Model (DSCIM) developed in refs. 28,29 (Methods and Supplementary Information, section K). We assign country-specific average prices to total calorie production (Supplementary Fig. 20), allowing producers to intensify/reduce production to meet demand in their market at increasing marginal cost (Methods, Supplementary Information, section K, and Supplementary Fig. 19). In general, aggregate yield losses under climate change harm consumers as caloric consumption is lower and prices are higher; producers are also harmed by production losses, but these may be offset by gains from higher prices. In all scenarios, our approach implicitly allows the spatial distribution of within-crop varietals to adjust optimally within present cropped locations (Extended Data Fig. 1, Methods and Supplementary Information, section B). In some further scenarios, we deflate these estimates to account for the roles of crop switching and international trade, which might cause the spatial distribution of planting areas to shift (Methods and Supplementary Information, section K).

Across different modelling assumptions, the partial SCC for the crops we study ranges from $0.99 per ton of CO2 (5% constant discounting; adjusted for flexible crop switching, movement of cropped land and international trade; moderately elastic demand and supply; frictionless trade within countries; RCP 8.5) to $49.48 per ton (Ramsey discounting39; crop type and land distributions mirror present day; moderately elastic demand and supply; frictionless trade within countries; RCP 8.5). See Extended Data Table 3 and Supplementary Table 13 for all partial SCC estimates.

Our analysis of staple crops is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to quantify the adaptations of real-world producers to climate around the world and to apply these measurements to projections of global agricultural damages from climate change. Our econometric results complement a well-developed literature from process-based models that resolve the underlying mechanics of crop production and some important forms of adaptation but which take producer decision rules as exogenous7,8,18,20. Our results indicate a substantial and statistically significant rate at which ΔGMST reduces the ability of present global food systems to produce calories, net of adaptation. However, in the absence of adaptation, we project that agricultural outcomes would be materially worse.

Our findings indicate that projected consumption losses tend not to be evenly distributed across global populations. Wealthy regions of the world more easily absorb grain price shocks. In poor regions of the world, food shortages and associated price shocks may be more destabilizing. This suggests that future modelling efforts would benefit from representing realistic costs and benefits of adaptation, imperfect information and other aspects of producer decision-making. We expect that these changes would lead to projections of climate impacts to agriculture that are less optimistic than those assuming agronomically optimal management7 and more optimistic than models that do not model adaptation at all2.

A key finding is that global populations exhibit extensive adaptation to climate already, especially in relatively low income and hot regions of the world—with the exception of the world's poorest, who depend heavily on cassava and face higher potential losses (Fig. 3b,c, Supplementary Information, section I.3 and Supplementary Fig. 9). We also observe that breadbaskets of the world, in which the climate is moderate, exhibit more limited adaptation at present. Because such a large fraction of agricultural production is concentrated in these wealthy-but-low-adaption regions, they dominate projections of global calorie production, generating much of the global food security risk we document. This result is consistent with earlier regional findings that US crop systems are optimized for high average yields but not robustness to climatic changes36 and that projected maize losses in Sub-Saharan Africa are largest in the most productive and climatically moderate countries, whereas countries with hotter present-day climates have lower historical yields and smaller projected yield losses40.

Our projection of productivity declines under climate change contrasts with process-based model results that are calibrated to experimental farms, use researcher-defined adaptation rules and generally tend to indicate productivity gains globally (ref. 8 is an important exception). For example, ensemble mean projections of AgMIP process-based models indicate end-of-century productivity gains for maize (+1.3%, RCP 8.5), wheat (+9.9%), soybean (+15.3%) and rice (+23.3%)7. These differ substantially from the generally negative impacts we predict, with central end-of-century estimates that range from −35.6% (soybean) to −6.0% (rice) (Supplementary Table 10; RCP 8.5), although both sets of projections exhibit large uncertainties. A comparison of model skill over historical data suggests that the statistical approach of this paper outperforms the AgMIP ensemble across crops and locations (Extended Data Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Information, section F) and accurately captures observed variation in local yields (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6 and Supplementary Information, section F). These differences highlight the importance of using globally representative data and accounting for empirically measured rates of adaptive behaviours in projections of climate change damages. Unlike process-based crop models, our estimates do not provide insight about the agronomic mechanisms through which climatic changes influence future yields. Such insight is useful in guiding agricultural innovation and, indeed, process-based models are used at present in a Genotype by Environment by Management (GxExM) framework to target crop science research about future climate stresses41,42,43,44. The work we present underscores the urgency and importance of such crop technology developments and the importance of ensuring access to adaptive technologies by global producers broadly.

Future producer adaptation to climate change may differ from the historically observed patterns we recover. For example, technological breakthroughs, such as the industrial fixation of nitrogen, transformed what is understood about the limit of global productivity. However, the repeatability and penetration of these innovations has been uneven and perhaps should be interpreted cautiously—for example, synthetic fertilizers remain incompletely deployed despite their invention long ago45 and progress towards heat tolerance for some staple crops has stalled46. Furthermore, to the extent that these advances are correlated with income, our projections implicitly account for them. Notably, innovation has contributed positively to average yield trends in many regions30,35, which will probably continue into the future in some form. Our projected yield impacts should therefore be interpreted as deviations from a future trend in average yields that is driven by other factors, including innovation. Indeed, our findings provide a sense of the scale required of such innovations to maintain global food security.

Finally, our monetization of agricultural damages from climate change is limited, as it does not capture the impact of all future changes, such as linkages between climate change, food availability and social instability10,15. Nonetheless, synthesizing the complex global response of agriculture into a partial SCC is an important step towards representing these damages in climate policies47. Comparison of our partial SCC with existing estimates provides context for these findings. The Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution (FUND) model reports a partial SCC for agriculture of −$2.70 per ton CO2 (ref. 48) using a 3% discount rate (that is, warming improves global welfare through agriculture). Because this value relies on older (pre-2000) studies for calibration49, Moore et al.9 construct a revised estimate based on a meta-analysis of previous estimates8, mostly from process-based models. Inserting these projections into a computable general equilibrium model for 16 regions, Moore et al.9 estimate a partial SCC of $13.05 per ton (adjusted to the USD in 2023), opposite in sign from the original FUND partial SCC. Because this estimate is derived from process-based models, it does not account for observed rates of producer-level adaptation and it is two to five times larger than the range of our comparable estimates, $3.08–$6.84 (3% discount rate; Extended Data Table 3), that do account for autonomous adaptation. We note that, in a recent paper50, researchers incorporate the Moore et al.9 results directly into the Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) integrated assessment model and find that climate damages to the agricultural sector increase to $84. The discussion of that paper focuses on other aspects of the analysis and does not detail why this estimate changed. Also, neither Moore et al.9 nor this study account for non-staple crops or livestock, an important area for future work, and neither estimate accounts for the unequal impact of crop losses on the global poor (Fig. 3c), for whom lost agricultural revenues and/or consumption may be particularly damaging10,14,15. In continuing work51, we seek to more fairly represent these unequal costs in global estimates of monetized damages.

This section provides an overview of the data and methods used to estimate the relation between agricultural yields and variation in weather, accounting for adaptation to climate and economic development.

Subnational yields, production and harvested area, primarily at the second administrative level, were collected from the statistical offices of 54 countries (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). This includes data that were generously shared for Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand52 and Zambia53. This yields a dataset for 6 crops in 12,658 locations (41,186 location–crop pairs) spanning up to 137 years. Wheat varietals, when not identified in the data, were manually assigned to spring or winter wheat based on ancillary country-specific data (Supplementary Table 6). All growing season definitions are from ref. 54 and held fixed. Detailed information is provided in Supplementary Information, section A.

The main weather dataset used in this analysis is the Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset (GMFD v1)55. Data are available on a 0.25° × 0.25°-resolution grid from 1948 to 2010. We obtain daily maximum and minimum temperatures and daily total precipitation for all grid cells globally. These data provide surface temperature and precipitation information using a combination of observations and reanalysis, which is downscaled and bias-corrected using several station-based observational datasets to remove biases in monthly temperature and precipitation.

We use the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) Global Daily Downscaled Projections (GDDP) dataset for future projections of climate change. This comprises 21 climate projections, which are downscaled to 0.25° × 0.25° resolution56 from global climate model (GCM) runs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive57. NEX-GDDP uses GMFD55 and quantile mapping to adjust the GCM outputs (means and variances) in historical and future time periods so that the systemic bias of the GCMs is removed. In contrast to other approaches58, NEX-GDDP does not assume a common distribution shape between observed (GMFD) and GCM data. However, NEX-GDDP only assumes that GMFD (versus GCM) variances are correct, which other approaches58 do not require. Climate is projected under emissions from Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) up to 2100 (refs. 59,60), although the NEX-GDDP outputs of some models lack precipitation data past 2098, so that the ‘end of the century' in this paper is the year 2098. The CMIP5 ensemble of GCMs is not a systematic sample of possible futures. To provide an ensemble of climate projections with a probability distribution of GMSTs consistent with that estimated by a probabilistic simple climate model, we use the method outlined in ref. 61 to assign probabilistic weights to climate projections. A full list of models and their weights is given in Supplementary Table 9. For a more complete description, see ref. 29.

We obtain national and subnational income data for 1,503 administrative regions from 83 countries from ref. 62. Data are provided by ref. 62 at the state/province level for each country. We use these subnational data to allocate national GDP data from the Penn World Tables (PWT) database (https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/) under the assumption that the within-country distributions of GDP recorded in ref. 62 are accurate, but the exact levels may not be. Using these data, we construct a consistent panel of subnational incomes for all areas in our crop dataset that sum to the national GDP from the PWT database for all countries in the sample.

Future projections of national incomes are derived from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ENV-Growth model63 and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) GDP model64, as part of the ‘socioeconomic conditions' of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)65. These are the only models that provide GDP per capita projections for a wide range of countries in the SSP database. The SSPs propose a set of plausible scenarios of socioeconomic development over the twenty-first century in the absence of climate impacts and policy. Data are interpolated to annual frequency and downscaled following ref. 29.

We obtain data on the area equipped for irrigation from AQUASTAT of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)66. These data are a single cross-section centred around the year 2000 at 0.08° × 0.08° resolution and we hold the values fixed in climate projections. (Increases in incomes and heat exposure may drive increases in future irrigation, whereas aquifer and reservoir drawdown may drive decreases in future irrigation).

We develop a reduced-form approach to modelling crop yields and producer adaptation, allowing us to recover plausibly causal effects of weather on yields based on data from real-world farms, without having to observe all of the biophysical processes in a given crop that mediate these effects. The approach allows us to account for the total costs and benefits of numerous real-world adaptive adjustments that producers undertake, without requiring that we observe or model each adjustment explicitly. This approach builds on ideas and techniques developed in refs. 4,19,26,27, using the method for capturing the benefits of adaptation in ref. 28 and accounting for its costs based on the revealed preference approach in ref. 29. Following common practice in the literature2, our implementation also allows our model to recover local, micro level and instantaneous nonlinear effects of environmental conditions, even though outcome data are only observed at more aggregate spatial scales and temporal frequencies28,31.

We apply cross-validation techniques common in machine learning but adapted for model selection in a causal inference context. Our approach has three stages: (1) we remove variation that is associated with non-parametric controls to condition out the influence of unobservables; (2) we apply cross-validation to this residualized data to select weather measures; and (3) we again apply cross-validation, modifying the model chosen in the previous step to select dimensions of climate that matter for adaptation. We perform the sequence (1)–(3) for each of the six crops separately to identify the most suitable model for each crop. Having selected and fitted an empirical model that accounts for weather and adaptation, we then apply the model in projections of climate change impacts. Each of these steps is detailed below.

A large number of candidate weather variables are constructed from raw weather data based on previous literature5,67,68,69,70,71. We assemble variables that previous analyses report were influential for at least one crop, although individual variables might not ultimately be included in the specification for all or any crops. All weather transformations were conducted at the pixel level using daily data before aggregation, unless otherwise specified. Encoding pixel-by-day weather data after nonlinear transformations allows a high degree of flexibility in how local daily weather conditions can have an instantaneous and nonlinear impact on crops28,31. This means that even short periods of environmental stress are resolved and captured by these variables and the model. Degree day terms were constructed following ref. 5, with kink points selected for each crop by a tenfold cross-validation search over potential kinks. Growing-season-phase precipitation was summed within month by grid cell and then transformed70. Construction of vapour pressure deficit followed ref. 69. The count of rain days was calculated by grid cell as days with positive precipitation68. Extreme rain was identified by constructing the 1980–2010 rainfall distribution for each grid cell in the GMFD daily precipitation data and aggregating the amount of rainfall or number of days of rainfall in excess of the 95th percentile of this distribution68. Count of extreme rain days was measured following extreme rain except grid cell days were counted instead of summed within grid cell68. Drought was defined as a binary indicator over administrative unit growing season precipitation, using a tenfold cross-validation search over percentile cut-offs in the administrative unit growing season total precipitation distribution, largely following ref. 71 (final cut-offs ranged from the 8th to 25th percentiles). Minimum temperatures were calculated as the average of daily grid cell minimum temperatures within each month, following ref. 67. For all weather terms, weighting and aggregation to administrative units were done as described in ref. 29 with cropped area weights from ref. 54. See Supplementary Information, section D and Supplementary Tables 2–5 for full details on the construction of each weather variable.

We first select non-parametric controls for unobservable factors to isolate plausibly random variation in our set of weather measures5,22,31. Specifically, we use administrative unit i (typically county), fixed effects \({\mu }_{i}\), absorbing time-invariant confounds such as soil quality; country–year fixed effects \({\rho }_{ct}\), absorbing country-by-year price and trade policy confounds; and state or province quadratic time trends \({h}_{s}(t)\), absorbing slow-moving, local confounds such as the diffusion of new technologies or local variation in prices (equation (1), Supplementary equations (B.12) and (D.1)–(D.6)). We separately partial out the variation in yields yit and the vector of regressors xit on these non-parametric controls (Supplementary Information, section B), leaving us with residual variation \({\widetilde{y}}_{it}\) and \({\widetilde{{\bf{x}}}}_{it}\) for our cross-validation procedures.

We implement cross-validation over ten random folds to systematically evaluate the importance for yields of the broad range of weather measures previously described in the literature. Each potential model is required to have at least one temperature term and one moisture term. (Temperature and precipitation are known to be correlated, so causal effects estimation of one without controlling for the other is vulnerable to bias5. Vapour pressure deficit was treated as a moisture term. Note: these terms may affect moisture demand and/or soil moisture supply). Weather terms are each interacted with a fixed set of covariates: growing season average daily maximum temperature (‘long-run temperature', \(\overline{T}\)), growing season average monthly precipitation (‘long-run precipitation', \(\bar{P}\)), log(GDPpc) (‘income', \(\bar{I}\)) and the share of cropped area equipped for irrigation (‘irrigation', \(R\)). This ensures that weather variable selection occurs using models that are at least as flexible as those selected after the second cross-validation step, without having to simultaneously explore the full set of potential combinations of weather measures and covariate interactions (which would number 103,904 separate models). In selecting a candidate set of weather terms over which to study adaptation, we seek to optimize over parsimony and explanatory power, selecting a high-performing model in which additional weather terms do not individually contribute substantial fit gains (see Supplementary Tables 7 and 8).

Not all weather terms can be reliably projected by climate models72,73,74 and models containing these candidate variables were explored in the cross-validation procedure (Extended Data Fig. 2) but ultimately excluded in projections of climate change because they could not be projected with reasonably high confidence. Overall, this procedure evaluates the out-of-sample (OOS) performance of candidate models that include all combinations of weather variables that we draw from the literature and allows for varying degrees of nonlinearity (Fig. 1, Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2 and Supplementary Information, sections B–D).

In our second cross-validation step, we select a set of covariate interactions for which covariates reflect the factors that mediate producer adaptation actions4,19,26,27,75,76 (equation (B.7)). We take as given the set of weather parameters selected from the first step, allowing for interactions between weather variables and income, irrigation, \(\bar{T}\), \(\bar{P}\) and/or \(\bar{T}\times \bar{P}\). Further, we allow for the nonlinear precipitation response to vary over phases of the growing season or to be constant over the growing season, with ‘phases' of the growing season defined by a systematic model search (Supplementary Table 4). Finally, we also allow for interaction terms between degree day responses and monthly precipitation.

Accounting for mediating effects of income and irrigation is important because access to resources alters producer actions through several channels—such as access to technology77,78,79,80,81, insurance and credit markets77,80,82,83, inputs such as fertilizer77,84 or labour markets77,79,81 or information85. Notably, this minimizes confounding in our estimates, as resources and climate tend to be correlated (for example, poorer nations tend to be located in the tropics86) and it allows our model to capture that climate and income jointly determine yields87. Further, this allows us to project future changes associated with economic development.

In this step, we use cross-validation with ten folds over random blocks of data grouped by state/province. Here the test of model performance is the ability to model yields for a set of states or provinces that are held out of the data. This matches one of the intended uses of our interaction surface, which is to model the heterogeneous response of yields to weather for locations with no yield data available.

In our climate projections, long-run average precipitation (\(\bar{P}\)) values range more than 17 standard deviations outside the mean in our historical data. To prevent extrapolating adaptation behaviour to \(\bar{P}\) values far outside our data, we imposed a single-knot linear spline in \(\bar{P}\) for each weather measure (\({z}_{a}(\bar{{P}_{i}})\), \({z}_{b}(\bar{{P}_{i}})\) and \({z}_{c}(\bar{{P}_{i}})\) below). These knots were chosen using a within-R2 search over knot locations (Supplementary Information, section D). See Supplementary Information, sections B–D for further estimation details.

The final maize specification is:

with

in which yit is log(yields) in administrative unit i in year t, \({{\rm{DD}}}_{it}^{8-31}\) represents degree days from 8 °C to 31 °C, which is interacted with each of average growing season daily maximum temperature (\({\bar{T}}_{i}\)), splines in average growing season total precipitation (\({z}_{[\cdot ]}({\bar{P}}_{i})\)), the interaction between \({\bar{T}}_{i}\) and \({z}_{[\cdot ]}({\bar{P}}_{i})\), average log(GDPpc) (Ii) and area equipped for irrigation (Ri). The remaining weather terms have similar interactions. prcp_phase[j]it represents monthly precipitation summed within growing-season-phase j, for j ∈ {1, 2, 3}. μi, hs(t) and ρct are as described previously. Standard errors of all estimated parameters allow for the correlated nature of yields (and weather) across space and over time. Specifically, we estimate cluster-robust standard errors88, which allow arbitrary correlations across observations over time within first-level administrative units (that is, autocorrelations within and between counties within a given state) and across all observations within a given country–year. See ref. 31 for a discussion of this issue in this context. Note that the terms in equation (1) reflect rows (weather variables) and columns (mediating variables) illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1b. See Supplementary Information, section D, for full details of the final model specification for each crop.

We note that the overall fit of the above empirical model to the historical data is high, with an R2 of 0.85 for maize. For reference, the seminal analysis of maize by Schlenker and Roberts5 report a model R2 of 0.77 when modelling yields for only the Eastern United States, for which data quality is high relative to much of the globe and the underlying patterns of producer behaviour are probably more homogeneous across locations.

We are able to empirically observe the benefits of adaptive management among producing regions because adaptation decisions have costs19,26. If adaptations were free, then we would expect all regions to use uniform management practices and varieties using only the most climate-resilient technology available, as this strategy would convey benefits at no cost19,29. To capture the full impact of climate change on agricultural systems, it is therefore essential that these costs of adaptation are accounted for, as well as adaptation benefits, as these costs would not be incurred in the absence of climate change.

We cannot observe these costs directly but they can be inferred under the assumption that profit-maximizing producers undertake adaptations for which the benefits exceed costs, but not those for which costs exceed benefits29. This is referred to as a ‘revealed preference' approach and is widely used in economics research89. Specifically, we follow the approach developed in ref. 29 to track these costs for each crop and in each region until 2100 (see Supplementary Information, section H, for a derivation, Supplementary Fig. 6 for intuition and Supplementry equations (H.6) and (H.7) for a detailed example). We follow ref. 19 and deduct these costs from yield changes to develop a complete measure of climate change impacts29. Thus, our projections of climate change impacts on yields should be interpreted as capturing both the costs and the benefits of voluntary producer adaptations in each location.

Intuitively, consider the term \({\gamma }_{6}{\bar{T}}_{i}\) in equation (1), through which long-run average temperature in region i (\({\bar{T}}_{i}\)) modulates the negative effect of extreme heat shocks (\({{\rm{DD}}}_{it}^{31+}\)) on yields. A 1 °C increase in \({\bar{T}}_{i}\) flattens the negative extreme heat slope by γ6 log points per extreme heat degree day—a benefit of adaptation in hotter climates. If a producer in this example expects ten extreme heat degree days during the growing season, then the expected adaptation benefit for a 1 °C increase in \({\bar{T}}_{i}\) would be 10 × γ6 log points of yields. This benefit must not be costless, otherwise producers would have already adapted away all extreme heat yield losses. We thus infer marginal adaptation costs as equal to the marginal adaptation benefits that we estimate (an implication of assuming that producers maximize profits; see Supplementary Information, section H for details).

Many correlated aspects of weather affecting crop biophysical processes have been separately studied2,5,36,67,68,69,70,71,101,102,103 and we evaluate which are important drivers of the biophysical processes affecting yields of each crop. We use cross-validation to evaluate more than 8,000 candidate empirical models across all six crops, for which each model predicts residual changes in historical crop yields using a different combination of weather variables proposed by previous studies5,67,68,69,70,71. On the basis of OOS performance, we find that nonlinear degree days are the most important determinant of yields, on average across crops, by a considerable margin (Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2). Degree days increases model OOS fit (Supplementary Table 7) across crops by 51.7% on average (relative to the second-best model), with the largest gain for sorghum (101.6%, a doubling of model OOS fit) and the smallest gains for rice and cassava (9.1% and 9.4%). In general, exposure to cool daily temperatures (<9 °C for wheat and <29–31 °C for all other crops) modestly increase yields, whereas daily temperatures above these thresholds cause sharp declines in yields; for example, lowering end-of-season maize yields by −5% for each day that shifts from a 25 °C to a 40 °C day (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3). This finding generalizes previous results from the USA (for example, see ref. 5) globally and across crops.

Seasonal precipitation is the second most important determinant of yields across all crops, to the exclusion of a wide range of other candidate weather variables put forward in the literature (Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2). Nonlinear measures of seasonal precipitation increase model OOS fit across crops by 14.5%, with the largest gains for rice and maize (22.8% and 22.2%) and the smallest gains for wheat, soybean and sorghum (7.8%, 9.2% and 9.4%; Supplementary Table 8). Across crops, increasing seasonal monthly precipitation raises yields on average 0.2% per mm at low rainfall levels (<100 mm per month), has little effect at intermediate levels (250–300 mm per month) and reduces yields −0.6% per mm at higher levels (>400 mm per month; Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4).

In contrast to reports from individual empirical studies (for example, refs. 67,68,69,71), we find that monthly average minimum temperatures (tmin), vapour pressure deficit, drought, the count of rain days, the count of extreme rain days and the amount of extreme rain generally only contribute modest gains to yield model fits (average % gains in OOS fit range from 1.2% to 3.6% excluding drought for cassava, discussed below). Minimum temperatures are important predictors for rice and wheat yields but not other crops (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8).

There are exceptions for individual crops. Cassava yields are generally insensitive to weather overall (the maximum OOS variance predicted is 2.3%), motivating its cultivation in contexts in which the climate is not conducive to other staple crops that are more sensitive104. We find that growing season drought is the most important factor for predicting cassava yields (24.0% gain in variance predicted; Supplementary Table 7). Drought is also important for rice yields, as is the count of rain days (6.4% and 8.0% gain in variance predicted; Supplementary Table 7). The count of rain days is also moderately important for maize yields (6.6% gain in variance predicted; Supplementary Table 7). Taken together, these results indicate the importance of nuanced projections of future precipitation distributions for a restricted set of global staple crops.

We find that producers adapt to higher temperatures such that, across crops and around the world, yields are systematically less sensitive to daily temperature and generally more sensitive to seasonal precipitation in locations that are hotter on average (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs. 1b, 3a,e and 4a,e). Similarly, yields are less responsive to temperature and more responsive to precipitation in locations that are drier on average (Extended Data Figs. 1b, 3b,f and 4b,f). Because climate-associated adaptations influence numerous—possibly correlated—aspects of weather–crop responses, we estimate the mediating influence of all dimensions of climate simultaneously on all dimensions of weather for each crop, generating a multidimensional function describing these interacting relationships (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). This function serves as the basis for projecting adaptation to climate change (Methods and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5) and has not been previously represented in global process-based models7,8.

We also find that rising incomes enable producers to respond to environmental conditions in important but varied ways, thereby mediating the effects of different climates. For example, maize and sorghum yields become more sensitive to temperature as incomes rise, whereas rice and cassava become less sensitive (Extended Data Figs. 1b and 3c). These differences could be because of differences in how access to improved technologies, infrastructure, banking and credit or insurance77,78,80,82 influence producer strategies77,83. Notably, however, we find that higher incomes and access to irrigation are associated with greater resilience to precipitation extremes across all crops (Extended Data Figs. 1b, 3g and 4g), consistent with access to improved irrigation technologies increasing with income77,80.

We integrate our econometric results with the DSCIM28,29 to develop projections and partial SCC estimates (Supplementary Information, section K.5). Calculations were conducted as described in refs. 28,29, over 24,378 geographically granular regions, 33 climate models and 1,920 Monte Carlo draws of statistical uncertainty per crop. Following ref. 29, we project the impacts of climate change net of adaptation and its costs, relative to a counterfactual in which incomes grow but the climate is held fixed. Projections in percentage terms represent weighted averages of log yield estimates, converted to percentages. Crop impacts are aggregated over space using cropped area weights (Supplementary Information, section A), over climate models using surrogate model mixed ensemble61 weights (Supplementary Table 9) and over crops using calorie weights90. Yield gains from CO2 fertilization are difficult to empirically quantify91,92,93,94 but we adjust our projections to incorporate CO2 fertilization using previous estimates9. Yield projections are robust to restricting future weather projections to be bound within the support of the historical data (Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Fig. 12). See Supplementary Information, section G for full details of the projection methodology.

To calculate a partial SCC, we must value climate-induced changes in yields for both producers and consumers (Supplementary Figs. 19 and 21). Our approach to this valuation follows ref. 95 and models consumers and producers of calories with constant elasticity of demand and supply, drawing elasticities from the literature95,96,97. We allow for frictionless crop trade within country but do not allow for trade between countries. We test sensitivity to this assumption by allowing frictionless trade between countries within continents and throughout the globe. We consider the potential impacts of crop switching, shifting of cropped areas and international trade by drawing on the previous model-based literature75,98,99,100. In calculating the SCC, we follow ref. 28 to calculate results for constant discount rates (2%, 2.5%, 3%, 5%) and refs. 28,47 for Ramsey discounting (ρ = 0, η = 2). See Supplementary Information, section K, for full details of the valuation methodology.

A challenge to this analysis is the limited way in which future resource access has been projected105, that is, relying on standardized scenarios contained in the SSPs65. Numerous types of resources probably influence how staple crops are managed. However, we restricted our analysis to consider only the mediating effects of income and irrigation. We treat income as a proxy measure for access to resources associated with economic development, such as fertilizer or extension services. These variables are intentionally omitted from regression models so that their influence will be captured by the income variable, allowing them to be represented in standard socioeconomic projections for which income is projected and available to us, but these other variables are not65. Mediating effects of irrigation are accounted for explicitly because they are influential and irrigation presence is dependent on groundwater geology, local topography and surface water flows, which are not well captured by income nor climate measures. An important area for future work is to develop projections of irrigation for use in crop yield projections.

Another challenge is that our measures of climate used to estimate adaptation are cross-sectional; thus, correlations between climate and omitted variables that determine the shape of the yield–weather response could potentially bias our estimates of adaptation. If such correlations exist, they might be regional in nature or otherwise only affect limited subsamples of our data. As a partial test of this possibility, we examine non-parametric estimates of the association between climate and temperature sensitivity and find that the associations we rely on are systematic throughout the data (Supplementary Fig. 3). This suggests that any unknown omitted variable would have to be consistently correlated with climate throughout our sample to influence our analysis.

We are able to account for some, but not all, potential shifts in crop growing seasons under future climate change. Our parameterization of adaptation implicitly captures effects of shifting the harvest date earlier in the growing season (for example, to avoid late-season heat exposure; see Supplementary Information, section B). However, we cannot capture the effects of planting dates that may shift to a period before the start of our growing season windows nor can we capture crop switching in our yield models (although we do capture it in the valuation of impacts; see Supplementary Information, section K). We note that such shifts may not depend only on temperatures but also on rainfall quantity and timing, which are not yet well modelled by existing GCMs72,73,74. These are forms of adaptation that some process-based models explicitly include7,8,9,18,106,107,108. Furthermore, unlike process-based models, our reduced-form approach by design does not capture the agronomic mechanisms by which climatic changes influence future yields. Such mechanistic insights can be used to guide crop research in expectation of future climate stresses41,42,43,44, highlighting an important trade-off in the two methodological approaches (Supplementary Information, section B.1).

For precipitation effects, we do not project some extreme precipitation effects because these precipitation extremes are not well captured by the existing suite of GCMs72,73,74. We highlight this as an area of need for future research from the climate modelling community, with potentially important implications for our further understanding of climate change impacts to global food security.

Also, we note that our valuation of agricultural damages from climate change and the partial SCC only accounts for the crops in our sample, which account for a large share of global calories but a smaller share of total agricultural revenues. The present analysis does not include effects of climate change on other sources of agricultural revenue, such as livestock, citruses and other specialty crops. We look to future work to incorporate these output categories.

For each staple crop, cross-validation is used to first select key weather variables that influence yields (rows) and then applied to select mediating variables that capture adaptation or resource access (columns). Each selected mediating variable interacts with each selected weather variable. All observations are residualized before model selection, to remove cross-sectional and time series confounders. All candidates models are tested for each crop; a and b illustrate the process only for maize. a, First step: cross-validation is used to select weather variables that influence maize (see Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3 for all crops). Top panel (blue) shows the unconditional distribution of OOS root-mean-squared error (RMSE) for all candidate models. Subsequent rows show pairs of conditional distributions that partition the sample. Green distributions depict model performance for all model permutations that include the indicated weather variable; grey distributions represent all model permutations that exclude the weather variable. Vertical lines indicate average values for each distribution. Strongly non-overlapping distributions indicate that models including the weather variable systematically tend to outperform those that exclude it. Fully overlapping distributions indicate that the indicated weather variable used to stratify models does not improve model fit. Weather terms with black stars were retained in the maize model. b, Second step: using cross-validation to select mediating variables that capture adaptation to climate (for example, average temperature) or resource access (for example, GDP per capita). Candidate mediating variables are all interacted with weather variables from a. Sub-panels depict the mediating influence of the these factors (columns) on the response to weather variables (rows). Grey panels indicate pairs of variables that are not selected for the final model. Colours indicate a weather response that is empirically recovered for a lower (blue) or upper (red) tercile, although actual model specifications are continuous interactions. All coefficients and interactions are estimated simultaneously from a single joint model. Standard errors robust88 to autocorrelation over time within first-level administrative units (for example, states) and across all units within country–year. c, Similar to b but indicating weather-mediating variable pairs selected in the final model (white squares) for each crop.

The top row shows the kernel density of model OOS root-mean-squared error values for each crop; subsequent rows show conditional densities for each weather term. Pink represents all model permutations including the given weather term; grey represents all model permutations excluding the given term. Black bars indicate the average fit difference from including the term and red stars indicate significance (P < 0.05, t-test). Weather terms with black stars were carried forward to the next cross-validation procedure. The bottom four rows represent weather terms that cannot be reliably projected by existing climate models72,73,74.

Empirically estimated temperature and precipitation response surfaces, by crop and by adaptation parameter. Columns are crops, rows are adaptation parameters (covariates). Yellow: all covariates evaluated at the sample mean; blue: covariate of interest evaluated at its lower tercile; red: covariate of interest evaluated at its upper tercile. Note that the top panel includes an extra column for rice (tmin). Also note that cassava does not include irrigation in the model, thus no irrigation interaction effects are plotted for this crop. Standard errors robust88 to correlated shocks within state over space and time and within country–year. See Extended Data Fig. 4 for wheat.

Empirically estimated temperature and precipitation response surface for wheat, by adaptation parameter. Columns are seasons, rows are adaptation parameters (covariates). Yellow: all covariates evaluated at the sample mean; blue: covariate of interest evaluated at its lower tercile; red: covariate of interest evaluated at its upper tercile. Standard errors robust88 to correlated shocks within state over space and time and within country–year.

Crop yields observed in our data (‘Observed') versus those predicted by our model when dropping country–year fixed effects from estimation (‘Fitted'). The dotted red line is the y = x line; perfect fitted values would lie on this line. The distribution of fitted values around this line indicates that our modelled yields are, on average, unbiased. Fitted yields in levels converted from logs accounting for the non-zero expectation of the log error term. Data winsorized at the 99th percentile for visual clarity. Horizontal banding in some plots associated with known data issues in some countries.

Comparison of modelled versus observed yields for many regions of the world. Red dots are observed values, blue dots are modelled values. Rows are crops. Column 1 plots data for the region with average yield at the 95th percentile of yields in the data (by crop), column 2 the 95th percentile of cropped area, column 3 the 5th percentile of yields and column 4 the 5th percentile of cropped area. Yields originally modelled in logs and converted to levels accounting for the non-zero expectation of the exponentiated error term. 95% confidence intervals are asymmetric owing to conversion to levels and top-coded in some cases for visual clarity. The y-axis scale is consistent within crop (rows).

Metrics details

Each spring, billions of Bogong moths escape hot conditions across southeast Australia by migrating up to 1,000 km to a place that they have never previously visited—a limited number of cool caves in the Australian Alps, historically used for aestivating over summer1,2. At the beginning of autumn, the same individuals make a return migration to their breeding grounds to reproduce and die. Here we show that Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby navigating in their inherited migratory direction towards their distant goal. By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator3,4,5, we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth's known magnetic sense4), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions. Visual interneurons in different regions of the moth's brain responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation, firing maximally when the moth was headed southwards. Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth's magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination.

The Bogong moth (Agrotis infusa; Fig. 1a) is an iconic and threatened migratory insect endemic to Australia. During the austral spring, newly eclosed Bogong moths make a highly directed migration of up to 1,000 km to a geographically restricted assemblage of high alpine caves in the extreme southeast of the country (Fig. 1b), a place that they have never previously visited. After 3–4 months of dormancy (aestivation; Fig. 1c), the same individuals return to their breeding grounds during autumn to reproduce, after which they die1,2. We have recently shown4 that these moths steer flight during the long-distance phase6 of their migration by sensing the Earth's magnetic field and correlating its inherent directional information with one or more visual landmarks, potentially using these landmarks as temporary orientation beacons along the route. However, exactly which natural visual features are used by Bogong moths for navigation remains unclear. A dark feature on the nocturnal horizon, one or more stars, or the moon are all possible cues. In the austral night sky, the constellations of stars and the bright Milky Way are particularly prominent and have excellent potential as reliable navigational cues7,8. Their predictable celestial positions over the course of each night make stellar cues useful for determining an arbitrary compass direction for short-range orientation (for example, for dung beetles9,10,11 and cricket frogs12) and as a geographically relevant compass for long-range navigation (for example, for birds13,14, humans15,16 and possibly seals17). However, to our knowledge, no invertebrate is currently known to use the stars for discerning specific geographical directions (that is, a direction relative to north) for directed long-range navigation to a distant goal. Here we show that moths have this ability and use the stars as a compass during the long-distance phase6 of their migration to determine and follow an inherited migratory bearing, reversing this bearing when the season changes. Moreover, we show that visual interneurons in the moth's brain are tuned to specific orientations of the night sky, suggesting their involvement in a stellar compass network.

Using a light trap located at Mount Selwyn, about 70 km north-northeast of the main alpine aestivation sites in southeast New South Wales, we captured migrating Bogong moths departing northwards during their autumn return migration (Fig. 1b). Captured moths were transferred to our nearby experimental site and tethered and flown within a modified Mouritsen–Frost flight simulator3,4,5 that continuously measured the instantaneous orientations of vigorously flying moths that were free to turn in any azimuthal direction (details of the simulator, the tethering and the criteria used to select moths for analysis are provided in the Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1). To test whether Bogong moths fly in their inherited migratory directions under natural night skies, two transparent ultraviolet (UV)-transmissive non-magnetic cylindrical flight simulator arenas were placed on an open hilltop (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Moths tethered within the arena had a full view of the surrounding landscape (meadows, trees and hills) as well as of the entire dome of the night sky. They also experienced the natural geomagnetic field.

If Bogong moths use the stars for maintaining a geographically specific, inherited migratory heading, they need to deal with the seasonal differences in the appearance of the stars (Fig. 3a), as well as with the nightly movements of the stars across the sky that result from the rotation of the Earth. Such movements substantially shift and rotate the stripe of the Milky Way and the positions of the stars as the night progresses, therefore creating a potential problem for migrating animals that rely on them to navigate a straight course. Early during the night (20:49 ± 17 min), under a cloudless autumn starry sky with a waxing gibbous half-full moon, moths flown in the two arenas were significantly oriented northward, in their expected migratory direction (Fig. 2a; n = 95, α = 5°). When tested 3 h later (23:42 ± 17 min), when the stars and the moon had shifted substantially (and the sky was still cloudless), the same cohort of moths (which had been swapped between arenas to eliminate landmarks as possible cues) retained their northward orientation (Fig. 2b; n = 95, α = 355°), with their earlier and later mean orientation directions being indistinguishable (likelihood-ratio test on population means for all 95 moths, early versus late: χ2 = 2.663, d.f. = 1, P = 0.103). If one exclusively considers moths that were highly oriented both earlier and later in the evening (r > 0.8 in both trials: 35 out of 95 moths), this finding is only reinforced (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Thus, Bogong moths not only orient in their expected migratory direction under natural night skies, but they also do so despite the nightly movements of the stars and moon.

The dim pattern of polarized light18 associated with the moon is also a potential compass cue. Lunar polarized light is used by nocturnal dung beetles for straight-line orientation19 but, when the moon is absent, they instead revert to the Milky Way, and are disoriented when the sky is obscured by clouds9. However, substantial migrations of Bogong moths also occur around the new moon (E.W. and B.F., unpublished data), implying that, if polarized light is used as a compass cue, it is not essential.

Notably, on nights on which the moon and stars were obscured by heavy cloud, Bogong moths were still oriented in a northward direction (Fig. 2c; n = 44, α = 13°), with a mean orientation direction that was not significantly different to either of the two mean directions (Fig. 2a,b) recorded on clear nights (likelihood-ratio tests comparing mean orientation direction in Fig. 2c with those in Fig. 2a,c: χ2 = 0.007 and 0.242, d.f. = 1, P = 0.935 and 0.886, respectively). Thus, even when the stars and moon are unavailable, Bogong moths can still navigate in their inherited migratory direction, strongly suggesting reliance on the only known remaining compass cue—the Earth's magnetic field.

The most parsimonious explanation for these results is that, in overcast conditions, Bogong moths rely on the geomagnetic field as their compass for navigation, which raises the critical question of whether Bogong moths use a stellar compass at all.

To investigate whether Bogong moths use a stellar compass, we captured Bogong moths at Mount Selwyn that were migrating roughly southwards into the Australian Alps in spring and back northward during autumn (Fig. 1b). Moths were transferred to a purpose-built dark ferromagnetic-free laboratory at our field site and tethered and flown in a flight simulator (details of the laboratory are provided in the Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1c–i). The simulator arena was placed at the centre of a three-axis Helmholtz coil system that was used to null (that is, remove) the Earth's magnetic field and therefore disable the influence of the moth's magnetic sense. Moths were subjected to a natural clear moonless austral night sky (matching the date and time of the experiment) projected at natural intensity onto a flat screen placed on top of the dark-walled arena (Fig. 3a) and their flights were recorded for 5 min.

Under naturally oriented night skies (geographical north 0°; Fig. 3a) and in the absence of a magnetic field, moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions4 during two springs and two autumns in 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 3c): roughly southwards in spring (n = 70, mean vector direction α = 168°) and north-northwest in autumn (n = 54, α = 341°). Under the natural sky stimulus rotated by 180° (arena-centric geographical north now at 180°), the moths flew in almost exactly the opposite direction (Fig. 3d), turning by 187° in spring (n = 68, α = 355°) and by 174° in autumn (n = 56, α = 167°). When the stars of the natural sky were randomly distributed (identical light intensity, no directional information: Fig. 3b), moths were disoriented in both seasons (spring: Fig. 3e, n = 58; autumn: Fig. 3f, n = 49). Full statistics are provided in Extended Data Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 1. Moth flight directions during spring and autumn, and under rotated and unrotated skies in either season, were significantly different (Mardia–Watson–Wheeler tests; Extended Data Fig. 2g). These results show that Bogong moths can use the distribution of stars within the austral night sky alone as a navigational compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby determining their required migratory direction, during both their southward spring migration and their northward autumn migration. When these stars were rearranged randomly, this ability disappears. Apart from humans15,16 and several night-migratory songbirds6,13,14, to our knowledge, no other animal is known to use the stars to navigate in a specific geographical direction. Birds use the centre of stellar rotation to determine north or south6,13,14 and, if Bogong moths do the same, this might explain their ability to hold an inherited migratory course despite the nightly movements of the stars (Fig. 2a,b). Alternatively, Bogong moths might possess a time-compensated star compass that can account for the predictable movements of the stars, analogous to the time-compensated sun compass of Monarch butterflies3. However, exactly which aspects of the starry sky are used by Bogong moths remains to be determined.

In summary, our behavioural results demonstrate that Bogong moths, like night-migratory birds20, use a stellar compass and a geomagnetic compass and, like birds6,21, remain oriented in their inherited migratory direction when at least one is available, either the natural stars alone (Fig. 3c,d) or the Earth's magnetic field alone (Fig. 2c). When neither cue is available the moths are disoriented (Fig. 3e,f).

To explore the neural basis of the Bogong moth's stellar compass, we recorded intracellularly from visual neurons in three regions of the Bogong moth brain22,23: the optic lobe, the central complex (CX; the insect navigation centre24) and the lateral accessory lobes (LAL; the steering centre25). We measured neural responses to the same stimuli that induced behavioural responses in our laboratory flight experiments (dorsal starry sky, nulled magnetic field). Restrained moths were mounted in the apparatus with an eastward orientation relative to the initial starry sky. During experiments, we rotated the sky through 360° from this starting point. Impaled neurons (n = 28) revealed a peak spiking frequency at a specific sky rotation angle φmax (that is, at a specific compass direction of the moth; Fig. 4a). Their responses fell into four physiological categories: (1) unimodally excited; (2) unimodally inhibited; (3) rotation-direction-selective unimodal; or (4) rotation-direction-selective bimodal (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3). While unimodal neurons showed a single activity peak (maximal excitation or maximal inhibition), bimodal neurons showed two peaks separated by approximately 180°. Responses of neurons in categories 1 and 2 were largely insensitive to movement direction, with clockwise and anticlockwise sky rotations leading to similar responses. By contrast, category 3 and 4 neurons responded differently to clockwise and anticlockwise rotations. Despite the diversity of response types, φmax was consistent across repetitions, with the majority of cells having a tuning variability of 20° or less (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Figs. 4–6). However, when randomized stars (Fig. 3b) were rotated as a control, cells failed to show tuning (Figs. 4e and 5b). As the control shares local contrast and motion cues, its inability to drive the recorded neurons suggests that these neurons are not simply movement detectors but are tuned to features present in the natural starry sky.

a, Examples of general response categories (1–4) for 360° clockwise (CW; grey curves) and anticlockwise (CCW; purple curves) night sky stimulus rotations (mean ± s.d. tuning curves show spike impulses (imp) per s). In the moth's reference frame, flying under a natural (stationary) sky, 0° = 360° indicates that it is heading north; 90° indicates that it is heading east; 180° indicates that it is heading south; and 270° indicates that it is heading west. φmax is defined at the top (red dashed line). The horizontal dashed lines show the pre-stimulation response level. b, The φmax for all cells (note that bimodal cells have two φmax ≈ 180° apart; separate plots for all four cell categories are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3). The red vector gives the mean φmax (α) and the vector length (r) for all 18 unimodal cells (one-sided Rayleigh test, spring and autumn pooled, P = 0.00319; 95% confidence limits (black straight lines), ±35°). The dashed circles show the required r value for statistical significance: P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively for increasing radius. Unimodal cells fire maximally when moths head southwards (171° ± 35°) under natural skies (irrespective of season). c, The variability in φmax for successive clockwise (average 9°) or anticlockwise (average 10°) sky rotations in individual cells. d, φmax for dot and bar control stimuli in a subset of unimodal and bimodal cells (autumn 2020). The empty circles show the second φmax for bimodal cells. The bottom row shows the angular difference between the cell φmax for dot/bar stimuli and its starry sky φmax (quoted ± angular limits, dashed lines). e, The response SNR for different stimuli (grey dots, included data; black dots, outliers). For the box plots, the box limits show the 25th to 75th percentiles, the centre line shows the median value, and the whiskers extend to 1.5 × interquartile range. The SNR is the maximum response during sky rotation (that is at φ = φmax) divided by the standard error before rotation.

To further test the selectivity of these responses, a subset of six cells was also stimulated with artificial compass cues (of natural intensity) that mimicked aspects of the Milky Way (Fig. 4d): its brightest region around the Carina nebula (revolving dot) and its stripe-like shape (rotating bar). All but one of the cells responded to both cues (dot, n = 6; bar, n = 5) and these qualitatively resembled their response to the starry sky, with similar azimuthal tuning (deviations from starry sky φmax were clustered around 0° across neurons; Fig. 4d). Whereas the maximum deviation from the starry sky φmax was larger for the dot (52°) than the bar (15°), the responses to the bar were weaker than those to the starry sky or the dot (Fig. 4e). Thus, the bar more closely reflected the cell's azimuthal tuning to the starry sky, while the dot reflected its response strength. This suggests that these neurons are suited to encode at least two features of the starry sky: the extended shape of the Milky Way and its brightest region around the Carina nebula.

Notably, across the entire population of unimodal cells, φmax values consistently clustered in the Southern Hemisphere, independent of recording season or response type (Fig. 4b; n = 18, α = 171° ± 35°). Thus, in the reference frame of a Bogong moth flying under a natural (stationary) sky, unimodal cells fire maximally when moths head southwards (irrespective of season: a Mardia–Watson–Wheeler test indicates that the spring and autumn mean φmax values do not significantly differ: P > 0.2). Notably, head direction cells recorded in the medial pallium of fledgling shearwater chicks show a similar behaviour—all fire maximally when the chick's head is directed towards magnetic north (even though the chick will eventually fly due south on its inaugural migration)26. In fixed quiescent Monarch butterflies, CX neurons recorded extracellularly in response to a rotating ‘sun' stimulus (a bright green LED at 30° elevation), also revealed narrow φmax tuning27. However, when allowed to fly and receive self-motion cues this tuning disappeared, revealing dependence on behavioural state27. As our Bogong moths were likewise fixed and quiescent, we cannot rule out that the narrow φmax tuning we report is also due to behavioural state.

The functional diversity of neurons also corresponded to a morphological diversity. Of the 28 neurons that responded to our stimuli, we anatomically identified 11 cells by intracellular tracer injections (Fig. 5a). The identified neurons were distributed across all three brain regions targeted in our recordings: the optic lobes, the CX and the LAL. While the optic lobe is responsible for primary visual processing, the CX is a higher-order integration centre for spatial orientation, navigation and action selection28,29. The LAL is the major output target of the CX and generates steering commands to downstream motor circuits25. For visually guided migration in Bogong moths, all three brain regions are therefore expected to have key roles in processing visual compass cues and transforming these signals into steering commands. While the optic lobe neurons showed sharply tuned responses with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the responses of the two CX neurons that we held long enough to record from were less pronounced (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Figs. 4 and 7; cell 181122_003), indicating that visual stimulation alone is insufficient to fully drive these cells. The three anatomically identified category 4 (bimodal) cells localized to the LAL and the ventrolateral and ventromedial protocerebrum—their direction-selective responses are suggestive of a potential role in steering. The six identified category 1 and 2 (unimodal) cells localized to the optic lobe and CX, locations that are more concerned with early-stage sensory processing (optic lobe) and heading encoding (CX).

Although we obtained only a sparse sample of neurons, and despite the constraints of in vivo intracellular electrophysiology, our data nonetheless demonstrate that information from the starry sky is encoded in the moth's brain. While these neurons are located in brain regions that are known to analyse multiple navigational cues in other insects24, surprisingly, our identified cell types have not previously been described in analyses of insect compass pathways24 or head-direction circuits30 (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 7). Further work is clearly required to understand these neural circuits in detail, and whether their properties vary with behavioural state.

Our results indicate that a stellar compass is sufficient on its own to guide Bogong moths during their migration, and this may become useful if the geomagnetic field becomes perturbed by a magnetic storm or by local magnetic anomalies31 (which are admittedly not strong in southeast Australia, and typically alter field strength by only a few per cent). Under natural conditions, a geomagnetic compass is also sufficient if the stars become obscured by cloud. When neither cue is available, moths are disoriented. Moreover, we have also shown that Bogong moths possess previously undescribed neurons in the navigational centres of the brain that respond to a specific orientation of the night sky. Notably, these neurons are all tuned to a common azimuth, firing maximally when the moth is heading southwards, irrespective of season (Fig. 4b).

Newly eclosed Bogong moths therefore rely on stellar and geomagnetic compass cues to target a distant and restricted geographical region they have never previously visited (during spring), relying on the same global cues for the reverse migration (during autumn). For Bogong moths, how these cues are interpreted to determine the desired migratory heading depends on three spatiotemporal factors: the moth's geographical origin (different breeding populations across southeast Australia migrate in different directions to reach the same target), the season (moths migrate towards the mountains in spring and return to the breeding grounds in autumn) and the time of night (stellar positions change due to Earth's rotation). As in other insects24, to move in a desired (migratory) heading direction, Bogong moths must first establish their current heading (for example, using global compass cues), compute the angular difference between their current and desired headings and, depending on geographical location, season and time of night, generate a steering command that turns the moth to its required migratory direction. While head direction is well understood to be encoded by the CX24,30,32, our understanding of how desired heading is encoded is only now emerging33,34. However, consistent with data from flies28,34,35,36,37, bees38 and Monarch butterflies33, the computation of desired migratory heading in Bogong moths could well take place in the fan-shaped body of the CX. Indeed, our identification of starry sky responses in a fan-shaped body input neuron (Fig. 5a) supports this notion. However, exactly how the fan-shaped body of Bogong moths accounts for geographical location, season and time of night to generate a desired migratory heading remains unclear.

The question remains of what aspects of a moonless austral night sky might be useful as compass cues for Bogong moths. Humans15,16 and birds6,13,14 can use individual stars, or constellations of stars, as compass cues for distinguishing specific geographical directions, but it remains unclear how many of the brightest stars are discernible by the moth's small compound eyes. However, the Milky Way—which, in the Southern Hemisphere, is a bright extended stripe of light that becomes brightest somewhere in the southern half of the sky7,10—is very likely visible to Bogong moths39, as also suggested by our physiological results (Fig. 4). Its shape and celestial position at any time of night are predictable from one night to the next throughout each migratory season, and its rotation around the South Celestial Pole over any single night retains the brightest parts of the Milky Way (including the Carina nebula) somewhere in the southern half of the sky, but not consistently due south. Exactly where the brightest parts are located depends on season and time of night and can vary from southeast (Figs. 2a and 3b) to almost due west (Fig. 3a). Thus, a simple phototactic mechanism, with Bogong moths orienting towards the brightest parts of the sky in spring and away from them in autumn, seems unlikely. Furthermore, the presence of a bright moon in different parts of the sky would severely disrupt such a mechanism. However, Bogong moths orient in their inherited migratory direction even when the moon is present (Fig. 2a,b).

Notably, the Southern Hemisphere Milky Way is used to determine an arbitrary compass direction for short-range orientation in ball-rolling dung beetles7,9,10, not for distinguishing a specific geographical direction to travel towards a distant goal, but as a visual guide to keep a straight bearing for a few minutes in any random (goalless) direction. A straight trajectory is the safest for taking the beetle away from the furious competition of the dung heap. By contrast, Bogong moths, navigate long distances over many nights towards a distant destination they have never previously visited and therefore require a global compass to distinguish and hold their specific, inherited, geographical migratory heading. While the Earth's magnetic field certainly acts as one such compass4 (Fig. 2c), the southern night sky clearly acts as another, with each of these compasses probably taking over from the other when the salience of either diminishes or fails (Figs. 2c and 3c,d). However, exactly which celestial features are used for the stellar compass, whether the common directional tuning of stellar compass neurons has any role in the computation of desired heading, and how stellar, magnetic and any other hitherto unknown sensory cues en route are behaviourally and neurally integrated for robust navigation (including how and whether they are calibrated against each other40), all remain enticing topics for future research.

Bogong moths (A. infusa) of both sexes were caught in the wild during their autumn and spring migrations (2019 and 2018) using a LepiLED insect light (www.gunnarbrehm.de), or a vertical beam search light (model GT175, Ammon Luminaire Company), placed in front of a white sheet suspended between two trees. Almost all of the animals were caught near the Mount Selwyn Snowfields (southeast New South Wales, Australia: 35.914° S, 148.444° E; elevation, 1,600 m), which is approximately 70 km north-northeast of the nearest aestivation cave in the Main Range of the New South Wales Alps. Thus, to reach these caves in spring, these moths (a tiny subset of all moths travelling to the mountains in a multitude of directions from across southeast Australia) would be expected to fly south-southwest in spring, and returning moths might be expected to travel north-northeast in autumn (which agrees with our behavioural results). A few animals were also caught near Thredbo (Dead Horse Gap, southeast New South Wales, Australia: 36.524° S, 148.260° E, elevation 1,580 m). These moths were used for electrophysiology only. Each captured moth was transferred to its own plastic container to isolate it from influence by other moths. After capture, moths were transported to the testing site Glenhare, a rural property near Adaminaby New South Wales (36.040° S, 148.864° E; elevation, 1,250 m), fed with 20% honey solution (in water) and stored in a cool and sheltered place (exposed to the natural light cycle) to recover from stress induced by capture.

A purpose-built ferromagnetic-free laboratory located at Glenhare, Adaminaby (built on a concrete slab reinforced with fibreglass and constructed entirely from non-magnetic materials) housed the indoor behavioural and electrophysiological experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Each experimental apparatus (behaviour and electrophysiology) has its own dedicated earth separated from the mains earth (through a 6-mm thick, 30-mm wide and 12-m long copper strap dug into the ground below the concrete slab). Background levels of radio-frequency disturbances at this rural site are extraordinarily low4. All of the experiments were performed on dark-adapted moths in darkness at night (beginning at least 1 h after sunset). Darkness was achieved with black-out blinds (to remove residual starlight and moonlight from outside) and dark cloth around the experimental apparatus (to shield from the minimal stray light emitted from the equipment).

The non-magnetic electrophysiological apparatus (such as table and animal mounts; Extended Data Fig. 1f,g) was constructed from Thorlabs aluminium optomechanical components using high-grade stainless-steel fasteners. Vibration isolation between the aluminium pillar legs and the aluminium bread board table (on which the moth and manipulators were mounted) was provided by four high-grade stainless steel Stillpoints Ultra 6 (with Ultra base) isolators (Stillpoints). The moth was mounted (see below) onto a pillar attached to the bread board table, and a custom-built non-magnetic Sensapex piezo micromanipulator (Sensapex Oy, Oulu), also attached to the pillar, was used to move and advance a glass microelectrode. A removable circular UV-transmissive Perspex disc (diameter, 250 mm; thickness, 5 mm), covered in a layer of UV-transmissive diffusing paper (Lee Filters 251 1/4 white diffuser) and mounted 127 mm above the moth, was used for projection of celestial visual stimuli (see below). The electrophysiological apparatus was placed at the centre of a computer-controlled, double-wrapped41 three-axis (3D) Helmholtz coil system custom built in aluminium and copper (University of Oldenburg workshop; outer coil diameters; x, 900 mm; y, 835 mm; z, 775 mm) to create a nulled magnetic field (Extended Data Fig. 8) around the experimental moth. These coils were mounted onto the experimental table holding the moth and manipulators. The coil systems were powered by constant-current power supplies (Kepco, BOP 50-2M) and the current running through the coil systems was controlled through High-Speed USB Carriers (USB-9162, National Instruments) and custom-written codes in MATLAB (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks). Further details were reported previously3,4. Before each experimental session, Meda FVM-400 magnetometer measurements ensured that the magnetic field was nulled within the apparatus (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

The non-magnetic behavioural apparatus (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i) consisted of a modified Mouritsen–Frost flight simulator3,4,5,42 used to record the virtual flight path of tethered migratory Bogong moths. In brief, each flight simulator consisted of a cylindrical Perspex arena (diameter, 50 cm; height, 35 cm) placed vertically onto an aluminium table with a clear Perspex top within a 3D Helmholtz coil system (as described above, but with coil outer dimensions: x, 1,245 mm; y, 1,300 mm; z, 780 mm). Again, the nulled magnetic field conditions within the coils were carefully monitored using the Meda FVM-400 magnetometer (Extended Data Fig. 8a). The arena walls were covered with two layers of black felt. An optical encoder (E4T Miniature Optical Kit, US Digital) was mounted in the middle of a UV-transmissive Perspex disc (diameter, 50 cm; thickness, 0.5 cm), which was placed on top of the arena like a lid. A layer of UV-transmissive diffusing paper (Lee Filters 251 1/4 white diffuser) was placed on top of the disc (and served as a screen for dorsal projection of celestial stimuli; see below). A fine vertical tungsten rod (the encoder shaft: diameter, 0.5 mm; length, 153 mm), inserted into the axial centre of the optical encoder, extended downwards into the arena and allowed the attachment of tethered flying moths (see below). We used the encoder manufacturer's software (USB1 Digital Explorer 1.07, US Digital) to continuously record the moth's heading relative to geographical north (gN), therefore allowing us to reconstruct the moth's virtual flight path in the presence of celestial visual cues. An LED projector (ASUS S1 Mobile), neutral density (ND) filters (optical density between 4 and 5 log units) and a mirror placed at 45° under the Perspex tabletop were used to project a dim moving (10 mm s−1) pattern of optic flow onto a screen (Lee Filters 251 1/4 white diffusing paper) placed beneath the arena and therefore below the tethered flying moth (Extended Data Fig. 1d). The direction of the optic flow was controlled by custom written software (M. York), which coupled the encoder system (USB1 or USB4 encoder data acquisition USB device, US Digital) through a feedback loop. Thus, the optic flow would always move from head to tail below the moth, instantaneously changing direction as the moth changed direction. The mean radiance of the optic flow at the location of the performing moth was 2.06 ± 0.19 × 109 photons cm−2 s−1 sr−1.

A natural moonless starry austral night sky, in both the electrophysiological and the behavioural rigs, was projected using a downward pointing projector (behavioural rig: LED projector ASUS S1 Mobile; electrophysiological rig: Sony MP-CL1A laser projector; spectra of both projectors are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9d). Each projector was mounted sufficiently high above the moth in each rig to provide clear and correctly sized dorsal images of the night sky. To avoid unwanted stray light, each projector was housed in a custom-built 3D-printed plastic box featuring an opening in front of the lens and ventilation slits above the projector.

The free software Stellarium43 was used to simulate the moonless starry night sky over Canberra (about 80 km from Adaminaby as the crow flies) at 21:30 on four respective dates: 1 October 2018 (spring 2018), 21 March 2018 (autumn 2018), 21 October 2019 (spring 2019) and 27 February 2019 (autumn 2019). Screenshots (screen resolution 7,480 × 720 pixels) of these simulated starry skies were taken, cut in a circular shape using CorelDRAW X5 and saved as PNG files (300 dpi) to create the stimulus images (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Subtended at the moth, celestial images projected onto the circular screens in each rig (see above) provided 160° (behavioural rig) and 100° (electrophysiological rig) fields of view of the starry night sky centred on the zenith. Celestial images contained grey level values ranging from 4 (darkest) to 255 (brightest, on a scale of 0–255), with an average grey level of 62. The quality of the night sky provided by these images was comparable to that provided by the natural rural night sky at Glenhare (as measured with a Unihedron Sky Quality Metre; Extended Data Table 1). Before each experiment, the PNG files were opened using IrfanView64 on a PC using a screen resolution of 1,280 × 720 pixels. The PC was connected through an HDMI cable to the projector. The projected size of the circular sky matched the diameter of the circular screen in each rig.

Before each experiment, we ensured that the projection was centred accurately and that its light intensity was reduced to starlight levels using ND filters (the behavioural rig is shown in Extended Data Fig. 9b). In the case of the electrophysiological rig, two 1.2 log unit ND filters were inserted into the light path to dim the image to starlight levels (Extended Data Fig. 9c). The projection of the starry sky was initially set to its natural orientation relative to geographical north or flipped along its vertical and horizontal axes to test the moths under a 180° rotated sky.

As the projectors did not emit UV light, we installed a custom-made LED-ring (built by T. McIntyre; diameter, 120 mm; inner diameter, 50 mm) featuring eight UV LEDs (LED370E Ultra Bright Deep Violet LED, Thorlabs) in front of the projector. The brightness of the LED-ring was controlled using custom written software using MATLAB (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks) and several layers of ND filters that were fixed in front of the LED-ring to bring the UV intensity into a quasi-natural range (the behavioural rig is shown in Extended Data Fig. 9d).

Upward light intensity and spectrum measurements of the starry night sky were made underneath the projection screen in each rig with the probe located at the position of the moth (Extended Data Fig. 9b–d). The light metre used was a calibrated Ocean Optics QE65PRO Spectrometer (Ocean Optics).

To create randomized starry skies for experiments in autumn 2018 and spring 2018, the positions of all individual pixels of the natural night sky stimulus image were reassigned randomly to new positions, and the resulting randomized images were likewise saved as PNG files (Extended Data Fig. 9a). These featureless stellar conditions provided an identical stimulation intensity but provided no celestial spatial information. The randomized starry skies used during spring and autumn 2019 were improved by randomizing groups of pixels containing individual stars, therefore retaining the stars but removing spatial variations in the night sky (such as the Milky Way) that could be used for orientation (again maintaining identical intensity). Here, the stimulus image (of autumn 2019) was subdivided into squares with a size of 13 × 13 pixels, as the brightest star in the image had roughly these dimensions. The positions of these squares were now randomly reassigned and the resulting image was saved as a PNG file. A final improved randomized stimulus (used during spring 2019) was generated from the test stimulus by randomizing the positions of the individual visible stars. This was achieved by first detecting the position and size of each star in the test stimulus using a multiscale Laplacian of a Gaussian convolution of a greyscale version of the test stimulus, followed by local maxima detection. The resulting spatial information was then used to extract and save the image of each star from the natural night sky stimulus, before replacing them on a new background image, with a uniform colour and intensity equal to that of the mean of all pixels in the test stimulus that were not part of a star. This way, the location of the stars on the randomized image could be drawn from any desired distribution. In this case, a uniform distribution was used for the location of all but the brightest star, which was placed in the centre of the image.

To test the selectivity of central brain visual neurons to various parts of the Milky Way during electrophysiological experiments, we stimulated cells with artificial compass cues that, like the starry sky stimulus, filled the projection screen above the moth (Fig. 4d). These cues mimicked aspects of the autumn Milky Way: its brightest region around the Carina nebula (revolving dot) and its stripe-like shape (rotating bar). The bar length and width were chosen to mimic the main stripe of our natural Milky Way stimulus. The intensities of these artificial stimuli were also adjusted to provide a good mimic of the intensities of the stars and the dark background sky in our natural stimulus (see above) and had the same mean grey level (61 ± 1 for values between 0 to 255, darkest to brightest).

Two ferromagnetic-free Mouritsen–Frost flight simulators (of the same type used in the laboratory) were placed on a hilltop at Glenhare and used to record the heading directions of tethered migratory Bogong moths experiencing the full local surrounding landscape and the entire dome of the natural sky. To achieve this, each flight simulator arena consisted of a transparent UV-transmissive Perspex cylinder (again with diameter, 50 cm; height, 35 cm), placed vertically onto an aluminium table (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). The table top was also made of transparent Perspex. The two flight simulators (and their tables) were placed around 15 m apart. A tethered moth was connected to an optical encoder suspended at the centre of the open top end of each arena by a thin horizontal UV-transmissive Perspex arm. The two arenas were controlled from computers that were operated from within a black light-tight cubical tent that was placed midway between the two arenas, approximately 7 m from each. The tent was therefore a landscape feature that the moths could potentially see during their tethered flights.

Most behavioural procedures used in this study have been previously described4,5. Before attachment of tethering stalks, moths were chilled in a freezer for 5–10 min to immobilize them. The scales on the moth's dorsal thorax were removed by suction using a micro-vacuum pump (custom built by B.F.). Afterwards a thin vertical tungsten stalk (which is ferromagnetic free), fashioned at its end to create a small circular footplate, was glued to the dorsal thorax using contact cement while being restrained by a weighted-down plastic mesh. Moths were tested on the day of stalk attachment.

Shortly before sunset, UV-transmissive Perspex boxes holding individual stalked moths were placed onto an elevated outdoor location and provided with a clear view of the western sky and the setting sun (and the skylight polarization pattern), in case these cues were important for calibrating compass mechanisms (as found for the magnetic compass of birds44,45,46). After sunset, the moths could also see the stars (and the celestial rotation).

For tethering within the behavioural arena (performed in dim red light to maintain a dark-adapted visual state), the arena lid holding the optical encoder was lifted and the tungsten stalk of a vigorously flying moth (held with medical forceps) was attached to the bottom end of the encoder shaft through a 1.5 cm length of thin rubber intravenous medical tubing that connected the stalk to the shaft (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Once the arena lid was returned to the arena, this coupling enabled the moth to rotate freely around its yaw axis and choose any flight direction. Once the moth was mounted in the arena, it was gently pointed manually towards geographical north. The heading direction count was then reset, the moth was released and the optical encoder was enabled to register the flight heading direction of the moth under a given night sky condition (projected on the arena lid) at a sampling rate of 5 Hz (and a horizontal resolution of 3°). Each moth was tested for exactly 5 min in each stimulus condition.

Moths chosen for analysis were required to fulfil three ante hoc criteria, two before the experiment and one during the experiment: (1) the tethering stalk was perfectly vertical; (2) wing flapping was vigorous and its amplitude was large and equal for both wings (indicating that the contact cement had not interfered with the wings); and (3) that the moth flew continuously for the full 5 min. For the last criterion, if a moth stopped flying, the arena was gently tapped in order to stimulate the moth to continue flight behaviour. A moth that stopped flying four times was rejected and the recording aborted. For the field seasons of spring 2018 and 2019, as well for Autumn 2019, the percentages of moths that were aborted due to failing to meet these criteria were 2 out of 59 or 3.4% (Spring 2018), 25 out of 137 or 18.3% (Spring 2019), and 35 out of 76 or 46.1% (Autumn 2019). The high rejection rate during Autumn 2019 may have been due to the unusually wet and cold weather that occurred during this season. Moths often behave erratically on rainy or stormy nights, and even on days before and after such nights.

The same behavioural methods (and criteria) that were used indoors were also used outdoors. The goal of these experiments was to understand how migratory Bogong moths deal with natural skies (in particular the nightly movements of the stars and moon, as well as cloud cover) while experiencing a normal geomagnetic field and the local surrounding landscape under natural illumination. Experiments were performed under clear starry skies during autumn 2023 (over three nights during the last week of March), as well as at two times of night, to test whether the migratory orientations of moths were affected by the nightly movements of the stars and moon (which was approximately half-full): (1) between 20:32 and 21:06 (about 1.5 h after sunset), and (2) between 23:25 and 23:59. The same moths were used for orientation measurements at both times, and moths that were flown in one arena at the earlier time (and saw the black tent on their eastern side) were flown in the other arena at the later time (and now saw the black tent on their western side) and vice versa. Moreover, there was a stand of trees close to the arena on the eastern side of the tent, and single trees close to the arena on the western side of the tent. Thus, other panoramic landmarks (apart from the tent) differed markedly in their spatial positions from within the two arenas. Between earlier and later experiments, tethered moths were kept isolated and in the dark in a suitcase that was warmed with hot water bottles. Experiments were also carried out on a fourth completely overcast night that totally covered the stars and moon (between 21:12 and 21:48).

To maximize the success rate of the demanding intracellular recordings during the short migratory season, these experiments were performed both in the afternoon and during the natural nocturnal flight time of the moths. For afternoon experiments, we removed the two 1.2 log unit ND filters in front of the projector lens (as described above) to generate a starry sky projection around 250 times brighter than the one used at night (to account for the circadian-rhythm-induced light-adapted state of the moths). For night experiments, the ND filters were reinserted. No obvious differences were found in results obtained in the two situations. The moths were mounted onto a custom-made 3D-printed animal holder and immobilized using wax. The antennae were fixed to the front of the head with a drop of wax, and a square piece of cuticle was removed from the head capsule to expose the brain. The neural sheath was digested with Pronase (Sigma-Aldrich) for about 30 s and then carefully washed. It was then removed using a pair of fine forceps. A second small hole was cut into the cuticle above the proboscis muscle and a chlorinated silver wire was inserted into this muscle to serve as reference electrode.

Glass electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass on a P-97 Flaming-Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument), and had a typical resistance of 50–100 MΩ. The electrode tip was filled with Neurobiotin solution (4% Neurobiotin in 1 M KCl, Vector Laboratories), and the remainder of the electrode was filled with 1 M KCl. Electrodes were moved into position with a non-magnetic Sensapex micromanipulator. Signals were amplified using a BA-03X intracellular amplifier and headstage (NPI Electronic), and were then digitized using a CED Micro 1401-3 (Cambridge Electronic Design) and recorded with Spike2 software (v.8.03, Cambridge Electronic Design). Stimulus control signals from MATLAB (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks) were simultaneously recorded in Spike2. During the recording, the brain was kept hydrated through regular application of moth ringer solution47.

Moths were mounted under starry skies that were naturally oriented before sky rotation (that is, had the same orientation as the stars outside the laboratory). In earlier experiments, the initial heading orientation of the mounted moth was north relative to the stars and, in later experiments, the initial heading orientation south; however, greatest ease of access to the brain was eventually found for an eastward heading. The action potential spike trains obtained for a 360° rotation of the sky were corrected according to the initial heading orientation of the moth so that spike trains obtained across all experiments were comparable (with a correction angle of 0° applied for an initial northward orientation, 90° for an eastward orientation and 180° for southward orientation). Impaled cells were stimulated with dorsally projected images of the natural starry night sky, or control images of randomized stars (see above). Cells were also stimulated with bars and dots that mimicked different parts of the Milky Way (see above). All of these projected images (natural and randomized stars, artificial Milky Way stimuli) were rotated 360° at 30° s−1 to 45° s−1, with a 2 s break between clockwise and anticlockwise rotations, using custom-written MATLAB code (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks). Between rotations, a neutral grey background image was presented that had the same average grey value as the starry sky/control images.

We targeted an area of the central brain in which we expected to find both CX and lateral complex neurons, as well as optic lobe neurons traversing the brain in the posterior optic tract. Neurons that clearly did not respond to an initial sky rotation were immediately discarded and no recording was saved. 79 neurons were assessed as potentially responding to the stimulus and, of these, 28 (35%) met the inclusion criteria of a unimodal or bimodal response profile. The remaining 51 neurons were classified as uniform in their response to stellar rotation (that is, showed no obvious response) and were therefore excluded from the analysis.

After recording from a suitable cell, a positive current (range: 1–3 nA for 3 min) was applied to the electrode to inject Neurobiotin into the cell. The electrode was then removed and the brain was dissected out of the head capsule. Brains were fixed in 4 °C overnight in paraformaldehyde solution (4% PFA in phosphate buffer) and then washed in 0.1 M PBS (4 times for 15 min). During washing, the retinas were removed. Brains were then incubated with streptavidin–Cy5 (Jackson Immuno Research, 1:1,000 in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 3 days and kept in the dark from this point onwards. After incubation, the brains were washed in PBS-Triton X-100 (6 times for 20 min) and PBS (2 times for 20 min) and then dehydrated in an increasing ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90%, 95% and twice at 100%). Brains were then transferred to a fresh mixture of methylsalicylate and ethanol (1:1) and, after 15 min, were left to clear in 100% methylsalicylate for 75 min. The cleared brains were mounted in Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mounting media between two coverslips and left to dry for at least 2 days.

Brain samples were scanned with the 633 nm laser of a Leica SP8 confocal microscope and viewed with a ×20 oil-immersion objective (Leica Microsystems). For optimal resolution, the scan settings were set to 1,024 × 1,024 pixels, 12-bit pixel depth, 3 times line accumulation and 400 lines per s in the photon-counting mode of the hybrid detector. Neurons and relevant neuropils were then reconstructed in Amira v.5.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and registered into the Bogong moth standard brain22,23.

The data used for the analyses described below are available online48. As there were no statistical differences in results obtained from male and female moths, the results were pooled.

The behavioural analysis used in this study has been previously described4,5. As mentioned above, the encoder software (USB1 Digital Explorer v.1.07, US Digital) recorded the instantaneous heading directions of a tethered flying moth every 200 ms (5 Hz) and saved these values in a text file. We used custom-written MATLAB code (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks) to visualize the virtual flight paths of all tested moths and calculated a mean orientation vector based on each virtual flight path. Each vector for each moth in the circular plots (Fig. 3c–f) encodes the mean orientation direction of a moth's individual recorded flight path as well as its r value (that is, length, or directedness, of the flight path vector). To take advantage of the extra information in our data arising from the fact that the flight trajectories of moths not only had a mean direction (as used for a classic Rayleigh test49) but also a mean directedness (vector length), we used the circular statistics software Oriana (v.4 (2011), KCS) and Excel (Microsoft Office 2019, Microsoft) to apply a one-sided Moore's modified Rayleigh test4,50,51 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (Supplementary Table 1). The R* value encodes the directedness of a population of tested moths and reveals the likelihood that the combined flight direction of these moths—each with its own direction and directedness—differs significantly from random.

To confirm that the two distributions of moth flight directions were significantly different between naturally oriented and 180°-rotated night sky conditions, as well as significantly different between spring and autumn for any single sky condition (Fig. 3c–f), a Mardia–Watson–Wheeler test49 (Oriana) was used (Extended Data Fig. 2g).

The statistical procedures used for data collected outdoors were the same as those used for data collected indoors, with the exception that a likelihood-ratio test52 was used to test whether mean orientation directions for moth populations flown under two different clear natural sky conditions (earlier and later in the evening) were significantly different from each other (Fig. 2a,b). We did this by fitting maximum-likelihood distributions to the mean orientation directions for each trial, using the circular statistics package circular53 in R v.3.6.1 (www.r-project.org). In a similar manner, we determined the likelihood that the moth population flown under overcast conditions (Fig. 2c) had the same mean direction as either of the two populations flown under clear skies, in this case testing whether the means of the two different populations differed significantly.

Moreover, for the cohort of 95 moths flown under clear skies earlier and later in the evening (Fig. 2a,b), we used the mean orientation direction of each moth flown earlier (Fig. 2a), subtracted from the mean direction for the same moth flown later (Fig. 2b), and tested whether the mean angular differences were significantly different from zero (no change in heading). As the moth cohort was clearly less oriented later in the evening (possibly due to fatigue), we made this analysis by separating moths into three groups (Extended Data Fig. 2): (1) those that were well-oriented throughout the night (r > 0.8, both earlier and later in the evening, 35 out of 95 moths); (2) those that were well-oriented in only one trial (typically r > 0.8 earlier and r < 0.8 later, 42 out of 95 moths), and those that were less well-oriented throughout the evening (0.2 < r < 0.8 in both trials, 18 out of 95 moths). This analysis revealed that moths that were well oriented throughout the night (group 1) showed no change in heading, while those that were less-well oriented (groups 2 and 3) showed a westward drift later in the evening (Extended Data Fig. 2). However, this drift was not sufficient (in either direction or directedness) to significantly alter the mean direction of the population as a whole from earlier to later in the evening (Fig. 2a,b).

Spike train data were analysed using custom-written code in MATLAB (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks). Circular statistical analysis was performed in R (v.3.6.1; www.r-project.org) using the circular maximum-likelihood estimation package (CircMLE54). Responses were classified as unimodal (models M2A, M2B or M2C in the R-library CircMLE) or bimodal (models M4A or M4B) based on the Akaike information criterion. Only responses that were classified as unimodal (models M2A, M2B or M2C in the R-library CircMLE, based on the Akaike information criterion) were analysed further with respect to the half-width of the rotation tuning curve, the SNR and the variability of the response.

For cells that responded to night sky rotation (rotation angle φ) with an increase in spiking activity (which became maximal at the sky rotation angle φmax), the bootstrapped interquartile range of the unimodal part of the response distribution was taken to be an estimator of the half-width of the rotation tuning curve (φ range for 50% maximal response or greater). For cells that responded with a decrease in spiking activity, von Mises and mixed-von Mises distributions did not appropriately reflect this inhibition. Instead, the responses of these neurons were binned at 1° intervals and low-pass filtered, and the width at half-maximum was then determined in MATLAB (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks). The signal-to-noise ratio SNR was calculated in MATLAB as the ratio between the maximum response during night sky rotation (which occurs at a rotation angle φ = φmax), and the s.e.m. before the night sky rotation started. This was calculated for each stimulus rotation separately. To obtain an estimate of the reliability of a given cell's response to repeated rotations of the night sky, the mean preferred stimulus rotation angle (φmax) was calculated as the circular mean for each individual night sky rotation. We then used the circular s.d.55 of the mean angle across all rotations as an estimate for the variability in the response.

Behavioural data under natural clear starry skies (Fig. 2a,b) were obtained in independent experiments over three separate nights (with new moths used each night). Behavioural data under natural overcast skies (Fig. 2c) were obtained during only a single night. Behavioural data under projected starry skies generated using Stellarium (Fig. 3c–f) were obtained in independent experiments run over several nights with each night's cohort of moths used only once. These experiments were repeated with the same results over two separate spring and autumn seasons (2018 and 2019). Thus, all of these experiments deal with biological replicates. Sample sizes were based on the availability of moths, with at least 40 moths (and as many as 70) being used for each experiment. Experiments were conducted without blinding and without a specific randomization protocol (apart from the random selection of moths used as replicates). Intracellular electrophysiological recordings (Fig. 4) and dye injections (Fig. 5) were obtained from single visual cells in the brain that were subjected to rotations of a projected starry sky (generated using Stellarium). Since each recording (and subsequent dye injection) was a unique observation, replication was not possible. This is due to the stochastic nature of intracellular recordings—single neurons were penetrated randomly from target brain regions that contain many thousands of cells.

D.D., B.F. and E.W. conceived the project. K.G. contributed detailed knowledge of Bogong moth ecology and aestivation sites and provided critical logistical support in the Australian Alps. M.W., G.H. and J.C. provided crucial logistical, experimental and intellectual input. E.W., D.D., A.A., B.F., H.C., S.H. and H.M designed the experiments, and designed and manufactured the laboratory and experimental apparatus. D.D., A.A., H.C., J.X., J.W. and E.W. performed the experiments. D.D. and J.W. calibrated the magnetic stimulation apparatus and wrote the MATLAB scripts to control it. D.D., A.A., H.C., S.H., J.F., E.W. and B.F. analysed the results. A.A., S.H., D.D. and E.W. made the figures. E.W., A.A., S.H and D.D. wrote the initial version of the manuscript and all of the authors made substantial contributions to the final version.

a, The two transparent hilltop arenas (sitting on their aluminium tables) seen on either side of the black tent enclosing the experimenters and the computers. b, A close-up of one of the arenas seen in a. Photographs Hui Chen. c, Our new Australian lab, built of entirely non-magnetic materials (to eliminate magnetic artefacts), at Adaminaby. The laboratory occupies 50 m2, has two separate rooms (one for the electrophysiology rig, and one for the behavioural rig) and sits on a concrete slab. Each rig has its own earth separated from the mains earth (provided by a 6 mm thick, 30 mm wide and 12 m long copper strap dug into the ground below the concrete slab). d, The flight arena, with a flying moth (circled) tethered to an optical encoder that tracks changes in the moth's heading direction (relative to North). The flying moth is free to turn in any direction, and the encoder thus records its virtual flight trajectory over time. The floor of the arena displays an optic flow pattern of starlight-intensity (here brightly shown in order to see it) which always moves from head to tail as the moth turns, inducing it to fly. e, The tethering arrangement. f,g, The non-magnetic electrophysiology rig for recording the responses of compass cells in the moth's brain in response to precise magnetic and visual stimulation. The rig is enclosed within Helmholtz coils (f) to precisely control the direction and inclination of the Earth's magnetic field (or to null the magnetic field, as in the experiments described here), and a projector and screen (g) create natural images of the starry night sky above the moth. The moth is mounted horizontally on a stand beneath the projection screen and an electrode is inserted into its central brain. h,i, The non-magnetic behavioural rig for monitoring the trajectories of tethered flying moths. The flight arena, again enclosed within Helmholtz coils, receives an image of the starry night sky on a projection screen installed above the moth (i), from a projector mounted above the coils (h). Photographs Eric Warrant.

a–c, Orientation directions under a cloudless autumn night sky earlier and later in the evening (data from Fig. 2a,b). d–f, Change in mean population heading (Δα) from earlier to later in the evening. a,d, Individual moths that were well-oriented in both trials (r > 0.8 in both trials, n = 35) retained the same heading (a), exhibiting no change in direction between trials. At a population level, the pattern of changes (d) was not significantly different from 0° (χ2 = 0.428, d.f. = 1, p = 0.5131, Δα = 7.64°E). b,e, Moths that were well-oriented in only one of the two trials (r > 0.8 in either trial, n = 42), typically earlier in the evening, started the evening with a population mean heading similar to those that were well-oriented throughout the night (left panels in a and b), but drifted to the West later in the evening (b, right panel), a drift (e) that was significantly different from 0° (χ2 = 7.454, d.f. = 1, p = 0.0063, Δα = 67.77°W). c,f, For moths less well-oriented throughout the night (r < 0.8 in both trials, n = 18) there was no significant population level orientation (c), and no significant population-level difference (f) from a 0° heading change (χ2 = 1.769, d.f. = 1, p = 0.1835, Δα = 89.17°W). Nonetheless, the mean headings, despite lacking significance, were similar to those of the moths in b. a–c, Direction and directedness of MV given by α and R* value, respectively. Inner dashed circle: required R* value for statistical significance: p < 0.05. Red radial dashes: 95% confidence intervals (CI95). mN = magnetic North, gN = geographic North. One-sided Moore's modified Rayleigh tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons – corrected p-values: 1.72 × 10−11 (earlier) and 2.76 × 10−8 (later) in a; 2.46 × 10−12 (earlier) and 5.57 × 10−3 (later) in b; 0.426 (earlier) and 1.000 (later) in c. d–f, Red arrow: the bias-corrected mean vector for the maximum-likelihood distribution of heading changes; Dashed circle: required r value for statistical significance: p < 0.05; Red arc: 95% confidence intervals (CI95) of the mean angle across heading changes (numerical simulation). One-sided likelihood-ratio tests52 adjusted within each dataset (from a, b and c) using the Benjamini-Hochberg method56. g, Mardia-Watson-Wheeler tests for determining whether populations of moth directions (n) in different seasons and under different skies (as presented in Fig. 3c,d) were significantly different from each other (if so, p is small). 0° is the natural starry sky orientation and 180° is the starry sky rotated by 180°.

φmax values were derived from neural responses to a rotating starry sky stimulus, subdivided into response type and seasons.

Frequency plots and circular φmax diagrams, separated into clockwise (CW, left panels) and counter-clockwise (CCW, right panels) stimulus rotations, for every cell recorded in spring 2018 (cell ID, red text). Responses to the starry sky stimulus are shown in blue, responses to the control stimulus are shown in grey. Where the cell's anatomy was identified, branching regions are also given (shown as green text). For detailed anatomies, see Extended Data Fig. 7.

a,b, The Helmholtz coil system was used to compensate the local geomagnetic field and create a “nulled” or near-zero magnetic field (NZMF) within the two experimental rigs. The typical variation of the magnetic field strength, shown as nanotesla (nT) over time (s), for the duration of a typical behavioural experiment (300 s). This measurement was made at the position of the moth (position 0 in d). The three-component vector (X, Y, Z: red, green and purple lines respectively) of the field was measured 6 times over 300 s to obtain X, Y and Z traces. These six traces were averaged to give the mean magnetic field strength for each component (X, Y and Z) and the standard deviation (shaded areas around the mean). c,d, To control that the central area of the arena (where tethered moths flew) had a nulled magnetic field, the magnetometer probe was positioned at the arena centre (position 0 in c) and moved outwards in 1 cm steps along 4 directions (coloured arrows in d) relative to geographic North (gN) and the strengths of the X, Y, and Z field components were measured at each position. These field strengths were less than 100 nT a radius of 4 cm from the coil centre (dashed yellow line and circle in c and d) in all four directions (bar colours in c correspond to direction colours in d). Since the wingspan radius of a Bogong moth is about 2.5 cm (dashed brown line and circle in c and d), this indicates that the entire moth experienced a magnetic field strength substantially less than 100 nT, effectively a “nulled field” (which can be compared to the external local magnetic field strength of around 58,500 nT).

a, Stellarium images of the austral starry night sky (and randomized sky) used during the spring and autumn migratory seasons in 2018 and 2019. Geographic North (gN) is upwards in each image. Randomized skies in 2018 were created by randomizing pixels (insets), whereas those in 2019 were improved by randomizing stars (see Methods). b,c, Brightness distributions of natural starry skies and randomized skies projected onto a screen above the moth in the behavioural (b) and electrophysiological rigs (c). The probe of a spectrometer (Ocean Optics QE65 PRO, see Methods), equipped with a collimating lens (25° field of view), was positioned at the same location as the moth and systematically pointed at the projected sky in different directions (0–360° in 30° steps) relative to geographic North. The radiance (photons/cm²/sec/sr) was measured from the screen in each direction in (5 measurements per position): mean radiance is shown as a function of measurement direction (green squares = spring projection, magenta squares = autumn projection, blue squares = randomized projection). Error bars give standard deviations. Note that the brightest areas of the autumn and spring projections were respectively located south-easterly and westerly. d. The spectra of the projectors used in the behavioural (left) and electrophysiological rigs (right), measured using the Ocean Optics QE65 PRO spectrometer. For the projector in the behavioural rig, a ring of UV LEDs was used to create a quasi-realistic spectrum (see Methods). Note that for this spectrum the noise level is relatively high since we used all the neutral density filters normally used during an experiment.

Metrics details

Sexual reproduction relies on meiotic chromosome pairing to form bivalents, a process that is complicated in polyploids owing to the presence of multiple subgenomes1. Uneven ploidy mostly results in sterility due to unbalanced chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, pentaploid dogroses (Rosa sect. Caninae; 2n = 5x = 35) achieve stable sexual reproduction through a unique mechanism: 14 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted biparentally, while the remaining 21 chromosomes are maternally inherited as univalents2,3. Despite being studied for over a century, the role of centromeres in this process has remained unclear. Here we analyse haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies for three pentaploid dogroses. Subgenome phasing revealed a bivalent-forming subgenome with two highly homozygous chromosome sets and three divergent subgenomes lacking homologous partners, therefore explaining their meiotic behaviour. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny, phylogenetic relationships and centromere composition indicate that the subgenomes originated from two divergent clades of the genus Rosa. Pollen genome analysis shows that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins form bivalents, supporting multiple origins of dogroses and highlighting variation in subgenome contributions. We reveal that bivalent-forming centromeres are enriched with ATHILA retrotransposons, contrasting with larger tandem-repeat-based centromeres mainly found in univalents. This centromere structural bimodality possibly contributes to univalent drive during female meiosis. Our findings provide insights into the unique reproductive strategies of dogroses, advancing our understanding of genome evolution, centromere diversity and meiotic mechanisms in organisms with asymmetrical inheritance systems.

Whole-genome duplication or polyploidy is a frequent phenomenon across the phylogeny of land plants4. Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction, ensuring the reduction in genomic content in gametes through chromosome pairing and exchanges between non-sister chromatids, that is, crossovers5,6. Polyploidy often results from meiotic failure, that is, the generation of unreduced gametes, which poses challenges to meiotic chromosome pairing and the maintenance of sexual reproduction1,7. Thus, polyploids often skip sexual reproduction by promoting vegetative propagation8 or apomixis9. However, in many allopolyploids, in which distinct subgenomes come into contact through hybridization, recombination partners from homologous chromosomes (same parental subgenome) are preferred, while recombination between homoeologous chromosomes (different parental subgenomes) is suppressed10,11.

The genus Rosa, which comprises approximately 150 species, is a typical example of evolution through frequent polyploidy and hybridization events12, which is also reflected by the large variety of cultivated roses with a long breeding history that includes both processes. The genus comprises two major clades, the Rosa and allies clade and the Synstylae and allies clade with subg. Hulthemia, subg. Hesperhodos and sect. Pimpinellifoliae as the basalmost splits12,13. Available genomes from diploid roses of sect. Synstylae14,15,16 and sect. Rosa17 revealed high levels of synteny, enabling comparative studies in this taxonomically difficult genus. Studies on tetraploid cut roses (Rosa hybrida) undergoing regular meiosis have shown that most genomic markers were recombined freely from all four chromosome sets, but preferential recombination between chromosomes and even chromosome arms vary18,19.

Within the Synstylae clade, allopolyploid dogroses (Rosa sect. Caninae (DC.) Ser.) exhibit a unique reproductive strategy known as Canina meiosis, in which the selective chromosome pairing results in a mixed mode of inheritance—combining biparental transmission of bivalents and uniparental transmission of univalents within the same nucleus20,21. First observed in the early twentieth century, this mechanism is most common in pentaploid dogroses (2n = 5x = 35), in which the male and female parents contribute 7 and 28 chromosomes, respectively, to the zygote2,3,22,23. During meiosis, 14 chromosomes form 7 bivalents, while the other 21 chromosomes remain as univalents. Bivalent-forming chromosomes from two highly homozygous sets are transmitted to both sperm and egg cells, whereas univalents are inherited exclusively through the egg cell and excluded from pollen grains, restoring pentaploidy in the offspring through the fusion of haploid male and tetraploid female gametes24,25,26,27 (Fig. 1a). Despite extensive study, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying this asymmetric inheritance remain poorly understood.

a, The known sexual reproduction of the pentaploid R. canina (2n = 5x = 35). Different chromosome sets are represented by one chromosome each. During Canina meiosis2,3,22,23, two chromosome sets form bivalents (dark grey and red asterisks) during meiosis and are transmitted through both pollen and egg cells24,25,26. The remaining three sets form univalents (lighter grey) and are transmitted through the egg cell only24,25,26. Diakinesis of male meiosis I (n = 15) of R. canina is shown on the left. Scale bar, 10 µm. b, GENESPACE synteny and phylogenetic relationships of the five chromosome sets of R. canina and their close diploid relatives R. chinensis (sect. Synstylae) and R. rugosa (sect. Rosa) with a dated phylogenetic tree constructed using 16,372 orthologous genes on the left. Each colour indicates synteny to each R. chinensis chromosome, which was used as reference to name the R. canina chromosomes. c,d, Unrooted maximum-likelihood phylogenies of the homoeologous R. canina chromosomes and chromosomes from the respective linkage groups of the diploid species R. chinensis (sect. Synstylae) and R. rugosa (sect. Rosa) based on alignments of whole-chromosome sequences. The phylogeny of synteny group 1 chromosomes is shown in c. Synteny groups 2–7 are shown in d. Filled chromosomes refer to subgenomes of R. canina belonging to the Synstylae clade (violet/light blue) and the Rosa clade (dark/light orange). Chromosomes from the diploid roses are indicated by hatching. e, Synteny and rearrangement analyses (SyRI) of the R. canina genome assembly. Pairwise comparisons of the synteny of all R. canina subgenomes (S1_h1/S1_h2, S2, R3 and R4) are juxtaposed against the corresponding chromosomes (chr.) of R. chinensis and R. rugosa. Only synteny blocks and rearrangement blocks greater than 50 kb in length are shown.

Bivalent-forming and univalent chromosomes are thought to have originated from multiple ancient hybridization events28,29,30. Phylogenetic studies based on maternally inherited plastids suggest that dogroses are polyphyletic within the Synstylae clade, with subsects. Rubigineae and Caninae are separated by species exhibiting regular meiosis13,31,32,33. Cytogenetic evidence shows that bivalent-forming chromosomes in subsect. Caninae become univalents in subsect. Rubigineae and vice versa34,35. The rose-specific (peri)centromeric satellite repeat (CANR4) is notably enriched in dogrose univalents, possibly linking centromere expansion to their drive during female meiosis36,37. Although other uneven polyploid systems with hemisexual reproduction exist38,39,40, the meiosis observed in dogroses is unique among eukaryotes. However, the lack of genomic studies has hindered understanding of how centromere properties contribute to this enigmatic reproductive behaviour.

Here we present a high-quality haplotype-phased chromosome-scale assembly of the pentaploid genome of Rosa canina (subsect. Caninae) and compare it with another R. canina individual and R. agrestis (subsect. Rubigineae), both from the Darwin Tree of Life (DToL; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/). Subgenome-aware analyses revealed that dogroses are composed of four subgenomes with one subgenome being present in two highly homozygous haplotypes and the other three in only one. Targeted sequencing of rose-specific single-copy orthologues (SCOs) from pollen DNA, together with the analysis of synthetic F1 hybrids, confirmed that the two-copy subgenome is biparentally inherited and therefore forming bivalents, while 21 non-recombining univalents from three distinct subgenomes are exclusively inherited through the female germline. Our SCO-based phylogenetic analysis supports the multiple-origin nature of dogroses, as subgenomes from different evolutionary origins were found in pollen, that is, forming bivalents. We also identified a bimodal centromere architecture with small (retrotransposon ATHILA-based) and large (tandem repeat CANR4-based) centromeres. Notably, CANR4-based centromeres were prevalent in univalents, possibly contributing to their drive in asymmetric female meiosis. Our results therefore provide a valuable basis for studying the trade-offs between sexual and asexual reproduction within a single genome.

Although R. canina has been recognized as a pentaploid species (2n = 5x = 35) for decades, its genome has remained unresolved owing to its complex polyploid structure and hybrid origin. To address this, we assembled a de novo haplotype-resolved, chromosome-level genome using PacBio HiFi sequencing (23× coverage) and chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data (Supplementary Table 1). The total size of the assembled 35 pseudochromosomes is about 2.4 Gb, achieving 99.2% completeness in terms of gene content (Extended Data Fig. 1). This high-quality reference genome provides a critical resource for understanding R. canina's genetic features, asymmetric meiosis and hybridization.

All-to-all chromosome alignments revealed seven syntenic groups in R. canina, each consisting of five chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. 1). In each group, two chromosome sets consistently exhibited 99–100% similarity, indicating two haplotypes of the same subgenome, while the remaining three chromosome sets showed lower similarities (95–98%; Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1), which may derive from three different subgenomes. Phylogenetic analyses based on gene and chromosome data, using the diploid rose genomes of Rosa chinensis (sect. Synstylae)16 and Rosa rugosa (sect. Rosa; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) as references, revealed that two subgenomes are closely related to R. chinensis and were therefore designated ‘S', while the other two are more similar to R. rugosa (Fig. 1b–e) and were therefore designated ‘R'. The two highly similar Synstylae-like haplotypes were named S1_h1 and S1_h2, while the more divergent Synstylae-like chromosome set was named S2. The Rosa-like subgenomes were named R3 and R4, respectively. Moreover, using subgenome-specific k-mers41, we observed that chromosomes assigned to the same subgenome clustered together both in the k-mer heat map and the principal component analysis plot, confirming the correct assignment of the four primary subgenomes (S1, S2, R3 and R4; Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). These findings resolve the long-standing question regarding the identity of the five homoeologous chromosomes within each syntenic group.

To further validate the evolutionary relationships of the subgenomes in pentaploid R. canina, we conducted orthologous cluster analysis and genome-wide comparisons of synonymous substitution rates (Ks) between R. canina, R. chinensis and R. rugosa. These results were consistent with previous phasing assignments and confirmed the allopolyploid origin of R. canina (Supplementary Figs. 2–4). Structure-based pairwise chromosomal analysis across the subgenomes of R. canina and genomes of R. chinensis and R. rugosa revealed a strong conservation of synteny between the two haplotypes of the homozygous S1 subgenome (S1_h1/h2). By contrast, the S1 subgenome showed much lower synteny with the other three subgenomes (S2, R3, R4), which were characterized by large inversions, duplicated regions and translocations (Fig. 1e). Notably, the R3 and R4 subgenomes of R. canina exhibit greater synteny to the R. rugosa genome than to the other subgenomes of R. canina (Fig. 1e), supporting their origination from sect. Rosa35. Despite the distinct divergence and origins of four subgenomes, a comparison of R. canina chromosomes of all subgenomes against R. rugosa syntenic chromosomes revealed no evidence of differential fractionation (loss of one or the other copy of a duplicated gene; Supplementary Fig. 5). To detect differential evolutionary rates between subgenomes, we analysed the ratio of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitution rates and revealed, besides a few outliers, strong purifying selection across orthologous genes in all subgenomes (Supplementary Fig. 6). Together, these results suggest an absence of large-scale subgenome dominance.

We next took advantage of the recent HiFi and Hi-C sequencing datasets from the DToL (https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) for another R. canina accession (European Nucleotide Archive (ENA): PRJEB79802) and from Rosa agrestis (subsect. Rubigineae; ENA: PRJEB79880) to generate de novo pseudochromosomes (Supplementary Table 2). Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of synteny between our R. canina S27 genome and the DToL R. canina, both sharing the same subgenome composition (Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). The R. agrestis genome, also pentaploid with 35 pseudochromosomes, displayed a different subgenome composition, with two highly similar haplotypes for the R4 subgenome (R4_h1/h2) and only one copy of the S1 subgenome (Extended Data Fig. 3b–e and Supplementary Fig. 7c,d). Comparative subgenome phasing revealed a gradient of differentiation between the subgenomes of R. canina and R. agrestis. The S1 subgenomes of both species were the least differentiated and clustered together (Supplementary Fig. 8a). This was followed by the R4 subgenomes, which exhibited a slightly higher degree of differentiation compared with S1 (Supplementary Fig. 8b). The most pronounced differentiation was seen in the S2 and R3 subgenomes, which were distinctly separated in both species (Supplementary Fig. 8c,d). This pattern suggests that the subgenomes S2 and R3 are accumulating more divergence over time.

To trace the hybridization history of dogroses, we identified subgenome-specific long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) and estimated their insertion times in R. canina and R. agrestis to determine the timing of subgenome differentiation before hybridization. Notably, we observed a distinction in the median insertion times of LTR-RTs: the S1, S2 and R3 subgenomes in R. canina were estimated to have diverged around 0.7 million years ago (Ma), while the R4 subgenome was older, at approximately 1.2 Ma (median values, 95% confidence intervals; Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). In R. agrestis, the median insertion times for S1 and S2 (~0.7 Ma) and for R4 (~1.2 Ma) were the same as for R. canina, whereas a slightly older median insertion time was detected for the R3 subgenome (around 0.9 Ma; Extended Data Fig. 4c). These results suggest that the combination of S1, S2 and R3 subgenomes arose at different timepoints in R. canina and R. agrestis. This is further supported by the Ks-based divergence time estimation obtained from SCOs (Supplementary Fig. 6) and comparable findings from the high differentiation between their R3 subgenomes (Supplementary Fig. 8). Together, these findings suggest that modern dogroses originated through independent, stepwise hybridization events.

Only bivalent-forming chromosomes are able to segregate properly and produce viable haploid (1x) pollen in dogroses. We therefore used flow sorting to isolate pollen nuclei as a proxy to confirm which subgenomes are exclusively pollen-inherited and form bivalents in dogroses. We successfully collected around 200,000 generative nuclei from pollen samples (Fig. 2a) of 9 pentaploid dogrose accessions (including 3 accessions of R. canina, 2 of R. corymbifera, both subsect. Caninae; and 3 of R. rubiginosa, subsect. Rubigineae) and analysed them using single-copy orthologous nuclear locus target enrichment (Methods). This enabled us to create sample-specific reference sequences for each SCO locus. We mapped a total of 5,794 SCO sequences to the R. canina S27 genome and identified 7 major chromosome pairs, with most hits in R. canina pollen located on the S1_h1/h2 chromosomes (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 2). By contrast, R. rubiginosa pollen showed hits primarily on the R3 and R4 chromosomes (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 2). By leveraging dogrose pollen SCO mappings on the R. canina genome, we unambiguously identified seven pairs of bivalent-forming chromosomes across several dogrose species. Moreover, mapping SCO loci to the R. agrestis genome revealed that the R4_h1/h2 subgenome forms bivalents in this species (Extended Data Fig. 5a). These results confirm that bivalent-forming chromosomes in subsect. Caninae form univalents in subsect. Rubigineae and vice versa34,35.

The bubble map represents chromosomal hits, which were selectively filtered to display loci with a single alternative hit. The size of the symbols corresponds to the mean counts of pollen SCOs mapped to each chromosomal pair, identifying seven pollen-inherited chromosomes from the S1 subgenome within the R. canina (subsect. Caninae) genome assembly. In R. rubiginosa (subsect. Rubigineae), pollen SCO mapped preferentially to the R3 and R4 subgenomes. c, Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of the genus Rosa based on SCO loci including those retrieved from chromosome-scale assemblies and all pollen samples.

The x axis shows the coverage histogram of the short reads from this species mapped to each R. canina subgenome. The y axis shows the probability densities. The hybrid revealed doubled coverage for R4, indicating the presence of two sets of R4 copies, biparentally inherited, while only one set of maternally inherited S1 was detected, confirming sexual reproduction and the subgenome's inheritance through male and female meiosis.

Next, we aligned SCO loci obtained from the R. canina S27, R. canina DToL and R. agrestis DToL subgenomes, along with pollen DNA from section Caninae and different diploid rose samples and outgroups. This resulted in 58 sequences, totalling 642,158 positions derived from 1,904 concatenated SCO loci. Subgenome-wise as well as chromosome-wise phylogenetic analysis delineated two large clades within the genus Rosa: the Synstylae clade and the Rosa clade, as well as the earlier splits of subg. Hulthemia (Rosa persica), subg. Hesperhodos (Rosa stellata) and sect. Pimpinellifoliae (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 3). The tree corroborates the allopolyploid origin of dogroses13,28,29,30. In R. canina (subsect. Caninae), the bivalent-forming subgenome (S1) and the univalent-forming subgenome S2 clustered in the Synstylae clade, while the univalent-forming subgenomes R3 and R4 were part of the Rosa clade, sister to the European species R. majalis. All of the subgenomes of R. agrestis grouped with the corresponding R. canina subgenome samples, supporting a common origin of individual subgenomes despite the high differentiation observed in S2 and R3 subgenomes (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8). However, the pollen SCO data from all R. rubiginosa samples grouped as sister to both R3 and R4 subgenomes from R. canina and R. agrestis, respectively, implying multiple origins of the bivalent-forming chromosomes in subsect. Rubigineae. Notably, the pollen SCO data from R. canina ‘CAN2' was sister to the univalent-forming subgenome S2, suggesting some intraspecific variation in the bivalent-forming subgenomes within R. canina (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 3), as indicated by variation in microsatellite alleles from bivalent-forming chromosomes in R. canina26. Supported by the respective clustering of bivalent-bearing pollen data from subsect. Caninae and subsect. Rubigineae, our data demonstrate an independent origin for the bivalent-forming subgenomes of dogroses and, consequently, the independent origins of asymmetric meiosis34,35. Furthermore, the finding that representatives of subsect. Caninae and subsect. Rubigineae (including the newly generated plastome assemblies for R. canina and R. agrestis) contain phylogenetically distant plastids from the Synstylae clade13,31,32,33 (Extended Data Fig. 5b) supports the hypothesis that two progenitors from the Synstylae clade formed reciprocal hybrids, which subsequently incorporated R genomes through pollen donors.

While haploid (1x) pollen nuclei are clearly a product of Canina meiosis (Fig. 2a,b), tetraploid (4x) sexually derived egg cells were inferred by the respected embryo/endosperm ratio in seeds (Fig. 2d). In sexually reproducing diploids with double fertilization of the egg cell and the polar nuclei, the endosperm/embryo ratio is 1.5 (3x endosperm/2x embryo; Extended Data Fig. 5c). However, in sexually reproducing 5x dogroses, the ratio was found to be 1.8, indicating a 9x endosperm and a 5x embryo (Fig. 2d), similar to previous findings42. To further check the reproduction mode of dogroses, we have investigated the genome composition of two synthetic hybrids obtained from controlled crossing experiments43. In the first cross, the female gamete came from R. canina (subsect. Caninae) and the male donor was R. rubiginosa (subsect. Rubigineae). As anticipated from the result of the Canina meiosis, the subgenome contribution in the hybrid was consistent with the expected 4x egg cell containing one copy of each S1/S2/R3/R4 subgenome from R. canina and a 1x pollen nucleus with the R4 subgenome from R. rubiginosa (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5d). In the second case, the female gamete came from R. rubiginosa and the male donor was R. corymbifera—a very close relative of R. canina44. Again, the hybrid showed the expected subgenome composition, consisting of a male haploid S1 subgenome and a female tetraploid S1/S2/R3/R4 subgenome (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). These results are in agreement with S1 and R4 being bivalent-forming subgenomes and confirm the 1x male versus 4x female gamete composition. Our findings further suggest that different subgenomes are potentially interexchangeable in hybridization events; however, hybrids in extant populations originated mostly from unreduced eggs suggesting some subsection-specific differentiation subgenomes, which might impact bivalent formation45.

To gain further insights into the subgenome differentiation of R. canina, we aimed to characterize its global repeat composition, both genome-wide and specifically at centromeres. The R. canina genome exhibited a very high content of LTR Ty1/Copia elements, which made up 40% of the total repeat content, compared with 23% of Ty3/Gypsy elements. Among the Ty1/Copia elements, the BIANCA family accounted for more than 45% of all annotated full-length LTR-RTs while, among the Ty3/Gypsy elements, RETAND and ATHILA were the largest classes found, comprising 10% and 8% of all annotated full-length LTR-RTs, respectively. Tandem repeats, that is, satellite DNA, were mainly composed of the (peri)centromeric CANR4 repeats15,20 and rDNA sequences (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Data 4). The repeat profile across the 35 chromosomes revealed prominent 2–3 Mb peaks of highly dense repeats probably corresponding to the centromeres (Fig. 3a).

The colour-intensity histograms (top right) show the number of alignments versus pairwise sequence similarity. The sequence tracks plotted below highlight the main classes of repeats identified and the respective association with CENH3 and DNA methylation. The window size in b and c is 10 kb. For the y axes in a–c, all features were scaled [0, 1]; the original values are provided in Supplementary Fig. 10. d, CENH3 ChIP–seq enrichment (log2[CENH3/H3]) compared with the densities of the centromeric elements ATHILA and CANR4 in 50 kb windows, and DNA methylation in the CpG, CHG and CHH sequence contexts, for each subgenome. Only the centromere proximity regions are shown—10% of the centromere-to-telomere distance. Centromeres (CEN) were defined by the maximum CENH3 enrichment. All signal values (y axis) were scaled from 0 to 1 based on the global minimum to global maximum, except for DNA methylation, for which the original percentage values were retained. e, Linear regression of CANR4 size and CENH3 abundance on the centromere across all chromosomes. Each dot coloured by its subgenome presents a centromere. The abundance of CENH3 was calculated by the sum of CENH3 ChIP–seq (log2[CENH3/H3]) signals on centromeres normalized to coverage. The R2 of the linear regression model is 0.84. The Spearman's rank correlation is 0.93. Note the high CENH3 enrichment for the cenLTR1-based centromere in Rca1_R4, which lacks CANR4 repeats. Source data are provided in Supplementary Data 15.

To validate the DNA sequences associated with functional centromeres, we developed an R. canina centromeric histone H3 (CENH3)-specific antibody and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq). Notably, our results revealed two main types of centromere composition—Ty3/Gypsy ATHILA and CANR4 satellite-based centromeres (Fig. 3a,b). Analysis of the centromere-wide repeat structures revealed that ATHILA-based centromeres were most frequent in the chromosomes of the S1 and R4 subgenomes, while larger CANR4-based centromeres were found across all chromosomes in the S2 and R3 subgenomes (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Fig. 10). CANR4 centromeric arrays were also found in 3 out of 7 syntenic groups (2, 4 and 5) of the S1_h1/h2 bivalent-forming chromosomes and in two R4 chromosomes, in which these arrays were frequently interrupted by ATHILA elements (Fig. 3a–c, Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 3). A similar centromeric sequence composition was observed in both R. canina and R. agrestis from DToL, despite considerable variation in sequence length (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12 and Supplementary Data 5–8). Further structural sequence analysis of the diploid relatives R. chinensis and R. rugosa revealed that CANR4 repeats are present in only four and three centromeric regions, respectively, while centrophilic ATHILA elements were found in all centromeres (Supplementary Data 9–11). Together, our results confirm the expansion and predominance of CANR4-based centromeres in exclusively maternally inherited univalent chromosomes in dogroses20.

Moreover, we identified two centromeres of R. canina S27 from the R4 subgenome (Rca1_R4 and Rca4_R4) that lack CANR4 repeats but exhibited high affinity for CENH3 in regions other than ATHILA elements. These two centromeres were characterized by the presence of several tandem-repeat sequences with very long monomers ranging from 1,425 to 2,596 bp. Detailed characterization of these tandem-repeat arrays has revealed that all of these sequences identified are probably derived from different centrophilic ATHILA elements, as they all share over 75% similarity with their LTR sequences and are therefore referred to cenLTR1–4 (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 13). Notably, the cenLTR arrays showed significantly higher CENH3 enrichment compared with neighbouring ATHILA elements, with the most pronounced enrichment observed in Rca1_R4, which contained a large array of cenLTR1 (235 kb; Extended Data Fig. 6). Although cenLTR arrays found in Rca4_R4 were shorter and characterized by less CENH3 enrichment compared with cenLTR1 in Rca1_R4, we found two different arrays of cenLTR2 and cenLTR3 with higher enrichment than neighbouring ATHILAs. Furthermore, the cenLTR1 monomer sequence showed over 85% similarity to the LTR sequences of ATHILAs in Rca4_R4; however, it was not found in tandem arrays in this chromosome (Supplementary Fig. 13). Notably, these cenLTR arrays were not detected in either of the DToL genome assemblies of R. canina or R. agrestis (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12), suggesting that the formation of these centromeric tandem repeat arrays is a very recent evolutionary event.

To investigate the epigenetic organization within centromeres, we analysed DNA methylation patterns across chromosome arms, scaling from the telomeres to the centromere midpoints. Methylation levels were generally elevated at centromeres across CpG, CHG and CHH contexts. However, DNA methylation was slightly reduced, particularly in CANR4-based centromeres (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 14). These findings suggest distinct methylation patterns in CANR4 centromeres compared with ATHILA-based centromeres. Indeed, ATHILA accumulation was less pronounced in the centromeres of univalents of S2 and R3 subgenomes, despite a few insertions being found within CANR4 centromeric arrays (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 14). Notably, ATHILA insertions in CANR4 arrays disrupted CENH3 binding, while ATHILA-based centromeres were smaller and showed a lower level of CENH3 association compared with CANR4-based centromeres (Fig. 3b–d, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 14). Frequent insertion of ATHILA elements into CANR4 arrays was also observed in R. agrestis and the diploid roses R. chinensis and R. rugosa (Supplementary Data 7–11). A similar disruption of centromere activity by centrophilic ATHILA has been recently found within Arabidopsis centromeres46,47.

We further observed a positive correlation between the amount of CANR4 repeats and CENH3 abundance along R. canina S27 centromeres (Fig. 3e). In fact, the total centromere length, as the measurement of the CENH3-binding regions per subgenome, confirmed that the S2 and R3 centromeres were larger compared with those of S1 and R4 (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Data 5). Most CANR4-based centromeres showed increased levels of CENH3 accumulation compared with the CANR4-less ones. Notably, the centromere on Rca1_R4, which is mainly based on a cenLTR1 array (Extended Data Fig. 6), showed one of the highest enrichments for CENH3 among CANR4-less centromeres (Fig. 3e). Thus, tandem repeats bearing different monomer composition seem to accumulate high CENH3 levels in the R. canina centromeres.

CENH3 immunostaining of R. canina chromosomes revealed differences in the size of individual centromeres (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Video 1; n = 12). The size difference was further confirmed by immunostaining analysis of the kinetochore component KNL148 (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b; n = 23). Furthermore, in situ hybridization with probes for CANR4 and ATHILA on mitotic (n = 15) and meiotic (n = 18) chromosomes of R. canina confirmed the predominance of large CANR4 signals at the centromeres of univalents, while all bivalent and almost all univalents showed ATHILA centromeric signals (Extended Data Fig. 8c–k). In the diploids R. chinensis and R. rugosa, CANR4 centromeric signals were observed in only three pairs of chromosomes while, again, ATHILA was found in all centromeric regions (Extended Data Fig. 8l,m). Thus, the observed difference in the size of CENH3 centromeric signals is probably associated with the accumulation of CANR4 satellite repeats, supporting our ChIP–seq analysis (Fig. 3e). These results confirm the bimodal architecture of R. canina centromeres, which are preferentially ATHILA-based in bivalents and CANR4-based in univalents, with the caveat that our ChIP–seq experiment was performed using leaf tissue.

a, Centromeres on all chromosomes were detected by CENH3 protein in mitotic metaphase. Note the size difference in CENH3 signals among different chromosomes. b,c, Centromeric organization during early prophase I. d, The orientation of centromeres during the diakinesis stage. e, Metaphase I with univalents (U) surrounding the bivalents (B); the dashed line highlights the typical clustering of bivalents in the middle. f, Metaphase I, with all chromosomes organized in the equatorial plate initiating the segregation of homologous pairs (in the case of bivalents) and separation of sister chromatids (in the case of univalents). g,h, Early (g) and late (h) anaphase I shows early separation of bivalents, while sister chromatids of univalents usually lagging behind. i,j, During metaphase II (i) and anaphase II (j), two main spindles are formed, while lagged chromosomes are still attached to additional abnormal spindles (arrowheads). At anaphase II (j), sister centromeres of the bivalent-forming chromosomes finally segregate to form haploid gametes, while single chromatids from univalents lag behind and are eliminated. Experiments were independently repeated at least ten times with similar results to track all meiotic stages represented here. Scale bar, 5 µm (j).

Next, we investigated the behaviour of centromeres and spindle dynamics during male meiosis of R. canina. Our immunostaining analysis using antibodies against CENH3 and alpha-tubulin clarified the asymmetric distribution of chromosomes during meiosis. In early stages of male meiosis, both small and large centromeres were visible (Fig. 4b–d and Supplementary Videos 2–4; n = 31). At onset of metaphase I, we observed seven bivalents organized at the centre of the cell surrounded by 21 univalents (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Video 5; n = 31), a configuration that was first proposed over a century ago2,3,22,23. During this stage, microtubules facilitated the separation of the homologous pairs through bipolar attachment, while univalents also showed bipolar attachment (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Video 6; n = 31). In early and late anaphase I, homologous chromosomes migrated first, while single chromatids derived from univalents lagged behind (Fig. 4g,h and Supplementary Videos 7 and 8; n = 31). Notably, we observed two groups of univalents exhibiting different timing in sister-chromatid separation (Fig. 4g,h (arrows)). During metaphase and anaphase II, we frequently observed both normal and abnormal spindles, resulting from single chromatids lagging behind from anaphase I (Fig. 4i,j (arrowheads)). Homologous pairs derived from bivalents separated normally at end of anaphase II, forming haploid nuclei with seven chromosomes, while single chromatids from univalents lagged behind and were probably eliminated (Fig. 4i,j and Supplementary Videos 9 and 10; n = 31). Despite the apparent irregularities in male meiosis, viable pollen grains in R. canina (S27) were produced at a rate of approximately 20% (Supplementary Fig. 16a,b). Notably, while at the end of meiosis polyads are formed showing nuclei with varying number of centromere foci (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Video 11), the mature binucleate pollen grains seem to contain only a haploid vegetative (1n = 1x = 7 chromosomes) and generative (2n) nucleus, as confirmed by their genome size and composition (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 16c). This suggests that, despite meiotic irregularities, a selective mechanism ensures the formation of haploid pollen. Our findings highlight how the atypical centromere behaviour and spindle dynamics during male meiosis in R. canina deviates from canonical meiotic processes but can still result in viable pollen production.

By leveraging newly generated genome assemblies of dogroses, we shed light onto the long-standing century-old mystery of the unique Canina meiosis2,3,22,23. Through structural analysis of subgenomes and centromeres, combined with pollen-derived genomics and hybridization experiments, we demonstrate that the bivalent-forming subgenomes in dogroses evolved independently and exhibit distinct interaction patterns during meiosis (Fig. 5).

a, Reproduction mode and centromere evolution of the pentaploid dogroses. Dogroses of subsect. Caninae have two copies of the S1 subgenome, while dogroses of subsect. Rubigineae have two copies of the R4 subgenome. The S2 and R3 subgenomes are found as a single copy only. During meiosis in subsect. Caninae, the S1_h1/S1_h2 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted to both pollen and egg cells. The remaining univalent subgenomes (S2, R3 and R4) are transmitted by the egg cell only. By contrast, in subsect. Rubigineae, the R4_h1/R4_h2 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted to both pollen and egg cells, while the remaining univalent subgenomes S1, S2 and R3 are transmitted only by the egg cell. The analyses of centromeric sequence composition revealed a dominance in ATHILA LTRs in most of the bivalent-forming centromeres of S1 and R4 subgenomes. By contrast, larger CANR4-based centromeres were found in all chromosomes of the permanently univalent S2 and R3 subgenomes. b, The model for the origin of dogrose subsections. On the basis of the findings that representatives of subsect. Caninae and subsect. Rubigineae contain phylogenetic distant plastids from the Synstylae clade13,31,32,33 (Extended Data Fig. 5b), we propose that two progenitors of the Synstylae clade formed reciprocal hybrids and additionally incorporated R genomes through pollen donors. Subgenomes are represented by one chromosome. Synstylae subgenomes S1 (violet) and S2 (light blue) and Rosa clade subgenomes R3 (light orange) and R4 (dark orange) are shown.

The bimodal architecture of centromeres in R. canina is particularly intriguing when considered alongside its asymmetric female meiosis, in which univalent chromosomes are obligatorily transmitted through the egg cell3,49. The prevalence of CANR4 repeats in univalent centromeres could possibly link centromere expansion with their drive in female meiosis (Fig. 5a), a phenomenon in which larger centromeres are preferentially transmitted during meiosis37,50,51. The structural divergence and selective enrichment of CANR4 repeats in the centromeres of univalents may underpin their larger size, ensuring the preferential transmission of univalents through the egg cell and, therefore, maintaining the pentaploid genome structure. This may represent a rare case of an obligate drive mechanism, functioning in a ‘drive or die' manner to maximize the transmission of univalents. However, the occasional presence of ATHILA-based centromeres in some univalent chromosomes suggests that CANR4 expansion alone does not fully explain univalent drive. Furthermore, the structural divergence of centromeres seems also to influence their behaviour in male meiosis, as large CANR4-based centromeres in univalents could possibly promote bipolar orientation and premature chromatid separation in male meiosis. Notably, in Arabidopsis thaliana, bipolar orientation of univalents happens only when sister chromatid cohesion is defective52, but it appears to be more common in wheat univalents53. This observation contrasts with that of female meiosis, in which univalents seem to have monopolar orientation in dogroses3 (Supplementary Fig. 17). Thus, a potential role for sexual dimorphism in sister chromatid cohesion regulation could be part of the adaptations enabling Canina meiosis.

It is possible that the absence of a homologous pair (and therefore a competing centromere) in the obligatory univalents (S2 and R3 subgenomes) may facilitate the expansion of CANR4 repeats. By contrast, the S1 and R4 centromeres, which exist within a competitive pairing environment, experience counterbalancing forces that limit CANR4 accumulation (Fig. 5a). This is further supported by the absence of solely CANR4-based centromeres in diploid roses R. chinensis and R. rugosa. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence for the emergence of few tandem repeats originating from LTR sequences, which outcompete neighbouring ATHILA elements for CENH3 binding in two R4 univalent chromosomes (Rca1_R4 and Rca4_R4). These findings highlight the higher affinity of tandem repeats for centromere function in dogroses, further emphasizing the role of centromere composition in shaping meiotic behaviour. However, while the observed correlation is intriguing, we acknowledge that future studies will be essential to confirm whether the expansion of CANR4 in univalent centromeres is directly linked to their drive during female meiosis.

Despite the lack of recombination, univalent chromosomes retain functional protein-coding genes, as evidenced by high BUSCO completeness and the absence of differential selection pressures. This supports a relatively recent origin of modern dogroses and highlights the resilience of their polyploid genome. Phylogenetic analyses using pollen SCOs and maternally inherited plastid markers further corroborate the polyphyletic origin of dogroses13,31,32,33 with multiple hybridization events contributing to their evolutionary history (Fig. 5b). The distinct subgenome ratios observed in R. canina (3:2 Synstylae to Rosa) and R. agrestis (2:3 Synstylae to Rosa) underscore the complexity of their hybrid origins30,32. Pollen SCO data align with cytogenetic studies, indicating that bivalent-forming subgenomes in the subsections Caninae and Rubigineae are phylogenetically distant34,35. Moreover, multiple origins for R. canina are suggested, as the S1 subgenome clusters with five R. canina individuals, while the S2 subgenome clustered with another individual. This model aligns with reports of Canina-like meiosis arising spontaneously in hybrids of diploid sexual Synstylae species54, further highlighting the complex hybrid origin and evolutionary dynamics of dogroses.

For genome sequencing, we used the same individual of R. canina (S27), which has already been cytogenetically analysed34 (voucher: GLM12396) from a natural stand (WGS84: 51.1732° N; 14.6271° E; Weißenberg, Saxony, Germany). A vegetative runner was dug on 28 March 2022 and planted in a pot. Clones of the collected plant specimen were cultivated in a greenhouse at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Germany.

High molecular mass genomic DNA was isolated from leaves using the NucleoBond HMW DNA Kit (Macherey Nagel). A HiFi library was prepared according to the manual of the HiFi SMRTbell Libraries using SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences) with initial DNA fragmentation using Diagenode Megaruptor 3 and final library size binning into defined fractions by Blue Pippin with 0.75% agarose cassettes (Sage Science). The size distribution was again controlled by a Femto pulse system (Agilent). Size-selected libraries were then sequenced on the Sequel II device with a Binding Kit 2.0 and Sequel II Sequencing Kit 2.0 for 30 h using two SMRT cells (Pacific Biosciences). Moreover, a chromatin-capture library was prepared from 0.5 g of fresh-weight leaf material input. All treatments were performed according to the recommendations of the Dovetail Omni-C kit for plants (Dovetail Genomics). As a final step, an Illumina-compatible library was prepared (Dovetail) and paired-end 2 × 150 bp deep-sequenced on the HiSeq 3000 (Illumina) device. All libraries were sequenced at the Max Planck Genome Centre Cologne at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research.

A phased chromosome-level genome was assembled using the generated PacBio HiFi and Hi-C data. First, a phased primary assembly was obtained by running Hifiasm55 using 50 Gb of PacBio HiFi reads in combination with Dovetail Omni-C reads with the following command: hifiasm -o out.phased.asm.hic --h1 hic.R1.fastq.gz --h2 hic.R2.fastq.gz hifi.reads.fastq.gz. In the default diploid mode, we generated two sets of phased contigs. Each set was further scaffolded to the chromosome scale using Salsa256, followed by successive rounds of manual curation and rescaffolding. We then identified 14 and 21 pseudochromosomes, respectively.

We used Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologues (BUSCO, v.5.4.0)57 to evaluate the completeness of 35 chromosome-level scaffolds and for each of the four subgenomes. The lineage database used for running BUSCO was eudicots_odb10. The protein sequences were converted from the assembly using the GFF analysis toolkit AGAT: agat_sp_extract_sequences.pl -g annotation.gff -f genome.fasta -p --type cds -o protein.fasta. The k-mer-based tool Merqury (v.1.3)58 was used to estimate both the completeness and base quality of the chromosome assembly. The quality value of the chromosome assembly was greater than 66.6, and the quality value of each chromosome was at least 62. Read k-mers were built from HiFi sequences by Meryl (v1.3) with a k-mer size of 31 bp.

During the scaffolding step, we noted the absence of approximately 20 Mb (including the centromere) on chromosome Rca2_S1_h2. Further validation using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that this chromosome should indeed have a large array of CANR4, as found in its homologous chromosome Rca2_S1_h1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). We noted that this assembly error was probably generated by the presence of a small translocation found at the start of the missing region in Rca_S1_h2 compared with Rca_S1_h1. We further mapped the HiFi reads to the region present in Rca_S1_h1 and found robust evidence for the presence of five copies of this region in the genome. We then concluded that this region was incorrectly missing from the Hifiasm assembly due to its high degree of similarity between the S1_h1 and S1_h2 haplotypes. We therefore duplicated the Rca2_S1_h1 region (37265454–54065178 bp) and manually assigned it to the expected position on Rca_S1_h2 (from Rca2_S1_h2: 33518152 bp).

We also downloaded available data from the Darwin Tree of Life (DToL) project for another accession of R. canina (PRJEB79801) and for R. agrestis (PRJEB79880) and performed phased chromosome-level genome assemblies as described above. R. agrestis from DToL revealed two copies of the R4 subgenome; our previous studies suggested that some accessions of R. agrestis were of hybrid origin, which should then have two copies of S1 subgenome45,59.

k-mer analysis to estimate genome size was performed using jellyfish (v.2.3.0)60 and Genomescope (v.2.0)61. The pentaploidy of R. canina was further confirmed and analysed using Smudgeplot (v.0.2.5)61.

To clarify the maternal lineage of the allopolyploid R. canina (S27), we assembled the plastid genome of the sequenced individual. GetOrganelle (v.1.7.7.0)62 was used to de novo assemble the first draft of the plastid genome using 2× 150 bp Illumina short-read data (Sequence Read Archive (SRA): ERS1370372). This toolkit implements Bowtie 263 to initially find reads mapped to a plant chloroplast database and SPAdes64 for de novo assembly and iterative extension. During the assembly and iteration process, BLAST+65 was used to identify off-target contigs, which were then removed or trimmed. The resulting plastid genome was then used as a reference for mapping the original reads back using Geneious Prime v.2023.2.1 (Biomatters), allowing only mapping of paired reads mapped nearby with a minimum overlap of 75 bp and a minimum overlap identity of 98%. The results were manually examined and corrected where necessary.

The initial annotation of the chloroplast genome was performed using GeSeq (v.2.03)66. The annotation included the chloroplast inverted repeats (IRs), rps12 interspersed gene, protein-coding sequences, tRNAs and rRNAs using 55% identity as thresholds for annotation of proteins and 90% for DNA as well as RNAs. Furthermore, tRNAscan-SE (v.2.0.7)67 and Chloë (v.0.1.0)68 were used as additional annotators within GeSeq. The annotations were manually edited using Geneious Prime v.2023.2.1 (Biomatters). The presence of chloroplast genomes differing in the orientation of the single-copy units (large single-copy (LSC) region, small single-copy (SSC) region) was checked by selecting motifs from the border region of the IR and the single-copy units (LSC-trnH-GUG 5′-GGTTCAATTCCCGTCGTTC-3′ or LSC-rps19 5′-GTGACACGTTCACTGAAAAAA-3′ and IRb-rps19-rpl2-IGS 5′-AGACGAAGAAACAAATTCTAT-3′; SSC-ndhF 5′-TGTAATAATATAATAATTGAA-3′ or SSC-ycf1 5′-CGACCCTAAACGATGGAATCG-3′ and IRa-ycf1 5′-TTGAAAAACCCGTTGTAACTAT-3′), noting their relative orientation to each other on the same reads using SeqKit (v.2.6.1)69.

The assembled R. canina chloroplast genome had a length of 156,650 bp and a classical quadripartite structure (Supplementary Fig. 18): a LSC of 85,634 bp (~56.57% of the plastid genome), a SSC of 18,878 bp (~12.05%) and two IR regions of 26,069 bp (~16.64% each). Different isomers were found to differ in the orientation of the SSC and LSC (flip-flop configuration).

We computed a chloroplast phylogeny using 37 samples, including sequences downloaded from GenBank and newly assembled data (Supplementary Data 17). The alignment was performed with MAFFT70, and the phylogenetic tree was calculated using IQ-TREE71 with the following settings: -m MFP --con-tree --burnin 250 -B 1000 -T 36 --wbtl.

The assembled chromosomes were subjected to pairwise comparisons presented as dot plots using the Synteny Mapping and Analysis (SyMAP) tool72. Multiple alignments within the synteny groups comprising five R. canina chromosomes plus R. chinensis and R. rugosa assemblies were carried out in the CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC) using the ‘whole genome alignment' plugin with the following parameters: minimum initial seed length of 250; minimum alignment block length of 250. The aligned chromosomes were subjected to pairwise comparisons. The similarity values were calculated as the block fraction of the two genomes that were aligned (that is, the alignment percentage) or as the percentage of exactly matching nucleotides within the aligned blocks (the average nucleotide identity).

Multifasta files containing assembled short-read sequences of pollen SCO loci from eight different dogrose individuals (three samples of R. canina, two samples of R. corymbifera (subsect. Caninae) and three samples of R. rubiginosa (subsect. Rubigineae)) that were not sequenced by long reads (Supplementary Data 17) were used as queries to map them with the software BWA73 with the aln command to the R. canina chromosome assembly. From the sequence alignment map (.sam) file, those chromosome hits with only one alternative were filtered according to the ‘XA:Z:' flag using a Python script written by GPT-4 (ChatGPT Plus, OpenAI). A bubble map displaying the mean counts of chromosome pairs within different subsections was drawn with ggplot274.

Chromosome synteny was analysed with the Synteny and Rearrangement Identifier (SyRI)75. For this purpose, chromosomes of subgenomes S1_h1, S1_h2, S3, R3 and R4 were aligned against each other within each linkage group (Rca1–Rca7) by minimap276,77 using the following command: minimap2 -ax asm5 --eqx -t 16 genome1.fa genome2.fa | samtools sort -@8 > aln.sorted.bam. Moreover, subgenome S1 was also aligned with R. chinensis (NCBI: GCA_041222415)16 and R. canina subgenome R4 was aligned with R. rugosa (NCBI: GCA_958449725.1; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) to analyse its synteny. To keep all of the chromosomes arranged in the same order as R. canina and for better visualization, chromosomes 2, 5 and 7 of R. chinensis were inverted, and the chromosomes of R. rugosa were reordered to 6, 1 (inverted), 7, 5 (inverted), 2, 3 and 4, corresponding to chromosomes 1–7 in R. canina. SyRI was implemented for all of the aligned genome pairs using the following command: syri -c aln.sorted.bam -r genome1.fa -q genome2.fa -k -F B --nc 16. Visualization revealed only syntenic blocks over 50 kb, which was performed by plots: Python PLOTsr --sr rugosa_R4/syri.out --sr R4_R5/syri.out --sr R5_s3/syri.out –sr S3 _S2/syri.out --sr S2_S1/syri.out --sr S1_chinensis/syri.out --genomes genomes.txt -o out_50k.pdf -S 0.7 -W 10 -H 9 -f 10 --itx -s 50000.

Syntenic orthologues among the primary annotations of diploid strawberry Fragaria nilgerrensis78, R. chinensis16, R. rugosa (GCA_958449725.1, DToL; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) and the five sets of chromosomes of R. canina were inferred using the GENESPACE (v.1.2.3)79 pipeline with the default parameters. In brief, GENESPACE compares protein similarity scores into syntenic blocks using MCScanX80 and Orthofinder (v.2.5.4)81 to search for orthologues/paralogues within synteny constrained blocks. Syntenic blocks were used to query pairwise peptide differences among progenitor alleles, determine divergence among progenitor orthologues using R. chinensis syntenic anchors and search for specific orthogroups.

Synteny information was obtained using the SynMap tool on the CoGe platform82,83. Only genes within synteny blocks were considered, including not only gene pairs but also singleton genes in each genome that lost their counterpart in the other genome due to fractionation or other gene loss. The identification of syntelogues between species was performed using SynMap2 (https://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/SynMap2), which internally uses LAST for sequence alignments84, and then fractionation bias was analysed with FractBias85.

Protein-coding sequences (CDSs) were extracted for each R. canina subgenome according to coordinates from the gene structural annotation file using GffRead (v.0.12.6)86 and translated into amino acid sequences using the transeq command from EMBOSS87. Additional amino acid sequences and CDSs of R. rugosa (BioProject: PRJNA1061178; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/), R. chinensis (NCBI: GCF_002994745.2)14 and Fragaria vesca (NCBI: GCF_000184155.1)88 were downloaded. The CDS and amino acid sequences were validated, for example, for correct start codons or methionine as the first amino acid in the proteins, using Python scripts. The confirmed proteomes were subsequently analysed using OrthoFinder81 to identify common single-copy orthologues. According to the protein IDs, FASTA files for each orthologue gene containing five proteins of R. canina together with the three of outgroups were aligned with MAFFT (v.7.490)70. On the basis of the aligned proteins, corresponding CDSs were codon based aligned using PAL2NAL89 and DNA alignments were transformed into PHYLIP format. The PAML pipeline90 with yn00 was used in a looped pairwise mode over all PHYLIP files for each subgenome and outgroup to estimate the nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution rates, as well as their ratio (dN/dS = ω). The results based on the Yang–Nielsen91 method were extracted from PAML output files and combined using a Python script and graphical visualized with ggplot274 in the R environment92. To covert the relative evolutionary time (Timet) from yn00 into absolute divergence time (TMa) in millions of years ago (Ma), we used F. vesca as a fixed calibration point with its fossil record of 2.96 Ma (refs. 93,94). The relative divergence time Timet for each pairwise compared gene was multiplied with a scaling factor as follows:

All scripts were developed with the help of ChatGPT-4o (ChatGPT Plus, OpenAI).

We first generated whole-chromosome multiple alignments in synteny groups 1–7 using the Whole Genome Alignment tool in ClC workbench (Qiagen). The algorithm identifies seeds, that is, short stretches of nucleotide sequences that are shared between multiple genomes but not present multiple times in the same genome. These seeds were then extended using a HOXD scoring matrix, and the HOXD substitution score was combined with an adjustment term based on k-mer frequency to avoid spurious matches to repetitive regions in the genome95. The program parameters were as follows: minimum initial seed length, 250; minimum alignment blocks, 250; and mismatches in seeds, allowed. The chromosome phylogenies were constructed from multiple alignments using RAxML (v.8.2.12)96 with the GTRGAMMAI model. The diploid accessions were chromosome assemblies of R. chinensis16 and R. rugosa. For R. rugosa, the original chromosomes were renamed to fit the R. chinensis synteny.

We used SubPhaser41 (default parameters) to phase and partition the subgenomes of the pentaploid R. canina and R. agrestis by assigning chromosomes to subgenomes based on differential repetitive k-mers. These were assumed to have expanded during the period of independent evolution after divergence from the nearest common ancestor and before the stepwise hybridization events (the divergence–hybridization period). A subgenome is considered to be well phased when it displays distinct patterns of both differential k-mers and homoeologous chromosomes, confirming the presence of subgenome-specific features, as expected. As the S1_h1 and S1_h2 chromosomes represent haplotypes of the S1 genome, only the S1_h1 haplotype was used in the phasing analysis together with the sets of S2, R3 and R4 chromosomes.

LTR insertion times were calculated by Subphaser as follows: LTR-TRs were de novo detected using LTRharvest (v.1.6.1)97 and LTRfinder (v.1.07)98. To reduce false positives, TEsorter (v.1.3.0)99 was used to reconstruct the classification of LTR-RTs and further refine this classification. The subgenome-specific k-mer sequences were mapped to the LTR-RT sequences using a substring match procedure to identify the subgenome-specific LTR-RTs using the Fisher's exact test. Two LTRs of each subgenome-specific LTR-RT were retrieved and the nucleotide divergence was estimated using the Jukes–Cantor 1969 model. The insertion time (T) was calculated using the equation T  =  K/2r, where r  =  1.3 × 10–8 substitutions per year (default)100, and K represents the divergence of the LTRs from the LTR-RT.

To isolate the nuclei from embryo and endosperm tissue, nutlets from fruits of the sequenced individual of R. canina S27 (voucher: GLM12396) were first cracked with pliers. The embryo and endosperm were then carefully transferred into a droplet of nuclei isolation buffer (CyStain PI Absolute P; Sysmex-Partec) in a Petri dish and chopped with a sharp razorblade. After adding additional nuclei isolation buffer to a final volume of 500 µl, the nuclei suspensions were filtered through 50 µm disposable filters (CellTrics, Sysmex-Partec), stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to a final concentration of 1.5 µg ml−1 and stored on ice until use. The measurements were performed on a CyFlow Space flow cytometer (Sysmex-Partec) equipped with a high-power UV LED (365 nm).

To analyse the phylogenetic origin of the subgenomes of allopentaploid R. canina, we sampled 30 rose individuals of 24 diploid species across the genus Rosa. Thus, R. stellata (subgen. Hesperhodos), 10 species from sect. Synstylae, seven from sect. Rosa (Cinnamomeae, including sect. Carolinae), four from sect. Pimpinellifoliae and one individual of R. chinensis (sect. Chinensis) were sampled from the living collection of the Europa-Rosarium Sangerhausen. Moreover, one accession of R. majalis (sect. Rosa) was collected from the Botanical Garden Würzburg, and R. persica (subg. Hulthemia) from Botanical Garden Jena. Species were rechecked using their respective floras101,102,103, and the material was compared with available herbarium specimens available online (JSTOR Global Plants, https://plants.jstor.org/; Moscow Digital Herbarium, https://plant.depo.msu.ru). Herbarium vouchers were deposited in the Herbarium Senckenbergianum Görlitz (GLM; Supplementary Data 17).

To determine bivalent-forming genomes, we sampled pollen from several individuals of Rosa sect. Caninae (subsect. Caninae: three 5x R. canina, two 5x R. corymbifera; subsect. Vestitae: one 5x R. pseudoscabriuscula; subsect. Rubigineae: three 5x R. rubiginosa; Supplementary Data 17). We collected anthers from 50 to 100 freshly opened flowers under dry weather conditions in early May 2021 in the field, stored them in open glass for 1 day to allow the anthers to open and subsequently transferred them to a 50 ml tube. Owing to electrostatic attraction, the pollen deposited on the walls of the tube. Anthers were carefully removed, and the pollen powder was collected at the bottom of the tube by gentle centrifugation. The pollen powder was then tapped out over clean paper and transferred to tubes with the help of a spatula. This procedure was repeated three times. Pollen grains were stored in a refrigerator until use.

Nuclei of mature pollen grains were isolated by the filter bursting method104 using the nuclear isolation buffer as described previously105. Pollen grains were burst on the surface of a 20 μm disposable CellTrics filter (Sysmex-Partec). The resulting nuclear suspension was stained with propidium iodide (50 µg ml−1, PI) and run on a BD Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Nuclear populations were identified in a dot plot showing the PI fluorescence signal (log scale) versus side scatter signal (SSC, log-scale). A sort gate was defined based on the corresponding fluorescence intensity (lin-scale) histogram. A total of 200,000 individual generative nuclei (volume, around 400 µl) were collected into a 1.5 ml reaction tube using the ‘1.0 Drop Pure' sorting mode of the BD FACS software (BD Biosciences). After adding 50 µl of 1× TE and 50 µl of NaN3, the nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation (1,000g for 10 min at 4 °C). Next, 300 µl of the supernatant was removed, and the nuclei with the remaining liquid were stored at −20 °C. The gating strategy to isolate generative nuclei of R. canina is presented in Supplementary Fig. 19.

DNA from diploid rose species was first extracted from 20 mg of silica-dried leaf tissue according to the ATMAB protocol106 and subsequently purified using the Mag-Bind Total Pure NGS Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Nocross) according to the manufacturer's manual. DNA from flow-sorted pollen nuclei was extracted using the Mag-Bind Plant DNA DS Kit with the modification that permanent but careful mixing was performed during binding and elution because the DNA quantities ranged from 37 ng to 236 ng. The DNA yield was quantified using the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

To analyse nuclear single-copy regions in rose genomes, we used published SCO tags107. The SCO tags were originally developed to be amplifiable by PCR and covered coding as well as non-coding regions. We used the 29,000 sequences from additional file 3 from ref. 107, which consisted of SCO tags of 17 rose species and seven outgroup species of the Rosaceae family. These sequences were filtered for uniqueness so that duplicates were removed and searched with BLAST in the R. chinensis haploid line genome (v.1.0)15. Owing to the structural gene model annotation of the R. chinensis genome, we were able to identify 923 full-length nuclear genes with single-copy characteristics. The target-capturing baits were designed by the Agilent bioinformatics service (I. Kisakesen, Agilent Technologies) and covered exons + UTRs with flanking regions and small introns of the selected genes in the R. chinensis genome. Finally, the target consisted of 5,794 sequences of different lengths (the shortest at 179 bp and the longest at 6,544 bp) named according to R. chinensis gene prediction and had a total size of 2 Mb (Supplementary Data 12). All target sequences were covered by 2× tiling with a total of 85,670 specific baits.

For target enrichment, we used the SureSelect XT HS2 DNA system with precapture pooling (Agilent Technologies) and target design as described above. For diploid roses, 200 ng of input DNA was used, and for pollen DNA, 36–200 ng of input DNA was sheared with a Bioruptor Pico sonication device (Diagenode) to a recommended fragment size of 180–250 bp. The Illumina short-read libraries were amplified for 9 cycles after adapter ligation, pooled for precapture to 16 samples and then postcapture library pools were amplified again with 12 cycles of PCR amplification. The library pools were sequenced in 150 bp paired-end mode on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system by Novogene with approximately 1 GB of data output per sample.

To analyse the ploidy of the samples, in vitro flow cytometry was performed on silica-dried leaflets according to a protocol described previously45 using R. arvensis (2n = 2x = 14) as an internal standard. The fluorescence intensity was measured using the CyFlow Ploidy Analyser (Sysmex Partec), and the data were analysed using Flowing Software v.2.5.1 (Turku Bioscience Centre). Each sample was measured three times with a minimum of 3,000 particles.

To estimate the ploidy of the samples in silico, we used K-Mer Counter (KMC) (v.3.1.1)108,109 to generate a k-mer database from FASTQ sequence files containing short-read data covering SCOs. The setting was a k-mer size of 21, a minimum count for a k-mer to be included of 1 and an upper limit for k-mer counts of 5,000. To avoid noise, KMC database reduction was performed using the transform operation with the L 30 and U 5000 settings. With smudgeplot61 analysis and its hetkzer operation, the coverages of the identified k-mer pairs were written to a ‘_coverages.tsv' file. A custom R script with ggplot274 and data.table packages92 was used to plot the distribution of frequencies of different SNP ratio classes. For each sample, the ploidy level was then estimated by visual inspection of the plots.

The raw SCO reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v.0.39)110 with the following settings: 2:30:8 LEADING:13 TRAILING:13 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:19 MINLEN:36. We updated the script from a previous study111 to run it with current package versions and used it for mapping, variant calling and sample-specific reference building. In brief, the trimmed short reads from the target enrichment sequencing were mapped against the SCO targets of the R. chinensis reference genome (5,794 sequences) using the BWA program73. Using SAMtools (v.1.16.1)112, the reads were sorted and indexed, and duplicates were removed. Notably, approximately 98% of trimmed reads were successfully mapped to the target. Hits with exactly one alternative mapping position were subsequently filtered. After mapping, the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (v.4.1.9.0)113 was used with the operation HaplotypeCaller114 for variant calling, BaseRecalibrator and ApplyBQSR were used to realign around SNPs and indels, and FastaAlternateReferenceMaker was used to create a sample-specific consensus sequence as a reference for each SCO locus in each sample. The provided ploidy level for the HaplotypeCaller was 2 (diploid) for both the pollen and diploid roses with regular meiosis, and the --max-alternate-alleles flag was set to 6, so that although the pollen is monoploid, it would be possible to call potential variances.

The SCO target was used as a query for a local search with BLAST+65 in our R. canina S27 genome assembly with a customized output table (-outfmt 6 qseqid sseqid pident length qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore) and additional in the DToL R. canina (PRJEB79801) and R. agrestis (PRJEB79880; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) genomes also assembled by us (see below). Those SCO loci that had only five hits, one each on subgenomes S1_h1, S1_h2, S2, R3, R4 and R4_h1, R4_h2, R3, S2 and S1 for R. agrestis, respectively and within the same linkage group, were filtered and considered single copies. A main list of common single-copy loci for all three genomes was created to preserve the correct order and used to extract the filtered loci from the BLAST outputs with the grep command. The filtered BLAST output was then converted into a BED file containing the sequence coordinates using a bash script written with the help of GPT-4 (ChatGPT Plus, OpenAI). Using the BEDtools (v.2.30.0)115 command getfasta, sequences for each SCO locus were extracted from the R. canina genome assembly and written into a multifasta file. To obtain sequences with the same strand orientation, two locus lists were also created: one of the loci with a positive strand orientation and one with a negative-strand orientation. Loci with negative-strand orientation were identified by calculating the end coordinates minus the start coordinates and filtering according to negative values. According to both lists, the sequences were extracted and stored in two separate multi-FASTA files. Sequences with negative-strand orientation were reversed and complemented with SeqKit116 and combined with the positive strand-oriented SCO sequences in one fasta file. Finally, for each subgenome (S1_h1/S1_h2, S2, R3, R4 for R. canina and R4_h1/h2, R3, S2, S1 for R. agrestis), the extracted SCO sequences were concatenated in the same order according to the main locus list and written to subgenome-specific fasta sequences. The same procedure was used for the haploid genome assemblies of Rubus ideaus (GenBank: GCA_030142095.1)117 and three strawberry species, F. vesca subsp. vesca (GCA_000184155.1)88, Fragaria iinumae (GCA_009720345.1)118 and F. nilgerrensis (GCA_010134655.1)78 as outgroups. Moreover, the same single-copy loci considered in the genome assembly were extracted and concatenated in the same order with target enrichment samples from nine pollen samples and 30 leaf samples of 26 diploid rose species. The concatenated multilocus sequences were aligned using MAFFT (v.7.490)70. Finally, a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated by applying IQTREE71 with ModelFinder using the following settings: iqtree2 -s -m TEST --con-tree --burnin 250 -B 1000 -T 12 --wbtl. The tree figures were graphically finalized with MEGA X119 and Inkscape v.0.92.3 (2405546, 2018-03-11) software.

Synthetic hybrid R. canina (seed parent) × R. rubiginosa (pollen parent) (sample ID, D62b_2; SRA: SRR15033882) was a cross between R. canina (sample ID, D3b_2; SRA: SRR15033883) and R. rubiginosa (sample ID, D145b_2; SRA: SRR15033877), and the second synthetic hybrid R. rubiginosa (seed parent) × R. corymbifera (pollen parent) (sample ID, D166b_2; SRA: SRR15033879) was a cross between R. rubiginosa (D145b_2; SRA: SRR15033877) and R. corymbifera (sample ID, D81b_2; SRA: SRR15033881). These hybrids were originally produced by Wissemann and Hellwig43 and kept as a living plant in the Botanical Garden Gießen, Germany. Whole-genome short-read sequencing was performed for both hybrids and their parental plants. The mean coverage of the maternal plant (sample ID, D3b_2) is ~27×, and the paternal plant (sample ID, D145_b2) is ~27×. The hybrid's (sample ID, D62b_2) coverage is ~29×. The reciprocal hybrid (sample ID, D166_b2) has an average of ~30× coverage, whereas its paternal plant (sample ID, D81_b2) is ~19×.

The reads from these six samples were mapped to the S1 subgenome of our assembled R. canina, respectively, using bowtie2 (v.2.5.1)63 with the default parameters. Filtering was applied for all alignments with the same setup ‘samtools view -F 3340 --min-MQ 1'. The coverage of each sample was calculated by ‘bedtools coverage' (v.2.30.0) with a 100 kb window size. SNPs were called with the filtered alignments by bcftools (v.1.9)112. Specifically, ‘bcftools mpileup' ran first with the minimum mapping quality 1, then ‘bcftools call' ran with flags ‘--keep-alts --variants-only --multiallelic-caller'. In the end, only the unique SNPs in each parent were selected to calculate the SNP contribution in the hybrids.

Structural analysis of DNA sequences of whole chromosomes and centromere cuts were performed with ModDotPlot (v.0.9.0)120 using the default parameters. ModDotPlot is a dot plot visualization tool designed for large sequences and whole genomes. The method outputs an identity heat map by rapidly approximating the average nucleotide identity between pairwise combinations of genomic intervals.

The predicted gene model structures in the nuclear genome were annotated by applying the full-length chromosome sequences to Helixer121. Moreover, complete LTR retrotransposons were annotated with the DANTE and DANTE-LTR tools implemented in RepeatExplorer2122,123. R. canina short-read data (SRA: ERR1662939) were subjected to clustering analysis using the RepeatExplorer2 pipeline, and the output library of repeats was subsequently used to annotate the genome with the implemented RepeatMasker124. Tandem-repeat annotation and genome abundance estimation were performed using TAREAN and TideCluster implemented in RepeatExplorer2122.

Total mRNA was extracted from the leaf tissue of R. canina S27 using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA-Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The RNA-sequencing library was prepared with poly(A) enrichment and then sent for sequencing on the NextSeq 2000 platform with 2 × 150 bp mode, resulting in 33,594,132 reads. For a more accurate mapping of RNA sequences, the annotated tandem repeats and transposable elements were hard-masked from the genome. RNA alignment was done using hisat2 (v.2.1.0)125 with the flag --no-mixed. The output was then filtered by only allowing for tag NM:0 and minimum mapping quality 2. To count the transcripts number for each gene, we converted the masked genome to protein sequences based on Helixer121 structural annotation, and then functionally annotated the protein sequences by Mercator4 (v.7.0)126 with both Prot-scriber and Swissprot databases, then htseq-count (v.2.0.1)127 was applied to count the transcripts for all annotated proteins. The gene expression was analysed by DESeq2128. As the high homozygosity between the haplotypes of S1 subgenome, RNA reads were aligned to S1_h1, S2, S3, S4 genome, and the expression level of S1 was then halved (Supplementary Fig. 20 and Supplementary Table 4).

For detecting the functional centromeres of R. canina S27, we designed a specific polyclonal antibody against its CENH3 protein (ARVKHTAARKDRIKTARRQP-C, AB016310), synthetized by LifeTein with immunization in rabbits. The CENH3 gene of R. canina S27 was identified using BLASTP with the parameter ‘-evalue 1e-5 -qcov_hsp_perc 50' and the A. thaliana CENH3 protein HTR12 (AT1G01370) was used as the reference. The ChIP experiment was performed as described previously129 with a few modifications. Young leaves (around 2–5 g) of R. canina S27 were collected and cross-linked in 4% formaldehyde in 1× PBS on ice with vacuum infiltration applied for 30 min. The quenching was performed applying 1 M glycine in each sample followed by vacuum infiltration at room temperature for 15 min. The material was then macerated in liquid nitrogen and the chromatin was extracted. After extraction, the chromatin was sonicated for 30 min on a Bioruptor (Diagenode) until fragments of around 200–600 bp length were achieved (30 s on; 30 s off; in high mode). The sonicated chromatin was incubated over night at 4 °C with 1 µg of each polyclonal antibodies (anti-CENH3 specific for R. canina (LifeTein, AB016310) raised in rabbit and anti-histone H3 (Active Motif, 39064) raised in mouse). Samples with no addition of primary antibodies were also incubated as input control samples and at least two experimental replications were used for each ChIP combination. After incubation, protein beads (anti-rabbit: rProtein A Sepharose FastFlow 50% slurry; anti-mouse: rProtein G Sepharose FastFlow 50% slurry (GE Healthcare)) were washed and added to each complex protein–antibody and incubated for at least 2 h at 4 °C in slow rotation. The final recovered chromatin was eluted from the beads, followed by a de-cross-linking step and final DNA extraction. After quality control using the 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent Technologies), the samples were forwarded for 150 bp paired-end Illumina sequencing. For the analysis, the raw 150 bp paired-end reads were quality checked and then mapped to the R. canina haplotype phased reference genome using the default parameters in bowtie263. The BAM file was converted to bigwig using the bamCompare tool from deeptools2130, and then normalized to reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped. Peak calling was then performed using the MACS3 pipeline131 with the inclusion of the parameters --broad -g 1.9e+9. The plots showing the distribution of different genomic features per chromosome or specific region were constructed using pyGenomeTracks132. The ChIP–seq signals in metaplots to compare chromosome (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 14) and subgenome CENH3 enrichment (Fig. 3e) were calculated by bamCompare with parameters ‘--ignoreDuplicates --scaleFactorsMethod readCount --operation log2' to normalize the CENH3/H3 by read coverage.

Functional centromere regions in the genome assembly of R. canina S27 were annotated based on the detection of CENH3 peaks with MACS3 (see above). The total centromere length was then calculated by the interval between the 5′ and 3′ CENH3 peaks. After alignment to the annotated functional centromeres in R. canina S27, comparable centromeric regions were extracted from DToL R. canina and R. agrestis (https://www.darwintreeoflife.org). The repeat abundance of CANR4 satellite repeats and Ty3/Gypsy ATHILA retrotransposons in the predefined centromeric regions were determined in base pairs for each chromosome of the three investigated Rosa genomes (R. canina S27, R. canina DToL and R. agrestis DToL). To reduce data skewness the data were log-transformed. A Shapiro–Wilk normality test was used to check normal distribution of the data with R (v.4.3.3)92 (29 February 2024). A bivariate Bayesian generalized linear mixed model was implemented using the MCMCglmm package133. The model included pairing type (bivalent B, univalent U and univalent in R. canina but bivalent in R. agrestis Ub) as a fixed effect, while subgenome, genome, and synteny group were random effects, with an unstructured covariance structure (us(trait):random_effect) to account for correlations between response variables. MCMC settings included 100,000 iterations, with a 50,000 burn-in and a thinning interval of 50 and the family parameter was set according to ‘gaussian'. Data visualization was performed using the ggplot274, patchwork134, tidyr135 and dplyr136 packages (Supplementary Fig. 15; source data are available in Supplementary Data 13 and 16). The correlation of CANR4 size with CENH3 abundance (Fig. 3e) was calculated by Spearman's rank correlation as the Shapiro–Wilk normality test resulted in P ≪ 0.5. Linear regression model was fitted using the lm function in R (v.4.4.0), with multiple R2 value as 0.842 and adjusted R2 value as 0.836.

cenLTR sequences were primarily annotated as tandem repeats using TAREAN and TideCluster implemented in RepeatExplorer2122. Further sequence similarity with LTR retrotransposons was performed using the transfer annotation tool of Geneious Prime v.2025.0.2 (https://www.geneious.com) with a minimum sequence similarity threshold of 75%. Using a Geneious Prime plugin for ClustalO137, we performed alignments of consensus cenLTR sequences against the regions with the highest similarity found in the R. canina S27 genome, which all corresponded to different ATHILA elements on chromosomes Rca1_R4 and Rca4_R4. Consensus sequences of cenLTR1–4 are available in Supplementary Dataset 14.

To investigate the methylome of R. canina, we performed enzymatic methyl-sequencing (EM-seq). For this, we extracted genomic DNA from young leaves and the samples were then prepared for an Illumina-compatible library using the NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq Kit and further sequenced on the HiSeq 3000 device with paired-end orientation. We ended up with 68,632,618 pairs of 150 bp reads. EM-seq data were first aligned to the S1_h1, S2, R3, R4 combined subgenomes with Bismark (v.0.23.0) with the flag ‘--local' and duplications were removed by deduplicate_bismark. CpG-, CHG- and CHH-context methylations were then extracted by bismark_methylation_extractor (v.0.23.0). The output was converted to bedgraph by bismark2bedGraph (v.0.23.0) with the flag ‘-CX' activated for CHG and CHH contexts to visualize the methylations chromosome-wide and on the centromeres.

In the metaplots (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 14), all signals were smoothed by the spline.smooth function with spar 0.3 in R (v.4.4.0). CENH3 enrichment was calculated by CENH3 ChIP–seq (log2[CENH3/H3]) signal normalized by coverage. CENH3 enrichment, DNA methylations, ATHILA density and CANR4 were calculated in 50 kb adjacent windows and averaged by all chromosomes of the corresponding subgenome. All chromosome coordinates were scaled on the basis of their distance to centromere against the distance of centromere to telomere. Centromere position was defined on the basis of where the maximum CENH3 enrichment was located. Mitochondrial sequences were masked when computing the CENH3 enrichment. All signal values (y axis of metaplots) were scaled from 0 to 1 based on the global minimum to global maximum except for DNA methylations, for which the original percentage values were retained. The p- and q-arm values were averaged and mirrored.

For immunodetecting the centromeres of R. canina S27, we used polyclonal antibodies against CENH3 protein (see above) and kinetochore protein KNL1 (C-EDHFFGPVSPSFIRPGRLSD, AB015677-3) described previously48, also synthetized by LifeTein and raised in rabbits. To identify the microtubules, we used a commercial antibody against alpha-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T6199) with immunization in mouse. For analysing the distribution of these markers in mitotic cells, root tips were fixed after a pretreatment in 0.2 mM 8-hydroxyquinoline for 4 h at 18 °C. For meiotic stages, the young anthers were directly fixed with no previous antimitotic pretreatment. The immunodetection experiment was performed according to a previously published protocol138 with modifications to R. canina material. Young flower buds were collected on ice in buffer A (15 mM PIPES–NaOH, 80 mM KCl, 0.5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 80 mM sorbitol, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and next incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde in buffer A for 1 h under vacuum infiltration on ice. After the fixation, the samples were washed three times with buffer A and then digested in enzymatic solution containing 1% cellulase-onozuka, 1% cellulase, 1% pectolyase Y23, 1% cytohelicase, 1% macerozyme and 10% pectinase in citrate buffer for 1 h in a humid chamber at 37 °C. To remove the excess of enzymatic solution, the material was gently washed with buffer A and left on ice until the preparation of the slides. A couple of anthers were placed and dissected in a drop of buffer A on a 18 × 18 mm high-precision coverslips, a few μl of polyacrylamide solution (25 µl 15% polyacrylamide (Sigma-Aldrich, A3574) in buffer A plus 1.25 µl of 20% sodium sulfite and 1.25 µl of 20% ammonium persulfate) were added to the dissected anthers, quickly mixed and a second coverslip was put above the first making a sandwich gently squeezing the anthers with a needle to liberate the meiocytes. The sandwiches were allowed to dry for up to 1 h until complete polymerization. After this, the coverslips were carefully separated and incubated in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mM EDTA for at least 1 h, then more 2 h in blocking solution containing 3% BSA in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20. After this period, the primary antibodies were diluted in 1:500 (CENH3 and KNL1) and 1:200 (alpha-tubulin) ratios in blocking solution and applied on each sample, which were sequentially incubated at 4 °C for 48 h. After primary antibody incubation, primary antibodies were detected using secondary antibodies conjugated with specific fluorophores (Alexa Fluor 488 and Abberior StarRed and STAROrange for STED microscopy, also diluted in blocking solution in a proportion of 1:250) and incubated in a dark humid chamber at room temperature for at least 2 h. The material was then washed four to five times for 20 min each in 1× PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 and then mounted in SlowFade Gold medium containing DAPI. The slides were photographed using a super-resolution STED microscope (Abberior instrument facility line; https://abberior-instruments.com/) and posterior brightness and contrast adjustments were done in Photoshop.

For mitotic chromosome preparations, root tips and young flower buds from R. canina S27 plants cultivated in the greenhouse were collected and then fixed in methanol:acetic acid solution (3:1 (v/v)) for 2–24 h at room temperature and then kept at −20 °C until use. After fixation, the root tips were pretreated with an enzymatic solution of 2% cellulase R10-onozuka (Duchefa Bioquemie)/20% pectinase (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1 M citric acid for 40 min at 37 °C in a humid chamber and then squashed in a drop of LB01 buffer (15 mM Tris, 2 mM Na2EDTA, 80 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermine, 15 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5)) and, after frozen in liquid nitrogen, the coverslips were removed.

For meiotic chromosome preparations, the anthers of R. canina C1 (GLM-P-0181117) were dissected from fixed flower buds around 0.5 cm in length. Anthers were washed with 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 (PVP-40; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie) and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15–20 min, followed by enzymatic digestion overnight in a humid chamber at 4 °C in 1% (w/v) cellulase Onozuka R-10 (Serva), 0.2% (w/v) pectolyase Y-23 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5% (w/v) hemicellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5% (w/v) macerozyme R-10 (Duchefa Biochemie) dissolved in citric buffer (0.04 M citric acid and 0.06 M sodium citrate). The anthers were macerated on a slide, squashed in a drop of 70% acetic acid and fixed by freezing in liquid nitrogen.

For FISH experiments, a 22 bp oligo probe directly labelled with a Cy3 fluorophore at the 5′ terminus was designed, synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich and then used to detect the CANR4 satellite repeat (Cy3-5′-ACCCTAGAAGCAAGAAGTTTGG-3′) or an insert of the plasmid carrying the CANR4 dimer (GenBank MK069593) was used as a FISH probe20. For detection of the centromeric LTR ATHILA retrotransposon sequences, we designed a probe based on clustering analysis of Illumina reads (SRA: ERR1662939) using the RepeatExplorer2 pipeline. It was revealed that cluster 5 (CL5) contig contained Ty3/Gypsy/ATHILA sequences. The CL5 contig was used to design PCR primers amplifying a 180 bp product from R. canina genomic DNA. The primers were as follows: Rcan_centr_CL5_for: 5′- GCAAGCGCATAATTTAACC-3′ and Rcan-centr_CL5_rev: 5′-CAATCAAAAATATCCCCCC-3′. The PCR product was purified and cloned into the pDrive vector (Qiagen) and sequenced by the Sanger dideoxy method using the SP6 primer (Micosynth). Clone 11 was submitted to GenBank (PV030978). The inserts of plasmids were directly labelled in a nick translation reaction with Cy5 d-UTP or Cy3 d-UTP fluorochromes (Jena Bioscience) and used for FISH. To detect the 5S and 35S rDNA loci, the full-length 18S rRNA gene from tomato (GenBank: X51576.1) and the Pta71 clone from Triticum aestivum were used to detect the 35S rDNA region, while a 5S rDNA unit (B variant) from R. canina35 and the D2 clone from Lotus japonicus were used to detect the 5S rDNA locus. rDNA robes were directly labelled by Nick translation using Cy5 d-UTP (Jena Bioscience). The slides were prepared in accordance with the protocols described previously35,139. In brief, the slides were treated with pepsin solution (1 mg ml−1 diluted in 0.01 N HCl) for 30 min at 37 °C in a humid chamber, washed with 2× SSC (saline sodium citrate, pH 7.0) solution, post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed again with 2× SSC and then dried in 70% and 100% ethanol. After air drying for at least 30 min, the slides were denatured with hybridization mix (50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate and ~50 ng of each probe (15 μl per slide)) for 5 min at 75 °C and then incubated for at least 18 h at 37 °C. After hybridization, stringency washes were performed with 2× and 0.1× SSC solutions at 42 °C, achieving around 76% stringency. The slides were then washed at room temperature with 2 × SSC solution and mounted with DAPI in the antifade mounting medium Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).

Five mature and well open flowers were collected from the plant in the greenhouse. They were shaken above a microscope slide and their pollen was released on top of the slide. Then, 20 µl of Alexander staining solution (Morphisto, 13441.00250) was added and briefly mixed with the pollen by stirring with the pipette tip. A coverslip 24 × 40 mm was put on top of the mix. Pictures were taken with a Labscope microscope by Zeiss, using 10 × magnification. Five snapshots were counted with the help of the ZEN software.

(a) Hi-C map of 35 chromosome-level scaffolds. Each synteny group contains five chromosomes, which were ordered as S1_h1, S1_h2, S2, R3, and R4 in sequence. The vanished Hi-C signals of the first two chromosomes in each linkage group suggest the high homozygosity of S1_h1 and S1_h2 haplotypes. (b) GenomeScope2 21-mer distribution from HiFi sequences and genome size estimation confirmed the expected R. canina genome size, i.e., 5× 490 Mbp. 21-mer coverage is estimated as 23.5× coverage, consistent with read coverage (23×). The 4x peak at coverage 94 is less invisible, indicating two out of five haplotypes are highly similar. (c) Ploidy and genome structure inference based on 21-mer Smudgeplot analysis. A and B represent the number of heterozygous k-mers identified. Note the high amount of pentaploid heterozygous k-mer combinations AAAAB and AAABB. (d) BUSCO (Universal Single-Copy Orthologues) genes assessment results based on the annotated protein sequences of the pentaploid genome and each individual subgenome set. (e) HiFi k-mer multiplicity frequency by Merqury. The number in the plot legend and different colours indicate the copy numbers found in the assembly. (f) and (g) are Mercator4 statistics of gene contents based on its functional annotation on Rosa canina protein sequences. (f) Percentage of genes occupying a certain gene category. (g) Protein length distribution based on the deviation to category-specific reference lengths. Each bar represents the number of proteins having a certain length difference to the reference length of the corresponding Mercator4 category. The overall small deviation of gene lengths in R. canina comparing to Mercator reference genes indicate most annotated genes in R. canina are complete. (f) and (g) show the results for the subgenome S1 haplotype h1 only since the other three subgenomes show highly similar distribution.

(a) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (the horizontal colour bar at the top of the axis indicates to which subgenome the k-mer is specific; the vertical colour bar on the left of the axis indicates the subgenome to which the chromosome is assigned). The heatmap indicates the Z-scale relative abundance of k-mers. The larger the Z score is, the greater the relative abundance of a k-mer), and (b) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of differential 15-mers confirmed that the genome was successfully phased into four subgenomes based on clearly distinct patterns of both differential k-mers and homoeologous chromosomes. (c) Chromosomal characteristics. From the outer to inner circles (1–9): (1) subgenome assignments based on the k-means algorithm; (2) significant enrichment of subgenome-specific k-mers − the same colour as the subgenome indicates significant enrichment for those subgenome-specific k-mers − white areas are not significantly enriched; (3) normalized proportion (relative) of subgenome-specific k-mers; (4–7) count (absolute) of each subgenome-specific k-mer set; (8) density of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) − if the colour is consistent with the subgenome, it indicates that LTR-RTs are significantly enriched in those subgenome-specific k-mers; grey indicates nonspecific LTR-RTs; and (9) homoeologous blocks. All statistics (2–7) are computed in sliding windows of 1 Mb. Notably, the fraction of subgenome differentiation between the S1 and S2 subgenomes was restricted to proximal regions, likely representing their different centromere compositions. Whereas R3 and R4 subgenomes are clearly distinct from each other in their specific k-mer spectrum.

The upper panel (d) exemplarily depicts the phylogeny of chromosomes of synteny group 1. Synteny groups 2 − 7 are presented in (e). Filled chromosomes refer to subgenomes of R. canina belonging to the Synstylae clade (violet/light blue) and Rosa clade (dark/light orange). Chromosomes from R. agrestis are marked with hatched white filling, while the diploid roses are marked with black hatched filling.

The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are marked in the upper right corner to predict the insertion time boundaries of LTR-RTs on the subgenome for R. canina (a), R. canina DToL (b) and R. agrestis DToL (c). The colours of the subgenomes are consistent throughout the Fig. panels.

(a) Genome-wide distribution of pollen SCOs from pollen of eigth dogrose species (subsect. Caninae: three samples of R. canina, two samples of R. corymbifera; subsect. Rubigineae three samples of R. rubiginosa) from two subsections in the R. agrestis genome assembly from DToL. The bubble map represents chromosomal hits from the SAM file output, which were selectively filtered to display loci with a single alternative hit. The size of the symbols corresponds to the mean count of pollen SCOs mapped to each chromosomal pair, identifying seven bivalent chromosome pairs within the R. agrestis (subsect. Rubigineae) genome assembly and seven different pairs in which R. rubiginosa (subsect. Rubigineae) pollen SCO mapped. (b) Plastome phylogeny of the genus Rosa.

The observed endosperm/embryo ratio 1.5, fits to the expectation of 3x endosperm and a 2x embryo originated by sexual reproduction including endosperm fertilization. Please note that the gain of the fluorescence was adjusted to position the embryo peak at channel 100. For a better visualization of the endosperm peak the scale of the Y-axis was manually adjusted to 200 counts (red rectangles). Em1: embryo G0/G1, Em2: embryo G2, En: endosperm G0/G1. (d) The parental SNP ratios detected in each subgenome of the hybrid R. canina × R. rubiginosa (Sample ID: D62b_2). SNPs were called by aligning short reads to our assembled R. canina (S27) S1_h1. The y-axis displays the proportion of SNPs in each subgenome. For instance, ~62% SNPs detected in the alignments to S1 subgenome are the same as the maternal R. canina (Sample ID: D3b_2), while only around 5% SNPs are from the paternal R. rubiginosa (Sample ID: D145_b2), indicating the S1 subgenome of the hybrid was supposed to be contributed by the maternal parent. Overall, the hybrid subgenome S1, S2, and R3 are all from maternal parent R. canina, while one R4 subgenome is from maternal R. canina and the other R4 is contributed by paternal R. rubiginosa. So, the subgenome composition of the hybrid should be S1, S2, R3, R4_h1/h2. (e) Assessment of the parental genomes contribution of a synthetic hybrid between R. rubiginosa (female donor) and R. corymbifera (male donor), confirming the sexual reproduction and subgenome's inheritance trough male and female meiosis. Note, that R. corymbifera belongs to subsect. Caninae and is a very close relative of R. canina and so it has two copies of S1 subgenome. (f) The parental SNP ratios detected in each subgenome of the hybrid R. rubiginosa × R. corymbifera (Sample ID: D166b_2). The plot interpretation is the same as (d).

Metaplot of CENH3 enrichment, DNA methylation, and centromeric elements—ATHILA and CANR4 density—per subgenome. CENH3 enrichment marked in dark red was calculated by CENH3 ChIP-seq (log2 CENH3/H3) signal normalized by coverage. DNA methylations have three contexts with CpG marked in black, CHG maked in dark grey, and CHH marked in light grey. ATHILA (yolk yellow) and CANR4 (magenta) were presented by their density. All signals were calculated in 50 kb adjacent windows. All chromosome coordinates were scaled based on their distance to centromere against the distance of centromere (CEN) to telomere (TEL). Centromere position (CEN) was defined by where maximum CENH3 enrichment was located. All signal values (y-axis) were scaled from 0 to 1 by global minimum to global maximum except for DNA methylations, which retained the original percentage values. The p- and q-arm values were averaged and mirrored. Please note the higher CENH3 association with CANR4-based centromeres compared with ATHILA-based centromeres.

(a–b) Immunodetection of the KNL1 protein (in red) at all centromeres of R. canina revealed a differential distribution, with the presence of large and small centromeres, as shown in more detail in the upper and lower insets (a). (c–d) Distribution of the centromeric satellite repeats CANR4 (in magenta) and 5S rDNA (in cyan) in the R. canina miotic chromosomes, while the CANR4 repeat is present at the centromeres of a set of chromosomes. The 5S rDNA is located at the pericentromeric regions of chr1, insets in c and d highlight the pericentromeric location of 5S loci (right) and a weak CANR4 signal (left). (e–h) Distribution of the CANR4 repeat in meiotic diakinesis, revealing its distribution mostly in univalents according (e and f), while the pattern of 5S and 35S rDNA (g and h) (cyan and yellow, respectively) hybridized to three sites, two of which were located near 35S sites on a bivalent (inset in h) corresponding to the Rca3_S1_h1/h2 chromosomes as found in our assembly annotation. Week signals are highlighted in the insets present in g and h. (i–m) FISH with CANR4 and ATHILA on a diakinesis of R. canina (i–k) and mitotic cells of R. chinensis (l) and R. rugosa (m). Asterisks in i–k point to bivalent-forming chromosomes. The experiments for this set of data were repeated at least 10 times and independently presenting similar results. Scale bar = 5 µm.

Metrics details

The origin of pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, is poorly understood, owing to the temporal and morphological gaps that separate them from their closest non-flying relatives, the lagerpetids. Although both groups coexisted during the Late Triassic, their limited sympatry is currently unexplained, indicating that ecological partitioning, potentially linked to palaeoclimate, influenced their early evolution. Here we analysed pterosauromorph (pterosaur + lagerpetid) palaeobiogeography using phylogeny-based probabilistic methods and integrating fossil occurrences with palaeoclimate data. Our results reveal distinct climatic preferences and dispersal histories: lagerpetids tolerated a broader range of conditions, including arid belts, enabling a widespread distribution from the Middle to early Late Triassic. Conversely, pterosaurs preferred wetter environments, resulting in a patchier geographical distribution that expanded only as humidity increased in the Late Triassic, probably following the Carnian Pluvial Event. This major environmental disturbance, potentially driven by changes in CO2-related thermal constraints and/or palaeogeography, appears to have had a key role in shaping early pterosauromorph evolution by promoting spatial segregation and distinct climatic niche occupation.

Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight, more than 60 million years before the earliest birds. However, our understanding of early pterosaur evolution is hindered by the major temporal and anatomical gaps between these highly modified flying reptiles and their closest terrestrial relatives1,2. The fossil record of pterosaurs and their kin is notoriously incomplete3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 (Supplementary Fig. 1), and fundamental aspects of their early evolution, such as the timing, area, ecological settings of their initial radiation and palaeobiology (for example, growth dynamics and climate preferences1,12,13), are still poorly understood compared with other contemporaneous archosaur groups such as dinosaurs14,15,16.

Recent phylogenetic studies, descriptions of new taxa and detailed reevaluations of historically described specimens have renewed interest in pterosaur origin, ancestry and early evolution. This work overturned previous hypotheses of pterosaur relationships, demonstrating that lagerpetids were the closest relatives of pterosaurs, uniting these two groups in the clade Pterosauromorpha2,11,17,18,19. All known lagerpetids are non-flighted forms, whereas all known pterosaurs are volant. This new phylogenetic hypothesis substantially reduces temporal and anatomical gaps between Pterosauria and other avemetatarsalians (pterosaurs, dinosaurs and their closest relatives)2,11,18,19. Consequently, the origin of Pterosauria is now minimally constrained to an interval of ~10–15 million years between the Ladinian and early Norian intervals of the Triassic Period2,11,18,20. The past decade of research has also provided a wider sample of Triassic pterosauromorph specimens from more localities across the globe and a better understanding of their phylogenetic relationships1,2,11,17,18,19,20 and stratigraphic occurrences. These advances offer the chance to investigate early pterosauromorph macroevolution quantitatively (for example, ref. 11), by uncovering potential abiotic factors that might have influenced their diversification, as hinted at by the stratigraphic occurrence and disjunct palaeogeographical distributions of lagerpetids and pterosaurs through the Triassic18.

Sympatric occurrences of lagerpetids and pterosaurs were limited during their ~20-million-year overlap in the Norian and Rhaetian (Fig. 1). Lagerpetids are found in continental fluviolacustrine deposits on at least four current continents and maintained a wide latitudinal and geographic spread throughout most of their evolutionary history11,17,18,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34 (late Ladinian to late Rhaetian, 237–201 Ma; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Conversely, the earliest body fossils of unambiguous pterosaurs are middle Norian in age and found in a restricted low-latitude belt, primarily, but not exclusively, in marine formations that were deposited around the margins of Tethys1,12,35,36,37. From the late Norian onwards, pterosaurs spread to higher latitudes and in a much broader array of habitats1,3,8,12,38,39,40,41,42. This could suggest that lagerpetids and pterosaurs occupied fundamentally different ecological, environmental or climatic niches. Investigating pterosauromorph distribution in time and space combined with environmental data allows a new opportunity to answer several long-standing key questions in palaeontology: how did Triassic climate change affect pterosaur and avemetatarsalian evolution? What climatic regimes and environments did vertebrate flight first evolve in? And why are early pterosaur fossils so rare, and where might we find more of them?

Middle–Late Triassic pterosauromorph occurrences worldwide (left) and close-ups of the southwestern USA (right). An., Anisian; Jr., Jurassic.

We investigated these questions using a holistic approach that integrates novel fossil occurrence data, comprehensively sampled phylogenies, climatic niche modelling and palaeobiogeography. Our aims are (1) to assess and quantify the potential for latitudinal dispersal of Triassic lagerpetids and pterosaurs and to compare it with that of other contemporaneous groups; (2) to investigate climatic preferences of pterosauromorphs; and (3) to quantify and map habitat suitability for pterosaurs and their closest relatives during the Middle to Late Triassic. Furthermore, our results allow us to estimate the ancestral area of origin and hypothetical distribution and dispersal of pterosauromorphs across Pangaea during the Middle Triassic to early Late Triassic—the undersampled time interval in which their origin probably unfolded—to propose testable hypotheses regarding their early biogeography and its potential influence on their evolution and to identify potential target areas for future fieldwork.

Our palaeobiogeographic analysis suggests that lagerpetids—and pterosauromorphs as a whole—probably originated in southwestern Pangaea (that is, modern South America), whereas the origin of pterosaurs was predicted at low latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (Extended Data Fig. 1), consistent with previous studies8,11. Note that this and the following results are based on phylogenetic data, which, in light of the biases and incompleteness of the fossil record may simplify what are probably more complex scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The pterosauromorph dispersal inertia curve maintains a consistently high Δ-log likelihood (that is, lower but constant dispersal) across the Ladinian–early Norian interval (Fig. 2a). In other words, the dispersal of lagerpetids (the only pterosauromorphs present at that time) across climatic barriers was constant but more constrained than that of dinosaurs (and avemetatarsalians as a whole). Dinosaurs experienced relatively stronger barriers to dispersal in the Ladinian–early Carnian and late Norian–Rhaetian, interrupted by a ‘release phase' (that is, increased levels of dispersal) during the middle–late Carnian14 (Fig. 2a). The middle Norian–Rhaetian segment of the pterosauromorph curve shows an increase in Δ-log likelihood, potentially indicating a reduced crossing of barriers through this interval (Fig. 2a). This section of the curve is primarily, if not exclusively, influenced by the addition of pterosaurs (Methods). The pattern of reduced dispersal is surprising given that Triassic pterosaurs were volant and many are found in low-latitude areas (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). A similar pattern (that is, increase in species richness and drop in dispersal) could be achieved by few intermittent crossings of the barriers, which are unlikely to alter the dispersal pattern, followed by cladogenesis within the same geographical area, which will not affect the dispersal through barriers. Nevertheless, as emphasized in the Methods, the importance of this segment of the curve remains uncertain. As pterosaurs could fly and were presumably less constrained by physical barriers, their likelihood for dispersal may have left a less clear phylogenetic signature compared with their non-flying close relatives.

J., Jurassic; E. Tr., Early Triassic; I., Induan; Olenek., Olenekian.

A complementary way to decipher the latitudinal dispersion of different groups is by quantifying dispersal events in each clade through time11 (Fig. 2b,c). This shows that lagerpetids dispersed consistently throughout their evolutionary history (Anisian–Rhaetian). The lagerpetid curve for accumulated latitudinal dispersion is high both in absolute (Fig. 2b) and corrected values (Fig. 2c). These curves maintain a plateau throughout the Carnian and Norian and decrease only in the Rhaetian, when the taxonomic diversity of the group declines. This pattern is similar to that of silesaurids (Discussion), contrary to the results of Müller et al.11, whose lagerpetid curve peaked after the Carnian and was more similar to that of dinosaurs. This inconsistency is caused by (1) the pruning by Müller et al.11 of key lagerpetids (Kongonaphon kely and PVSJ 883) from their dataset, which reduced the number of branches and dispersal events in the Anisian–Carnian interval, thus lowering that part of the curve; and (2) the different strategy of Müller et al.11 of incorporating uncertain biogeographical values at internal nodes, which led them to discard the dispersal events at these particular nodes. The accumulated latitudinal dispersal of pterosaurs peaks immediately after their appearance in the middle Norian and maintains a high profile throughout the Norian and Rhaetian11 (Fig. 2b,c). The abrupt and pronounced Norian peak in the pterosaur curve may underscore the inherent ease of dispersal for these flying reptiles compared with their land-bound counterparts.

Statistical comparisons reveal that pterosaurs and lagerpetids occupied different climatic niche spaces during their temporal overlap in the Late Triassic (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 1; pairwise permutation multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), P = 0.0127). During the Norian and Rhaetian, lagerpetids occupied areas characterized by warmer temperatures and drier conditions and with less pronounced seasonal excursions in temperatures (Fig. 3b–d). Comparatively, pterosaurs occurred in areas that were distinctly cooler and seasonally more variable (Fig. 3b,d and Extended Data Table 1; P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Both lagerpetids and pterosaurs occupied areas with similar values of mean annual precipitation (MAP; Fig. 3c and Extended Data Tables 1 and 2; P > 0.05), although a majority of lagerpetids occupied drier areas (Fig. 3c). Pterosaurs occurred across a wide range of values for annual precipitation and seasonal variation in precipitation (Fig. 3c,e). The palaeoclimate niche occupation of lagerpetids was not constant over time (Fig. 3f). Specifically, Ladinian and Carnian lagerpetids (that is, Kongonaphon, Ixalerpeton, Lagerpeton and PVSJ 883) are found in high-latitude areas in southern Gondwana that were on average colder and withstood higher seasonal fluctuations in temperatures than their Norian and Rhaetian counterparts (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 1; pairwise permutation MANOVA, P = 0.012). This pattern is not entirely surprising considering the palaeogeographical occurrence of Ladinian and Carnian lagerpetids compared with their younger counterparts. Most Norian–Rhaetian occurrences are, in fact, found at lower latitudes that were characterized by higher temperatures and smaller seasonal fluctuations in temperature (Fig. 3b,d and Extended Data Table 1; P < 0.001), with the exception of Faxinalipterus and Dromomeron gigas, which were found in the southern part of Pangaea, in geographical areas and palaeoclimatic regimes broadly similar to those of their pre-Norian predecessors (Discussion, Figs. 1 and 3f and Supplementary Fig. 1). As a result, lagerpetids as a whole occupied an overlapping (pairwise permutation MANOVA, P = 0.098; Extended Data Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1) but broader palaeoclimate niche than pterosaurs, probably related to their higher tolerance for warmer, more seasonal (temperature-wise) and tendentially drier conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Extended Data Tables 1 and 2).

Climatic suitability offers a route to interpret the palaeobiogeographical distributions of early pterosauromorph body fossils and allows us to identify areas of suitable habitable space in fossil-depleted intervals. It provides a coarse, but useful, representation of their hypothetical fundamental niches (Fig. 3) in geographic space (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3). The temporal and spatial biases that control the early pterosaur fossil record epitomize the challenges faced in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of their evolutionary history and geographic distribution (Supplementary Fig. 1). Nevertheless, a probabilistic macroecological approach can provide insights on their climatic preferences and potential habitable areas, predicting potential geographic ranges for pterosaurs and lagerpetids based on climatic suitability. The distribution of areas of high suitability of pterosaurs and lagerperids appear broadly complementary. However, pterosaur potential distribution is patchier overall with lower habitability in continental interior areas (that is, arid regions) compared with the more widely distributed of lagerpetids. Although pre-Norian pterosaur body fossils have yet to be recovered, ecological niche modelling indicates the presence of potential suitable habitable space for hypothetical early pterosaurs that was unevenly spread at low tropical latitudes during the Ladinian (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3), compared with the occupation of higher, more temperate latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and broader and more continuous suitable space occupation in the southwestern tropics, for lagerpetids (Fig. 4). Habitat suitability modelling also indicates a marked extension of habitable pterosaur space towards the coastlines of Northern Tethys in the Carnian–early Norian (Fig. 4), alongside a reduction of suitable continental zones, emphasizing their climatic preference for the more temperate and wetter environments (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). By contrast, lagerpetids display a distinct Carnian pattern, maintaining a more homogeneous latitudinal occupation but with decreasing habitat suitability along the southern margin of the northern Tethys gulf, while simultaneously exhibiting an increasingly higher preference towards the southwestern tropics and reaching slightly higher latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig. 4). During the Norian (our ‘training stage'; Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3), pterosaurs (now represented by body fossils) were widely distributed in coastal, wet, tropical and low-latitude areas (Figs. 1 and 4). This is accompanied by the continuing patterns of reduction in suitable continental interior areas, except alongside the palaeoequatorial belt (broadly corresponding to the Chinle and Dockum basins) where favourable conditions for the group are maintained. Overall, in the Norian and Rhaetian, areas of pterosaur high climatic suitability occur at broad latitudes, extending from the northern margin of the Tethys to northern Australia and central South America (that is, southern Brazil and northern Argentina). Low suitability is recorded at high latitudes outside the tropics and in what is now equatorial Africa, Antarctica, Oceania and northeastern Eurasia and continental interiors (for example, modern Brazil and Canada–USA border). This pattern is broadly maintained through the late Norian and Rhaetian with an expansion of high suitable zones along the eastern margin of Pangaea (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). By contrast, lagerpetid suitability habitats are maintained throughout the Norian–Rhaetian interval with the addition of the western palaeoequatorial belt (that is, Chinle and Dockum basins) and northwestern Africa.

Note that the pre-Rhaetian suitability maps are modelled predictions because, so far, there is no Ladinian–Carnian fossil record of pterosaurs.

Triassic pterosauromorph distribution suggests that pterosaurs and lagerpetids had distinct and divergent early evolutionary histories, with regard to biogeography and dispersal. Lagerpetids achieved a wide latitudinal distribution soon after their first appearance (predominantly in southern Pangaea) and maintained a presence at high and low latitudes, globally, throughout their evolutionary history10,11,18 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The clade's dispersal across climatic barriers remained low and constant through time (Fig. 2), with our results suggesting that lagerpetids had a broad tolerance for a range of different climatic conditions, for example, higher thermal tolerances and/or other behavioural strategies to deal with high temperatures. By contrast, the earliest pterosaurs are found in low-latitude lacustrine and fluvial beds of the Chinle and Dockum basins during the early and middle Norian and more predominantly (but not exclusively) in coastal habitats of the northern Tethyan region3 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). However, within a few million years, pterosaurs are then found worldwide in remarkable variety of environments including many beyond low-latitudinal coastal regions, as shown by Arcticodactylus from fluvial deposits in Greenland (Fleming Fjord Formation, Norian–Rhaetian)38, Caelestiventus from the deserts of southwestern USA (Nugget Sandstone, upper Norian–Hettangian)41 and Pachagnathus and Yelaphomte from Argentina (Quebrada del Barro Formation, upper Norian–lower Rhaetian)20. In line with this clade's dramatic peak of dispersal in the middle Norian (Fig. 2), it is possible that these younger pterosaur occurrences are evidence of the clade's first dispersals outside of its hypothesized low-latitude ancestral area. As such, these occurrences might represent successive invasions of diverse habitats following a climatically driven ecological release (see below), rather than evidence of ancestral preference. The hypothesis of a rapid global spread8 from low latitudes finds support in (1) the phylogenetic predominance of low-latitude taxa closer to the root of the clade (2) and the ~6-million-year gap between the earliest identifiable pterosaurs in the fossil record (that is, SMU 69125, and PEFO 45782 from the early Norian of the southwestern USA) and the first occurrences of pterosaurs outside the palaeotropics (that is, Pachagnathus, Yelaphomte and Arcticodactylus from Greenland and South America).

The stratigraphic and biogeographical distribution of lagerpetids and pterosaurs, and any other group, is the result of prominent interaction of biotic and abiotic factors. The palaeoclimatically informed phylogeographic model and spatially explicit ecological niche models we generated offer an explanation for the above-mentioned biogeographical patterns. First, our climate-based principal component analysis (PCA) shows that, in the Norian–Rhaetian, lagerpetids and pterosaurs had statistically distinct climate preferences (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Table 1). Lagerpetids occupied a broad climatic niche and are found to inhabit pronoucedly warmer (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Table 1) and drier (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Table 1) localities than those yielding Triassic pterosaurs. The occurrence of lagerpetids under varied climatic conditions suggests a remarkable ecological versatility, which may have enabled their more continuous distribution across different latitudes (Fig. 4). By contrast, early pterosaurs exhibit a patchier distribution, particularly in terms of mean annual and seasonal temperatures (Fig. 3d,e). Pterosaur distribution may indicate a narrower, more specialized climatic preference and/or that these suitable conditions were initially limited to equatorial areas. Nevertheless, suitable conditions for pterosaurs are found globally, although in discontinuous patches, and less frequently in continental interiors, in the late Norian–Rhaetian (Fig. 4b,d), in accordance with the pattern of quantified latitudinal dispersal and increased geographical spread in the fossil record (Fig. 1). Another possibility is that, during this early stage of pterosaur evolutionary history, perhaps owing to initially constrained flight capabilities and/or partial confinement to arboreal environments1 (for example, to protect from predation and thermal stress or abundant food supply), their biogeography was constrained by the distribution of the canopy habitat they inhabited. As more suitable areas became available by the Norian (Fig. 4), pterosaurs may have dispersed latitudinally, benefiting from potentially increased suitable habitats. However, their climatic preferences might have resulted in a sparse and locally restricted distribution, a possibility confirmed by their modelled, patchily distributed suitable areas. This aspect could potentially be attributed to their limited capabilities for long-distance aerial dispersal and/or a stage that was still partially confined to arboreal environments. This unique ecology could account for the relatively high dispersal inertia observed in pterosaur lineages (Fig. 2a) and more pronounced latitudinal dispersion towards the latest Triassic (Fig. 2b,c) (that is, endemic dispersion within climatic blocks). Our combined analyses suggest that changes in the distribution and extension of climatically suitable areas throughout the Triassic are congruent with latitudinal dispersal patterns, demonstrating limited geographical overlap between lagerpetids and pterosaurs. This may exemplify the intricate interplay between climatic conditions and habitat, as well as the development of diverse pterosauromorph ecological niches, that probably acted on the spatiotemporal distribution of this clade. Paradoxically, pterosaurs survived the end-Triassic mass extinction but lagerpetids did not, despite pterosaurs occupying a patchier, narrower climatic niche and having a more restricted geographic distribution than lagerpetids before this event. This suggests that other factors such as the ability to fly might have played important roles in the differential survivorship of these two clades during this extinction.

Historically, the evolution of powered flight in vertebrates (that is, pterosaurs and bats43,44) has resulted in a geologically instantaneous and geographically widespread distribution; however, until recently, a lack of early pterosaur fossils prevented any assessment into whether the evolution of a volant vertebrate leads to a predictable biogeographic outcome. Now, efforts to understand the timing and place of pterosaur origin have increased in concert with recent discoveries. A literal reading of the Triassic pterosaurs record suggests that the group originated at low latitudes in northern Pangaea. This hypothesis is supported both by the early-diverging phylogenetic positions of European taxa8 and by the oldest occurrence of indeterminate specimens of this group in the early–middle part of the Norian in the southwestern USA. However, it is worth noting that, while there is probably a genuine biogeographical signal in these observations, they could also reflect severe sampling biases4,5,6. We can now explore this issue by combining the results of our analyses to provide a potential model that incorporates the biogeographical and climatic circumstances around this event. However, we must first address the absence of Middle Triassic–early Late Triassic pterosaurs from the fossil record.

The most recent divergence time estimates based on pterosauromorph phylogenetic relationships constrain pterosaur origin to a 10–15-million-year interval that extends across the Ladinian–early Norian2. However, while an Early Triassic or Middle Triassic origin for pterosaurs cannot be excluded, no body or trace fossils are known before the Norian1,8,12. Most of the earliest pterosaurs have been found in black shale lithologies in mid-latitudes from the middle Norian Alpine arch (that is, Italy, Austria and Germany). Similar facies are found in the same geographical area throughout the Anisian–Carnian interval, but despite the high potential for exceptional preservation at these localities, pre-Norian pterosaurs have yet to be found (or are currently unrecognized) from well-sampled Middle Triassic and early Late Triassic Lagerstätten not only in this region (for example, Monte San Giorgio, late Anisian–late Ladinian, Italy and Switzerland; upper Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk and lower Keuper, Anisian–Carnian, in Germany and equivalent beds in central Europe; Lunz, early Carnian, Austria) but also worldwide (Yangjuan, Anisian, China; Digxiao, Ladinian, China; Xinpu, Carnian, China; Raibl, early Carnian, Italy; Madygan, Ladinian–Carnian, Kyrgyzstan)9,12, even after decades of extensive sampling. Similarly, the absence of pterosaurs remains unexplained in the lower part of the Newark Supergroup in North America (that is, Lockatong Formation and Cow Branch Formation, lower Norian), which has yielded the fragile remains of gliding reptiles such as Icarosaurus and Mecistotrachelos, among others45,46.

Ecological niche modelling offers a potential explanation for pterosaur absences in these localities. Our analyses suggest that many of these areas were climatically unsuitable for pterosaurs before the Norian (Fig. 4). For instance, the northern margin of the Tethys Ocean was climatically poorly suitable for pterosaurs until the late Carnian (Fig. 4). This could support the idea that pterosaurs originated shortly before their first appearance in the fossil record and/or that pterosaurs originated earlier, and elsewhere, but did not have a global distribution until later in the Norian1,12. However, while our model does not necessarily support a pre-Norian origin of the group in the Tethyan region, it provides an additional explanation for their earlier absence from this area and time interval. Specifically, our results suggest that there is potential for pre-Norian and early-Norian pterosaurs to be found elsewhere, in areas identified as habitable in our palaeoclimatically informed suitability models (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3). Our niche models suggest that it might have been possible for pterosaurs to occur in the late Middle Triassic (Anisian–Ladinian) deposits of the southwest USA (upper Moenkopi Formation of Arizona and New Mexico), Morocco (members T3–T4 of the Timezgadiouine Formation, Argana Basin), India (Yerrapalli Formation), China (Xingyi fauna), Tanzania (Lifua Member of the Manda Beds), Brazil (lower Santa Maria Supersequence) and potentially southern and central Europe (for example, Dont Formation, Italy; Vellberg Formation, Germany). Suitable areas during the Carnian include the southwestern USA (for example, lower Otischalkian beds in the Dockum Group of Texas and New Mexico), Brazil (middle Santa Maria Formation), Argentina (Chañares Formation and lower Ischigualasto Formation), India (Tiki Formation and Maleri Formation), Madagascar (Isalo II/Makay Formation), continental Europe (Krasiejów locality, Poland), the lower Norian beds of the southwestern USA (upper Otischalkian and lowermost Adamanian beds of the Chinle Formation and Dockum Group, Arizona, Texas and New Mexico) and the basins of the Newark Supergroup, among others. In addition to these areas, the South China block shows high climatic suitability throughout the Anisian–early Norian. The upper portion of the Anisian–Carnian Guanling Formation (Panxian Fauna, Guanling Biota) also has high climatic suitability to yield pterosaur fossils, although the fossil record of its marine fauna shows limited terrestrial influence.

These results carry the caveat of known biases in the pterosaur fossil record4,5,6,9 (Supplementary Information) but provide testable hypotheses for future targeted fieldwork. While these formations were deposited in areas of high climatic suitability for pterosaurs, their geological characteristics might not have been suitable for preserving their fossils. As noted previously, many Triassic pterosaurs are preferentially preserved in black shale units1,12, although partial skeletons and individual bones have been more commonly recovered from fluvial, alluvial and desert depositional environments more recently20,38,41. Accordingly, among the above-mentioned formations, we particularly emphasize target lithologies representative of palaeoenvironments with known high preservation potential, particularly microvertebrate bonebeds, as these facies have the highest chance to preserve the small, fragile body fossils of Triassic pterosaurs. Articulated or associated skeletons comprise nearly all Triassic pterosaur occurrences, suggesting that their record in deposits where bones are recovered as disassociated and isolated elements (for example, microvertebrate bonebeds) may be underrepresented due to a lack of recognizable diagnostic features in collected skeletal elements from these settings.

Our study examines the historical palaeobiogeography of pterosaurs and their close relatives, lagerpetids, which together comprise pterosauromorphs. We identify climatic limits shaping the distribution of Triassic pterosauromorphs. Although multiple factors probably contributed to the distribution of these groups, the broad climatic adaptability and wide latitudinal spread of lagerpetids suggest ecological versatility, which allowed members of this group to thrive in localities with considerably warmer conditions than those yielding Triassic pterosaur remains. By contrast, early pterosaurs had a more constrained distribution in terms of mean annual and seasonal temperatures, favouring wetter areas that became more common after the Carnian, enabling their spread during the latest Triassic.

Our study independently aligns with the hypothesis suggesting that pterosaurs became widespread soon after their likely origin in the Middle Triassic–Late Triassic2. Furthermore, the modelled Carnian–early Norian pterosaur climatic niche would probably be found in temperate and wet conditions typical of tropical, near-coastal low-to-middle-latitude depositional environments. In emphasizing the complex interplay between climatic conditions, habitat and the development of diverse ecological niches, our study contributes valuable insights into the evolution and distribution of pterosaurs and their close relatives.

To explore the phylo-palaeobiogeography of Triassic pterosauromorphs, we implemented complementary analyses based on two recently published studies to (1) assess the degree to which pterosauromorphs dispersed across climatic barriers compared with other avemetatarsalian clades (following ref. 14) and (2) quantify the latitudinal dispersion of lagerpetids and pterosaurs alongside that of other avemetatarsalians (following ref. 11). To better compare the results of these analyses, which drew on different datasets, we assembled and tip-dated an avemetatarsalian supertree (Extended Data Fig. 1). This grafts the dinosaur tree topology recovered by ref. 14 into a randomly selected most parsimonious tree of Archosauromorpha from ref. 11. We then manually incorporated the dinosaurian and silesaurid taxa present in the latter dataset but not the former. This strategy allowed us to retain the entire pterosauromorph sample included in ref. 11, which is the most comprehensive available for this group. Each taxon in this newly assembled dataset was then scored for two different sets of geographical areas (see below). This was deemed necessary because the two above-mentioned studies were designed using distinct geographical frameworks (see details below). Overall, these operations improved the sampling of the selected avemetatarsalian groups and allowed more meaningful comparisons between the two sets of biogeographical analyses. Our analyses cover the Ladinian–Rhaetian interval, but the taxonomic sample includes Jurassic species, enabling consideration of all potential dispersal events nested in the Triassic.

Griffin et al.14 demonstrated the limited impact of changing archosaur topology in their results. However, their tree did not include a broad sample of lagerpetids and pterosaurs, so here we focus on the impact that different pterosauromorph tree topologies could have on our results. In Pterosauromorpha, the relationships within Pterosauria are relatively well established, so the topology here adopted corresponds to the strict consensus from ref. 11 and derivative analyses. Conversely, the relationships within Lagerpetidae are not well resolved, and it is not possible to produce a fully resolved strict consensus topology. However, for the purpose of our biogeographical analyses, this does not matter because the alternance of ‘Laurasian' and ‘Gondwanan' areas of origin at the tips is broadly maintained: a South American taxon (that is, Faxinalipterus) is consistently found at the earliest diverging branch, followed by Scleromochlus, from Europe. Further up the tree, a minority of North America taxa (that is, Dromomeron romeri and Dromomeron gregorii) are found nested within a majority of South American species. Our choice of using a randomly selected tree following ref. 14 is thus justified because the patterns of geographical areas at the tips of the tree are broadly stable and the patterns of potential of latitudinal dispersion and accumulated latitudinal dispersion are not affected by the taxon order of the tips (Supplementary Information).

First, we implemented an event-based quantitative analysis that aimed to assess the potential for pterosauromorph latitudinal dispersal during the waxing and waning of climatic barriers, following the methodology of ref. 14. Griffin et al.14 originally developed this method to test “whether the early phylogenetic history of dinosaurs retains a signal for restricted dispersal” (p. 317). Here, we applied the protocol to pterosauromorphs, which were sparsely represented in the latter study. We limit our interpretation of the pterosauromorph curve to the Ladinian–Carnian portion of the whole interval, where the signal is driven primarily by lagerpetids, because we cannot be sure to what extent our model is applicable to volant taxa, as pterosaurs affect the Carnian–Rhaetian portion of the results.

We implemented this analysis following the methodology of Griffin et al.14. First, we scored each taxon in the newly assembled dataset for one of five geographical regions: eastern Laurasia, western Laurasia, equatorial belt, northern Gondwana or southern Gondwana. These regions were selected because of the biogeographical importance of their boundaries throughout the Ladinian–Rhaetian (our interval of interest), namely, an arid belt in low-latitude southern Pangaea47 and, less relevant to the time interval of our study, the Hispanic Corridor and Viking Strait48,49. Second, we extended the lower boundary of the analyses to include the Ladinian stage to include the complete stratigraphic range of lagerpetids. We then implemented a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) model on the time-calibrated phylogeny under maximum likelihood. To simulate the waxing and waning of arid climatic barriers to dispersal, we adopted distinct rate matrices of dispersal across selected geographical areas and tested their occurrence across the whole interval. The Δ-likelihood is a measure of how strongly the dispersal pattern is supported at any time: in other words, a more negative Δ indicates dispersal/waning of climatic barriers. The Δ measures how much dispersal is occurring by imposing a penalty when the climate barrier is crossed. Thus, the Δ will be more negative when more organisms (lineages) are dispersing when barriers are present. Conversely, a Δ closer to zero indicates strong barriers to dispersal, or that the crossing of barriers was sporadic and largely followed by cladogenesis. Overall, this model uses the phylogeny of different avemetatarsalian groups to test whether, and when, climatic barriers affected the dispersal of each group, particularly lagerpetids, during the Ladinian–Rhaetian.

We also quantified the latitudinal dispersal of each avemetatarsalian group, following the methodology of Müller et al.11. Differing from that study, we decided against pruning the lagerpetids Kongonaphon kely and PVSJ 883 to enhance completeness. The stratigraphic and palaeobiogeographical occurrences of these taxa are of paramount importance for our analyses, and we believe that the benefits of their inclusion outweigh the uncertainties in their phylogenetic positions. Specifically, Kongonaphon kely is not only the stratigraphically oldest lagerpetid but also the only member of this clade from this region of Gondwana (Madagascar, representing the Indian subcontinent + Madagascar continental area). Similarly, we retained the unnamed taxon PVSJ 883, from the late Carnian of Argentina10,16, because its occurrence suggests a dispersal event that would otherwise be ignored.

To run the analyses, we used the same tip-dated supertree of Avemetatarsalia as discussed above. This time, each taxon in the dataset was assigned to one of eight discrete geographic areas (that is, western North America, eastern North America, Brazil, Argentina, Europe + Russia, South Africa, and Indian subcontinent + Madagascar) among the ten determined by Button et al.50. The quantification of dispersal events relies on reconstructing ancestral states at internal nodes. This was achieved using the R package BioGeoBEARS51 v.1.1.2 in R v.4.3.1 (ref. 52), using different likelihood-based palaeobiogeographic models: DEC, dispersal vicariance analysis likelihood (LIKEDIVA) and BAYAREALIKE. Only the simple DEC model was used for subsequent calculations to avoid long-distance palaeolatitudinal jumps in the latitudinal dispersion calculations14 following Müller et al.11, and for meaningful comparison with the first analysis that is also based on DEC14 for the same reason. However, we notice that, in our comparisons of biogeographical models, ‘+j' models are better supported (Supplementary Table 1). This may suggest a more complex biogeographic history in which (aerial?) dispersal rather than vicariance may have been the dominating phenomenon (expected in flying animals) in early pterosaur macroevolution.

Because the main barriers preventing dispersion in the Middle to Late Triassic were arid latitudinal belts at mid-to-low latitudes47, we quantified the accumulated amount of latitudinal dispersal of lagerpetids and pterosaurs separately and compared them with those of other avemetatarsalian clades (silesaurids and dinosaurs).

First, we counted the number of dispersal events across the tree by identifying those branches with different geographical values at their nodes (or tips). The latitudes of well-known avemetatarsalian-bearing localities were adopted as proxies for the broader geographic area and used to calculate the latitudinal extent of dispersion events. The localities we used are the same as those in Müller et al.11: Otis Chalk Quarries (western North America, palaeolatitude 6.9° N); New Haven County (eastern North America, 16.2° N); Buriol site (Brazil, palaeolatitude 39.7° S); Quebrada del Puma site (Argentina, palaeolatitude 40.6° S); Lombardia (Europe + Russia, palaeolatitude 27.1° N); Free State (South Africa, 42.8° S); and Manda (Indian subcontinent, palaeolatitude 53.7° S). Unlike ref. 11, we did not discard uncertain nodes but instead averaged the latitudinal values of different areas when an overwhelming signal was not computed. Only events that started (but did not necessarily end) in the Triassic were included in the final analyses.

The total amount of latitudinal dispersion (measured in degrees) for each clade was then calculated and plotted across the Anisian–Rhaetian through 1-million-year-long bins (Fig. 2b) and subsequently averaged by the number of dispersal events in each interval (Fig. 2c). These calculations were done using a slight modification of the R codes provided by Müller et al.11 (see ‘Code availability' section).

To explore the palaeoclimatic niches occupied by pterosauromorph lineages, we compiled a locality-based dataset of all Triassic lagerpetid and pterosaur occurrences. This integrated a literature search with unpublished fieldwork data (20+ years in the southwestern USA in Arizona, Texas and New Mexico)3,11,17,20,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,40,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74 (see ‘Dataset_pterosauromorphs_R1.xls' in Supplementary Data 1). Unique occurrence data were recorded for each specimen in our dataset. Unnamed and/or undescribed specimens were examined in person and included to increase the data available for our palaeoclimate niche analyses. This sampling strategy means that the datasets for the palaeobiogeographic and climate analyses are independent (that is, the first relies on phylogeny and the second on occurrence data), but all taxa present in the former are also included in the latter. This strategy recognizes the value of including undescribed or indeterminate lagerpetid and pterosaur specimens, which provide fundamental information on the distributions of their respective clades, even if they cannot be included in phylogenetic analyses. The lagerpetids included in the palaeoclimate niche analyses but excluded from the phylogenetic framework (and, hence, the palaeobiogeographic analyses) are: the indeterminate lagerpetids (NMMMNH P-80469, PEFO 44476 and PEFO 50545) from, respectively, NMMNH L-149 in the Los Esteros Member of the Santa Rosa Formation of New Mexico (Otischalkian holochronozone, lower Norian)64, PFV 456 (Thunderstorm Ridge) in the Blue Mesa Member (Adamanian holochronozone, middle Norian)34 and PFV 215 (Zuni Well Mound) in the Petrified Forest Member (Revueltian holochronozone, upper Norian)34 of the Chinle Formation of Petrified Forest National Park and multiple representatives of the genus Dromomeron from 13 distinct localities in the southwestern USA30,31,34,59,60,61,62,67 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). Similarly, the pterosaurs that are present in the palaeoclimate analysis but could not be included in the phylogenetic dataset are Arcticodactylus from Greenland38,40, which is currently under investigation68; three unnamed pterosaurs from the southwestern USA, including an undescribed pterosaur (tentatively referred to as Eudimorphodon sp.) from the ‘Kalgary localities' (approximately upper Carnian–lower Norian) of the Tecovas Formation of the Dockum Group3,69 and fig. 9.5 in ref. 70, two undescribed pterosaurs from the Chinle Formation of Petrified Forest National Park, one (PEFO 45782) from PFV 456 (Thunderstorm Ridge) in the Blue Mesa Member (Adamanian holochronozone, middle Norian, ~220 Mya (refs. 73,74)); and an undescribed pterosaur (PEFO 53384) from the Owl Rock Member (Apachean holochronozone, late Norian)71. Finally, MCSNB 8950 is an unnamed taxon from the Argilliti di Riva di Solto Formation of northern Italy (upper Norian), which was previously referred to Eudimorphodon ranzi72 but is now thought to be an unnamed new genus12.

However, because the resolution of the general circulation (palaeoclimatic) models is 1° × 1° (~111 km2) (see below), we consider only one locality if more than one specimen was found in a radius smaller than 111 km, unless they yielded different taxa (for example, the pterosaur localities in northern Italy). The occurrence of taxa with uncertain stratigraphic ranges covering multiple time bins was considered present in each of the relevant bins. This resulted in a summarized dataset of 54 occurrences (24 pterosaur and 30 lagerpetid entries; Supplementary Data 1).

To explore whether palaeoclimatic conditions influenced the biogeographic distributions of pterosaurs and lagerpetids, we integrated occurrence data for these groups with outputs from a general circulation (palaeoclimate) model. The values extracted from these models show a good match with the estimates from geochemical, sedimentological and biological proxies at the basin level and broader scales (for example, see refs. 75,76 for a detailed study of the palaeoclimate of the Chañares–Los Rastros–Ischigualasto Triassic succession). The accuracy and evaluation of general circulation (palaeoclimate) model outputs are further discussed in the Supplementary Information. Palaeoclimate model simulations used a recent version of the coupled Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Model and HadCM3L77 (specifically HadCM3L-M2.1aD), following the nomenclature in the work of Malanoski et al.78), including the modifications described by Judd et al.79. The model has a resolution of 3.75° longitude × 2.5° latitude in the atmosphere and ocean, with 19 hybrid levels in the atmosphere and 20 vertical levels in the ocean with equations solved on the Arakawa B-grid. Atmospheric subgrid scale processes such as convection are parameterized as they cannot be resolved at the resolution of the model. The ocean model is based on the model of Valdes et al.80 and is a full primitive equation, three-dimensional model of the ocean. A second-order numerical scheme is used along with centred advection to remove nonlinear instabilities. Flux adjustments (such as artificial heat and salinity adjustments in the ocean model to prevent the model drifting to unrealistic values) are not required in this model81, which is crucial for long palaeoclimate simulations. Sea ice is calculated on a zero-layer model with partial sea ice coverage possible, with a consistent salinity assumed for ice. Because geological data recording land surface vegetation for Triassic stages are uncertain and globally sparse, we use a version of the model that includes the dynamical vegetation model TRIFFID (Top-Down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics) and land surface scheme MOSES 2.1a (ref. 82). TRIFFID predicts the distribution and properties of global vegetation based on plant functional types (PFTs), in the form of fractional coverage (and, thus, PFT coexistence) within a grid cell, and is, in turn, based on competition equations based on the climate tolerance of five PFTs. The HadCM3L model demonstrates high performance at reproducing the modern-day climate79 and has been used for an array of pre-Quaternary palaeoclimate experiments79,83,84. Palaeoclimate experiments typically require on the order of hundreds of years to reach a near-surface quasi-equilibrium state (but many thousands of years for the deep ocean79,80) as well as true climate equilibrium. Relatively low-resolution global climate models such as HadCM3L are relatively computationally expensive, allowing near-fully equilibrated simulations of climate to be undertaken that would not be possible with higher-resolution, more complex models85.

Seven model simulations with Ladinian (239.54 Ma), ‘early' Carnian (233.6 Ma), ‘late' Carnian (232 Ma), ‘early' Norian (227 Ma), ‘middle' Norian (222.4 Ma), ‘late' Norian (217.8 Ma) and Rhaetian (204.9 Ma) were carried out using stage-specific boundary conditions (topography, bathymetry, solar luminosity, continental ice and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2)). Stage-specific realistic carbon dioxide concentrations were chosen on the basis of proxy-CO2 (Ladinian, 1,034 ppm; ‘early' Carnian, 1,492 ppm; ‘late' Carnian, 1,614 ppm; ‘early' Norian, 2,059 ppm; ‘middle' Norian, 1,810 ppm; ‘late' Norian, 1,481 ppm; and Rhaetian, 1,503 ppm) reconstructions from ref. 86, and the solar constant was based on ref. 87. The orography and bathymetry were derived from palaeogeographic digital elevation models, produced by ref. 88 as part of the PALEOMAP project (see ref. 79 for more details). Each stage-specific digital elevation model is interpolated from a 1° × 1° grid onto the model 3.75° × 2.5° grid. Similarly, land ice is also transformed onto the model grid assuming a simple parabolic shape to estimate the ice sheet height (m). Surface soil conditions were set at a uniform medium loam everywhere because stage-specific soil parameters during the Triassic are not globally known. All other boundary conditions (such as orbital parameters, aerosol concentrations and so on) are held constant at preindustrial values. The simulations were carried out for a total of over 10,000 years. By the end of the simulations, (1) the globally and volume-integrated annual mean ocean temperature trend is less than 1 °C per 1,000 years; (2) trends in surface air temperature are less than 0.3 °C per 1,000 years; and (3) net energy balance at the top of the atmosphere, averaged over a 100-year period at the end of the simulation, is less than 0.25 W m−2. Climatological means were produced from the last 100 years of each simulation. All these simulations are identical to the ‘Scotese07' simulations described in ref. 78 and the ‘model 2' simulations of ref. 79. The climate predicted by the model is compared with proxy indicators of climate in the Supplementary Information. The outputs from the simulations are available at https://www.paleo.bristol.ac.uk/ummodel/scripts/html_bridge/scotese_07.html.

To explore the climatic conditions occupied by pterosauromorphs during the Late Triassic, multivariate statistical tests were used and summary statistic plots were constructed. This approach is commonly used in modern ecology89,90,91,92,93 and, in the past decade, has become more common in studies pertaining to the fossil record of both invertebrate94,95,96,97,98,99 and vertebrate groups15,16,73,100. Accordingly, each taxon was assigned climate variables based on the mean values for their stratigraphic age and geographic locations (namely, mean annual temperature (MAT), MAP, seasonal variation in temperature and seasonal variation in precipitation; Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). Taxa spanning two geological stages (n = 8) were assigned the mean of the variables for both stages and assigned single, averaged, stratigraphic occurrence. To quantify ‘palaeoclimatic niche space' for each taxon, we followed the procedure outlined in ref. 16. Obtaining information on species' fundamental niches from the fossil record is challenging: therefore, the term ‘palaeoclimatic niche' as used here refers to an approximation of the realized climatic niche of the fossil taxa (that is, the set of climatic conditions occupied by a taxon16). A PCA was performed using the prcomp() function in R v.4.4.2 (ref. 52), which included the scaling argument so that variables were scaled to have unit variance before the analysis took place. A non-parametric MANOVA was performed to statistically compare the distribution of the two groups using the R package RVAideMemoire89. Raincloud plots displaying both box plots (depicting the distributions of the palaeoclimate data within the taxonomic groups) and frequency distributions were constructed to examine the range of individual palaeoclimatic conditions occupied by both groups. To statistically compare the distributions between both groups, pairwise comparisons were performed in R using Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann–Whitney) tests. These specific statistical tests were chosen because the palaeoclimate variable data do not conform to the assumptions of a normal distribution, which was determined through probability plots (for example, quartile–quartile plots) and Shapiro–Wilk tests.

To assess the climatic suitability of these taxa, we implemented the DOMAIN algorithm100 through the R package ‘dismo'101, which is an ecological niche modelling tool using the Gower distance metric to assess climatic suitability. The DOMAIN algorithm quantifies the disparity between the climatic conditions of map pixels and the nearest species observation within the n-dimensional environmental space, diverging from geographic proximity. Although this model is generally classified as a coarse niche modelling technique102,103,104,105, it offers the advantage of straightforward implementation and minimal assumptions, which are necessary due to the paucity of the pterosauromorph fossil record. Given the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of our dataset, coupled with our exclusive focus on producing suitability maps based solely on climate, and the low number of occurrences in our datasets, we favoured this simplistic modelling approach over more recently introduced ecological niche and habitat suitability modelling techniques, including those previously used by our team in prior works101,102,103,104,105, where the associated limitations and assumptions are also addressed. We furthermore calibrated the model on a compound occurrence dataset that maximizes the geographic spread for each of the subclades, centring on the best sampled interval (the middle–late Norian, 218 Ma) and including palaeobiogeographic outliers from the Carnian (Lagerpetidae) and throughout the full duration of the Norian for pterosaurs, projecting these models into more refined climatic simulations (eight time slices from the Ladinian to the Rhaetian). MAT (°C) and MAP (mm per year) are the variables used for the habitat suitability modelling.

Metrics details

Kupffer cells (KCs) are tissue-resident macrophages that colonize the liver early during embryogenesis1. Upon liver colonization, KCs rapidly acquire a tissue-specific transcriptional signature, mature alongside the developing liver and adapt to its functions1,2,3. Throughout development and adulthood, KCs perform distinct core functions that are essential for liver and organismal homeostasis, including supporting fetal erythropoiesis, postnatal erythrocyte recycling and liver metabolism4. However, whether perturbations of macrophage core functions during development contribute to or cause disease at postnatal stages is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a mouse model of maternal obesity to perturb KC functions during gestation. We show that offspring exposed to maternal obesity develop fatty liver disease, driven by aberrant developmental programming of KCs that persists into adulthood. Programmed KCs promote lipid uptake by hepatocytes through apolipoprotein secretion. KC depletion in neonate mice born to obese mothers, followed by replenishment with naive monocytes, rescues fatty liver disease. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF1α) in macrophages during gestation prevents the metabolic programming of KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, thereby averting the development of fatty liver disease. These results establish developmental perturbation of KC functions as a causal factor in fatty liver disease in adulthood and position fetal-derived macrophages as critical intergenerational messengers within the concept of developmental origins of health and diseases5.

Early-life environmental factors strongly influence the risk of developing non-communicable diseases in adulthood, a concept known as developmental origins of health and diseases (DOHaDs)5. Maternal malnutrition, obesity, infection, environmental pollutants and psychosocial stress have been associated with metabolic disorders, neurological diseases, cancer and dysregulated immune responses in offspring6,7,8,9,10,11. At the cellular level, maternal immune activation can alter fetal haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), contributing to neonatal sepsis12. A maternal high-fat diet (HFD) or viral infection can also program microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, leading to neuronal disorders9,13. However, it remains elusive whether macrophages outside the brain can act as intergenerational messengers and causally contribute to disease onset, serving as cellular components in DOHaDs7,8.

Tissue-resident macrophages, including KCs in the liver, are long-lived, yolk sac-derived cells that support tissue development and homeostasis via production of growth factors, signalling molecules, and phagocytosis of waste products and apoptotic cells4. The liver, one of the first organs colonized by macrophages1, exposes fetal KCs early to maternal blood components from the placenta14. Whether maternal environmental factors, particularly diet, influence KC development and functions, thereby leading to liver disease, remains unknown.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is rising with global obesity15. MAFLD can progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In diet-induced MAFLD, yolk sac-derived KCs can lose self-renewal and are, at least partially, replaced by monocyte-derived KC-like cells, diversifying the macrophage pool16,17,18,19. These macrophages adapt to the fatty liver environment, altering their epigenome and transcriptome, and contribute to disease progression through the secretion of inflammatory and non-inflammatory mediators19,20. Although our understanding of MAFLD and the role of KCs in disease progression to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis is growing, it remains unclear how KCs respond to maternal obesity-induced fatty liver disease (FLD) in the offspring and whether they drive disease onset.

Here we show that maternal obesity induces a HIF1α-dependent metabolic reprogramming of yolk sac-derived KCs, persisting into adulthood and driving FLD. Using fate-mapping, depletion and conditional knockout (KO) models, combined with multi-omic profiling, we identified KCs as intergenerational messengers that translate maternal nutritional cues into long-lasting hepatic dysfunction. Our study uncovers a causal link between developmental KC perturbation and adult-onset FLD, positioning yolk sac-derived macrophages as central players in DOHaDs.

Maternal obesity is associated with obesity and liver disease in offspring in humans and animal models21, yet mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that KCs may contribute to FLD due to their early liver colonization and metabolic roles4. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6Jrcc female mice were fed a HFD for 8 weeks, leading to increased body weight and homeostatic model for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). These diet conditions did not lead to maternal inflammation as assessed by serum cytokine and chemokine measurements, with only interleukin-1α (IL-1α), C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) and leptin being upregulated (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). Females were then bred to control diet (CD)-fed males. To dissect gestational versus lactational effects, newborn mice were cross-fostered and/or weaned onto a CD or HFD (Fig. 1a, maternal obese groups). As maternal lean control groups, we analysed offspring born to CD females and fed with a CD throughout life or weaned on a HFD (Fig. 1a). At 11 weeks, the maternal obese groups fed with a CD after birth (HFDMCDLCD; M denotes maternal diet during gestation and L refers to foster mother diet during lactating phase) or weaning (HFDMHFDLCD) showed no differences in body weight or white adipose tissue (WAT) weight compared with the maternal lean group on a CD (CDMCDLCD; Extended Data Fig. 1e). Only groups on a HFD postnatally (CDMCDLHFD, HFDMCDLHFD and HFDMHFDLHFD) developed obesity (Extended Data Fig. 1e), indicating that a post-weaning diet, not maternal obesity alone, determines overall body and WAT weight.

By contrast, liver lipid content increased in all maternal obese groups, as shown in the Oil-red-O (ORO) and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stainings, although the liver weight was similar in all conditions (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Both principal component analysis (PCA; Fig. 1d) and hierarchical clustering of lipidomics analyses (Extended Data Fig. 1g) indicated that maternal obese groups with a CD as their final diet (HFD>CD) were distinct from all animals fed a HFD as their final diet (CD>HFD and HFD>HFD), all of which diverge from CDMCDLCD (CD>CD). Indeed, the HFDMCDLCD and HFDMHFDLCD groups showed a significant increase of lipid species, such as saturated triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and cholesterol esters, whereas maternal lean CDMCDLHFD as well as maternal obese HFDMCDLHFD and HFDMHFDLHFD groups showed only a moderate increase of lipid accumulation compared with CDMCDLCD livers.

We next performed serum metabolomics profiling of more than 900 metabolites and lipids to test whether the observed FLD phenotype of offspring born to obese mothers is also associated with systemic alterations, which might even serve as specific biomarkers. Group differences primarily reflected final dietary status (CD versus HFD; Extended Data Fig. 1h and Supplementary Table 1). Comparing CDMCDLCD with HFDMCDLCD offspring, in which body composition was similar but the FLD phenotype was most prominent in HFDMCDLCD livers, revealed 129 significantly altered metabolites (Supplementary Table 2), which were enriched in the metabolic pathways ‘taurine and hypotaurine metabolism', ‘arginine biosynthesis' and ‘histidine metabolism' (Extended Data Fig. 1i). In particular, the glutamine:glutamate ratio, two amino acids that feed into arginine biosynthesis, was significantly increased in HFDMCDLCD mice (Supplementary Table 2). Although generally decreased in FLD22, a maternal obesity model has reported an increased ratio correlating with liver metabolic state23, suggesting a biomarker for maternal obesity-driven FLD. In summary, maternal obesity induces a distinct FLD phenotype in offspring compared with postnatal diet-induced FLD.

We next characterized the maternal obesity-induced FLD phenotype focusing on hepatic myeloid cells, which have a critical role in FLD initiation and propagation24. Quantification confirmed increased neutrophils, monocytes and classical dendritic cells (cDC1 and cDC2) in HFDMCDLCD offspring (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). KC numbers were increased across maternal obese groups, whereas liver capsular macrophages were unaffected. Post-weaning HFD in maternal lean controls (CDMCDLHFD) did not induce myeloid cell influx (Extended Data Fig. 2b). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sorted KCs (Extended Data Fig. 2c) revealed clustering according to their in utero exposure to either lean (CD>) or obese (HFD>) mothers (Fig. 1e). Co-expression network analysis (hCo-Cena)25 identified five modules (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 3). The steelblue module represented genes upregulated by maternal obesity. Pathway enrichment analyses using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and HALLMARK databases revealed an upregulation of genes related to ‘cell activation involved in immune response'. Among these genes was Trem2, which has been previously described to be upregulated in KCs during FLD17, and which was accompanied by its downstream signalling cascade molecules Tyrobp and Syk in the same module (Fig. 1g). In addition, Myd88, Gpnmb and the monocyte-specific genes Ccr2 and Cx3cr1 were found in the steelblue module with the highest expression in HFDMCDLCD KCs (Fig. 1g). Moreover, we found the term ‘glycolysis/gluconeogenesis' to be enriched in the steelblue module (Fig. 1f). By contrast, the turquoise and lightgreen modules indicated that metabolic processes such as ‘oxidative phosphorylation', ‘cellular respiration' and ‘xenobiotic metabolism' were downregulated upon maternal obesity (Fig. 1f). Thus, maternal obesity causes an inflammatory response of KCs, and leads to an alteration of their metabolic status on a transcriptional level. To validate the transcriptional changes of KCs at the protein level, we performed spectral flow cytometry-based metabolic profiling26 of KCs from CDMCDLCD and HFDMCDLCD offspring (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Although most nutrient transporters and metabolic enzymes involved in the glucose and lipid metabolic pathways remained unchanged, the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA), a key component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) were reduced in HFDMCDLCD KCs compared with CDMCDLCD (Extended Data Fig. 2e). These findings indicate that maternal obesity impairs the metabolic capacity of offspring KCs.

To determine systemic effects, we assessed serum cytokines and bone marrow compartment cellularity. No systemic cytokine elevation or progenitor changes were observed (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). Together, maternal obesity-induced FLD is accompanied by local inflammation and a switch of KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis.

Diet-induced FLD models show increased monocyte influx and replacement of yolk sac-derived KCs16,17,18. Our RNA-seq data hinted at a monocyte signature in KCs from maternal obesity offspring. To address KC ontogeny, we generated Tnfrsf11aCre;Rosa26LSL-YFP;Ms4a3FlpO;Rosa26FSF-tdTomato mice. This double fate mapper allows to follow ontogeny of yolk sac-derived pre-macrophages and bone marrow-derived monocytes simultaneously using a combination of conventional recombinase approaches (Fig. 2a,b). We have previously shown that Tnfrsf11aCre mice label pre-macrophages and their progeny efficiently1. However, Tnfrsf11a is a core macrophage gene1 whose expression is induced once monocytes differentiate into macrophages27,28 whereby fetal-derived and bone marrow-derived macrophages remain undistinguishable. Thus, we additionally took advantage of the newly developed Ms4a3FlpO mice (Extended Data Fig. 4a), as we previously have shown that the Ms4a3 locus specifically targets monocytes and, thus, all monocyte-derived macrophages29. First, we confirmed that the fate-mapping efficiency of Ms4a3FlpO mice was as efficient as in Ms4a3Cre mice, with more than 95% Ly6C+ blood monocytes being labelled with tdTomato (tdT; Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Among these monocytes, we observed a small fraction (approximately 13%) that already expressed YFP, suggesting that these cells already start to express a core macrophage program. However, none of the monocytes was only YFP+, demonstrating that the double fate mapper can unequivocally distinguish between the yolk sac-derived and adult bone marrow-derived waves of haematopoiesis (Extended Data Fig. 4c). High YFP labelling was also confirmed in microglia that are yolk sac derived30,31 (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). In 11–12-week-old CDMCDLCD livers, more than 96% of KCs were YFP+, with minimal tdT labelling (less than 1% for YFP+tdT+ and approximately 3% for tdT+; Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4d), consistent with yolk sac origin1,29. Similarly, HFDMCDLCD KCs retained high YFP labelling (approximately 96%), despite the FLD phenotype and monocyte gene upregulation. Thus, KCs remain of yolk sac origin despite experiencing maternal obesity and a FLD environment during adulthood, and therefore can serve as intergenerational messengers conveying information that they experience in utero to adult life.

We hypothesized that developmental programming of KCs by maternal obesity impairs their homeostatic function and promotes FLD via paracrine signalling. To test this hypothesis, we co-cultured hepatocytes with KCs from CDMCDLCD or HFDMCDLCD livers without direct cell contact, ensuring that only paracrine signalling occurred (Fig. 2d). Real-time lipid accumulation in hepatocytes was monitored using LD540 labelling to visualize neutral lipids via live-cell imaging. Hepatocytes co-cultured with HFDMCDLCD KCs exhibited significantly greater lipid accumulation, as indicated by increased LD540 intensity after 4 h, compared with those co-cultured with CDMCDLCD KCs (Fig. 2e). Thus, KCs that have experienced dietary factors from obese mothers during embryogenesis exert their FLD-promoting function via paracrine signalling.

To further validate KC-dependent lipid accumulation in hepatocytes in vivo, we utilized the KC–diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) mouse model32, in which human DTR is expressed under the control of the KC-specific Clec4f promoter, enabling targeted depletion of KCs within 24 h following a single dose of diphtheria toxin (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). We generated HFDMCDLCD offspring with either the Clec4fDTR/+ or Clec4f+/+ genotype. At postnatal day 0 (P0), diphtheria toxin was injected to deplete KCs in Clec4fDTR/+, followed by transplantation of tdT+ bone marrow monocytes and HSPCs from naive mice at P1 to replenish the KC niche (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5c). We confirmed the presence of tdT+ KC-like cells in the adult liver of Clec4fDTR/+ mice, despite a large fraction of KC-like cells originating also from endogenous tdT− progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 5d). This treatment effectively rescued the fatty liver phenotype in Clec4fDTR/+ HFDMCDLCD mice, as evidenced by reduced lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes, demonstrated by ORO and H&E staining (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 5e). By contrast, Clec4f+/+ littermates receiving the same diphtheria toxin injection and cell transfer retained lipid accumulation, consistent with observations in C57BL/6Jrcc mice (Fig. 1b,c). Moreover, replenishment of the empty KC niche solely by endogenous monocytes or HSPCs and residual KCs (Clec4fDTR/+ mice injected with diphtheria toxin but without any cell transfer from a naive source), did not rescue the fatty liver phenotype (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 5e), indicating that HSPCs themselves may be developmentally programmed, as previously reported33,34. In summary, we demonstrate that KC-derived paracrine factors drive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes in the offspring of obese mothers.

As HIF1α regulates the metabolic switch of macrophages from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis35,36, we tested whether preventing HIF1α-dependent developmental programming of KCs by maternal obesity would rescue the FLD phenotype. We used LysMCre;Hif1af/f mice, in which Hif1a is depleted in macrophages and other myeloid cells37. As maternal diet during lactation showed minimal impact (Fig. 1), we focused on the dietary switch after birth in the maternal obese groups and used HFD-fed animals after weaning as control groups (Fig. 3a). Both Hif1af/f (wild type (WT)) and LysMCre;Hif1af/f (KO) littermates gained body weight and WAT weight when the end diet was a HFD (CDMHFD and HFDMHFD), indicating that myeloid-specific loss of HIF1α does not prevent diet-induced obesity (Extended Data Fig. 6a).

Next, we focused on the liver phenotype. As in the C57BL/6Jrcc mice, the total liver weight remained unaltered (Extended Data Fig. 6a), and Hif1af/f offspring born to obese mothers (HFDMCD WT) developed a FLD, as observed by ORO staining (Fig. 3b,c) and lipidomics (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Similar to the lipidomics results in C57BL/6Jrcc mice, HFDMCD WT offspring showed an increase of saturated triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters. However, HFDMCD KO offspring was rescued from developing a FLD (Fig. 3b–d and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c), indicating that depletion of HIF1α in KCs during embryogenesis is sufficient to prevent their metabolic programming, which ultimately drives lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. This effect was diminished when KO offspring was kept on a HFD after birth (HFDMHFD KO), as they showed a similar development of FLD as HFDMHFD WT with high lipid accumulation (Fig. 3b,c) and significant increase of triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerol and cholesterol esters (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Hepatocyte transcriptomes reflected these differences (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e).

To assess a possible transient activation of HIF1α by maternal obesity specifically during gestation that may have long-lasting effects, we performed RNA-seq of KCs isolated from C57BL/6Jrcc mice at P0 born to CD-fed or HFD-fed mothers. Comparing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from CD and HFD conditions resulted in 54 regulated genes (Extended Data Fig. 7a). To investigate gene regulation patterns, we inferred transcription factor activity on the basis of all DEGs and a collection of transcriptional regulatory interactions38, indicating that DEGs were downstream of HIF1α, among other transcription factors (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Indeed, a total of five HIF1α target genes (Hif3a, S100a8, S100a9, Tgfb3 and Vegfa) were among the 29 upregulated DEGs (Extended Data Fig. 7c), and HALLMARK analysis of these 29 upregulated DEGs revealed that they fall into the term ‘hypoxia' (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Of note, only Hif3a expression was regulated, whereas genes encoding other HIF proteins were not transcriptionally regulated (Extended Data Fig. 7e). To validate that HIF1α is transiently active in KCs, we evaluated HIF1α protein expression in KCs of P0 neonate mice born to either HFD or CD mothers (Extended Data Fig. 7f). Quantification of immunofluorescence staining in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm showed an increase of HIF1α translocation to the nucleus in maternal obese neonate mice when compared with maternal lean neonate mice (Extended Data Fig. 7g). These data indicate that KCs react to maternal obesity by increased HIF1α translocation to the nucleus, leading to the upregulation of HIF1α target genes at birth.

Together, our results show that the development of KCs from the offspring is perturbed by maternal obesity in a HIF1α-dependent manner, and that ablation of HIF1α function in fetal KCs rescues the development of FLD during adulthood caused by maternal obesity.

As FLD induced by maternal obesity was only rescued by Hif1a deletion if the offspring was kept on a CD, we asked whether additional factors, such as inflammation, may add to the hepatic lipid accumulation at postnatal stages when the offspring is fed with a HFD. To address whether hepatocytes may attract immune cells and cause a slowly increasing local inflammation in the liver when experiencing a HFD throughout life, we used the hepatocyte transcriptome data and investigated expression of chemoattractant factors. Indeed, we found Agt (encoding angiotensin), C3 (encoding complement C3), Lect2 (encoding leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2) and Cxcl12 (encoding C-X-C motif chemokine 12) to be particularly upregulated in hepatocytes isolated from HFDMHFD WT and/or HFDMHFD KO groups, which are involved in attracting monocytes and neutrophils39,40,41 (Extended Data Fig. 8a). In line with these findings, flow cytometry analyses showed an, albeit not always significant, increase in the number of recruited myeloid cells (monocytes, neutrophils, cDC1 and cDC2; Extended Data Fig. 8b). Of note, deletion of Hif1a did not decrease myeloid cell numbers compared with WT littermates in any of the dietary conditions (Extended Data Fig. 8b), suggesting that the recruitment and/or proliferation of all myeloid cells is independent of HIF1α function at this early stage of FLD.

To investigate how HIF1α-dependent developmental programming in KCs causes FLD, we analysed the transcriptomes of WT and KO KCs from maternal lean and maternal obese conditions. PCA showed that maternal obesity, not the end diet, was the main driver of the KC transcriptional program (Fig. 3e), similar to the C57BL/6Jrcc model (Fig. 1e). Only KCs from HFDMCD KO mice clustered with maternal lean conditions (Fig. 3e), demonstrating that developmental programming events caused by maternal obesity are HIF1α dependent. Focusing specifically on HIF1α-dependent gene regulation, comparing HFDMCD WT versus HFDMCD KO KCs, yielded 409 DEGs (adjusted P value of 0.1; Supplementary Table 4). GO term analysis of DEGs downregulated in HFDMCD KO KCs revealed terms such as ‘fatty acid metabolic process', ‘cellular response to xenobiotic metabolism' and ‘blood coagulation, fibrin clot formation' (Extended Data Fig. 8c and Supplementary Table 5). As ex vivo culture data indicated that KCs cause lipid accumulation via paracrine factors (Fig. 2d,e), we searched for secreted ligands with corresponding hepatocyte receptors. Among 25 differentially expressed ligands, the majority were upregulated in HFDMCD WT compared with HFDMCD KO KCs (Fig. 3f). Among them, we detected apolipoproteins (Apob and Apoa1) and many coagulation factors, such as Fga, Fgb, Fgg, F2, F8 and F9, which encode fibrinogen, thrombin and coagulation factors VIII and IX, respectively.

To validate HIF1α-dependent upregulation of KC-derived ligands at the protein level, we performed proteomics on isolated KCs from CDMCD WT, CDMCD KO, HFDMCD WT and HFDMCD KO offspring. First, we compared HFDMCD WT with CDMCD WT to identify proteins induced by maternal obesity (WT list). Next, we compared HFDMCD WT with HFDMCD KO to identify HIF1α-dependent proteins in the context of maternal obesity (HFDMCD list). These analyses identified 66 and 59 differentially expressed proteins, respectively, as well as 147 proteins that were both HIF1α dependent and induced by maternal obesity (Cross list; Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 8d). GO, HALLMARK and KEGG analyses of these proteins revealed pathways such as ‘triglyceride catabolic process', ‘complement and coagulation cascades', ‘insulin-like growth factor receptor signalling pathway' and ‘ECM receptor interaction' among the Cross proteins. In addition, lipid transport pathways were enriched in the WT and HFDMCD lists, whereas immune-related terms were specifically enriched in the HFDMCD list (Extended Data Fig. 8e and Supplementary Table 6). A heatmap visualizing Cross proteins (Fig. 3h) showed that HIF1α deficiency in KCs prevented the upregulation of many proteins, including apolipoproteins and coagulation factors, in response to maternal obesity. Together, these transcriptional and proteomic analyses identified several HIF1α-dependent candidates induced by maternal obesity, potentially acting as KC-derived paracrine signals driving lipid accumulation in hepatocytes.

To determine whether maternal obesity-induced changes persist into adulthood and to avoid potential contamination from sorted KCs42, we performed single-nucleus RNA (snRNA)-seq–assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) on nuclei isolated from 12-week-old C57BL/6Jrcc HFDMCDLCD and CDMCDLCD offspring. This allowed for the epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis of individual cells. Integration of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data resulted in various hepatic cell types, including KCs and hepatocytes (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Subclustering the KCs revealed five distinct KC states (Fig. 4a,b), with clusters 0, 1 and 4 expressing high levels of Adgre1, Timd4 and Clec4f. Clusters 2 and 3, which increased relatively to the total KC numbers in the HFDMCDLCD condition, exhibited high levels of the MHC class II-related genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and Cd74) in cluster 2 and immune-regulation and metabolic-response genes (Pparg, Lilr4b and Lgals3) in cluster 3 (Fig. 4b). Increased MHC class II expression was validated in the HFDMCDLCD liver parenchyma, whereas CDMCDLCD mice showed restricted MHC class II expression around the periportal and central veins of the liver (Extended Data Fig. 9c).

Comparisons of ATAC-seq peak-related genes between HFDMCDLCD and CDMCDLCD KCs identified 28 downregulated and 60 upregulated gene loci (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Despite the relatively low numbers, GO term analyses of downregulated genes indicated enrichment of lipid metabolic processes (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Of note, ATAC-seq peaks were differentially present within the Pck1 locus, a gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, which is an enzyme that typically has an antagonistic role to glycolysis. Plotting the gene expression validated the loss of Pck1 expression across all HFDMCDLCD KC states (Extended Data Fig. 9f), aligning with the metabolic switch described earlier (Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). Furthermore, we observed epigenetic changes within the Gpnmb locus where ATAC-seq peaks increased significantly. Of note, Gpnmb has been previously described as a biomarker for steatohepatitis43. Consistent with bulk RNA-seq results, this epigenetic change was accompanied by upregulation of Gpnmb gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 9d,f). However, this upregulation was restricted only to clusters 2 and 3, which expand proportionally under maternal obesity conditions. To investigate whether these distinct KC states are differentially regulated at the transcriptional level, we performed DEG analysis comparing the clusters (Supplementary Table 7), combined with DecoupleR transcription factor activity analysis. This revealed that KC states clustered by dietary condition rather than identity, indicating that persistent changes in transcription factor activity were driving the observed DEGs in HFDMCDLCD KCs (Fig. 4c). Transcription factor activity analysis identified HIF1α to be mainly active in clusters 1, 2 and 3 in the HFDMCDLCD condition. Transcription factors, such as Jun, Ets1 and Esr2, were more active in most HFDMCDLCD clusters, with PPARα and PPARγ showing increased activity across all HFDMCDLCD clusters (Fig. 4c). These findings suggest that, in addition to HIF1α, other persistent transcriptional changes stem from altered transcription factor activity in offspring born to obese mothers.

Next, we leveraged the snRNA-seq data to assess signalling pathways that are activated in HFDMCDLCD KCs using CellChat analysis. In line with the bulk RNA-seq data, KCs demonstrated increased intercellular communication via APOE and APOA1 signalling pathways under maternal obesity conditions (Extended Data Fig. 9g). Gene expression analyses confirmed upregulation of Apoe and Apoa1 in all HFDMCDLCD states (Fig. 4d), consistent with increased transcription factor activity of PPARα and PPARγ, which are known regulators of apolipoproteins44. In addition, ATAC-seq analysis revealed an increase in peaks at putative regulatory elements located upstream of the Apoe promoter in HFDMCDLCD cluster 3 compared with CDMCDLCD, which harbour PPARα and PPARγ–RXRα transcription factor-binding sides (Fig. 4e).

Together, our data show that maternal obesity induces persistent changes in KCs. Of note, we identified new KC states (clusters 2 and 3) that probably account for the immune-related signature observed in the bulk RNA-seq data. These clusters expand in response to maternal obesity and specifically upregulate inflammatory genes. Furthermore, the snRNA–ATAC-seq approach corroborates our findings from bulk RNA-seq and proteomics approaches, highlighting the significant upregulation of apolipoproteins in KCs.

To investigate whether apolipoproteins contribute to lipid accumulation in the liver, we utilized the hepatocyte live-imaging cell culture approach, adding APOE or APOA1 to the medium. As a positive control, we used tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which has been previously identified as a KC-derived driver of lipid storage in hepatocytes45. In all conditions, the LD540 signal intensity increased, with APOE inducing the highest lipid accumulation compared with control hepatocytes (Fig. 4f).

In summary, our findings provide evidence that HIF1α-dependent developmental programming by maternal obesity leads to the upregulation of apolipoproteins in adult KCs, which can induce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, thereby contributing to the onset of FLD.

This work supports the hypothesis that yolk sac-derived tissue-resident macrophages are cellular components within the concept of DOHaDs, as developmental perturbations of hepatic macrophages result in postnatal liver pathophysiology. This is in line with previous studies showing that microglia can contribute to neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders8,9,46,47,48. Our data indicate that continuous exposure to a maternal HFD during gestation induces a HIF1α-dependent metabolic switch in KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, detrimentally affecting adult hepatic lipid metabolism. Unlike most maternal immune activation studies, in which cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17a influence offspring development49,50, our model does not indicate a maternal immune activation phenotype or systemic inflammation. Instead, maternal metabolites and lipids probably cross the placenta and modulate macrophage function. For instance, stearic acid, enriched in obese mice, has been proposed to reprogram macrophages via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)9,51. An intriguing question for future research is to administer defined fatty acids to pregnant dams and trace their effect on fetal KC development in a HIF1α-dependent manner.

Using the LysMCre mouse model to delete Hif1a specifically in myeloid cells excludes developmental programming of oocytes, hepatocytes and their progenitors as primary driver of FLD, as the promotor controlling expression of the Cre recombinase only becomes active during early fetal macrophage differentiation1,52. However, indirect effects via inter-organ communication, such as adipose-derived signals, cannot be ruled out. Our double fate mapper model showed that KCs remain of yolk sac origin upon maternal obesity, contrasting with diet-induced FLD models in which bone marrow-derived cells replace KCs16,17,18. Thus, in accordance with DOHaDs, KCs can serve as intergenerational messengers that sense maternal-derived factors during gestation and convey this information into a long-lasting transcriptional program during adulthood. Our transcriptomic, epigenetic and metabolic analyses demonstrate that maternal obesity functionally programs KCs, promoting lipid accumulation in neighbouring hepatocytes via persistent transcriptional changes. KC depletion experiments further confirmed this: replenishment with monocyte-derived cells from animals that never experienced a HFD rescues the developmental programming effects, providing a potential cellular target for treating FLD caused by maternal obesity. Replenishment with monocytes from maternal obesity-experienced animals did not rescue the phenotype, suggesting that neonatal monocytes or HSPCs undergo developmental programming33,34. These findings highlight the resilience of the KC niche to maternal obesity-induced programming, as the origin of KC-like cells determines FLD pathogenesis.

A previous study has shown that upon a postnatal HFD, KCs secrete pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF, with TNF inducing lipid accumulation in hepatocytes45. By contrast, in maternal obesity-induced FLD, we observed no upregulation of these particular factors. Instead, genes associated with lipid metabolism (for example, Trem2, Tyrobp, Syk and Lpr1) were upregulated, partially resembling the phenotype of hepatic lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs)17. Recent work has also shown that TREM2+ LAMs expand during injury and can originate from both resident KCs and monocyte-derived macrophages53. In our model, however, LAM-like KCs remain of yolk sac origin, suggesting that functional adaptation to lipid-rich environments, rather than a change in cellular origin, drives their phenotype. This distinction highlights the unique nature of maternal obesity-induced FLD compared with postnatal HFD models. Notably, maternal obesity upregulates apolipoproteins such as APOE and APOA1 in a HIF1α-dependent manner, aligning with previous findings linking apolipoproteins with FLD54,55.

In summary, our study establishes KCs as active players in liver metabolism, demonstrating distinct responses to a maternal-derived versus postnatal diet-derived HFD. We showed that a maternal HFD during gestation programs KCs metabolically and transcriptionally in a HIF1α-dependent manner, leading to persistent changes that promote FLD. These findings offer a therapeutic time window to manipulate the metabolic status of KCs, and thereby prevent the development of FLD in the offspring.

All investigations concerning mouse work had local approval and all procedures conformed to the guidelines from Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on protecting animals used for scientific purposes. In detail, all animal experiments were conducted according to the German law of animal protection and in agreement with the approval of the local institutional animal care committee (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz (LANUV), North Rhine-Westphalia, Az 81-02.04.2019.A146 and Az 2024-A314). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with 12-h light–dark cycle, at 21 °C, 55% relative humidity, and with food and water provided ad libitum. Animals were euthanized using liver or heart perfusion after anaesthesia injection. C57BL/6JRcc was used as the WT strain. To generate the double fate mapper Tnfrsf11aCre (ref. 56); Rosa26LSL-YFP (JAX stock #006148)57; Ms4a3FlpO;Rosa26FSF-tdT (JAX stock #032864)58, we bred Tnfrsf11aCre/+;Rosa26FSF-tdT/FSF-tdT animals with Ms4a3FlpO;Rosa26LSL-YFP/LSL-YFP animals (see Extended Data Fig. 4a for description of the Ms4a3FlpO locus). KC-DTR (Clec4fDTR/+) mice have been previously described32. All mice were originally of the C57BL/6J background and crossed to C57BL/6Jrcc for 2–5 generations. To generate Hif1aflox/flox;LysMCre/+, the Hif1aflox/flox (JAX stock #007561)59 and LysMCre/+ (JAX stock #004781)37 were used (both kept on the C57BL/6J background after import). All lines were back-crossed to their respective WT line (C57BL/6J for LysMCre/+;Hif1aflox/flox and C57BL/6Jrcc for all other lines) once per year. Mice were genotyped according to protocols provided by JAX or donating researchers. For all experiments, male mice were analysed with the exception of the double fate mapper, where both male and female mice were used, and ex vivo-isolated hepatocytes, where only young female mice were used to assure a lean and metabolically healthy state.

For WT cohorts, 3–4-week-old C57BL/6JRcc female mice were put on a CD (sniff, E15748-047) for 2 weeks. Subsequently, female mice were separated into two groups and received either a HFD (sniff, E15742-347) or a CD for 8 weeks. For metabolic assessment, the HOMA-IR was used60. Glucose was measured using GlucoCheck GOLD with stripes (11864873 and 11864933), and insulin was measured via ELISA (EMINS, Thermo Fisher). Only mice with significantly higher HOMA-IR were used to generate offspring. Females were mated with males fed with a CD overnight. The day of vaginal plug formation was estimated as embryonic developmental day 0.5 (E0.5) post-coitum. Females were always placed back in their cages with a HFD after overnight mating. All offspring were cross-fostered to females on the respective diet. The litter size was standardized to a maximum of six pups per foster mother on the day of birth. In addition, whenever possible, litters from different biological mothers were cross-fostered to the same foster mother to ensure consistency and minimize maternal variability. Cross-fostering took place also between mothers on the same diet to exclude stress-mediated effects of cross-fostering. After 3 weeks of lactation at postnatal day 21 (P21), offspring were weaned into their post-weaning cage (CD or HFD). Here offspring from maternal lean and maternal obese groups were mixed to minimize effects caused by cage-specific microbiome differences. In addition, during the post-weaning diet, bedding stemming from cages with the same diet was mixed weekly between cages (typically 10–20 cages at any time) to further reduce cage-specific effects related to the microbiome.

Mice were euthanized and used in the experiment at weeks 11–13, unless otherwise stated.

Maternal obese KC-DTR male offspring were injected at P0 with 50 ng diphtheria toxin and injected at P1 through the temporal vein under ice-induced anaesthesia with 106 bone marrow monocytes and HSPCs isolated from Rosa26mTmG mice. Bone marrow monocytes and HSPCs were isolated as following: Rosa26mTmG mice were killed through cervical dislocation, and their tibias and femurs from the hindlimbs were freed. Bone marrow was flushed out with DMEM (Pan Biotech) and filtered through a 70-μm strainer on ice. Cells were then blocked with FACS buffer (0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS) containing 2% rat serum and stained with biotinylated antibodies (anti-Ly6G, CD19, CD3, Ter119, Nkp45 and F4/80) for 30 min at 4 °C. Monocytes and HSPCs were then negatively selected using MojoSort Streptavidin Nanobeads (BioLegend) following the manufacturer's manual.

Adult mice were anaesthetized and perfused with ice-cold PBS. P0 mice were killed by decapitation. For flow cytometry analysis of hepatic myeloid cells, 200–300 mg of adult or half of a P0 liver was collected, cut into small pieces and incubated in a digestion mix (PBS containing 1 mg ml−1 collagenase D (11088858001, Roche), 100 U ml−1 DNase I (DN25, Sigma-Aldrich), 2.4 mg ml−1 of dispase (17105041, Gibco) and 3% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C before mechanical disruption through a 100-μm filter. The cell suspension was diluted in 3 ml of FACS buffer (0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS) and centrifuged at 50g for 3 min to remove hepatocytes. Then, the supernatant containing myeloid cells was collected and centrifuged at 370g for 7 min at 4 °C. For bone marrow, one leg was isolated, and both the tibia and the femur were cleaned from surrounding tissues and cut at the ends. The bones were flushed with 5 ml of ice-cold FACS buffer. Cells were centrifuged at 370g for 7 min at 4 °C. Pellet was resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (155 mM NH4Cl, 12 mM NaHCO3 and 0.1 mM EDTA) and incubated for 3 min on ice. Then, 5 ml FACS buffer was added, cells were resuspended and centrifuged at 370g for 7 min at 4 °C. Cell pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer containing purified anti-CD16/32 and 2% rat serum (liver) or 2% rat serum only (bone marrow) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were immune-stained with antibody mixes for 30 min at 4 °C. The complete list of antibodies used can be found in Supplementary Table 8. Data were acquired with FACSymphony A5 (BD Biosciences) or LSRII and analysed in FlowJo Software. For sorting of KCs and hepatocytes, liver cell suspension was prepared as described above with the following modifications: first, 1 ml twice-concentrated digestion mix was used for tissue digestion; second, digestion was performed at room temperature and centrifugation at 50g for 3 min was omitted to retain hepatocytes; and last, all steps were performed with buffers containing 1 mM of flavopiridol (F3055, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were stained by antibody mixes and sorted using FACS ARIA III cell sorter (BD Biosciences) directly into 500 μl lysis buffer (79306, Qiagen). For KC metabolic flow cytometry assays, single-cell suspensions were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (1%) and rat serum (2%) in FACS buffer, followed by surface marker staining for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and then permeabilized for 15 min with PBS supplemented with 0.4% Triton X-100 (X100, Sigma-Aldrich). Intracellular staining was performed for 1 h at 4 °C. Intracellular antibodies were conjugated in-house using lightning-link conjugation kits (Abcam) as previously described26. Cells were analysed on an ID7000 7-laser Spectral Cell Analyzer (Sony Cooperation).

For neutral lipid staining, cryo-preserved liver blocks were cut at 10 µm thickness and dried for 1 h at room temperature. Lipid staining was performed using an Oil-red-O Stain Kit (O0625, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were then stained with haematoxylin for 5–10 min to visualize nuclei, rinsed with distilled water and mounted with Kaiser's glycerol gelatine (pre-heated at 55 °C; 6474.1, Carl Roth). Images were taken with an Axio Lab.A1 microscope (Zeiss). For ORO staining quantification, 2–10 images of each sample with a ×40 objective were taken and quantification was performed using QuPath software (v0.5.1). For haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, paraffin-embedded liver blocks were cut at 5 µm thickness and heated for 1 h at 65 °C before staining. Sections were deparaffinized by two steps of xylol and descending series of alcohol and rinsed in distilled water. Next, sections were stained with haematoxylin solution for 1.5 min and neutralized by running tap water, followed by alcoholic eosin staining for 2 min. Sections were then dehydrated by an ascending series of alcohol and two steps of xylol and mounted with Entellan (1.07961.0100, Millipore). Images were taken with the Axio Lab.A1 microscope. Quantification of droplet adiposity in liver cells in H&E-stained histological sections was performed manually using a light microscope without the support of digital imaging or software tools. From each section, 10 random high-power fields were selected at ×10 magnification to ensure a representative selection of liver parenchyma while avoiding areas of artefacts or tissue damage. Hepatocytes were analysed for the presence of lipid droplets. All hepatocytes in each selected field were counted and classified as either normal (without lipid droplets) or lipid laden (with lipid droplets recognizable as intracellular vacuoles). The percentage of lipid-laden hepatocytes was calculated for each field by dividing the number of hepatocytes with lipid droplets by the total number of hepatocytes in the field and multiplying the result by 100. The percentages of all analysed fields were averaged to obtain a representative value for each sample. For immunofluorescence staining, cryo-preserved liver blocks were cut at 10 µm thickness, dried for 1 h at room temperature and permeabilized with PBS-T (0.4% Triton X-100; X100, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, tissue was blocked with PBS-T containing 2% BSA (37525, Thermo Scientific) and 2% donkey serum (D9663, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by primary antibody staining overnight at 4 °C, and secondary antibodies hosted in donkey for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (42281, BioLegend). Immunofluorescence images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM Airyscan 880 microscope (Zeiss) and processed with Fiji61.

Livers were isolated from ice-cold PBS-perfused mice and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ten milligrams were homogenized in ddH2O using a Precellys homogenizer (Peqlab Biotechnology). For lipid extraction, 50 µl of the homogenate was added to 500 µl extraction mix (CHCl3:MeOH 1:5 containing the following internal standards: 210 pmol phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)(31:1), 396 pmol phosphatidylcholine (PC)(31:1), 98 pmol phosphatidylserine(31:1), 84 pmol phosphatidylinositol(34:0), 56 pmol phosphatidic acid(31:1), 51 pmol phosphatidylglycerol(28:0), 28 pmol cardiolipin(56:0), 39 pmol lysophosphatidic acid(17:0), 35 pmol lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)(17:1), 38 pmol lysophosphatidylethanolamine(17:0), 32 pmol ceramide(17:0)), 99 pmol sphingomyelin(17:0), 55 pmol glucosylceramide(12:0), 14 pmol monosialodihexosylganglioside(18:0-D3), 339 pmol triacylglycerol(50:1-d4), 111 pmol cholesteryl ester(17:1), 64 pmol diacylglycerol(31:1), 103 pmol monoacylglycerol(17:1), 724 pmol cholesterol(D6) and 45 pmol carnitine(15:0)) and subsequently sonicated for 2 min and centrifugated at 20,000g for 2 min. The supernatant was collected into a new tube, and 200 µl chloroform and 800 µl 1% AcOH water were added. The sample was shaken and centrifuged for 2 min at 20,000g. The upper aqueous phase was discarded and the lower phase was transferred into a new tube and evaporated in a speed vacuum concentrator (45 °C at 10 min). Spray buffer (500 µl of 8:5:1 2-propanol:MeOH:H2O and 10 mM ammonium acetate) was added to the sample and sonicated for 5 min, infused at 10 µl min−1 into a Thermo Q Exactive Plus spectrometer equipped with the heated electrospray ionization II ion source for direct infusion lipidomics. MS1 spectra (resolution of 280,000) were recorded in 100-m/z windows from 250 to 1,200 m/z (positive) and 200 to 1,700 m/z (negative) followed by recording tandem mass spectrometry spectra (resolution of 70,000) by data-independent acquisition in 1-m/z windows from 200 to 1,200 (positive) and 200 to 1,700 (negative) m/z. Raw files were converted to .mzml files and imported into and analysed by LipidXplorer software (v1.2.8.1)62 using custom mfql files to identify sample lipids and internal standards.

Raw measurements of the lipidome were quantified in relation to internal standards measured simultaneously on the same instrument. The resulting values were normalized by the amount of tissue to obtain measurements in pmol mg−1. All lipid species that remained constant across all samples were removed from the dataset. In addition, species belonging to the triacylglycerol class with odd numbers of double bonds were excluded, as they were unlikely to originate from mice. This resulted in a set of 19 lipid classes: cholesteryl ester, ceramide, diacylglycerol, dihexosylceramide, hexosylceramide, LPC, ether-linked LPC, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, monoacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, PC, ether-linked PC, PE, ether-linked PE, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, sphingomyelin, unsaturated fatty acyl tails of triacylglycerol (unsat) and saturated fatty acyl tails of triacylglycerol (sat). Following the selection process, the dataset consisted of 476 metabolites for C57BL/6Jrcc mice (69 dropped) and 443 metabolites for the HIF1α model (31 dropped). Within each sample, the species belonging to the same class were aggregated by calculating the mean. The results were then summarized by computing the mean per condition. Log2 fold changes were calculated by comparing each condition to the control condition CDMCDLCD. For each lipid class, the conditions were assessed for significant deviations from the control condition using the lm function in R. Subsequently, a hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on the resulting dataset, both row wise and column wise, based on the Euclidean distance with complete linkage. The colour legend for the HIF1α mouse model is not evenly spaced around zero. This deviation arose from significant changes with low-effect sizes. To still indicate the direction of change, the space around zero was adjusted accordingly. The colour histogram shown represents the entire set of lipid species, not just the selected species shown in the main figure. The value of 1 was added to the data before performing the logarithmic transformation (log2) and performing PCA.

The Immune Monitoring 48-Plex Mouse ProcartaPlex Panel (EPX480-20834-901, Invitrogen) was used. Of sera, 25 µl was thawed and analytes were evaluated using Luminex xMAP system. All reagents were prepared and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytokines that were below the detection threshold in more than 80% of the samples were not plotted.

The values displayed within the heatmap are log10 + 1 transformed and ordered by decreasing overall mean.

cDNA library for sequencing was prepared as described in the SMART-Seq2 protocol63. The mRNA was extracted and primed utilizing poly-T oligonucleotides and converted into cDNA by SMART reverse transcription. Pre-amplification was performed by SMART ISPCR, followed by fragmentation using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina), amplification and indexing. Library fragments were then selected by size (300–400 bp) and purified using SPRIBeads (Beckman-Coulter). The Agilent high-sensitivity D5000 assay was used to measure the size distribution of cDNA libraries on a Tapestation 4200 system (Agilent). Quantifying cDNA libraries was performed using a Qubit high-sensitivity dsDNA assay (Thermo Fisher). Sequencing was performed using a 75-bp single-end setup on the NextSeq500 system (Illumina), applying NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit (v2.5; Illumina). Library fragments were then selected by size (300–400 bp) and purified using SPRIBeads (Beckman-Coulter). The Agilent high-sensitivity D5000 assay was used to measure the size distribution of cDNA libraries on a Tapestation 4200 system (Agilent). The cDNA libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity dsDNA assay (Qubit). To quantify the abundances of transcripts from the bulk RNA-seq data, Kallisto pseudo alignment was applied64.

The raw transcriptome files were prepared for Kallisto import to DESeq2 using the genecode annotation M16 (https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/release_M16.html) to correct for library size based on the provided average transcript length. Outliers (eight from the C57BL/6Jrcc dataset and three from the Hif1a dataset) were identified on the basis quality assessment and filtering of low-quality samples. The set of genes was further refined to include only protein-coding genes that were non-constant across all present samples. Low-expressed genes, defined as those with less than 10 counts in 25% of the samples, were also removed. PCA was performed on the variance-stabilized counts. DESeq2 (ref. 65) analysis was conducted to identify DEGs within each cell type. The default settings in DESeq2 were used. A gene was called differentially expressed if its corresponding Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value was less than 0.1 for the tested contrast. For the KC P0 DEGs subjected to transcription factor inference analysis, the absolute LFC threshold was set to 2. The DEGs were separated into two sets based on the sign of the LFC. Each set of DEGs was subjected to an over-representation analysis to identify enriched GO terms, HALLMARK pathways and KEGG pathways using the respective functions in clusterProfiler66. To reduce observed redundancy in the GO terms, the ‘simplify' function in clusterProfiler was used, which calculates the similarity among enriched terms based on their information content and selects a representative term with the lowest adjusted P value67. The universe for the over-representation analysis consisted of all genes used for the differential expression analysis. For the ligand–receptor analysis, DEGs with an absolute LFC greater than 2 in the KC set were subsetted to include ligands recorded in the CellTalk database68. For the hepatocyte dataset, all expressed genes (more than 10 counts in Hif1a-WT or Hif1a-KO HFDMCD conditions; not necessarily differentially expressed) were subsetted to include recorded receptors within the same database. Interactions between differentially expressed ligands from KCs and expressed receptors from hepatocytes were extracted from the CellTalk database and plotted. The order of ligands was based on their LFC from lowest to highest. A co-expression network analysis using hCoCena25 was conducted on the filtered and DESeq2 normalized counts, following the provided showcase Notebook25. hCoCena calculates pairwise correlations among the top most varying genes (the number needs to be user-specified) and constructs a network where vertices represent genes with at least one edge characterized by a correlation above a specified threshold. Here hCoCena was performed using the top 5,000 genes as input and all edges were kept with a correlation above 0.7. The resulting network, with 4,214 nodes and 286,853 edges, was then clustered using the Leiden algorithm69. Clustering was performed with 100 iterations. Each node that was advised to more than three clusters during the process was disregarded in the proceeding cluster analysis. The identified gene sets were summarized using Group Fold Change25 for each condition and displayed on a heatmap. Each cluster set was subjected to an over-representation analysis, with the hCoCena-input genes specified as the universe for testing. Manually selected terms from GO, KEGG and HALLMARK sets are displayed for each cluster to avoid term cluttering. For selected enriched terms, their intersection with the cluster genes was recovered, namely, ‘oxidative phosphorylation' with turquoise and lightgreen, ‘glycolysis' and ‘cell activation involved in immune response' with steelblue. The resulting set of genes was further manually reduced. The mean expression values for those intersectional genes were displayed and scaled across each condition. The columns were hierarchically clustered on the basis of the Euclidean distance with complete linkage. Transcription factor inference analysis was conducted using the CollecTRI38 framework, which integrates information from multiple sources, including RegNetwork70, ChEA3 (ref. 71), Pathway Commons72 and DoRothEA73. Within this analysis, a linear model was used to estimate the transcription factor activity. The model predicts the value of the DEGs solely based on the interaction weights between transcription factors and their respective target genes derived from CollecTRI. The final score was the t-value of the slope of the fitted model. A positive value indicates an active transcription factor. This analysis was conducted using decoupler's74 functionality.

Nuclei were isolated from approximately 50 mg of snap-frozen adult liver tissue to enable simultaneous snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, capturing both transcriptional profiles and chromatin accessibility. Nuclei were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Kit (1000283, 10X Genomics). In detail, snap-frozen liver tissue was first cut on dry-ice into small pieces and homogenized with a pestle in homogenization buffer containing 320 mM sucrose, 5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM Mg-acetate, 10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 0.2 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs), 1 mM flavopiridol and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (ITW Reagents) in nuclease-free water. Homogenate was then passed through a 70-μM cell strainer and mixed with equal volume of gradient medium containing 50% OptiPrep (StemCell Technologies), 5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM Mg-acetate, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (ITW Reagents) in nuclease-free water. Diluted homogenate was slowly laid atop a cushion (75% of the volume of diluted homogenate) containing 29% OptiPrep, 77.5 mM KCl, 15.5 mM MgCl2, 31 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 129.2 mM sucrose in UltraPure H2O and centrifuged with low acceleration and maximum deceleration at 10,000g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in 1X PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.2 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs) and 1 mM flavopiridol, stained with 7-AAD and purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using FACS ARIA III (BD Biosciences) for high-quality, monoploid and 7-AAD nuclei. For nuclei permeabilization, approximately 500,000 sorted nuclei were incubated for 2 min in a 0.1× lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.01% digitonin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% BSA and 1 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor, with 1 μM flavopiridol in nuclease-free water). Following permeabilization and washing steps, nuclei concentration was adjusted to 5,000 nuclei per microlitre in ice-cold 1× nuclei buffer (2000153/2000207, 10X Genomics) and were incubated in a transposition mix containing a transposase, allowing adapter sequences to be added to the ends of DNA fragments. Furthermore, 16,000 nuclei were used for analysis with the Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Kit (PN-1000230, 10X Genomics) and Gel Beads in Emulsion (GEMs) using the Chromium Next GEM Chip J Single Cell Kit. After GEM reverse transcription (GEM-RT) cleanup, pre-amplification of the sample was performed, producing material for both ATAC library construction and cDNA amplification for gene expression library construction. During the reverse transcription reaction, cDNA tagging was achieved with 16-nucleotide barcodes and 10-nucleotide molecular identifiers. The pre-amplified product was split into two aliquots: 40 μl for ATAC library construction and 35 μl for further cDNA amplification. For snRNA-seq library preparation, 25% of the total cDNA was used to generate gene expression (GEX) libraries. Libraries were prepared and sequenced according to the manufacturer's protocols: snATAC libraries used the 10X Genomics Single Index N Set, and snRNA-seq libraries used the Dual Index TT Set A. Pooled and barcoded libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 system with P3 flow cells, achieving an average depth of 30,000 reads per nucleus for both snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq libraries. The sequencing quality was assessed using FastQC (v0.12.1) executed within a containerized environment provided by biocontainers using Podman. All files passed initial quality assessment. Following assessment, Cell Ranger ARC (v2.0.0; 10X Genomics) was used for simultaneous alignment and quantification of both modalities. The cellranger-arc count pipeline was run according to the manufacturer's instructions using the 10X Genomics-provided reference dataset refdata-cellranger-arc-mm10-2020-A-2.0.0, which is based on the mm10 genome assembly and including introns. The automatically obtained quality assessment alerted for both conditions that the amount of valid ATAC barcodes was at 54% (ideally more than 80%). Despite the low proportion, both datasets were used because other critical ATAC quality metrics, such as fragment count and enrichment scores, met acceptable thresholds. Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data were processed using mainly the Seurat and Signac packages in R. Both modalities were extracted from the 10X Genomics ‘filtered feature matrix file', in which count data were used for additional filtering of low-quality cells, before using MACS3 to perform the peak calling within the remaining cells to reduce computational time. Applied thresholds were: cells with RNA counts below 500, number of genes less than 200 or more than 2,500, and mitochondrial RNA content above 1% (as for single-nucleus sequencing, we expected none). Resulting peaks were also used for filtering of low-quality cells. Applied thresholds were: ATAC counts below 1,000, nucleosome signal more than 2 and transcription start site enrichment less than 1. In addition, peaks were removed that overlapped with non-standard chromosomes: genomic blacklist regions. The preprocessing led to 8,197 total cells for CDMCDLCD and 5,017 cells for HFDMCDLCD. Each RNA-seq dataset was pre-processed within each condition before integration using SCTransform, regressing out the percentage of mitochondrial DNA. The integration of RNA and ATAC data across conditions followed the outline from Kim et al.75. Accordingly, RNA data integration began with the selection of 3,000 integration features using SelectIntegrationFeatures in Seurat. The datasets were prepared for integration with PrepSCTIntegration, and integration anchors were identified using FindIntegrationAnchors with SCTransform (SCT) normalization. The anchors were then used to integrate the datasets across conditions via IntegrateData. ATAC count integration started by creating a feature matrix for each condition based on a unified peak set that was shared across conditions. Dimensionality reduction for ATAC data relied on latent semantic indexing, which included feature selection of most variable peaks, transformation of peak counts and singular value decomposition. To improve the integration, Harmony was applied (RunHarmony). Harmony aligns datasets by projecting them into a shared low-dimensional space while minimizing the effects of batch-specific biases. For the final integration across modalities, multimodal neighbours were identified by combining RNA-based PCA and ATAC-based Harmony embeddings (FindMultiModalNeighbors) across 50 dimensions for each modality, without the first dimension for Harmony, as commonly done, aiming for additional batch correction. Clusters were identified using the weighted nearest neighbour similarity graph (FindClusters) with a resolution of 0.5. This approach allowed the simultaneous integration of RNA and ATAC data for both conditions while leveraging the complementary information from both modalities. Cluster-specific marker genes were identified by calculating differential expression for each cluster using FindAllMarkers in Seurat. Markers were filtered based on minimum expression percentage (0.10), minimum differential expression percentage (0.20) and log fold-change threshold (0.20), retaining only positive markers. Cell-type annotation was based on the expression of a curated gene set within the identified markers. Subclustering was performed on the cells annotated as KCs from the integrated dataset. Again, multimodal neighbours were identified (FindMultiModalNeighbors) using PCA for RNA and Harmony for ATAC, followed by UMAP for dimensionality reduction (RunUMAP) and clustering (FindClusters), as done for the dataset using all cell types. Subclusters with fewer than 50 cells were excluded due to low numbers, and markers for each remaining cluster were characterized using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat with the number of neighbours set to 60. Subcluster characterization was based on the expression of a curated gene set within the identified markers. To analyse intercellular communication involving the differing KC subclusters to hepatocytes, a CellChat analysis was performed. The analysis followed CellChat instructions for comparisons and analysis of multiple datasets. Normalized RNA expression data were used to define communication networks between KC subclusters and other cell populations. Overexpressed genes and interactions were identified for each condition, identifying 1,366 (CDMCDLCD) and 1,458 (HFDMCDLCD) highly variable ligand–receptor pairs subsequently used for signalling inference. Communication probabilities were computed using the 10% truncated mean for calculating the gene expression per cell group. Interactions with fewer than ten participating cells were filtered out to ensure robustness. The KC-specific communication networks were compared across conditions using rankNet function. A paired Wilcoxon test was performed to determine whether there was a significant difference of the signalling information flow between two conditions. Potential activated transcription factors were investigated using the package decouplR. For the analysis, the transformed RNA-count data were subsetted to the union of DEGs between the KC subclusters. The resulting set was subjected to the unified linear model to identify potential regulators (transcription factors). Only regulators were tested, which had at least ten known targets among the union differentially expressed set. According to decouplR's vignette, the resulting score matrix, representing regulations strength, was scaled and centred. The 25% trimmed mean activity per cluster for each condition is displayed to provide a robust central tendency measure.

Metabolomics analysis was conducted using data obtained from Metabolon. The Metabolon platform performed preprocessing steps on the data, including imputation of missing values and natural log transformation. In summary, the raw peak area data were median scaled per metabolite and then normalized by the value of the extracted volume. It was further rescaled to have a median equal to 1. Missing values for each metabolite were imputed with the minimum value observed across all samples. Finally, a natural logarithm transformation was applied to the metabolomic data, as it typically exhibited a log-normal distribution. For the PCA, the data were subjected to batch correction based on the day of the experiment, which was identified as a significant source of variance in the initial PCA analysis. The identified effect was treated as a batch factor in the ComBat function of the sva package76 for batch correction. The corrected data were then used for PCA analysis. To identify metabolites with significant effects of diet, genotypes or their interaction on their respective levels, an ANOVA was performed. Specifically, a contrast77 was applied within the ANOVA to compare metabolite levels between maternal obese (HFDMCDLCD) and maternal lean (CDMCDLCD) conditions. The resulting set of 129 metabolites with significant raw P values was further analysed using Metaboanalyst (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/)78 for pathway over-representation analysis. The HMDB IDs provided by Metabolon were used as input, resulting in a reduction to 111 metabolites due to missing labels. Furthermore, mapping to Metaboanalyst failed for ten additional metabolites. Default parameters were used for all remaining settings, except for choosing Mus musculus (KEGG) as the pathway library and applying out-degree centrality as the topology analysis method.

Eight-to-ten-week-old chow diet-fed C57BL/6JRcc female mice were used to isolate hepatocytes. Therefore, a two-step collagenase liver perfusion was performed. First, 7 min after injecting heparin-sodium (Ratiopharm; 30 units per gram body weight), mice were anaesthetized with ketamine–xylazine. Next, a 26 G indwelling venous catheter (0.62 mm × 19 mm; 391379, BD Neoflon Pro) was inserted into the portal vein. Perfusion was initiated with 25 ml Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.5 mM EGTA (pH 7.4) at a rate of 2.5 ml min−1 using a peristaltic pump, and subsequently with 25 ml collagenase buffer (William's Medium E, P04-29510, Pan-Biotech) supplemented with 3.6 mM CaCl2, 0.1 U ml−1 collagenase NB46 (17465, Serva Electrophoresis) and 10 mM HEPES at 37 °C at a rate of 1.25 ml min−1. Liver cells were released by gentle swirling with forceps into 40 ml suspension medium (William's Medium E supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 units per millilitre penicillin and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin). Hepatocytes were pelleted at 50g for 3 min at room temperature. The pellet containing the hepatocytes was resuspended in fresh suspension medium and plated on collagen-coated 24-well plates for co-culture experiments with KCs at a density of 30,000 cells per well or on collagen-coated 96-well plates for factor screening experiments at a density of 5,000 cells per well. To ensure a viable hepatocyte culture, cells were pre-incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow for attachment. Thereafter, the medium was replaced with fresh suspension medium containing LD540 (0.02 µg ml−1) and vitamin C (1 µg ml−1) for live-cell imaging using the IncuCyte SX5 (Sartorius). To isolate KCs, 11–15-week-old mice were perfused with the same method as isolating hepatocytes but without the in vivo digestion step. After perfusion, liver was minced and digested in a digestion mix (PBS containing 1 mg ml−1 collagenase D, 100 U ml−1 DNase I, 2.4 mg ml−1 dispase and 3% FCS) for 30 min at 37 °C without agitation. Digested liver was further disrupted with gentle pipetting, filtered through a 100-µm cell strainer and centrifuged at 400g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellet was washed with ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA) and centrifuged at 50g for 3 min at 4 °C to remove hepatocytes. The supernatant was then further filtered and washed with FACS buffer to obtain a clean, single-cell suspension and centrifuged at 400g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was then blocked with 1% anti-mouse CD16/32 (101302, BioLegend) and 5% rat serum (C13SDZ, Bio-Rad) for 10 min at 4 °C followed by incubation with biotinylated CD11b antibody (101204, BioLegend) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed, incubated with pre-washed streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (480016, BioLegend), washed and enriched in a 12-well untreated cell-culture dish mounted atop a magnet. Enriched cells were abundantly washed in FACS buffer and subsequently counted using a Neubauer chamber. Cells (3 × 105) were plated onto a 13-mm diameter, untreated glass coverslip (VWR; co-culture experiments) or 2–4 × 106 cells onto an untreated glass slide (Fisher Scientific; proteomics experiments). Cells were attached for 2 h in macrophage medium (DMEM, containing 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 10% FBS and 1 mM sodium pyruvate) in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After attachment, cells were abundantly washed with PBS. Macrophages on coverslips were used for co-culture experiments as described below. Macrophages for proteomics experiments were scraped off in PBS, centrifuged at 400g at 4 °C for 5 min to obtain pellets, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and further processed for proteomics as described below.

For hepatocyte–KC co-culture experiments, a plastic ring (8 mm in height × 15 mm in diameter) was placed in each well of hepatocytes seeded as described above. A glass coverslip attached with approximately 3 × 104 KCs (resulted from initially seeded 3 × 105 CD11b magnet-enriched cells), isolated from either CDMCDLCD or HFDMCDLCD mice, was positioned upside-down on the plastic ring. LD540 was then added, and signal was recorded by live imaging hourly for 4 h in the IncuCyte SX5, with each mouse represented by multiple replicates and nine fields of view (FOVs) per well. For treatment of hepatocytes with APOE or APOA1, APOE (1 µg ml−1 recombinant mouse APOE; ab226314, Abcam) or APOA1 (2 µg ml−1 recombinant mouse APOA1; 50918-M08H, Sino Biological) was pre-incubated with hepatocyte medium at 37 °C for 30 min. The pre-incubated medium was then added to hepatocytes already containing 1 volume of hepatocyte medium. TNF (0.1 µg ml−1 recombinant mouse TNF; 130-101-688, Miltenyi)-treated hepatocytes were used as positive controls. Non-treated hepatocytes served as negative controls. For each mouse, three replicates were prepared, LD540 was then added and the signal was recorded by live imaging hourly for 4 h in the IncuCyte SX5, with four FOVs imaged per well. The LD540-integrated intensity was quantified by multiplying µm2 per FOV using the IncuCyte SX5 analysis software. A cell area filter was applied to ensure single-cell detection. Out-of-focus FOVs were excluded from analysis, as indicated by red labelling in the raw data spreadsheet. For co-culture data, the mean integrated LD540 signal per mouse was calculated following outlier removal by the interquartile range method. Statistical tests included the Shapiro–Wilk test for normality, Levene's test for variance homogeneity, and two-sample t-tests to compare CD versus HFD conditions at each time point. For screening data, mean LD540 measurements were averaged across replicates and normalized to the control measurement mean for each mouse after 3 h and 4 h in the co-culture experiment, and after 2 h in the screening assay.

KCs were isolated and pelleted as described above. Pelleted cells were thawed and lysed in urea lysis buffer (8 M urea and 50 mM Tris (pH8)), DNA was sheared with 28 U ml−1 benzonase (Sigma), and disulfide bridges were reduced and alkylated with 10 mM Bond-Breaker TCEP solution (Thermo) and 30 mM chloroacetamide. Non-dissolved cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000g for 10 min, and clean supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Protein concentrations were determined with the Pierce 660 nm Protein-Assay-kit (Thermo). Of protein input, 25 µg was used for digestion in 2 M urea (diluted with 50 mM Tris (pH 8)) with a trypsin–LysC mixture (1:50 (enzyme:protein)) at 800 rpm for 16 h. Protein digestion was stopped with 1% formic acid, peptides were desalted on in-house-produced SDB-RPS Stage Tips and loaded onto EvoTip Pure trap columns following the manufacturers' protocol.

A liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry system consisting of an Evosep One liquid chromatograph (Evosep) and a timsTOF Pro 2 mass spectrometer (Bruker) was used for peptide separation and acquisition. Reversed-phase separation was performed on an Aurora Elite analytical column (IonOpticks) using the 40 samples-per-day separation method with a 31-min gradient preprogrammed on the liquid chromatography system. Eluting peptides were on-line transferred into the mass spectrometry via a CaptiveSpray ionisation source operated at a constant voltage of 1.5 kV. We used the data-independent acquisition parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation mode with the TIMS analyser operating with 100-ms accumulation and ramping times and a 100% duty cycle. Peptide ranges were limited to a mass-to-charge range of 350–1,100 m/z and an ion mobility range of 0.63–1.45 Vs cm−2 with 12 pydiAID-optimized data-independent acquisition parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation windows of variable widths79. We increased collisional energies stepwise from 24 eV at 0.70 Vs cm−2 and 49 eV at 1.35 Vs cm−2 for peptide fragmentation. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository80 with the dataset identifier PXD058285. Spectral library prediction, peptide identification and protein quantification were performed in library-free mode using DIA-NN (v1.8.1)81. The SwissProt Mus musculus database was used for predicted spectral library (downloaded from UniProt: 2022-12-28). In silico digestion was set to trypsin as the digestion enzyme with a maximal one miss-cleavage and cysteine carbamidomethylation set as fixed modifications. Precursor peptides were filtered at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 1%. The match-between-runs option was enabled. Using the DIA-NN main output table, we performed protein group intensity normalizations with the MaxLFQ algorithm82 implemented in the DIA-NN R-package. Only proteotypic peptides were considered for quantification. Statistical analysis was performed in the Perseus software suite (v1.6.15)83. Protein group label-free quantification intensities were log2 transformed and filtered for protein groups with data completeness in at least one condition. Missing values were replaced by random value drawing from 1.8 standard deviations downshifted and 0.3 standard deviations broad normal distributions. Significantly regulated proteins between any conditions were identified by ANOVA multiple-sample testing (S0 = 0.5, FDR < 0.1 with 250 randomizations) and all proteins were z-score normalized. For visualization, the dataset was summarized by taking the mean over all samples per group, namely, WT and KO in maternal lean, as well as WT and KO in maternal obese. The summarized data were objected to k-means clustering using k = 6 to obtain groups of proteins with varying expression patterns across samples from which several interesting representatives were chosen to be highlighted.

Statistical assessment was performed with one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons method, the Kruskal–Wallis test, the unpaired Student's t-test, the Mann–Whitney test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test, depending on the dataset, and following an assessment of normality. R-studio and Prism were used for the statistical evaluation and visualization. Statistical significance was represented via the probability (P value) as follows: not significant (NS) > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. All bar graphs represent mean values. In all of the aforementioned analyses, PCA was performed using the prcomp function in R on centred data. Significance levels were consistently set at P < 0.05. Raw P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate method and considered significant if the adjusted P < 0.1. The analysis was implemented using R (v4.2.0)84 and Bioconductor (v3.15)85.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Definitive, Insane, Swimsuit-Bursting Story of the Steroid Olympics","https://www.wired.com/story/enhanced-games-freestyle-record-las-vegas-steroids/","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

On February 25, 2025, the Australian swimmer James Magnussen stood on the starting blocks at a swimming pool in North Carolina with a million dollars and his reputation on the line. Magnussen, a triple Olympic medalist and world champion in the 100-meter freestyle, had been retired from professional sports for six years. But he had restarted his career to join the Enhanced Games, a kind of Olympics on steroids. This is meant literally: The event, which encourages athletes to take performance-enhancing drugs, is scheduled for May 2026 in Las Vegas.

Its founder, Aron D'Souza, is a slick-talking Peter Thiel acolyte who believes throwing off the shackles of drug testing can help push humanity to the next level. Enhanced, the company behind the Games, has secured millions from Thiel, Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital, and others, and praise from the likes of Joe Rogan. But the reaction from the sporting establishment has been split between horror over the health implications and skepticism over whether the event will ever actually happen.

At the time of his February swim, Magnussen was the only athlete to have publicly said he'd be willing to compete. He'd come to the Greensboro Aquatics Center for a secret time trial. If he could beat the world record time in the 50-meter freestyle—swimming's flagship event—he'd win a million-dollar prize from Enhanced, and D'Souza would get to prove his many doubters wrong by demonstrating that a cocktail of substances usually banned from elite sport could turn an ex-athlete into the fastest swimmer on Earth.

For four months, Magnussen had been on “the protocol”—a regimen of daily injections in the stomach and backside. No one from Enhanced would tell me what he was taking—they say they don't want to encourage copycats—but Magnussen let it slip to the Sydney Morning Herald: testosterone to boost muscle mass and bone density, the peptides BPC-157 and thymosin to speed up recovery, and ipamorelin and CJC-1295 to increase the release of growth hormone in the body.

James Magnussen, the first athlete to sign up to work with Enhanced, did not have an easy time training as enhanced athlete.

Standing on the blocks, he looked insane—his already out-there swimmer's physique pushed to the extreme. Veins popped on his forearms, and his shoulders were cartoonishly broad. His back muscles bulged so far out of the sides of his swimsuit that you could see them from the front. With the reflective goggles and black swimming cap, the overall effect was more alien than superhuman.

The target time was 20.91 seconds, set in 2009 by the Brazilian Cesar Cielo. But as soon as Magnussen broke the surface, you could tell something was wrong. He was sinking too low in the water. His arms raked forward, devouring the distance, but the more he strained, the more resistance he faced. He had put on 30 pounds of muscle, and his own beefed up body was working against him. The whole premise of the Enhanced Games seemed to hang in the balance. If the only elite athlete willing to come forward couldn't get close to the world record after five months of enhancements, well, what was the point?

In 2009, D'Souza got a phone call that changed his life and set him on the path that would lead to Enhanced. The Australian was in his first week as a law student at the University of Oxford, and a friend who was close to the billionaire Peter Thiel got in touch to say they were visiting the city and to ask if D'Souza would show them around.

Befriending Thiel opened his eyes to the “extraordinary opportunities that exist in the world,” he says. These were opportunities he wanted to seize; D'Souza is “obsessed with status and power,” as his friend Sam Altman once put it. He and Thiel hit it off immediately, and a year later D'Souza went to Thiel with a plan for how, given three to five years and $10 million, Thiel could take his revenge on Gawker for outing him as gay. Improbably, this involved covertly funding legal action by the wrestler Hulk Hogan against Gawker, which had published a sex tape without Hogan's consent. Although D'Souza is also gay, his plan to take down Gawker—which folded after Hogan won a $140 million verdict against it—was apparently not part of some righteous crusade. It was “just a way for him to make his mark,” writes Ryan Holiday in Conspiracy, a book about the trial.

After the verdict, D'Souza bounced between careers—diplomat, VC, philanthropist, fintech founder. But in the waning days of 2022, he got an idea. Every year D'Souza would spend the holidays sketching out new business plans—a subscription-based social network, a scheme to fund a poet laureate to define what it means to be Australian—but nothing had really stuck. Inspired by the ripped physiques he'd been seeing at the gym and on Instagram, D'Souza refined some thoughts for a showcase of just how far you could push human potential. He had the sense that public attitudes toward steroids were starting to shift after years of stigma following their misuse by athletes and state-sponsored doping regimes in the 1980s and 1990s.

Aron D'Souza, mastermind of the Enhanced Games.

It was a notion that had been percolating in D'Souza's head for years—ever since he'd read an article in a 2004 issue of WIRED called ‘Steroids for Everyone!' that outlined the case for an Enhanced Olympics using almost exactly the same argument that D'Souza employs today. There were other inspirations too: the “unimpressive” intellect of members of the International Olympic Committee who he met at a dinner in Oxford, and a study commissioned by the World Anti Doping Agency which surveyed athletes anonymously and found that 44 percent of them admitted to taking drugs. (This figure is one of D'Souza's most potent weapons in interviews, but one of the authors told me that it's likely an overestimate and that it was only ever meant to be a pilot study to assess new methods of measurement.)

He spent New Year's Eve with Thiel, as he does most years, and told the billionaire what he'd been working on. Thiel seemed interested, so D'Souza spent the next six months developing the concept further. D'Souza and his executive assistant Thomas Dolan tried pitching to investors (including Lance Armstrong, according to the Financial Times) but got little interest. “Everyone was like, you can't even talk about this stuff,” D'Souza says. “It was outside the Overton window.” In June 2023, D'Souza launched a website for the Enhanced Games and posted a 34-second stock-footage clip of a sprinter in the blocks, with a voice-over declaring that he was the fastest man in the world and “a proud enhanced athlete.” It presented the Games as a libertarian ideal: take whatever you want, with no testing.

D'Souza and Dolan spent £4,000 ($5,400) on paid promotion, and the clip got 9 million views in 24 hours. Enhanced had its first media coverage and its first investor—the prominent venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan, who reached out to D'Souza via Twitter DM, and followed up a few hours later with a term sheet for the deal, also sent over Twitter DM.

A few weeks later, D'Souza hosted a Sunday lunch at his house for Thiel, who was visiting London, and a few friends in the gay VC community. “We've all holidayed together for years,” he told me. “It's an extraordinarily tight group.” Also on the guest list was Christian Angermayer, a German biotech billionaire who Thiel had introduced to D'Souza on holiday in 2013. Angermayer had seen an article about Enhanced in the German press and wanted to come on board as a cofounder.

Neither Thiel, D'Souza, nor Angermayer are huge sports fans. (“We're three gay guys,” D'Souza says.) But over roast lamb, Yorkshire pudding, and fine wine the group got to talking about human enhancement, longevity, and all the rest of it, and by the end of the meal both Angermayer and Thiel had agreed to invest. D'Souza has proved to be a savvy fundraiser. He has the valuable ability to keep a straight face while saying something obviously ridiculous—engaging with him is “like talking to a bar of soap,” one doping expert told me.

The announcement of Thiel's and Angermayer's investments went out at the end of January 2024 and sparked a new round of media coverage, and the fiercest criticisms yet from health experts. Those I spoke to were worried about the effect of long-term steroid use on athlete's hearts, premature aging, and what might happen to people when they tried to come off the drugs. Others thought that an event like the Enhanced Games might cause steroid use to spread first through sport, then through society at large, and that people might end up taking larger doses or counterfeit versions of the pills that athletes are using. “There's going to be enormous ripple effects that will certainly have destructive implications in people,” says Thomas Murray, bioethicist and author of Good Sport: Why Our Games Matter—and How Doping Undermines Them. Personally, I felt that D'Souza had fundamentally misunderstood sports. At heart, they are about limitations: not who can travel 100 meters the fastest but who can do it while staying within a set of agreed-upon rules (no drugs, no rocket boots, no giant fan blowing a tail wind behind you). And even in events like sprinting and swimming, success isn't simply a function of adding more power. People aren't cars. There's a skill to swimming quickly that goes beyond the strength of your muscles. And the drugs aren't magic—even if you can take half a second off your 100-meter sprint time with steroids (and that's a generous estimate), to break Usain Bolt's record you need to find one of the handful of people who can already run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds and then convince them to risk their reputation, their earning potential, and maybe even their health.

Which raises a question: Why would even one athlete agree to this? In February 2024, Magnussen was driving home from a pickleball game when he got a call from the Hello Sport podcast; the hosts wanted to ask him about the Enhanced Games. He had a comfortable life in Australia: swimming at Bondi Beach every day and working as a commentator. But he missed the thrill of competition. “I love the simplicity of being an athlete,” he says. He made a flippant comment that would change his life and help usher the Games into being. “If they put up a million dollars for the 50-freestyle world record, I'll come on board as their first athlete,” Magnussen told the podcast hosts. “I'll juice to the gills and break the record within six months.”

A month after that, I met D'Souza at a plush coworking space in West London where Enhanced had set up a small office. Looking at the website back then, it was hard to take the idea seriously. D'Souza had co-opted the language of the LGBTQ community for his venture—the site talked about “coming out” as enhanced. There was a section devoted to covertly editing Wikipedia articles to, for instance, change the word “cheated” in an article about an athlete caught doping to “fought for science and bodily sovereignty.” On the official Enhanced Games Discord channel, which was mainly populated by bodybuilders sharing before and after pictures, I found a zip file called “The Arsenal” which was full of memes bashing the International Olympic Committee, the details of which are actually too cringe to describe.

But behind the scenes, things were starting to change. Angermayer had put his own people into senior roles, drafting in Mike Oakes from his Apeiron Investment Group to work on communications and Max Martin—a square-jawed twentysomething whose enthusiasm about his own enhancement program almost had me reaching for a syringe—to oversee the execution of the Games. More sensible hires followed: sports scientist Dan Turner to head up a scientific commission that would help advise athletes, former Team USA chief Rick Adams to handle the logistics of the event itself, Tim Phelan from Nike to run athlete relations. Magnussen had officially come on board as Enhanced's first athlete—they'd pay him a monthly salary. The mission changed, too, to become more about getting the public to embrace steroids, “the Enhanced Age,” superhumanity for everyone. There was also unrest: Early on, Angermayer had brought in physician Michael Sagner to sit on an independent medical commission that would ensure athlete safety. Sagner, a longevity and aging expert who operates a high-end clinic just off London's Harley Street, became incensed by some of D'Souza's public statements. “Without asking anybody, he was just going bananas with these press releases,” Sagner says. “And then it became even more outrageous when there was something else added to the website—that it's even better without testing, and anything goes.” He has stuck around—for now.

The Paris Olympics came and went with barely a peep from Enhanced. The first Enhanced Games had been slated for the end of 2024, but the open trials D'Souza had told me about the first time we met never materialized. Magnussen, still their only athlete, was getting restless.

In October 2024, Magnussen flew from Sydney to Los Angeles. He had presented Enhanced with a plan: With eight weeks to dope and train, he could try to break the world record as a way to showcase the potential of the Games before the first official event. His first challenge had been finding the drugs. A few companies had contacted him, and Enhanced had put him in touch with some members of its medical commission, but it wasn't the kind of thing that was easy to get advice on.

The next hurdle was finding somewhere to swim. Elite-level pools and coaches in Australia can only work with drug-tested athletes, so Magnussen reached out to Brett Hawke, a former Australian Olympian turned coach who had worked at Auburn University in Alabama for many years and was now coaching a club team in Irvine, California.

Hawke had coached the two previous fastest swimmers in history—Frédérick Bousquet in the years after his 21.04 in 2004, and Cesar Cielo's 20.91 in 2009, which was the target Magnussen would be trying to beat. Both these swims were in the supersuit era, when swimmers wore full-body polyurethane suits that made them more buoyant, before these were banned at the start of 2010. (Both swimmers also failed drug tests during their careers). Magnussen and Hawke had spoken about the Enhanced Games on Hawke's podcast a few weeks prior, and Magnussen figured California might be an easier place for him to train in anonymity.

At the height of his Olympic career, Magnussen had worked with a full team around him: biomechanicists, sports scientists, strength and conditioning coaches, physiotherapists, assistants. He had underwater cameras to check his form. The temperature of the water was always perfect. Irvine was different. It turned out that the pool manager at the club where Hawke normally worked didn't want Magnussen training there either. So they ended up doing the majority of the preparation for the world record attempt at the 25-yard swimming pool in Hawke's apartment complex—the one open to all residents. There were no lane markings and no blocks to dive from. There were no splash-over areas for the water to go into, so Magnussen was constantly fighting his own turbulence. “We would get a crowd sometimes. People would walk past and stare in amazement and sit and watch,” Hawke says. The only saving grace was the weather: a cold wet winter by California standards meant that they never had to share the pool with the other residents, although they did sometimes have to shoo away some ducks. “The whole process was bizarre to me,” Magnussen says.

James Magnussen, who burst through multiple swimsuits in his attempt to set a new world record.

He started his regimen of daily injections in mid-October, and his body soon started to change. In hindsight, he thinks he is a “super responder” to performance enhancements. “My strength was through the roof,” he says. “I was squatting 250 kilos, which I would say is at least 20 percent stronger than any other swimmer in history. It was insane.” Every few weeks, he would drive to a clinic in Los Angeles for a battery of blood tests and heart checks. Mostly he just trained—twice a day, every day for the first seven weeks in the US. But while the drugs helped his muscles bounce back quicker, the intense workload left no time for his central nervous system to recover. He was burning out.

In December, just when he should have been nearing his physical peak for the record attempt, he got a toothache, and his face “swelled up like a balloon.” He spent Christmas Day in the hospital, having an abscess drained and a root canal operation. The attempt had been pushed back from December to February, and for Magnussen what was meant to be an eight week stint away from friends and family became five months. He spent New Year's alone in an Airbnb, thousands of miles from home.

While Magnussen and Hawke toiled among the ducks and deck chairs in California, the Enhanced Games were inching closer to reality. More athletes were expressing an interest, D'Souza said—although none of them had yet been willing to stick their head above the parapet like Magnussen. Estimates ranged depending on who you asked: Some at Enhanced told me the number of interested parties was in the hundreds; Sagner put it at 35.

D'Souza says Enhanced was talking to “every major sports broadcaster” about screening the event, but he had his eye on social media virality. Angermayer drummed up interest from investors, while Max Martin and Rick Adams toured the world in search of potential host cities. But by the middle of 2024, they'd decided to wait and see who won the US presidential election. The Biden administration had been actively hostile to the idea of Enhanced. A Trump win opened up all sorts of interesting possibilities.

Enhanced began finalizing a deal to host the Games in Las Vegas not long after the election. “A hundred percent the reason they're happening in the US is because Trump won,” says Angermayer. A few months later, he secured investment from 1789 Capital, Donald Trump Jr.'s investment firm, and Enhanced would find itself ideally positioned to align itself with RFK Jr.'s crusade to “Make America Healthy Again.” (“He takes enhancements himself,” D'Souza says of Kennedy. “He is very pro–human enhancement.”) Enhanced started making plans to move its headquarters from London to New York.

In December 2024, D'Souza held a conference in Oxford on human enhancement. Speakers included the geneticist George Church, best known for trying to bring back the woolly mammoth, and Bryan Johnson, best known for plowing his personal fortune into increasingly creepy attempts to make himself younger. At the end, they signed the “First Declaration on Human Enhancement”—a document setting out the tenets that these “pioneers” agreed to follow. The 39 signatories are a strange mix: age-obsessed millionaires, longevity doctors, Enhanced staff members, interested college students, and a bodybuilding influencer called Mr. Vigorous Steve.

But the most interesting thing was the shift in tone. Angermayer's influence had made itself felt. Take Article 2d of the declaration: In competitions, organisers shall establish rigorous safety protocols, scientific testing and medical supervision to ensure that all enhancements are used responsibly.

This is a long way from the libertarian free-for-all that D'Souza had first proposed, and in fact, the more the Games evolved, the more they started to resemble the Olympics. “Obviously, as soon as you want to be taken seriously as a contender on the world stage … you can't have footage of athletes dropping dead,” says Ask Vest Christiansen, a doping researcher who was at the conference in Oxford but did not sign the declaration.

There was much trial-and-error with training the “enhanced” athletes.

Athletes who wanted to compete in the Games would be limited to legal drugs that were approved in the country where they reside and prescribed by a doctor, although several of the drugs Magnussen confessed to taking do not appear to have regulatory approval in either Australia or the US. (Enhanced said it couldn't comment on the “specific substances” Magnussen has taken but emphasized that he “underwent and successfully passed all of Enhanced's required medical screenings and safety checks at every stage of the process.”) Athletes would have regular blood tests and heart and brain scans, and if the doctors on the independent medical commission were concerned, those athletes would be barred from competing at the Enhanced Games.

Far from throwing off the shackles of the World Anti Doping Agency, it seemed as if Enhanced had simply re-created it, with a slightly different red line. The great irony of the Enhanced Games is that athletes who take part are likely to be tested much more often than they would have been had they stayed in clean competition. But by January 2025, the Enhanced Games had a venue, funding, and a friendly political environment. All they needed now was some proof that the drugs would actually make a difference.

After Magnussen recovered from his root canal surgery, he and Hawke tried to counteract some of the effects the enhancement program was having on his body shape. Swimming is a trade-off between power and weight: the heavier you are, the more you sink into the water and the more resistance you face when you're trying to propel yourself forward. He went on a diet plan to try to lose some of the weight he was putting on. Although Magnussen's athlete brain would never let him admit it, it was becoming clear to both him and Hawke that they were running out of time for him to get into world-record-breaking form.

In the meantime, Hawke got a call from Tim Phelan, Enhanced's VP of athlete relations. They had received an email from another athlete who wanted to sign up for the Games—a 31-year-old Greek-Bulgarian swimmer called Kristian Gkolomeev, who had finished fifth in the 50-meter freestyle at the Paris Olympics. (Enhanced says some non-swimmers have signed up too but has yet to name any.) Gkolomeev's ambition had always been to win a medal, but after Paris he felt despondent—he had missed out by less than three-tenths of a second for the second Olympics in a row.

Kristian Gkolomeev, another swimmer attracted to the million-dollar payday, at Enhanced Games event.

Throughout his career, Gkolomeev would bemoan how difficult it was to make a living as a professional swimmer. It was why his father Tsvetan—who swam for Bulgaria at the 1980 and 1988 Olympics—had moved the family to Greece in search of stable work when Kristian was 2. (Tsvetan died of skin cancer in 2010). Gkolomeev had his own young family now, and as he looked at the four years leading up to the next Olympics he wondered how he was going to make it work. Financially, mentally, emotionally, he was done. The million-dollar prize on offer for breaking a world record offered a tempting way out. “One successful year in the Enhanced Games and I could make as much as I would have made in almost 10 careers,” he says.

In early December 2024, Gkolomeev rented an Airbnb and moved his family from Houston to join Hawke in California, ostensibly to serve as a training partner for Magnussen. But a couple of weeks later, Hawke got another phone call. Gkolomeev was going to start an enhancement protocol—and he was going to try to break the world record too. “That's when all hell broke loose,” says Hawke.

Magnussen had moved his whole life to America for the record attempt and was “dead against” another swimmer muscling in on his turf, according to Hawke. “I wasn't thrilled about the prospect of having to share resources,” says Magnussen. “But it's not just about me and my attempt. To prove this concept of the Games, someone needed to break that world record.” Eventually they reached a compromise. Magnussen would get the first crack at the record attempt and the million dollars in February, then Gkolomeev would come back a few months later for his own attempt.

Hawke's job became as much about managing their egos as making them faster—he had to keep them separated when they were doing speed work so that they never got a direct comparison of their times. “Kristian's progression was a lot faster,” Hawke says. “That created a little bit of tension.”

Within a few weeks, Gkolomeev was swimming faster than Magnussen. Within a month, he was as fast as he'd been in Paris. In early February, Gkolomeev started his enhancement program. Like everyone at Enhanced, he was cagey about exactly what substances he was using, but it's clear that he took a very different approach than Magnussen. “I can tell you that I microdosed, like baby doses,” Gkolomeev says. “I could feel it within the first two weeks. I started feeling better—healthier, the energy levels, the confidence that I got.” Magnussen's extra muscle was weighing him down—they didn't want the same thing to happen to Gkolomeev.

A camera crew was following the swimmers as they tried to set new world records.

In the last week of February, Gkolomeev, Magnussen, and Hawke flew to North Carolina, where they were joined by a team from Enhanced and the documentary crew that would film the record attempt.

The Enhanced team had been scouring the country looking for 2009-era supersuits for Magnussen to wear—contacting former swimmers, paying thousands to buy their old gear and have it flown to Greensboro. They managed to find four: two for Magnussen, two for Gkolomeev. But Magnussen had put on so much muscle that he physically couldn't fit into the suit. The night before his first attempt at the record he tried one on and it ripped. Then the second suit ripped as well.

That night, there was a furious discussion in Hawke's room at the Marriott in Greensboro between Magnussen, Hawke, and Max Martin from Enhanced. Magnussen wanted the third supersuit—the one that had been promised to Gkolomeev. Hawke says the Greek was in his room downstairs, texting Hawke: “I'm not giving him my suit, I need it.” He'd done 21.45—just a hundredth below his personal best—in a time trial that morning and was within half a second of the world record in a newer, less buoyant supersuit. He felt like he could break the record.

“Kristian was a little pissed off at that stage,” Hawke says. He thinks the tension between the two men might go some way to explaining what happened next.

When he touched the wall on his final attempt in Greensboro on February 25, Magnussen's time was 22.73 seconds—almost two seconds off Cielo's world record and 1.2 seconds slower than his own clean personal best. He'd failed again, and the Enhanced team would have to regroup. They didn't have their record.

Magnussen was getting a massage in a room to the side of the pool when he heard Gkolomeev hit the water. Hardly anyone was watching—most of the film crew had taken a break, so only Hawke, Martin, and the official timekeepers were actually poolside to witness what happened next. The stakes seemed low, although the million was still up for grabs if either swimmer could go under 20.91 seconds. Gkolomeev had done two warm-up starts and slipped off the blocks both times, falling flat on his face, and he was planning to spend another couple of months on the enhancement protocol before returning to Greensboro in April for his own crack at the record.

But his third start was perfect. He slid into the water, and three powerful dolphin kicks set him on his way. He felt good—strong, relaxed, in flow. Magnussen could see a slice of the pool through the open door of the massage room, and when he saw him go past he knew he was going quicker than before. Hawke was jogging alongside the pool with a stopwatch to track the split times, and at the 35-meter mark he realized what was about to happen. Gkolomeev touched the wall and turned to check his time on the big screen in disbelief—20.89 seconds, a new world record. Mouth agape, hands raised to his black swimming cap in genuine shock. At the other end of the pool, Martin jumped into the water in celebration. “I felt like a Labrador who just couldn't help himself,” he says. Hawke sat with his head in his hands, as if he couldn't quite believe what they had just done. “It was a beautiful day,” Martin says. “Brett was crying. One of the officials was crying.”

Gkolomeev phoned his wife to tell her they were millionaires. The giant check presentation had to wait, though—the organizers had arranged one, but it had been made out to James Magnussen, so they returned the next day to stage some footage for the documentary and some slow-motion shots of them spraying champagne over each other. There was always one eye on the optics—and news of the record was kept a closely guarded secret, for now.

Seven weeks later, Gkolomeev returned to North Carolina to break another world record—for the fastest time in “jammers,” the skintight shorts that elite swimmers have worn since the supersuits were banned in 2010. But he found this one a lot harder. He had been on the enhancement regime for longer, and although he hadn't put on as much weight as Magnussen, he had to adjust his technique to compensate. In the end, it took Gkolomeev five attempts to go one-hundredth of a second under Caeleb Dressel's 2019 time of 21.04.

The fact that Gkolomeev seemed to get slower the longer he spent on the protocol made me wonder if he could have broken the record anyway, without the enhancements. “I would like to think yes,” says Hawke, his coach. Gkolomeev agrees—but says it would have taken longer, maybe six months of training. Magnussen, perhaps unsurprisingly, gives credit to the drugs. “If you watch his 50-meter freestyle race in Paris, at the 15-meter mark he was eighth,” he says. “He was last because he didn't quite have that explosive strength and power that you get on the performance enhancement protocol. I think that gave him that last 1 percent—that last cherry on top to break the world record.”

In May, Enhanced held what it was referring to internally as an “Apple-style launch event” at Resorts World, a sprawling hotel and casino complex in Las Vegas, where it would announce the date and venue of the first Enhanced Games. It was a day many of the doubters had thought would never come. If you'd asked me six months ago I would have agreed. But the changing political climate and Gkolomeev's record-breaking feats had changed what seemed possible.

The Vegas crowd during the Enhanced Games event.

In keeping with D'Souza's digital-first approach, the presentation was being streamed on YouTube, but there were about a hundred people gathered inside Zouk nightclub, where the VIPs seemed to outnumber the regular guests by about 4 to 1. There were burly men in suits that somehow managed to show off their arm muscles, several of whom turned out to be longevity doctors. I met Zoltan Istvan, a transhumanist who is running for governor of California. Enhanced staff—almost exclusively fit, young, and possibly enhanced men—buzzed around in branded black T-shirts. Peter Thiel's husband, Matt Danzeisen, was there with a delegation from Thiel Capital and a security detail so discreet that I didn't even notice they were there until someone told me afterward.

After a heavy-handed introduction—Greek statues crumbling, a solemn voice-over saying things like “we dream beyond what we were allowed to dream”—D'Souza took to the stage. He looked unusually nervous. The first Enhanced Games, he announced, would take place at Resorts World in Las Vegas on Memorial Day weekend in May 2026. If that was a bit anticlimactic—we were already sitting there, after all—what came next shocked the crowd. Angermayer got the honor of doing the Steve Jobs line—“one more thing”—as he introduced a clip of Gkolomeev breaking the 50-meter freestyle world record. There was a stunned silence in the room, followed by a round of applause. A guy near the front with a wrestler's physique and visible forehead veins rose to his feet in a standing ovation.

The Games had morphed from a libertarian Olympics into something smaller, safer—an exhibition with a few thousand in-person spectators. There will be a six-lane athletics track and a weightlifting arena. Gkolomeev and Magnussen will compete in the pool—with a more subtle enhancement program and the right suit, the Australian is sure he can break the record.

But maybe the event was never the point. All through my reporting I'd been struggling to understand what was in it for the investors—why billionaires with no interest in sport were so interested in disrupting it. Toward the end of the presentation in Vegas, it all clicked into place when D'Souza announced the launch of Enhanced Performance Products—a new line of supplements inspired by the ones athletes will be taking to prepare for the Games. This pill helped me run 100 meters in nine seconds, and now you can buy it too. The model isn't the Olympics or the World Cup. It's Red Bull.

“They buy sporting assets to sell an energy drink,” D'Souza told me. “That energy drink is 90 percent gross margin. They don't do the bottling or manufacturing, that's all done by outsourced service providers. And Red Bull is a multibillion-dollar company owned by two families. And so our business model is very similar.”

When I met D'Souza in his suite a few hours after the launch he was in a triumphant mood. He told me at least 20 new athletes had expressed interest, and “dozens” of people had signed up for the supplement line. He had received text messages from more than one royal. No matter that the livestream had, at the time of this reporting, a mere 4,000 views. The press had amplified that a thousand-fold. The sporting establishment had spent a year trying to ignore Enhanced, but in the following days USA Swimming sent a letter to athletes warning them against competing, and World Aquatics said athletes could still be banned for joining the Enhanced Games even if they competed clean. (Enhanced has always said drugs are optional for competing in the Games.) The World Anti Doping Agency is calling on the US authorities to shut down the Games. If it was all just marketing, he'd done a very good job.

D'Souza gestured out at Las Vegas—the hollow facade of the Sphere playing ads on an endless loop, the city conjured out of the desert, the parking lot soon to be transformed into the cradle of superhumanity. “In a year's time we're going to look out of that window and say wow—we built a track, we built a pool, we built a weightlifting arena, and we smashed a whole bunch of world records, and we did it safely and the world watched,” he said. In his mind, this moment was on par with the JFK speech that launched the space race—something to tell my grandchildren about. The dawn of the Enhanced Age.

Victoria Aveyard's eyes avoid the camera when she slams her large white binder on the table, weighed down with a 1,000-page draft of her latest work in progress. The stack is heavy, made clear by her audible sigh as she splits the thick manuscript in half. Fueled with Cherry Lime Poppi and a bowl of grapes, she purposefully jots notes on the pages with every quick camera cut. Aveyard, the New York Times bestselling young adult fantasy author of the Red Queen series, doesn't say a single word in the video, but her captions on the screen speak volumes. “Using GenAI to write a book doesn't make you a writer, it makes you a thief,” reads one.

“Don't use generative-AI to make tropey, regurgitated romantasy sludge that you can then launder through the self-publishing industry in order to backdoor your way into a traditional publishing deal,” Aveyard tells her over 460,000 followers on TikTok in another video posted on May 27. “Authors talk.” Both TikToks garnered over 350,000 views.

Criticism and warnings of Gen-AI authors snagging coveted deals are flooding both Threads and TikTok, with writers and readers sometimes flinging around accusations when they suspect someone is using AI as part of their creative process. Now, Aveyard and other prolific authors are not only calling out people who use AI to write, they're also posting livestreams and time-lapses of their writing processes to defend themselves against such complaints.

“The r/WritingWithAI subreddit has over 40,000 subscribers and growing. It's a very depressing thought, to know we may very soon be the minority,” Aveyard tells WIRED. “I don't think my voice will move the needle much or convince anyone already using generative AI to stop, but I needed to voice my anger with the circumstances.”

The publishing market is expected to grow by $18.9 million between now and 2029, according to market research firm Technavio, partially due to an influx of self-published authors. But with scammy rewrites and digitally fabricated authors entering the market, artificial intelligence has made searching for human-made content more difficult, causing independent authors to combat what some are calling an AI-generated “witch hunt.”

“Sometimes it's hard to conceptualize the scope and scale of work that goes into writing a book, and showing a physical manuscript really helps that hit home,” Aveyard says when asked about the inspiration behind her 1,000-page editing video. She is a strong critic of AI in publishing, calling it theft of creative intellectual property. “I post regularly on my platforms, and I'm always looking for content that catches the eye as well as emphasizes my work. And getting to emphasize my position on generative AI? An added benefit.” (Aveyard never names any specific indie authors using generative-AI to secure a traditional publishing deal.)

“Do I think authors should post ‘proof'? Not necessarily,” says indie author Ashley Godschild. “Would I like to see more authors post their process and make it clear it's without AI? Yes. Because I think we need to be loud and clear that it's not welcome in this industry.”

Godschild, who penned the fantasy novel The Hunter and The Hunted, says she's been writing since childhood and goes through a lengthy process—plotting her manuscript years before putting pen to paper. A few days after seeing Aveyard's 1,000-page edit post, Godschild posted a time-lapse of herself writing at her computer, captioning the video, “Watch this time-lapse of me writing a scene in a murder mystery TV show without the use of gen-AI.” The caption also notes that she's “not a thief” and that “the murderer is so unpredictable not even a machine could figure out who it is.”

Some writers are using the AI controversy to remind people of the very human skills it takes to craft a complex story.

YA indie author Rachel Menard posted a TikTok of herself opening drafts of one of her manuscripts, writing that if she was using AI, “It wouldn't take me 78 drafts to get it done.”

“Everyone has forgotten what makes a book good, and it's the work that goes into it,” says Menard, who has penned three books independently. She adds that while AI may be able to “pop out a decent spice scene,” it can't create a compelling story. “If my characters don't feel like real people, living real lives, with real problems, then I need to keep working on it.”

Quan Millz, an indie author with over 830,000 TikTok followers and well-known for his jaw-dropping “street lit” titles like Old Thot Next Door and This Hoe Got Roaches in Her Crib, says accusations that he has used AI to write go beyond labeling him as a thief—they underestimate the cultural fluency behind his novels. Prior to revealing his identity on TikTok in 2023, Millz, who is Black, dealt with accusations that he was white and even a rumor that he was a “CIA operative.”

“It's clear now that you use AI to write all your books. Ain't no way you're dropping the books this fast,” one commenter wrote on one of Millz's posts.

Millz uses AI to make book covers, including for books that are still in the conceptual phase, but says allegations that he also writes with the tool are false.

“There's no way in hell you're going to get any of these AI models to really capture the essence of just how Black people talk,” Millz tells WIRED. The author says he has tested using AI for writing and found that the large language models censored his adult scenes and could not reproduce his nuanced tone. “It doesn't understand that AAVE [African American Vernacular English] is not monolithic … Black people in Chicago don't sound like Black people in New York.”

While Millz has hosted a couple of TikTok Lives documenting his writing process in real time, he tells WIRED that he won't be hosting more—even if it helps prove to skeptics that his written work is original.

Constantly checking in with commenters hindered his writing process, he says, and he feels that while having a social presence is crucial in indie publishing, filming your process won't provide more proof of AI-free work than your work itself—at least not yet. “I really do think that there's something else transcendent about the human experience, something mystical that we just don't know about yet, and you can feel that through the arts,” Millz says. “When you read AI text, even if you do a good job of trying to edit it or make it your own, there's still something amiss.”

I've been waiting for a monitor like this for a long time. OLED has already taken the PC gaming world by storm, with many gaming monitors finally bringing true high dynamic range (HDR) visuals in a meaningful way. But it hasn't helped much with the lack of HDR content on the internet, primarily because the monitors that professional video editors use are still not HDR-capable.

Dell has finally introduced a non-gaming OLED monitor, the Dell 32 Plus QD-OLED (S3225QC). At $850, the monitor has a 4K resolution with a 120-Hz refresh rate, as well as immersive 3D audio. Finally, a monitor exists under $1,000 that you can properly view and edit HDR video on—the type of display that could change everything.

The vibe of the Dell 32 Plus is important. After all, you've been able to buy an impressive OLED monitor for a while now, and they all come with spectacular image quality and loads of high-end features. But they were always billed as gaming displays, and thus, a gamer aesthetic. Jagged vents, aggressive angles, black plastic, and RGB galore.

They aren't all this extreme. The Samsung Odyssey G8 looks pretty modern, but even that might be a bit much in a design studio. I don't mean to sound pretentious—it's just the reality of the situation. And we desperately need more to get more HDR-capable monitors in the hands of editors if we want to see higher-quality video proliferate across the internet (and not just on vertical videos captured on phones, as things currently go). Dell's new design ethos is an all-white exterior, marked with just a splash of dark-gray fabric stretched over the large bottom bezel. It's plastic but has a unique textured feel and rounded corners that give it a simple but distinct look.

Speaking of that bottom bezel, you'll notice the camera dead center below the screen—normally a very odd place for a webcam. But that's because this camera isn't for Zoom calls. Instead, it's for tracking your head in 3D space to create the monitor's claims of “spatial audio.” Using beamforming technology, the speakers can create virtual surround sound in compatible games and movies. It's not perfect, but it can add an extra immersive element. (It only works with one person at a time.)

While the extra camera and speakers make for a thick bottom bezel, almost resembling a modern iMac, the five-speaker sound system produces some decent standard audio too. It gets loud enough to fill a room, which is important since this monitor is meant for entertainment. The audio isn't as rich and full as Apple's Studio Display, but these speakers are better than almost every other monitor I've tested.

The 32 Plus has a sharp screen, with its 3840 x 2160-pixel resolution stretched across a 32-inch panel for a pixel density of 138 pixels per inch. It also comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate that's useful for gaming, as is the lower input delay intrinsic with OLED.

But it's the image quality that really makes this stand out. Because each pixel is individually backlit, each can be individually shut off, creating the incredible contrast that typical IPS displays can't compete with. That contrast helps deliver a stunning HDR effect once you turn it on (which isn't on by default, as is the case on many OLED monitors). Games and videos do look fantastic, bringing out those deep blacks and highlights. Dell claims it can hit up to 1,000 nits of peak brightness, and I measured a high of 946 nits in a 4 percent window. That's nowhere near as bright as high-end OLED TVs in HDR, but it's enough to create a noticeable HDR effect.

The colors are extremely vibrant and crisp, too, which I verified with my Spyder colorimeter. That makes it a great display for video editors and graphic designers, especially if you're willing to calibrate your screen. That said, SDR brightness is the one issue I have with the panel quality. I measured it at just 227 nits, which could be a problem if your desk is positioned next to a window. Unlike TVs, the majority of what you do on a PC monitor isn't in HDR, so I would have liked to see it hit at least 300 nits in SDR, but that's a common problem with this generation of OLED monitors.

Until this point, OLED monitors designed for creators and video editors were thousands of dollars, like the Asus ProArt OLED PA32DC. If you're wondering how Dell managed to squeeze in all this tech for under $1,000, there's at least one compromise: ports. This is the smallest array of ports I've seen on a high-end monitor in a long time. At the back, you've got the bare minimum—HDMI for your desktop or USB-C for your laptop. There's no DisplayPort to be found. The USB-C port can do video and power up to 90 watts over one cable. You'll find one other USB-C port in the back for other accessories.

Well, almost. There's one secret port up this monitor's sleeve—a hidden forward-facing USB-C port on the left side of the display that can be popped down. This has been on other Dell monitors, and it's one of my favorite features. Reaching behind your monitor to access the ports is hugely inconvenient, especially if you need to charge your phone or insert an SD card. Still, this isn't a monitor that's designed to function as a USB hub for all your peripherals.

The Dell 32 Plus QD-OLED is one of my favorite monitors in recent memory. It's built for media first and foremost, whether that's movies or games, as well as content creation. This is the go-to option for video editors, especially if you're interested in making the transition to HDR. The image quality is as good as it gets, and the screen comes to life with HDR content. The speakers are a nice addition, too.

This isn't the right monitor for you if you're a multitasking aficionado. While it'll function fine for daily office work, it's more suited for entertainment and content creators. There's one other 4K OLED non-gaming monitor that leans into this use case even more, the Samsung M90SF, a new entry in Samsung's smart monitor line.

Your home office, though, doesn't need monitors like these. You're better off saving your money or spending it on a monitor with more multitasking features, like a KVM switch or more ports, such as the Dell UltraSharp 32 4K Thunderbolt monitor. But in my house, the Dell 32 Plus QD-OLED is the perfect monitor for our mixed-use office room. By day, it's a competent work monitor, and by night, it transforms into the ultimate entertainment display.

The Israel-linked hacker group known as Predatory Sparrow has carried out some of the most disruptive and destructive cyberattacks in history, twice disabling thousands of gas station payment systems across Iran and once even setting a steel mill in the country on fire. Now, in the midst of a new war unfolding between the two countries, they appear to be bent on burning Iran's financial system.

Predatory Sparrow, which often goes by its Farsi name, Gonjeshke Darande, in an effort to appear as a homegrown hacktivist organization, announced in a post on on its X account Wednesday that it had targeted the Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex, accusing the exchange of enabling sanctions violations and terrorist financing on behalf of the Iranian regime. According to cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic, the hackers destroyed more than $90 million in Nobitex holdings, a rare instance of hackers burning crypto assets rather than stealing them.

“These cyberattacks are the result of Nobitex being a key regime tool for financing terrorism and violating sanctions,” the hackers posted to X. “Associating with regime terror financing and sanction violation infrastructure puts your assets at risk.”

The incident follows another Predatory Sparrow attack on Iran's finance system on Wednesday, in which the same group targeted Iran's Sepah bank, claiming to have destroyed “all” the bank's data in retaliation for its associations with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and posting documents that appeared to show agreements between the bank and the Iranian military. “Caution: Associating with the regime's instruments for evading sanctions and financing its ballistic missiles and nuclear program is bad for your long-term financial health,” the hackers wrote. “Who's next?”

Sepah Bank's website was offline yesterday but appeared to be working again today. The bank didn't respond to WIRED's request for comment. Nobitex's website was offline today and the company couldn't be reached for comment.

As is often in the case in the fog of an unfolding war and its accompanying cyberattacks, what effects Predatory Sparrow's cyberattacks have had remain unclear. But Hamid Kashfi, an Iranian cybersecurity researcher living in Sweden and the founder of the cybersecurity firm DarkCell, says he has heard from contacts in Iran that Sepah's online banking and ATMs have been offline since the attacks began, causing widespread disruption to civilians' ability to access their funds. “There has been a lot of collateral damage,” Kashfi says. “It just seems to be straight up causing damage and chaos. I can't think of what other logic would be behind it. Yes, they provide services to the military. But they do for millions of regular joes and civilians as well.”

In the Nobitex attack, blockchain analysis reveals some of the details of Predatory Sparrow's sabotage: According to Elliptic, the eight-figure sum stolen from the exchange was moved to a series of crypto addresses that all started with variations on the phrase “FuckIRGCterrorists.” Those so-called “vanity” addresses typically can't be created in any way that offers control or recovery of funds held there, so Elliptic concludes that moving funds to those addresses was instead a pointed method of destroying the money. “The hackers clearly have political rather than financial motivations,” says Tom Robinson, Elliptic's cofounder. “The crypto they stole has effectively been burned.”

Elliptic also confirmed in its blog post about the attack that crypto tracing shows Nobitex does in fact have links with sanctioned IRGC operatives, Hamas, Yemen's Houthi rebels, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group. “It's also an act of sabotage, by attacking a financial institution that was pivotal in Iran's use of cryptocurrency to evade sanctions,” Robinson says.

Predatory Sparrow has long been one of the most aggressive cyberwarfare-focused groups in the world. The hackers, who are widely believed to have links to Israel's military or intelligence agencies, have for years targeted Iran with an intermittent barrage of carefully planned attacks on the country's critical infrastructure. The group has targeted Iran's railways with data-destroying attacks and twice disabled payment systems at thousands of Iranian gas stations, triggering nationwide fuel shortages. In 2022, it carried out perhaps the most physically destructive cyberattack in history, hijacking industrial control systems at the Khouzestan steel mill to cause a massive vat of molten steel to spill onto the floor, setting the plant on fire and nearly burning staff there alive, as shown in the group's own video of the attack posted to its YouTube account.

Exactly why Predatory Sparrow has now turned its attention to Iran's financial sector—whether because it sees those financial institutions as the most consequential or merely because its banks and crypto exchanges were vulnerable enough to offer a target of opportunity—remains unclear for now, says John Hultquist, chief analyst on Google's threat intelligence group and a longtime tracker of Predatory Sparrow's attacks. Almost any conflict, he notes, now includes cyberattacks from hacktivists or state-sponsored hackers. But the entry of Predatory Sparrow in particular into this war suggests there may yet be more to come, with serious consequences.

“This actor is very serious and very capable, and that's what separates them from many of the operations that we'll probably see in the coming weeks or months,” Hultquist says. “A lot of actors are going to make threats. This is one that can follow through on those threats.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Those Creatine Gummies You Bought Online Might Not Contain Any Creatine","https://www.wired.com/story/creatine-gummies-dubious-claims/","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

Gummy supplements are appealing for one obvious reason: Instead of choking down a chalky powdered drink or swallowing a dubious-smelling capsule, you essentially get to eat some candy. Unfortunately, when it comes to creatine, these products might not contain the essential ingredient they claim. Four of six popular creatine gummy products sold on Amazon contained almost no creatine or none at all when samples were tested by an independent lab.

Creatine, a staple supplement for weightlifters and fitness buffs due to its impact on athletic performance, is experiencing a remarkable surge in mainstream popularity. In recent years, the wellness industry has been marketing the substance as a kind of health panacea. Sales are skyrocketing, especially among women. To appeal to as many customers as possible, companies have launched “gummy” creatine products as an alternative to the traditional powdered format. “It's really having a moment right now,” says Jordan Glenn, head of science at the supplement industry tracking and recommendation platform SuppCo, which ordered the creatine gummy tests. “It's no longer just a gym bro supplement.”

One of the products SuppCo had tested was the highest-ranked creatine supplement on Amazon. It's made by a brand called Happyummmm and has been purchased more than 50,000 times in the past two months. (It even has an “Amazon's choice” label.) The gummy's label indicates that two gummies make up a 5-gram serving, but the lab SuppCo hired found that two gummies actually contained 0.005 grams, under 0.1 percent of what was listed. This means that someone would have to eat 2,000 Happyummmm gummies to get the listed serving size. (Happyummm's Hong Kong–based parent company Happygummi Limited does not have a public email or phone number, and WIRED was unable to contact the company for comment.) A person attempting to use Happyummm's products for a creatine “loading phase,” in which the typical daily dosage is around 20 grams, would need to eat 8,000 gummies a day to get their fill.

SuppCo's testing found that a brand called DivinusLabs' gummy samples contained only 0.025 grams per serving rather than the 5 grams indicated on the label. “We appreciate the role of independent testing in promoting transparency and have shared the information with our manufacturing and quality assurance teams. While we had not previously seen this data, we take all reports seriously,” says Ilya Sheleg, the founder from the brand's Brooklyn-based parent company Primerose Hill. Sheleg says the company plans to retest its current batch of gummies with other independent labs.

Other gummies fared even worse in tests. Two brands, Ecowise and Vidabotan, came back with 0 percent creatine. Despite these results, both brands have high ratings on Amazon. The headline for Ecowise's top review: “Tastes great and actually works!”

Like Happigummi Limited, Vidabotan does not list contact information online, so the company could not be reached for comment. When WIRED reached out to Ecowise, its founder and CEO Vladislav Shabanov promptly responded, expressing disbelief that his products tested so poorly, as his Colorado-based manufacturers have been Current Good Manufacturing Practices–certified, which means they follow guidelines set by the US Food and Drug Administration. The company also tests its products in third-party labs at regular intervals.

However, after WIRED sent Shabanov details about how SuppCo conducted its tests, he conceded that it's possible there may have been quality control issues with some of the product and says the company is launching an internal investigation and had already made a decision to switch to a different manufacturer for some products. “There's always a non-zero chance that manufacturers screwed up,” he says. “Worst-case scenario, we'll have to get the whole batch out of Amazon.”

According to Amazon spokesperson Juliana Karber, the company requires dietary supplement sellers to submit third-party testing results to prove that they contain the ingredients on the label and are free from harmful contaminants. For the four products that failed SuppCo's test, she says “three have valid test reports verifying their compliance with relevant standards and that they contain the advertised amount of creatine.” She noted that Amazon is going to do its own test of the products. “Our teams are investigating the remaining product in question, and if we conclude it does not comply with Amazon's policies, it will be removed from the store,” Karber said in a statement. Amazon declined to share which of the supplements had not proffered a valid test report.

Creating effective gummy supplements is a difficult task, since it requires distributing active ingredients evenly throughout individual gelatinous sweets. According to Shabanov, Ecowise spent months refining its processes because it was so hard to create a product that had the appropriate amount of creatine and also tasted good.

What's more, since most methods of creating gummy candies involve heat, active ingredients can get damaged in the process. “Since creatine gummies are often like other gummies, requiring moisture and heat to produce and having citric acid lowering the pH of the gummy, creatine can degrade faster than it would when just manufactured as a dry, unflavored powder,” says Kamal Patel, cofounder of the nutrient and supplement database Examine.com. Patel describes the task of making a good creatine gummy as “a lot harder” than formulating a powder product.

SuppCo also had the creatine gummies tested for levels of creatinine, a waste product created when creatine breaks down. All of the gummies that contained creatine also contained elevated amounts of creatinine, indicating that some of the active ingredients had been degraded. When the lab tested popular powdered creatine products, none had this issue.

SuppCo's test wasn't the first attempt to gauge the potency of creatine gummies. In fact, testing competing brands of gummies has become a kind of tradition in the world of supplements. Last year, the supplement manufacturer NOW Foods tested a dozen popular creatine gummies brands and reported nearly as dismal results to the SuppCo findings—5 of the 12 samples failed, showing very little or no active ingredients. Earlier this year, fitness influencer James Smith sent a sample of gummies from a company called Ovrload that he had previously attempted to invest in out for tests. (Smith claims the investment offer fell through, after which point the company allegedly continued to use his image to promote the brand.) He posted a YouTube video detailing the failed results. Another British supplement company conducted a similar third-party test and also found that Ovrload gummies failed, leading the company to pause sales. (Ovrload didn't respond to requests for comment, but the founder recently posted on Instagram that he plans to resume sales, and will add a transparency portal where users can see exactly what is in the gummies).

“Gummies might not be the best way to take creatine,” says Shabanov. “There's so much potential for human error.”

Creatine gummies aren't the only gelatinous supplement with quality control issues. While some supplement makers have successfully created gummy-style formulas that work, it's a difficult product to produce correctly. “I don't recommend taking supplements or medications in a gummy format, because the chance that the quality will be poor, though it will vary from gummy to gummy, is much greater than with capsules,” says Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who studies supplements. Cohen's previous research has examined how the “great majority” of melatonin gummies sold in the US are inaccurately labeled. In that case, the gummies were actually far more potent than the labels suggested.

In the United States, supplements are regulated very differently than traditional medications. Products can be sold without first getting any approval from the Food and Drug Administration, and the companies selling them are charged with making sure they are safe and effective. Supplements that feature new dietary ingredients need to submit a notification to the FDA prior to launching, but with something like a creatine gummy, which uses established ingredients, that isn't necessary. “FDA has no systematic way of knowing when new dietary supplements are introduced to the market or what they contain. Because of this, we are often at a disadvantage to identify unsafe or otherwise unlawful supplements,” Cara Welch, the director of the FDA's Office of Dietary Supplement Programs in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in 2024.

The loose rules have fostered an environment in which mislabeling is rampant. Many products sold as supplements actually contain pharmaceutical ingredients, including generic Viagra. While some sellers require third-party testing—CVS introduced its mandatory program in 2019—other stores and marketplaces do not.

The Trump Administration is unlikely to adopt a more critical approach to the supplements industry anytime soon. Last fall, prior to his confirmation, current Health and Human Services head Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that the administration would undo the FDA's “aggressive suppression” of supplements.

Cohen says that the best safeguard people have to buy supplements is to check to see if they've been certified by two independent nonprofit organizations, US Pharmacopeia and the NSF International, which test products for health and safety standards.

“As American consumers, right now, we have no idea if the supplement we've purchased is accurately labeled or not. Some are, many aren't. So we've got to work around this until the laws are changed,” he says.

The US Supreme Court's conservative majority on Wednesday upheld the state of Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors.

In a 6–3 decision in United States v. Skrmetti, the justices found that Tennessee's law is not unconstitutional. The central issue of the case was whether Tennessee's ban violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which states that the government cannot discriminate against individuals based on their race, gender, or other characteristics. The ruling does not affect states where gender-affirming care for youth remains legal, but establishes the precedent that states can ban this kind of treatment.

The lawsuit was brought to the court by three transgender teenagers and their parents, as well as a doctor, with the Biden administration's Department of Justice joining the plaintiffs. They argued that the Tennessee law discriminates based on sex and gender status by denying medical care to transgender youth that is available to other minors. This is the first case the Supreme Court has taken up on the issue of gender-affirming care for minors.

Gender-affirming care includes a variety of medical services meant to help align a person's body more closely with their gender identity. It can include hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and surgeries.

Tennessee enacted its law in 2023, which prohibits health care providers from prescribing medication or offering gender-affirming surgical procedures to minors whose gender identities are different from their assigned sex at birth. The law excludes procedures that address congenital defects or physical injuries, as well as gender-affirming medical care for minors whose gender identity conforms with their designated sex at birth. It means, for instance, that a cisgender boy with gynecomastia, a hormonal condition that causes enlarged male breast tissue, could receive medication or undergo surgery to remove breast tissue to conform to their gender identity, but a transgender individual could not receive the same treatment for gender dysmorphia.

Today's Supreme Court ruling, delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts, maintains that Tennessee's law is not discriminatory because it “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to any minor to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence, regardless of the minor's sex.” According to the justices, the Tennessee law does not exclude any individual from medical treatments based on their transgender status. “Rather, it removes one set of diagnoses—gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, and gender incongruence—from the range of treatable conditions,” the ruling says.

Since 2021, more than two dozen states have adopted laws or policies that prohibit or severely limit gender-affirming care for people under the age of 18. Many of those states also penalize health care practitioners for providing or offering this type of care to minors. According to the health policy nonprofit KFF, 40 percent of trans youth between the ages of 13 and 17 live in a state that has enacted a policy against gender-affirming care.

Though several states were facing legal challenges to their bans, today's Supreme Court decision means those laws will likely remain intact.

Leading medical organizations—including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the World Health Organization—support access to gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth, which they say is backed by scientific evidence. One study from 2022 surveyed nearly 12,000 transgender and nonbinary youth aged 13 to 24 and found that those who received gender-affirming hormone therapy had lower rates of depression, thoughts of suicide, and attempted suicide than those who had not received hormone therapy.

“Today's Supreme Court decision is a devastating blow to transgender youth and the families who love them,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, an organization that promotes LGBTQ+ civil rights, in a statement. “Families may now have to make the heartbreaking choice to leave their state or split their families, or take on extensive financial burdens, in order to ensure that their kids can access medically necessary care.”

Amazon-owned autonomous vehicle company Zoox has opened its first full-fledged production facility, where it expects to one day build 10,000 robotaxis per year.

The facility marks the latest step in Zoox's evolution out of the development phase. The company is currently testing vehicles in multiple U.S. cities and offering rides to employees in Las Vegas and San Francisco. Public access is expected to begin with an early-rider program in 2026.

The 220,000-square-foot factory is located in Hayward, California, near Zoox's Foster City headquarters. This is the company's second production facility in the Bay Area, adding to the assembly warehouse in nearby Fremont.

Zoox says the new factory will be used for engineering, software and hardware integration, assembly, storage, and testing. The Hayward production facility will assemble the custom-built Zoox robotaxis for multiple commercial markets, beginning with Las Vegas and then San Francisco. Zoox plans to roll out commercial robotaxi operations in Austin and Miami in the next few years.

The company says the facility's “unique layout and building equipment” will be able to adapt to different vehicle designs as its robotaxi lineup expands in the future. The facility will be operated by a mix of human workers and robots. Human workers will handle the bulk of the work, according to Zoox, which said robots will be used for specific tasks, such as applying adhesive for glass installation and transporting the robotaxi down the assembly line.

Google is rolling out the ability for users to have a back-and-forth voice conversation with AI Mode, its experimental Search feature that lets users ask complex, multi-part questions. With the new Search Live integration, users can have a free-flowing voice conversation with Search and explore links from across the web. 

Users will be able to access the feature by opening the Google app and tapping the new “Live” icon to ask their question aloud. They will then hear an AI-generated audio response, and they can follow up with another question.

Today's announcement comes a few weeks after Google rolled out AI Mode to everyone in the U.S. The launch of the feature was seen as Google's answer to popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI's ChatGPT Search. With this new update, Google is looking to take on those services' respective voice modes.

Google says the feature will be useful in instances where you're on the go or multitasking. For example, if you're packing for a trip, you can ask a question like “What are some tips for preventing a linen dress from wrinkling in a suitcase?” You could follow up with another question like “What should I do if it still wrinkles?”

As you're having the conversation, you'll find links right on your screen if you want to dig deeper into your search. 

Because Search Live works in the background, you can continue the conversation while in another app. Plus, you have the option to tap the “transcript” button to view the text response and continue to ask questions by typing if you'd like to. You can also revisit a Search Live response by navigating to your AI Mode history.

“Behind the scenes, Search Live in AI Mode uses a custom version of Gemini with advanced voice capabilities,” Liza Ma, the director of product management at Google Search, explained in a blog post. “Our custom model is built on Search's best-in-class quality and information systems, so you still get reliable, helpful responses no matter where or how you're asking your question. Search Live with voice also uses our query fan-out technique to show you a wider and more diverse set of helpful web content, enabling new opportunities for exploration.”

In the coming months, Google plans to bring more Live capabilities to AI Mode, including letting you ask questions based on what your phone's camera is seeing in real time, as was previewed at Google I/O in May.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said humanity is only years away from developing artificial general intelligence that could automate most human labor. If that's true, then humanity also deserves to understand and have a say in the people and mechanics behind such an incredible and destabilizing force. 

That is the guiding purpose behind “The OpenAI Files,” an archival project from the Midas Project and the Tech Oversight Project, two nonprofit tech watchdog organizations. The Files are a “collection of documented concerns with governance practices, leadership integrity, and organizational culture at OpenAI.” Beyond raising awareness, the goal of the Files is to propose a path forward for OpenAI and other AI leaders that focuses on responsible governance, ethical leadership, and shared benefits.

“The governance structures and leadership integrity guiding a project as important as this must reflect the magnitude and severity of the mission,” reads the website's Vision for Change. “The companies leading the race to AGI must be held to, and must hold themselves to, exceptionally high standards.”

So far, the race to dominance in AI has resulted in raw scaling — a growth-at-all-costs mindset that has led companies like OpenAI to hoover up content without consent for training purposes and build massive data centers that are causing power outages and increasing electricity costs for local consumers. The rush to commercialize has also led companies to ship products before putting in necessary safeguards, as pressure from investors to turn a profit mounts.

That investor pressure has shifted OpenAI's core structure. The OpenAI Files detail how, in its early nonprofit days, OpenAI had initially capped investor profits at a maximum of 100x so that any proceeds from achieving AGI would go to humanity. The company has since announced plans to remove that cap, admitting that it has made such changes to appease investors who made funding conditional on structural reforms. 

The Files highlight issues like OpenAI's rushed safety evaluation processes and “culture of recklessness,” as well as the potential conflicts of interest of OpenAI's board members and Altman himself. They include a list of startups that might be in Altman's own investment portfolio that also have overlapping businesses with OpenAI.

The Files also call into question Altman's integrity, which has been a topic of speculation since senior employees tried to oust him in 2023 over “deceptive and chaotic behavior.” 

 “I don't think Sam is the guy who should have the finger on the button for AGI,” Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's former chief scientist, reportedly said at the time.

The questions and solutions raised by the OpenAI Files remind us that enormous power rests in the hands of a few, with little transparency and limited oversight. The Files provide a glimpse into that black box and aim to shift the conversation from inevitability to accountability.

Pope Leo XIV is making the threat of AI to humanity a key issue of his legacy, challenging the technology industry that has spent years courting the Vatican. 

The new American pope's namesake, Leo XIII, stood up for the rights of factory workers during the Gilded Age, a period in the 19th century of swift economic change and extreme wealth inequality led by corrupt industrial robber barons.

Speaking to a hall of cardinals last month, the pope said he would rely on 2,000 years of church social teaching to “respond to another industrial revolution and to innovations in the field of artificial intelligence that pose challenges to human dignity, justice, and labor,” reports The Wall Street Journal.

In attempts to shape Rome's dialogue on AI and, by association, influence governments and policymakers, leaders of Google, Microsoft, Cisco and other tech giants have flown to the Vatican to preach the good word of emerging technologies. 

The Vatican has pushed for a binding international treaty on AI, something most tech CEOs would say threatens to stifle innovation.

Iran's largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, said Wednesday that it was hacked and funds have been drained from its hot wallet.

In a statement on its website translated by TechCrunch, Nobitex said it detected unauthorized access to its infrastructure and hot wallet, in which the company stores a portion of its customers' cryptocurrency. The company said it was investigating the incident, and that its website and app would be unavailable for the foreseeable future.

Public records show the hackers stole at least $90 million of the company's assets over multiple transactions. Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic said the hackers “burned” the stolen funds by sending the crypto to inaccessible wallets, effectively taking the money out of circulation.

Nobitex has more than 10 million customers, according to an archived copy of Nobitex's website from last week.

Pro-Israel hacking group Predatory Sparrow (also known in Farsi as “Gonjeshke Darande”) took credit for the cyberattack. In a post on X, the group said it targeted Nobitex for allegedly financing terrorism for the Iranian regime and evading international sanctions.

A day earlier, the hacking group also claimed responsibility for a hack on Iran's Bank Sepah resulting in widespread outages at ATMs across the country.

News of the cyberattacks comes as Israel and Iran attack each other's cities. It's not clear who is behind Predatory Sparrow, which first appeared in 2021, but the hacking group has targeted Iranian organizations with destructive cyberattacks in the past, and broadly appears aligned with Israeli interests. 

Iranian news outlet IRIB said Tuesday that amid the ongoing military conflict, Israel had “launched a massive cyber war against [Iran's] digital infrastructure to disrupt the process of providing services.”

U.S. President Donald Trump will issue another extension to decide the fate of TikTok, pushing it by 90 days, the White House said on Tuesday. The current extension, which was signed in April, was set to expire on Thursday, June 19.

“President Trump will sign an additional Executive Order this week to keep TikTok up and running,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News.

“As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,” she added.

In January, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law to ban TikTok, resulting in app stores and service providers pulling support for the app in the U.S. Just a few days after taking office, Trump signed an executive order to delay the ban to explore a deal with ByteDance to divest its U.S. business. On April 4, he issued another extension of 75 days to keep the short video app up and running.

An iPhone for AI would be a big mistake. Here's what we need to build instead.

When OpenAI acquired Io to create “the coolest piece of tech that the world will have ever seen,” it confirmed what industry experts have long been saying: Hardware is the new frontier for AI. AI will no longer just be an abstract thing in the cloud far away. It's coming for our homes, our rooms, our beds, our bodies. 

That should worry us.

Once again, the future of technology is being engineered in secret by a handful of people and delivered to the rest of us as a sealed, seamless, perfect device. When technology is designed in secrecy and sold to us as a black box, we are reduced to consumers. We wait for updates. We adapt to features. We don't shape the tools; they shape us. 

This is a problem. And not just for tinkerers and technologists, but for all of us.

We are living through a crisis of disempowerment. Children are more anxious than ever; the former US surgeon general described a loneliness epidemic; people are increasingly worried about AI eroding education. The beautiful devices we use have been correlated with many of these trends. Now AI—arguably the most powerful technology of our era—is moving off the screen and into physical space. 

The timing is not a coincidence. Hardware is having a renaissance. Every major tech company is investing in physical interfaces for AI. Startups are raising capital to build robots, glasses, wearables that are going to track our every move. The form factor of AI is the next battlefield. Do we really want our future mediated entirely through interfaces we can't open, code we can't see, and decisions we can't influence? 

The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next.

This moment creates an existential opening, a chance to do things differently. Because away from the self-centeredness of Silicon Valley, a quiet, grounded sense of resistance is reactivating. I'm calling it the revenge of the makers. 

In 2007, as the iPhone emerged, the maker movement was taking shape. This subculture advocates for learning-through-making in social environments like hackerspaces and libraries. DIY and open hardware enthusiasts gathered in person at Maker Faires—large events where people of all ages tinkered and shared their inventions in 3D printing, robotics, electronics, and more. Motivated by fun, self-fulfillment, and shared learning, the movement birthed companies like MakerBot, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and (my own education startup) littleBits from garages and kitchen tables. I myself wanted to challenge the notion that technology had to be intimidating or inaccessible, creating modular electronic building blocks designed to put the power of invention in the hands of everyone.

By definition, the maker movement is humble and it is consistent. Makers do not believe in the cult of individual genius; we believe in collective genius. We believe that creativity is universally distributed (not exclusively bestowed), that inventing is better together, and that we should make open products so people can observe, learn, and create—basically, the polar opposite of what Jony Ive and Sam Altman are building.

But over time, the momentum faded. The movement was dismissed by the tech and investment industry as niche and hobbyist, and starting in 2018, pressures on the hardware venture market (followed by covid) made people retreat from social spaces to spend more time behind screens. 

Now it's mounting a powerful second act, joined by a wave of AI open-source enthusiasts. This time around the stakes are higher, and we need to give it the support it never had.

In 2024 the AI leader Hugging Face developed an open-source platform for AI robots, which already has 3,500+ robot data sets and draws thousands of participants from every continent to join giant hackathons. Raspberry Pi went public on the London Stock Exchange for $700 million. After a hiatus, Maker Faire came back; the most recent one had nearly 30,000 attendees, with kinetic sculptures, flaming octopuses, and DIY robot bands, and this year there will be over 100 Maker Faires around the world. Just last week, DIY.org relaunched its app. In March, my friend Roya Mahboob, founder of the Afghan Girls Robotics Team, released a movie about the team to incredible reviews. People love the idea that making is the ultimate form of human empowerment and expression. All the while, a core set of people have continued influencing millions through maker organizations like FabLabs and Adafruit.

Studies show that hands-on creativity reduces anxiety, combats loneliness, and boosts cognitive function. The act of making grounds us, connects us to others, and reminds us that we are capable of shaping the world with our own hands. 

I'm not proposing to reject AI hardware but to reject the idea that innovation must be proprietary, elite, and closed. I'm proposing to fund and build the open alternative. That means putting our investment, time, and purchases towards robot built in community labs, AI models trained in the open, tools made transparent and hackable. That world isn't just more inclusive—it's more innovative. It's also more fun. 

This is not nostalgia. This is about fighting for the kind of future we want: A future of openness and joy, not of conformity and consumption. One where technology invites participation, not passivity. Where children grow up not just knowing how to swipe, but how to build. Where creativity is a shared endeavor, not the mythical province of lone geniuses in glass towers.

In his Io announcement video, Altman said, “We are literally on the brink of a new generation of technology that can make us our better selves.” It reminded me of the movie Mountainhead, where four tech moguls tell themselves they are saving the world while the world is burning. I don't think the iPhone made us our better selves. In fact, you've never seen me run faster than when I'm trying to snatch an iPhone out of my three-year-old's hands.

So yes, I'm watching what Sam Altman and Jony Ive will unveil. But I'm far more excited by what's happening in basements, in classrooms, on workbenches. Because the real iPhone moment isn't a new product we wait for. It's the moment you realize you can build it yourself. And best of all? You  can't doomscroll when you're holding a soldering iron.

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

From remotely-controlled smart cars to menacing Netflix messages, tech-facilitated abuse is keeping up with the times.

After Gioia had her first child with her then husband, he installed baby monitors throughout their Massachusetts home—to “watch what we were doing,” she says, while he went to work. She'd turn them off; he'd get angry. By the time their third child turned seven, Gioia and her husband had divorced, but he still found ways to monitor her behavior. One Christmas, he gave their youngest a smartwatch. Gioia showed it to a tech-savvy friend, who found that the watch had a tracking feature turned on. It could be turned off only by the watch's owner—her ex.

“What am I supposed to tell my daughter?” says Gioia, who is going by a pseudonym in this story out of safety concerns. “She's so excited but doesn't realize [it's] a monitoring device for him to see where we are.” In the end, she decided not to confiscate the watch. Instead, she told her daughter to leave it at home whenever they went out together, saying that this way it wouldn't get lost. 

Gioia says she has informed a family court of this and many other instances in which her ex has used or appeared to use technology to stalk her, but so far this hasn't helped her get full custody of her children. The court's failure to recognize these tech-facilitated tactics for maintaining power and control has left her frustrated to the point where she yearns for visible bruises. “I wish he was breaking my arms and punching me in the face,” she says, “because then people could see it.”

People I spoke with for this article described combating tech-facilitated abuse as playing “whack-a-mole.” Just as you figure out how to alert people to smartphone location sharing, enter smart cars.

This sentiment is unfortunately common among people experiencing what's become known as TFA, or tech-­facilitated abuse. Defined by the National Network to End Domestic Violence as “the use of digital tools, online platforms, or electronic devices to control, harass, monitor, or harm someone,” these often invisible or below-the-radar methods include using spyware and hidden cameras; sharing intimate images on social media without consent; logging into and draining a partner's online bank account; and using device-based location tracking, as Gioia's ex did with their daughter's smartwatch.

Because technology is so ubiquitous, TFA occurs in most cases of intimate partner violence. And those whose jobs entail protecting victims and survivors and holding abusive actors accountable struggle to get a handle on this multi­faceted problem. An Australian study from October 2024, which drew on in-depth interviews with victims and survivors of TFA, found a “considerable gap” in the understanding of TFA among frontline workers like police and victim service providers, with the result that police repeatedly dismissed TFA reports and failed to identify such incidents as examples of intimate partner violence. The study also identified a significant shortage of funding for specialists—that is, computer scientists skilled in conducting safety scans on the devices of people experiencing TFA. 

The dearth of understanding is particularly concerning because keeping up with the many faces of tech-facilitated abuse requires significant expertise and vigilance. As internet-connected cars and homes become more common and location tracking is increasingly normalized, novel opportunities are emerging to use technology to stalk and harass. In reporting this piece, I heard chilling tales of abusers who remotely locked partners in their own “smart homes,” sometimes turning up the heat for added torment. One woman who fled her abusive partner found an ominous message when she opened her Netflix account miles away: “Bitch I'm Watching You” spelled out where the names of the accounts' users should be. 

A record number of tech worker unions formed in the US last year. They're part of a global effort.

Despite the range of tactics, a 2022 survey of TFA-focused studies across a number of English-speaking countries found that the results readily map onto the Power and Control Wheel, a tool developed in Duluth, Minnesota, in the 1980s that categorizes the all-encompassing ways abusive partners exert power and control over victims: economically, emotionally, through threats, using children, and more. Michaela Rogers, the lead author of the study and a senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield in the UK, says she noted “paranoia, anxiety, depression, trauma and PTSD, low self-esteem … and self-harm” among TFA survivors in the wake of abuse that often pervaded every aspect of their lives.

This kind of abuse is taxing and tricky to resolve alone. Service providers and victim advocates strive to help, but many lack tech skills, and they can't stop tech companies from bringing products to market. Some work with those companies to help create safeguards, but there are limits to what businesses can do to hold abusive actors accountable. To establish real guardrails and dole out serious consequences, robust legal frameworks are needed. 

It's been slow work, but there have been concerted efforts to address TFA at each of these levels in the past couple of years. Some US states have passed laws against using smart car technology or location trackers such as Apple AirTags for stalking and harassment. Tech companies, including Apple and Meta, have hired people with experience in victim services to guide development of product safeguards, and advocates for victims and survivors are seeking out more specialized tech education. 

But the ever-evolving nature of technology makes it nearly impossible to create a permanent fix. People I spoke with for this article described the effort as playing “whack-a-mole.” Just as you figure out how to alert people to smartphone location sharing, enter smart cars. Outlaw AirTag stalking and a newer, more effective tool appears that can legally track your ex. That's why groups that uniquely address TFA, like the Clinic to End Tech Abuse (CETA) at Cornell Tech in New York City, are working to create permanent infrastructure. A problem that has typically been seen as a side focus for service organizations can finally get the treatment it deserves as a ubiquitous and potentially life-endangering aspect of intimate partner violence.  

CETA saw its first client seven years ago. In a small white room on Cornell Tech's Roosevelt Island campus, two computer scientists sat down with someone whose abuser had been accessing the photos on their iPhone. The person didn't know how this was happening. 

“We worked with our client for about an hour and a half,” says one of the scientists, Thomas Ristenpart, “and realized it was probably an iCloud Family Sharing issue.”

At the time, CETA was one of just two clinics in the country created to address TFA (the other being the Technology Enabled Coercive Control Clinic in Seattle), and it remains on the cutting edge of the issue. 

Picture a Venn diagram, with one circle representing computer scientists and the other service providers for domestic violence victims. It's practically two separate circles, with CETA occupying a thin overlapping slice. Tech experts are much more likely to be drawn to profitable companies or research institutions than social-work nonprofits, so it's unexpected that a couple of academic researchers identified TFA as a problem and chose to dedicate their careers to combating it. Their work has won results, but the learning curve was steep. 

CETA grew out of an interest in measuring the “internet spyware software ecosystem” exploited in intimate partner violence, says Ristenpart. He and cofounder Nicola Dell initially figured they could help by building a tool that could scan phones for intrusive software. They quickly realized that this alone wouldn't solve the problem—and could even compromise people's safety if done carelessly, since it could alert abusers that their surveillance had been detected and was actively being thwarted.

Instead, Dell and Ristenpart studied the dynamics of coercive control. They conducted about 14 focus groups with professionals who worked daily with victims and survivors. They connected with organizations like the Anti-Violence Project and New York's Family Justice Centers to get referrals. With the covid-19 pandemic, CETA went virtual and stayed that way. Its services now resemble “remote tech support,” Dell says. A handful of volunteers, many of whom work in Big Tech, receive clients' intake information and guide them through processes for stopping unwanted location sharing, for example, on their devices.

Remote support has sufficed because abusers generally aren't carrying out the type of sophisticated attack that can be foiled only by disassembling a device. “For the most part, people are using standard tools in the way that they were designed to be used,” says Dell. For example, someone might throw an AirTag into a stroller to keep track of its whereabouts (and those of the person pushing it), or act as the admin of a shared online bank account. 

Existing measures to mitigate AI risks aren't enough to protect us. Here's what we need to do as well.

Though CETA stands out as a tech-­centric service organization for survivors, anti-domestic-violence groups have been encountering and combating TFA for decades. When Cindy Southworth started her career in the domestic violence field in the 1990s, she heard of abusers doing rough location tracking using car odometers—the mileage could suggest, for instance, that a driver pretending to set out for the supermarket had instead left town to seek support. Later, when Southworth joined the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the advocacy community was looking at caller ID as “not only an incredibly powerful tool for survivors to be able to see who's calling,” she recalls, “but also potentially a risky technology, if an abuser could see.” 

As technology evolved, the ways abusers took advantage evolved too. Realizing that the advocacy community “was not up on tech,” Southworth founded the National Network to End Domestic Violence's Safety Net Project in 2000 to provide a comprehensive training curriculum on how to “harness [technology] to help victims” and hold abusers accountable when they misuse it. Today, the project offers resources on its website, like tool kits that include guidance on strategies such as creating strong passwords and security questions. “When you're in a relationship with someone,” explains director Audace Garnett, “they may know your mother's maiden name.” 

Southworth's efforts later extended to advising tech companies on how to protect users who have experienced intimate partner violence. In 2020, she joined Facebook (now Meta) as its head of women's safety. “What really drew me to Facebook was the work on intimate image abuse,” she says, noting that the company had come up with one of the first “sextortion” policies in 2012. Now she works on “reactive hashing,” which adds “digital fingerprints” to images that have been identified as nonconsensual so that survivors only need to report them once for all repeats to get blocked.

Other areas of concern include “cyberflashing,” in which someone might share, say, unwanted explicit photos. Meta has worked to prevent that on Instagram by not allowing accounts to send images, videos, or voice notes unless they follow you. Besides that, though, many of Meta's practices surrounding potential abuse appear to be more reactive than proactive. The company says it removes online threats that violate its policies against bullying and that promote “offline violence.” But earlier this year, Meta made its policies about speech on its platforms more permissive. Now users are allowed to refer to women as “household objects,” reported CNN, and to post transphobic and homophobic comments that had formerly been banned.

A key challenge is that the very same tech can be used for good or evil: A tracking function that's dangerous for someone whose partner is using it to stalk them might help someone else stay abreast of a stalker's whereabouts. When I asked sources what tech companies should be doing to mitigate technology-assisted abuse, researchers and lawyers alike tended to throw up their hands. One cited the problem of abusers using parental controls to monitor adults instead of children—tech companies won't do away with those important features for keeping children safe, and there is only so much they can do to limit how customers use or misuse them. Safety Net's Garnett said companies should design technology with safety in mind “from the get-go” but pointed out that in the case of many well-established products, it's too late for that. A couple of computer scientists pointed to Apple as a company with especially effective security measures: Its closed ecosystem can block sneaky third-party apps and alert users when they're being tracked. But these experts also acknowledged that none of these measures are foolproof. 

Over roughly the past decade, major US-based tech companies including Google, Meta, Airbnb, Apple, and Amazon have launched safety advisory boards to address this conundrum. The strategies they have implemented vary. At Uber, board members share feedback on “potential blind spots” and have influenced the development of customizable safety tools, says Liz Dank, who leads work on women's and personal safety at the company. One result of this collaboration is Uber's PIN verification feature, in which riders have to give drivers a unique number assigned by the app in order for the ride to start. This ensures that they're getting into the right car. 

Apple's approach has included detailed guidance in the form of a 140-page “Personal Safety User Guide.” Under one heading, “I want to escape or am considering leaving a relationship that doesn't feel safe,” it provides links to pages about blocking and evidence collection and “safety steps that include unwanted tracking alerts.” 

Creative abusers can bypass these sorts of precautions. Recently Elizabeth (for privacy, we're using her first name only) found an AirTag her ex had hidden inside a wheel well of her car, attached to a magnet and wrapped in duct tape. Months after the AirTag debuted, Apple had received enough reports about unwanted tracking to introduce a security measure letting users who'd been alerted that an AirTag was following them locate the device via sound. “That's why he'd wrapped it in duct tape,” says Elizabeth. “To muffle the sound.”

If tech companies can't police TFA, law enforcement should—but its responses vary. “I've seen police say to a victim, ‘You shouldn't have given him the picture,'” says Lisa Fontes, a psychologist and an expert on coercive control, about cases where intimate images are shared nonconsensually. When people have brought police hidden “nanny cams” planted by their abusers, Fontes has heard responses along the lines of “You can't prove he bought it [or] that he was actually spying on you. So there's nothing we can do.” 

Places like the Queens Family Justice Center in New York City aim to remedy these law enforcement challenges. Navigating its mazelike halls, you can't avoid bumping into a mix of attorneys, social workers, and case managers—which I did when executive director Susan Jacob showed me around after my visit to CETA. That's by design. The center, one of more than 100 throughout the US, provides multiple services for those affected by gender-based and domestic violence. As I left, I passed a police officer escorting a man in handcuffs.

CETA is in the process of moving its services here—and then to centers in the city's other four boroughs. Having tech clinics at these centers will put the techies right next to lawyers who may be prosecuting cases. It's tricky to prove the identity of people connected with anonymous forms of tech harassment like social media posts and spoofed phone calls, but the expert help could make it easier for lawyers to build cases for search warrants and protection orders.

Law enforcement's responses to allegations of tech-facilitated abuse vary. “I've seen police say to a victim, ‘You shouldn't have given him the picture.'”

Lawyers pursuing cases with tech components don't always have the legal framework to back them up. But laws in most US states do prohibit remote, covert tracking and the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, while laws relating to privacy invasion, computer crimes, and stalking might cover aspects of TFA. In December, Ohio passed a law making AirTag stalking a crime, and Florida is considering an amendment that would increase penalties for people who use tracking devices to “commit or facilitate commission of dangerous crimes.” But keeping up with evolving tech requires additional legal specificity. “Tech comes first,” explains Lindsey Song, associate program director of the Queens center's family law project. “People use it well. Abusers figure out how to misuse it. The law and policy come way, way, way later.”

California is leading the charge in legislation addressing harassment via smart vehicles. Signed into law in September 2024, Senate Bill 1394 requires connected vehicles to notify users if someone has accessed their systems remotely and provide a way for drivers to stop that access. “Many lawmakers were shocked to learn how common this problem is,” says Akilah Weber Pierson, a state senator who coauthored the bill. “Once I explained how survivors were being stalked or controlled through features designed for convenience, there was a lot of support.”

At the federal level, the Safe Con­nections Act signed into law in 2022 requires mobile service providers to honor survivors' requests to separate from abusers' plans. As of 2024, the Federal Communications Commission has been examining how to incorporate smart-car-­facilitated abuse into the act's purview. And in May, President Trump signed a bill prohibiting the online publication of sexually explicit images without consent. But there has been little progress on other fronts. The Tech Safety for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking Act would have authorized a pilot program, run by the Justice Department's Office on Violence Against Women, to create as many as 15 TFA clinics for survivors. But since its introduction in the House of Representatives in November 2023, the bill has gone nowhere.

With changes happening so slowly at the legislative level, it remains largely up to folks on the ground to protect survivors from TFA. Rahul Chatterjee, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, has taken a particularly hands-on approach. In 2021, he founded the Madison Tech Clinic after working at CETA as a graduate student. He and his team are working on a physical tool that can detect hidden cameras and other monitoring devices. The aim is to use cheap hardware like Raspberry Pis and ESP32s to keep it affordable.

Chatterjee has come across products online that purport to provide such protection, like radio frequency monitors for the impossibly low price of $20 and red-light devices claiming to detect invisible cameras. But they're “snake oil,” he says. “We test them in the lab, and they don't work.” 

Three breakthrough technologies reveal the challenges facing climate action this year.

With the Trump administration slashing academic funding, folks who run tech clinics have expressed concern about sustainability. Dell, at least, received $800,000 from the MacArthur Foundation in 2024, some of which she plans to put toward launching new CETA-like clinics. The tech clinic in Queens got some seed funding from CETA for its first year, but it is “actively seeking fundraising to continue the program,” says Jennifer Friedman, a lawyer with the nonprofit Sanctuary for Families, which is overseeing the clinic. 

While these clinics expose all sorts of malicious applications of technology, the moral of this story isn't that you should fear your tech. It's that people who aim to cause harm will take advantage of whatever new tools are available.

“[TFA] is not about the technology—it's about the abuse,” says Garnett. “With or without the technology, the harm can still happen.” Ultimately, the only way to stem gender-based and intimate partner violence is at a societal level, through thoughtful legislation, amply funded antiviolence programs, and academic research that makes clinics like CETA possible.

In the meantime, to protect themselves, survivors like Gioia make do with Band-Aid fixes. She bought her kids separate smartphones and sports gear to use at her house so her ex couldn't slip tracking devices into the equipment he'd provided. “I'm paying extra,” she says, “so stuff isn't going back and forth.” She got a new number and a new phone. 

“Believe the people that [say this is happening to them],” she says, “because it's going on, and it's rampant.”

There are occasions when it just isn't worth it to invest $200 or $300 in premium earbuds like AirPods Pro. Anker is a brand that specializes in making affordable and reliable electronic accessories, from chargers to earbuds, and their Soundcore brand is one that delivers quality audio products with consistently high reviews.

The Soundcore P30i noise-cancelling earbuds are one example with features and performance on a level with far more expensive models. Even at their standard price, the earbuds represent good value, but the current Amazon discount makes them a yet more compelling choice. Today, they are sold for only $28 which is a huge 43% saving from their normal list price of $49.

See at Amazon

One of the most innovative and creative aspects of the Bluetooth Soundcore P30i is its 2-in-1 charging case and… phone stand. This feature enables you to enjoy hands-free viewing anywhere you go. Simply open the back panel of the case, place your phone on the stand and you're ready to catch up on your favorite shows or videos.

Noise cancelling is another area where the Soundcore P30i excels: Fitted with an advanced active noise cancelling technology that can clear ambient noise of up to 42dB, these earbuds enable you to focus on your music even in noisy environments. The adaptive intelligent technology captures external sounds and automatically selects the optimal noise cancelling level for your ears and gives you a comfortable and immersive listening experience.

The Soundcore P30i gives 10 hours of playback from one charge (6 hours with ANC), and 45 hours total with the charging case (25 hours with ANC). 2 hours of listening time comes with a 10-minute quick charge, just what you need on those busy days when you're in a hurry to make a dash for it before you head out.

Now it's time to upgrade your listening experience at a record-low price.

Scoring a huge deal on Apple's top-rated AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds is a matter of timing. There's a 32% off deal that drops on Amazon which brings the price of these state of the art earbuds down to just $169, but you have to keep a sharp eye out for it. Or, better yet, we can just tell you when it's back. Like right now.

This $80 price drop on the AirPods Pro 2 hadn't been around for the past month before now, but with the exception of the small Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2024 window when the AirPods Pro 2 dropped to a record low $154, this elusive $169 deal is the lowest price on Apple's best-ever AirPods since they were released in April 2024.

See at Amazon

What's earned the AirPods Pro 2 that stellar 4.6-star rating from nearly 30,000 Amazon reviewers, and all of those professional reviews calling them Apple's best AirPods yet? Start with the new H2 chip that drives all of the many great features of the AirPods Pro 2. The state of the art H2 processor makes it all possible: the adaptive noice cancellation that intelligently detects the noise level of your surroundings, the transparency mode that lets in enough of your surroundings to keep you safe, and the vastly improved sound and call quality.

Tack on the 6-hour battery life, seamless linking with Apple's Find My with Precision Finding app to keep your AirPods Pro 2 secure, IP54-level dust, sweat, and water resistance, and the new ability to recharge with the Apple Watch charger in addition to USB-C, MagSafe, and other Qi-certified chargers, and those rave reviews make total sense.

Perhaps most impressively, the AirPods Pro 2 come with hearing health support that's a first in any mass-market earbuds. This includes a hearing test that allows you to check your hearing without a trip to the doctor's office, hearing protection for when you're in loud environments, and a clinical-grade hearing aid feature that assists people with mild to moderate hearing loss.

There's no predicting when that Amazon deal that drops the price of the AirPods Pro 2 from $249 to just $169. But when it does swing around — like right now — it's more than worth jumping on. You get the industry-leading AirPods Pro 2 with all of their upgrades and advanced features, not to mention the pristine sound and peerless performance when you're using them to take or make a phone call, and you get $80 back in your pocket.

The U.S. military recently announced that four executives from some of the top tech companies in Silicon Valley have joined the Army Reserve as direct-commissioned officers. The move is part of a push to speed up the adoption of technology in the military, but as the news outlet Task & Purpose points out, it's pretty unusual.

The Army said in a press release that the four executives are Shyam Sankar, CTO at Palantir; Andrew Bosworth, CTO at Meta; Kevin Weil, Chief Product Officer of OpenAI; and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab and former Chief Research Officer for OpenAI.

The four men are being commissioned at the high rank of lieutenant colonel as part of a program called Detachment 201: The Army's Executive Innovation Corps. As Task & Purpose notes, the men will get to skip the usual process of taking a Direct Commissioning Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, and they won't need to complete the Army Fitness Test.

The Army didn't respond to questions emailed Tuesday but said in a statement published on its website that, “Their swearing-in is just the start of a bigger mission to inspire more tech pros to serve without leaving their careers, showing the next generation how to make a difference in uniform.” Their role in the Army Reserve is to “work on targeted projects to help guide rapid and scalable tech solutions to complex problems,” as the Army puts it.

The new reservists will serve for about 120 hours a year, according to the Wall Street Journal, and will have a lot of flexibility to work remotely. They'll work on helping the Army acquire more commercial tech, though it's not clear how conflict-of-interest issues will be enforced, given the fact that the people all work for companies that would conceivably be selling their wares to the military. In theory, they won't be sharing information with their companies or “participating in projects that could provide them or their companies with financial gain,” according to the Journal.

Silicon Valley has always benefited greatly from ties to the U.S. military. Silicon Valley companies were bringing in $5 billion annually from defense contracts during the Reagan administration, something that the average person may not remember about the 1980s. But it's always been an uneasy alliance for consumer-facing tech companies, especially over recent decades.

That's all changing, according to many folks who align more with President Donald Trump, who was once considered a shameful person to represent in polite company. As Andrew Bosworth, the CTO at Meta, who is joining the Army Reserves, told the Wall Street Journal, “There's a lot of patriotism that has been under the covers that I think is coming to light in the Valley.”

Bosworth and his buddies can be a bit more open about their goals now that Trumpism has been more normalized in the president's second term. But they also run the risk of hitching their wagons—and the reputation of the companies they represent—to a president who's famous for acting recklessly. After all, this is the guy who just a couple of days ago told Tehran, a city of 10 million people, to evacuate and is heavily suggesting he's going to get the U.S. into war with Iran.

Some people may think that's a good thing, and at the very least, it might be a wise business decision for some firm like Palantir to hope for war. But OpenAI and Meta have a lot of products that depend on buy-in from the general public. And we've seen guys like Elon Musk take huge hits to their bottom lines after attaching themselves to Trumpism. And with Trump at the helm, any association with the Army is bound to be perilous in a time of war. We all saw the viral videos of Trump's parade, right?

Being part of the Anker group, eufy has quickly become a leader in value and quality when it comes to home appliances. Their robotic vacuums are especially impressive, offering excellent value for money and performance that rivals much pricier competitors. Directly competing with the likes of Ecovacs, iRobot, and Roborock, eufy consistently introduces products that are extremely capable but also much lower in price.

Right now, eufy is offering  a record-low price on its 11S Max robot vacuum which can be had for only $159, a brand new all-time low and an astonishing 43% discount off its original $279 list price. This is the perfect opportunity to say goodbye to tedious manual cleaning and bulky upright vacuums that drain your time and energy.

See at Amazon

For less than the cost of a high-end upright cleaner, you get a robot cleaner that deftly handles hard floors, medium-pile carpets and whatever else you can imagine. The eufy 11S Max is also Amazon top robot vacuum best-seller, and at this price point, it's not surprising to see why.

At a height of only 2.85 inches, it is able to pass under furniture and into crevices that other models cannot. That involves a deeper cleaning throughout your entire house without lifting up furniture or getting down on your hands and knees to reach hard spots. Quiet as a mouse but amazingly powerful, the 11S Max can be run at any time of day or night.

With a runtime of 100 minutes using a single battery, it can clean large spaces without interruption. This comes in handy for open floor plans or houses with many rooms. The BoostIQ technology of the vacuum changes suction power within 1.5 seconds automatically and provides optimal cleaning experience on any flooring. Regardless of what you have (hardwood, tiles, or medium-pile carpet), the eufy 11S Max adapts to provide you with the best results.

The eufy 11S Max features an anti-scratch tempered glass top cover which provides the device with a wonderful aesthetic appeal and also protects it from the usual wear and tear of day-to-day usage. Its infrared sensors enable it to move around objects and fall detection technology prevents it from rolling down the stairs or off the edge of a table.

Unlike some of the more premium models, it doesn't feature Wi-Fi or smartphone connectivity: All is controlled through the remote control included with it or through the controls on the device itself. Sure, that entails not being able to use your phone to tell your vacuum what to do but it also entails no tricky setup or connectivity issues to worry about.

With its price now at an all-time low, there's never been a more ideal time to purchase a robot vacuum.

AI texture decompression promises better image quality, lower resource usage

Nvidia's Blackwell architecture touts support for a raft of AI-powered ""neural rendering"" features. Among the more interesting of these is neural texture compression, or NTC. As developers pursue more realistic gaming experiences, texture sizes have also grown, creating more pressure on limited hardware resources like VRAM. An enthusiast has now demoed texture compression tech in action on both Nvidia and Intel test systems, demonstrating massive improvements in compression, a feature that will ultimately allow developers to do more with less VRAM, or to enable more features within the same GPU memory capacity.

NTC promises to greatly reduce texture sizes on disk and in memory and to improve the image quality of rendered scenes compared to the block-based texture compression techniques widely used today. It allows developers to use a small neural network optimized for each material in a scene to decompress those textures.

To enable neural rendering features like these, Nvidia, Microsoft, and other vendors have worked together to create a DirectX feature called Cooperative Vectors that gives developers fine-grained access to the matrix acceleration engines in modern Nvidia, Intel, and AMD GPUs. (Nvidia calls these Tensor Cores, Intel calls them XMX engines, and AMD calls them AI Accelerators).

NTC hasn't appeared in a shipping game yet, but the pieces are coming together. A new video from YouTuber Compusemble shows that an NTC-powered future could be a bright one. Compusemble walks us through two practical demonstrations of NTC: one from Intel and the other from Nvidia.

Intel's demo shows a walking T-Rex. The textures decompressed via NTC for this example are visibly crisper and sharper relative to those using the block compression method commonly employed today. The results from NTC look much closer to the native, uncompressed texture.

At least on Compusemble's system, which includes an RTX 5090, the average pass time required increases from 0.045ms to 0.111ms at 4K, or an increase of 2.5x. Even so, that's a tiny portion of the overall frame time.

Dramatically, NTC without Cooperative Vectors enabled requires a shocking 5.7 ms of pass time, demonstrating that Cooperative Vectors and matrix engines are essential for this technique to be practical.

Nvidia's demo shows the benefits of NTC for VRAM usage. Uncompressed, the textures for the flight helmet in this demo occupy 272 MB. Block compression reduces that to 98 MB, but NTC provides a further dramatic reduction to 11.37 MB.

As with Intel's dinosaur demo, there's a small computational cost to enabling NTC, but that tradeoff seems well worth it in exchange for the more efficient usage of fixed resources that the technique enables.

Overall, these demos show that neural texture compression could have dramatic and exciting benefits for developers and gamers, whether that's reducing VRAM pressure for a given scene or increasing the visual complexity possible within a set amount of resources. We hope developers begin taking advantage of this technique soon.

Spectrum internet went down across L.A. thanks to vandals who didn't even find any copper


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Many households across Los Angeles were left without internet on Father's Day, after some would-be thieves attempted to strip copper from fiber optic cables. Internet provider Spectrum told The LA Times that cut lines in Van Nuys affected swaths of homes in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with the total number of affected residents unknown.

Internet customers, primarily concentrated northwest of Los Angeles proper near Burbank, were left waiting for service to return from midnight on Sunday morning until well into Monday morning, when repairs were completed. Spectrum reports that work crews needed to make thousands of splices to the fiber connections to restore service, a time-intensive process. Fusion splicing entire sheaths of fiber wire, done wire-by-wire, required calling out extra crews to the vandalism location.

In a bitter twist, the wire-slicers also didn't receive anything for their labor, as Spectrum's fiber-optic lines do not contain copper. After reportedly climbing trees and slicing into multiple lengths of wire looking for copper, the thieves were left fruitless. Those who committed the ""criminal act of vandalism"" have yet to be located by authorities.

The lack of copper does not mean the wires were not highly expensive, however. A Spectrum spokesperson shared that not just Spectrum, but the entire communications industry is experiencing increased repair expenses, ""largely due to the increase in the price of precious metals. These acts of vandalism are not only a crime, but also affect our customers, local businesses, and potentially emergency services.”

The LA incident follows a nationwide uptick in would-be copper thieves chopping into fiber-optic and communications cables. While most phone lines still contain copper, fiber-optics are typically free of it, but take longer to repair, leaving some places with slower response times without internet for weeks post-fiber-vandalism.

Spectrum has pledged to credit customers in LA for the length of time they were without service. As precious metals increase in price, global tech markets are all beginning to feel the heat, with China recently increasing its rare earth exports to capitalize on high demand. And while we wait for truly wireless internet connections to homes, outages due to uneducated copper hunters may continue to increase.

HDR needs to be embraced 'from day one, not as an afterthought,' seems like sage advice.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Mario Kart World on the Switch 2 is guilty of implementing ‘fake HDR,' according to recent heated reactions by a number of TechTubers. We are well aware of social media rage farming, but a coolly considered, in-depth new technical blog by Alexander Mejia, agrees that Mario Kart World was developed using “an SDR-first content pipeline with a last-minute HDR tonemap that limits the color and dynamic range.” Mejia is probably one of the leading authorities on creating HDR visual experiences, based on his experience in delivering “the world-leading Dolby Vision HDR experience to Xbox Series X and Unreal Engine.”

In fairness, the developers of Mario Kart World have set themselves up for this stinging criticism, as the flagship launch title is marketed with boasts of it supporting 4K resolution at 60FPS refresh with HDR visuals (4K60 HDR for short). However, “Mario Kart World reveals that even the highest caliber of developers aren't taking HDR seriously,” reckons Mejia.

That tripping up over HDR isn't uncommon, though. Rather, Mejia admits that “If you're finding it tricky to make your game's HDR look right, you're not alone.” The most important thing to do, to make the most of the HDR capabilities present in most TVs and monitors sold in the 2020s, is “embracing HDR from day one, not as an afterthought,” suggests the HDR pipeline consulting expert.

If you are curious about how Mejia captured, reviewed, and assessed the Mario Kart World on Switch 2, he shares the full details of his hardware and capture path, the procedure, and tips for home users wishing to achieve similar insight.

Moving on to the findings, the HDR expert's images, charts, and stats make the HDR quality deficiencies in Mario Kart World glaringly obvious. A particularly stark result comes from image brightness peak measurement. “Nintendo's own test image peaks at only ~500 nits even if you set 10,000 nits peak brightness,” noted Mejia. “Not a good sign that they took HDR seriously.”

Also, it was observed that, even if the console brightness is cranked to 10,000 nits, “captured peaks in game never exceed ~950 nits.” That's quite a discrepancy. It is also quite a shame, given the game art's colorful and bright style being chained to an SDR-like color space (likely Rec.709), making no use of the extended color gamut afforded by the Rec.2020 standard.

Above: Both Godfall Ultimate Edition on XBOX Series X (left), and Mario Kart World on Nintendo Switch 2 (right) are captured in HDR, with 10,000 nits max brightness.

To conclude, Mejia repeats the sentiment from some of the tastiest quotes we have included above. In short, it looks like even the best developers are not taking HDR seriously, seem to follow an SDR-first workflow, and are thus squandering the possibilities of modern consoles and TVs (or monitors).

The HDR expert finishes up by cannily touting his studio consultancy, offering help with “HDR first rendering pipelines, Dolby Vision integration, and dynamic tone-mapping strategies.” Keep that in mind as you ponder his findings.

This project shattered our expectations.

Researchers from the Lincoln Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are showing the world that there are still plenty of new innovations to come in the world of 3D printing. We've reviewed really fun 3D printers like the Cocoa Press that 3D prints chocolate, but this is the first time we've seen anyone 3D print with glass.

When making things out of glass the usual way (sans 3D printer), there's a need for extremely high temperatures to not only shape the glass but also anneal the final creation. The thought of parsing hot material like molten glass through a machine sounds unreasonable to manage, and that's because it is. That's why the team at MIT developed a new technique that allows the team to produce glass structures at a much lower temperature.

According to the MIT team, their new technique makes it possible to print things out of glass that would otherwise be impossible to create using traditional means. They hope that the new development makes it easier for people to manufacture a wide variety of glass devices, giving examples like high-temperature electronic components and microfluidic systems.

The team refers to the glass-based filament as an inorganic composite glass, while the overall process is known as low-temperature additive manufacturing. This material apparently resolves stability concerns found in other filaments while still allowing for flexibility when it comes to structural versatility.

This inorganic composite glass is made of inorganic materials, with nanoparticles and silicate solution confirmed by the team as part of those materials. Once the glass filament has been printed, it's placed in an oil bath where the temperature is then raised to 250°C. An organic solvent is then used to clean any residue from the print.

We don't expect to see glass filament on the shelves anytime soon, but it's exciting to know this possibility is out there and being actively pursued. In the meantime, we'll stick to what we know best—3D printers that print plastic and chocolate.

How much is company culture worth?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta has been attempting to lure its staff to work at its AI division with absolutely outrageous compensation. He claimed during a YouTube interview at Uncapped with Jack Altman, who is his brother, that the social media giant is offering $100M signing bonuses to some senior technical people, with even greater annual compensation. This shows how big a bet Meta has placed on AI, and how much it is willing to pour into the project to get a leg up on the competition.

The brothers were talking about Meta's recent acquisition of Scale AI, which happened about a week ago. “I've heard that Meta thinks of us as their biggest competitor, and it is rational for them to keep trying. Their current AI efforts have not worked as well as they've hoped, and I respect being aggressive and continuing to try new things,” Sam said when asked about Meta's move.

“They started making these giant offers to a lot of people on our team, like $100 million signing bonuses, more than that comp per year. I'm really happy that, at least so far, that none of our best people have decided to take them up on that. I think that people sort of look at the two paths and say, ‘Alright, OpenAI's got a really good shot — a much better shot, actually — delivering on [AI] superintelligence and also may eventually be the more valuable company.”

As many companies have continued investing billions of dollars in AI hardware over the past few years, they have probably realized that they need equally expensive talent to run them. There have been previous reports that Meta has been losing AI staff despite paying them $2 million annually, with many jumping ship to its rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic. If Altman's claims are correct, it may be that Meta has noticed this and has decided to up the ante and pay so much more for senior AI engineers to join its effort.

Sam criticized Meta, saying that the degree it focuses on the compensation — not the work or the mission — will not set up a great culture. Because of this, he says people would rather stay at OpenAI, despite the massive amounts of money that Meta is throwing towards its people. “I hope that we can be the best place in the world to do this kind of research. I think we build a special culture for it, and I think that we're set up suck that if we succeed at that, and a lot of people on research team believe we will or we have a good chance at it, then everybody will do great, financially,” said Altman. “I think it's incentive aligned with mission first, and then economic rewards, and everything else flowing from that.”

OpenAI's people not jumping ship to Meta despite the massive packages it offers makes sense, though. After all, if you're already making more than enough to support your lifestyle and then some, you really don't need the extra money in exchange for the risk you're taking by moving to a different company, especially one that seemingly lags what your current organization has already achieved.

Besides, OpenAI and its people are confident that it will be among the first ones, if not the first one, to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), and then AI superintelligence (ASI), which could make it and its people a lot of money — so much more than what Meta can offer. However, Anthropic CEO Darius Amodei has an opposing view about AI development — if the government and society are unprepared, its widespread use can cause unemployment rates to jump to 20% and wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","New study shows how exercise protects the brain from Alzheimer's disease","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/study-how-exercise-protects-brain-alzheimers-disease-aging","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 10:36:45 GMT","

Researchers estimate that about 32 million people globally live with Alzheimer's disease — a type of dementia that affects a person's ability to think, communicate, and remember. 

While there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, past studies show that certain lifestyle changes may help decrease a person's risk for the disease or slow down its progression. 

One of these main lifestyle changes is physical activity. A study published in April 2025 reported that increasing physical activity in middle age may help protect the brain from Alzheimer's disease. A study published in May 2025 says older adults who sit less may lower their risk for the condition. 

Now, a new study recently published in the journal Nature Neuroscience sheds light on how physical activity helps protect the brain from Alzheimer's disease on a cellular level. 

Scientists believe these findings may one day lead to new prevention and treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease. 

For this study, researchers used a technique called single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). 

“Single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is a technique that allows (us to) analyze gene activity by examining the RNA inside on a cell by cell level, giving us precise information about the activation state of each and every single cell in the tissue examined,” Christiane D. Wrann, DVM, PhD, a neuroscientist and leader of the Program in Neuroprotection in Exercise at the Mass General Brigham Heart and Vascular Institute and the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital, and senior author of this study, explained to Medical News Today. 

“We used this sophisticated technology to examine how exercise reshapes [the] brain in an important region in the brain of mouse models for Alzheimer's disease,” Wrann added. 

Scientists focused on the hippocampus of the brain, which is responsible for making new memories and keeping old ones, as well as processing emotions and learning new information. 

Using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease — that were later verified in human Alzheimer's disease brain tissue samples — researchers found that exercise changed activity in the hippocampus' immune cells called microglia, as well as a specific type of neurovascular-associated astrocyte (NVA).

NVAs are cells associated with the brain's blood vessels that help make sure the brain receives enough oxygen and is an important part of the blood-brain barrier. 

“[Our findings mean] that exercise can remodel these important cell types on the transcriptional/gene expression level, which likely increases their neuroprotective properties. “It [is] one example, how on the molecular level exercise can improve brain cells in Alzheimer's disease, hopefully rendering them more functionally.” — Christiane D. Wrann, DVM, PhD

Additionally, Wrann and her team pinpointed a metabolic gene called ATPIF1 as an important regulator to create new neurons in the brain.

“ATPIF1 is a mitochondrial protein that regulates cellular energy production AKA — a gene that regulates energy metabolism,” Wrann detailed. “Research has shown that stimulating neurogenesis can protect against cognitive decline in aging or Alzheimer's disease. In our study, we show that ATPIF1 is an important regulator of neurogenesis.”

“Exercise is important for your brain health — please keep exercising to protect your brain,” she continued. “Alzheimer's disease is incurable at the moment. There are smart and dedicated scientists working on finding innovative treatment options.” 

“This work not only sheds light on how exercise benefits the brain but also uncovers potential cell-specific targets for future Alzheimer's therapies,” Nathan Tucker, PhD, a biostatistician at SUNY Upstate Medical University and co-senior of the study said in a press release. “Our study offers a valuable resource for the scientific community investigating Alzheimer's prevention and treatment.”

MNT also had the opportunity to speak with Gary Small, MD, chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this study. 

Small commented that this study's findings are consistent with the well-documented link between physical activity and brain health, including its role in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's and of slowing its progression in people who already suffer from the disease. 

“While the basic conclusion that exercise is important to brain health is not new, these new findings showing the impact of physical activity on key brain cells such as microglia and neurovascular-associated astrocytes provide a more nuanced and deeper understanding why the brain responds to exercise,” he explained. 

“Astrocytes and microglia play a crucial role in both initiating and regulating the inflammatory response. Thus, these results further elucidate the link between heightened brain inflammation and cognitive decline,” he said. 

“Brain health has a strong influence on our quality of life. Cognitive decline affects not just the physical and behavioral health of the patient, but also has an impact on their caregivers and all who care about the person. The bottom line is that dementia and Alzheimer's disease are not inevitable parts of aging. We can take steps to reduce the risk through lifestyle habits. And even for those who develop the disease, making changes in diet, physical activity, and stress management can slow the progression and extend the time when a person can enjoy a fulfilling quality of life.” — Gary Small, MD

“The more we understand how cognitive decline occurs, and what can change the course of its development and progression, the more opportunities there are to find ways to treat it,” Small added.

More than 50% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) experienced flare and nearly 50% had persistently active disease, whereas some had persistently active disease without flare. Both conditions were linked to a greater risk for organ damage accrual.

“The high frequency of PAD [persistently active disease] and its negative impact on patient outcomes make a compelling case for its use as a clinically meaningful endpoint,” the authors of the study wrote. “Our predictive models may help identify patients at high risk of flare or PAD to target for more stringent follow-up and assist in selecting high-risk patients for clinical trials.”

This study was led by Yanjie Hao, MD, University of Melbourne and St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, both in Melbourne, Australia, and Peking University First Hospital in Beijing, China. It was published online on February 26, 2025, in ACR Open Rheumatology.

The SLEDAI-2000 score used to define persistently active disease may have omitted several clinical manifestations while potentially overestimating its frequency. The findings suggested an association and not causation. The use of rituximab and belimumab was limited, and information on the use of anifrolumab and ciclosporin was lacking.

The Asia Pacific Lupus Collaboration received grants from several sources, including AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly.

Two other authors reported receiving grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council.

Exposure to acid-suppressive medications or antimicrobials in infancy was linked to higher risks for food allergies and anaphylaxis in early childhood, with the risks increasing further with multiple antimicrobial prescriptions.

“The composition of the gut microbiota is strongly associated with allergic manifestations, as the commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract promote healthy development of the gut immune system with promotion of food tolerance,” the study authors wrote. “Antibiotic exposure disrupts these microbial communities, which in turn affects individuals' immune response and likely increases their susceptibility for allergic manifestations,” they added.

Mohamad R. Chaaban, with the Head & Neck Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on May 30 in the Journal of Clinical Medicine.

The misdiagnosis of infant food allergies as gastroesophageal reflux disease and higher acid-suppressive medication use in more severe cases may have confounded the associations between these medications and food allergy.

A flat 0° head positioning before thrombectomy was associated with a significantly less risk for early neurologic deterioration and all-cause mortality than a conventional 30° head elevation in adults with large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke, a new study showed.

“Results suggest that patients awaiting thrombectomy treatment for LVO stroke should be positioned with the head at 0° to ensure clinical stability and prevent worsening,” the investigators wrote.

“We posit that 0° head positioning is a bridging maneuver to thrombectomy, protecting ischemic tissue and possibly reducing infarct progression before definitive treatment,” they added.

This study was led by Anne W. Alexandrov, PhD, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee. It was published online on June 04 in JAMA Neurology.

This study was limited by its small sample size and early termination, the lack of blinding to head position, and the exclusion of data on thrombectomy decisions. Additionally, patients transferred between facilities were excluded, which may have affected the 3-month outcomes.

COMMENTARY

 June 18, 2025  

A major new review on the diagnosis and treatment of uveitis, led by researchers at the University of Bristol, UK, has been published in JAMA. The review provides comprehensive guidance to help clinicians address this leading cause of vision loss, a condition which the authors said is often detected too late to prevent irreversible damage. 

Medscape News UK spoke with first author Panayiotis Maghsoudlou, PhD, National Institute for Health and Care Research academic clinical lecturer in ophthalmology at Bristol Medical School.

How does your review differ from information already in the literature?

In this JAMA review, we set out to create a rigorous, evidence-based, and clinically useful summary that speaks directly to a broad range of healthcare professionals. Unlike standard narrative reviews, JAMA articles are developed through close editorial collaboration with authors to ensure maximum clinical utility across specialties — in this case, from GPs identifying red flags, to emergency physicians triaging acute cases, to rheumatologists managing systemic disease. 

JAMA applies a strict evidence hierarchy, so we relied exclusively on high-level data such as randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses, and cohort studies, avoiding anecdote or personal opinion. We also developed diagnostic algorithms, referral pathways, and summary tables to help clinicians rapidly extract actionable information at the point of care. Our aim was to produce a clear, practical, and highly cited resource that supports informed decision-making in busy clinical settings.

Despite being a leading cause of preventable blindness, uveitis remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Why has this situation developed?

We believe this gap stems from several factors. Uveitis can present subtly, with nonspecific symptoms like eye redness, photophobia, or floaters that are easily missed or attributed to more common conditions. It also has multiple subtypes, each with different causes, presentations, and management strategies — making early recognition challenging, especially in general practice. 

Crucially, the hallmark clinical sign — cells floating in the anterior chamber of the eye — can only be detected on slit-lamp examination, which requires specialist assessment. Furthermore, public and professional awareness remains low, and there is no unified diagnostic or referral pathway in many healthcare systems. As a result, patients often present late. Our review aims to close this gap by offering clear, evidence-based guidance to support earlier diagnosis and tailored treatment.

How prevalent is the condition in the UK? 

Population-based data indicate that anterior uveitis constitutes roughly 50%-70% of all cases in the UK, with an overall prevalence estimated between 25 and 50 per 100,000 adults. Most affected individuals fall into the 20- to 50-year age bracket.

The UK is a high-prevalence region for birdshot uveitis, a rare autoimmune type of uveitis linked to the HLA-A*29 antigen. UK incidence is estimated at 0.035 cases per 100,000 person-years.

Your review says up to half of cases of uveitis are idiopathic and a high proportion of the rest are associated with systemic disease. What other causes might present?

Referral patterns have shifted over the last decade. We have seen decreases in Fuchs uveitis, Behçet uveitis, and ocular toxoplasmosis. There have been significant increases reported for syphilis and tuberculosis, reflecting increased population-level infections. Also increasing are rates of herpetic retinitis, vitreoretinal lymphoma, and sarcoidosis.

How much do you expect advances in treatment, such as biologic agents, to make a difference in the coming years?

We expect biologics to have a transformative impact, particularly for patients with noninfectious, sight-threatening, or refractory uveitis. Agents like adalimumab already have strong evidence for reducing treatment failure and preserving vision, while avoiding the long-term complications of systemic steroids. 

However, the key challenge is securing funding to run dedicated uveitis trials, which are essential for regulators to approve these therapies with a formal indication. At present, we too often rely on rheumatology-led access to biologics, which limits availability for ophthalmic use. This patchwork approach also means ophthalmologists may be less familiar with these drugs, and patients face more hoops to jump through for approval. Generating robust, indication-specific data is the next step to improving access and outcomes.

What are your key take-home points for ophthalmologists?

Tailor treatment to anatomical location. Recognise that anterior uveitis may respond to topical drops, but posterior or pan-uveitis demands prompt systemic immunosuppression to preserve vision. If conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; eg, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil) fail, escalate without delay to biologics (eg, adalimumab) to prevent irreversible damage.

Engage specialist support early. For recurrent, chronic, or refractory cases, collaborate promptly with tertiary uveitis centres or rheumatology teams. Rheumatology colleagues or uveitis centres usually have dedicated nursing staff experienced in counselling patients and monitoring blood tests — crucial for safe initiation and ongoing management of immunosuppressive therapy. Early multidisciplinary involvement can prevent delays that might jeopardise vision.

Emphasise pattern recognition and second opinions. Uveitis comprises a multitude of phenotypes; if a patient's inflammation fails to respond as expected, seek a second or even third expert opinion. Persistent or atypical presentations may reflect a ""masquerade"" syndrome — most notably primary vitreoretinal lymphoma — rather than straightforward immune-mediated uveitis. A high index of suspicion and timely investigation (for instance, vitreous biopsy or advanced imaging) are vital when the clinical course is unusual.

Think systemically, treat holistically. Always consider underlying systemic associations — ankylosing spondylitis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, and inflammatory bowel disease, among others — and liaise with the appropriate specialists (rheumatologists, gastroenterologists, or infectious disease experts) for comprehensive care. Systemic evaluation is as important as ocular management.

Communicate clearly with patients. Explain that uveitis may be chronic or relapsing and that long-term follow-up is often necessary. Discuss the balance between treatment benefits and potential side effects, emphasising adherence to both medication and monitoring schedules.

What are your key take-home points for GPs, and what key clues as to the type (anterior, posterior, etc.) or cause (idiopathic-, infectious-, rheumatologic-associated) should they have on their radar?

Differentiate by presentation: 

Be alert to systemic clues. Enquire about joint pains, back stiffness, or skin rashes (hinting at HLA-B27–associated disease or psoriasis/ankylosing spondylitis), mouth/genital ulcers (Behçet), respiratory symptoms (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis), travel or sexual history (syphilis, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis), and neurologic symptoms (intermediate uveitis often precedes a diagnosis of MS). A history of lymphoma or malignancy raises suspicion of a masquerade syndrome.

Timely referral matters. All suspected uveitis cases should be referred to ophthalmology within 24-48 hours — faster if vision is threatened. Delays allow complications such as macular oedema or glaucomatous optic neuropathy to become irreversible.

What might be a GP's referral threshold, and how urgent is this in the absence of vision loss/signs of sepsis?

Uveitis without vision loss is still a same/next-day ophthalmology referral. The absence of vision loss doesn't reduce urgency; it may just mean you're catching it early enough to prevent permanent damage. When in doubt, refer urgently. A 24-hour delay can mean the difference between full recovery and lifelong vision problems. 

Patients with visual symptoms and systemic illness (eg, fever, hypotension) should be referred to the emergency department for evaluation and treatment due to the risk of vision-threatening endophthalmitis and potentially life-threatening sepsis.

How common is resulting vision loss/sepsis and what is the prognosis overall?

In larger cohort studies, vision loss occurs in 10%-20% of uveitis patients, with markedly higher rates in intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis compared with anterior disease. Early adoption of DMARDs and biologic therapies is likely reducing these vision loss rates, but definitive long-term data demonstrating improved visual outcomes are not yet available. 

Delayed diagnosis remains a critical modifiable risk factor. Patients with chronic inflammation face compounded risk through complications (eg, glaucoma, cystoid macular oedema) that can progressively compromise visual function. As cohorts treated with contemporary immunosuppressive protocols from disease onset mature, clearer evidence of visual preservation should emerge over the coming decade.

Are patients vulnerable to repeat episodes in the absence of underlying disease?

Yes, even in the absence of an identified underlying systemic or infectious cause, patients with idiopathic uveitis (which accounts for up to 50% of cases) can still experience recurrent episodes. A large cohort study reported a 38.1% recurrence rate in the ipsilateral eye and a 15.2% recurrence rate in the contralateral eye over 10 years, with an overall recurrence risk of about 49.5% in either eye during the study period. 

This underscores the need for patient education on recognising key symptoms — such as eye pain, redness, photophobia, new floaters, or blurred vision — and the importance of ongoing follow-up, even when symptoms resolve between episodes.

How long should monitoring go on for, and how often?

There is no internationally agreed consensus on monitoring intervals for adults with uveitis, and follow-up is typically ophthalmology-led, based on disease type, severity, and underlying cause.

Anterior uveitis often requires less frequent monitoring once stable.

Posterior uveitis, particularly when sight-threatening or associated with syndromic conditions like Behçet disease or Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, needs more frequent and sustained follow-up, often monthly or even more regularly during active phases.

Uveitis has many underlying causes — from autoimmune conditions (eg, sarcoidosis, HLA-B27-related disease) to infections (eg, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis) — and this heterogeneity makes standardising monitoring difficult. Long-term review is essential to detect recurrences, complications, or treatment-related adverse effects.

What is your most important message for healthcare professionals?

Early systemic immunosuppression has been shown to preserve vision in many cases of noninfectious uveitis. Even so, approximately 1 in 5 patients will still experience significant vision loss despite modern DMARD- and biologic-based regimens. 

Initiating systemic therapy before irreversible damage (such as macular scarring or glaucomatous optic neuropathy) occurs is paramount.

A fecal metabolic dysbiosis score (MDS) predicted 30-day mortality in critically ill patients and may help identify fecal metabolites as a potential treatable trait to improve survival in these patients.

“Fecal metabolic dysbiosis, determined by quantitation of 13 fecal metabolites, is independently associated with 30-day mortality after MICU admission in our cohort,” the study authors wrote. “Therefore, fecal metabolic dysbiosis represents a potentially treatable trait to improve survival in heterogeneous critically ill patients,” and the MDS may serve as a biomarker to identify patients who might benefit from such treatment.

The study was led by Alexander P. de Porto, PhD, University of Chicago, Chicago, and was published online in Science Advances.

The study had limitations. Patients were recruited at a single tertiary academic center and needed respiratory support or a vasopressor, and thus, the results might not be representative of the entire medical ICU population. Also, patients who did not produce a fecal sample or gave a sample that was not analyzable for metagenomics and metabolomics were excluded.

The study was funded by the Duchossois Family Institute. de Porto was funded by the Niels Stensen Fellowship. The Center for Research Informatics is funded by the Biological Sciences Division at the University of Chicago, with additional funding provided by the Institute for Translational Medicine and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). One co-author was funded by the NIH/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

The initiation of tiotropium monotherapy was associated with, at most, a modest increase in dementia risk among older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with long-acting beta 2-agonist combined with inhaled corticosteroid (LABA-ICS) over a long-term follow-up, although the clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain.

“On balance, this evidence does not provide a compelling argument that patients with COPD should avoid tiotropium due to concerns about cognitive decline,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Che-Yuan Wu, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was published online on May 19, 2025, in JAMA Internal Medicine.

This study was potentially confounded by unmeasured factors such as smoking, dyspnea, peripheral biomarkers, spirometry measures, and other anticholinergic drugs. The assumption that the LABA-ICS comparator had no effect on the risk for dementia might not be true. The data for midlife medication dispensing and dementia biomarkers were unavailable.

Simultaneous exposure to ozone pollution and high temperatures significantly increases the risk for acute myocardial infarction (MI) among adults in the US, according to a recent study published in Circulation.

The findings highlight the dangers of joint environmental stressors even at moderate levels and the importance of timely patient counseling.

Using nationwide private insurance claims data from 2016 to 2020, researchers from Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut, and collaborators identified 270,123 cases of acute MI in people aged 18-64 years. They found joint exposure to ground-level ozone (60 ppb) and high temperatures — roughly 90-95 °F — increased the risk for an MI by 33% compared to cooler, low-ozone days. Even under moderate conditions, such as an ozone count of 50 ppb and typical temperatures around 70 °F, the risk increased by 15%.

“The lag 0f effect means clinicians need to pay close attention to high-pollution and hot days in real time,” said Lingzhi Chu, PhD, a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the Yale School of Public Health and colead author of the study “Clinicians should emphasize to younger patients that moderate levels still pose risks” to cardiovascular health.

Mary Johnson, PhD, a principal research scientist of environmental health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, said the findings bring much-needed attention to a younger demographic.

“This study is important because it focuses on a younger age group that is often overlooked in cardiovascular research,” said Johnson, who was not involved in the study. “Typically, you don't think about heart attacks happening in people in the young adult category.” 

Johnson also noted the value of examining heat and ozone together.

“We've seen studies showing impacts from temperature and from ozone individually,” she said, “but looking at them together, and especially looking at differences between men and women, is important.”

According to the study, women showed increased vulnerability on days with both high ozone and temperatures around 90-95 degrees, while men experienced heightened risk even when only one factor was elevated. The difference in exposure-response patterns by sex was statistically significant (P = .016).

Chu said clinicians should tailor counseling based on patient demographics.

“The sex difference that males are vulnerable to mild exposures is critical,” Chu said. “Young men need targeted proactive counselling.” 

While the researchers did not assess comorbidities like hypertension or diabetes, Chu acknowledged these conditions could affect risk.

“The potential pathophysiology suggests hypertension, diabetes, or obesity may compound risks, but further research is warranted,” Chu said.

Johnson said these findings should challenge assumptions in primary care because these clinicians often are the first to encounter patients of the age group studied.

“Just because you're young and healthy does not necessarily rule out the risk of a cardiac event,” she said. “Especially if there's a combination of poor air quality and elevated temperature.”

Acute MI is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, with approximately 800,000 cases annually in the US. Adults younger than 55 years, and particularly women, account for a growing share of acute MIs.

Chu recommended several practical prevention strategies clinicians can share with patients: Adjusting the timing of outdoor activities, staying hydrated, and using cooling methods such as fans or air conditioning.

She also acknowledged the challenge clinicians face in educating patients without overwhelming them.

“Clinicians may consider framing mitigation as simple behavior changes rather than drastic life changes to prevent patient overwhelm,” she said. “Some of these simple changes — like checking air quality apps, closing windows on high-ozone days, or staying hydrated — support overall health, not just cardiovascular health.”

Johnson agreed.

“While we can't individually control wildfires or ozone formation, everyone can be aware of ozone levels and temperature before going outside or doing anything physically strenuous,” she said.

The study relied on data from individuals with private insurance, a limitation both Chu and Johnson acknowledged.

“That population has access to care,” Johnson said. “But what about the uninsured or underinsured? They may be more at risk because they often live in areas with worse air quality and lack resources to adapt, like access to cooling systems or healthcare.”

She added that events like sudden cardiac death may be underreported in uninsured populations.

“They don't go to the emergency room. They die before they get there,” Johnson said. “So the real risk may actually be higher than what this study captured.”

Johnson said the findings also highlight a critical shift in how clinicians should view environmental risk.

“It's accurate to say we can no longer think about air pollution and environmental risks as being linked only to chronic conditions,” said Johnson. “There are acute consequences, too, and this study illustrates that clearly.”

A study published last month in the journal Epidemiology found prolonged exposure to the particulate matter in wildfire smoke was associated with small increases in the risk for several cardiovascular diseases, especially hypertension.

As climate change drives more frequent heat waves and worsens air quality, both Chu and Johnson said clinicians are on the front lines of patient education and prevention.

“Clinicians are key players in translating environmental health research into actionable prevention,” Chu said. “This study reinforces the need to think beyond traditional risk factors.”

Chu and Johnson reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

 June 18, 2025  

Every gym in America is awash in neon. The rainbow array of sports drinks promises to transform weekend warriors into athletic dynamos.

For decades, these beverages have occupied a curious space in American consumer culture, somewhere between medicine and marketing, between science and snake oil. Now comes a study showing sports drinks might improve athletic performance. Sort of.

Researchers from Peking University in Beijing, China, recently presented a poster at the American Society for Nutrition (ASN) 2025 Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida, from what appears to be a rigorous experiment: 23 trained adults who consumed a multi-ingredient sports drink performed 15% better during high-intensity exercise than when they drank a placebo beverage.

The drink contained a blend of macronutrients and micronutrients: Sugar for immediate energy, taurine and lysine as amino acids, inositol for cellular function, caffeine as a stimulant, and niacin and vitamins B6 and B12 to help metabolize food into energy.

The patients experienced less fatigue, maintained higher energy levels, and showed improved metabolic markers that suggested their bodies were preserving muscle protein during exercise, according to the researchers.

“I wouldn't say the findings are shocking or excitingly novel,” said Andrew Jagim, PhD, director of Sports Medicine Research at Mayo Clinic Health System, in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The participants were already trained athletes performing structured, 100-minute exercise sessions, a far cry from the typical American's relationship with physical activity. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, adults should spend at least 150 min/wk doing aerobic exercise, but only two thirds of Americans meet this guideline.

This disconnect between laboratory conditions and real life gets to the heart of what Stella Volpe, PhD, MS, head of the Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Virginia, calls the fundamental question: “For the average person who might be exercising 30 minutes a day, likely they don't need something like this. Likely they are fine with just water.”

Jose Antonio, PhD, MS, the CEO of the International Society of Sports Nutrition and professor of health and human performance at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, concurs. “Traditionally, sports drinks have been shown for decades to improve performance, reduce fatigue, etc.,” Antonio said. “It often depends on what the ingredients are. We already know caffeine is effective. The most important components of this sports drink are, of course, the fluid itself, but [also] the sugar and caffeine. The rest of it has a minor effect.”

Sports drinks can be dense in calories. A 16-oz bottle of AMP Energy, for example, is 220 calories per serving compared with 155 for a 12-oz serving of Coca-Cola. For Jagim, the question becomes one of benefits and costs: “Are those extra calories in that drink really worth what they're chasing in terms of just burning more calories during the workout?”

“When I train or race, I focus on two things [in a sports drink]: Sugar and caffeine,” he added. “The rest is ok, but for most, it doesn't matter. Don't trip over dollars to pick up pennies.”

But a psychological dimension complicates the purely nutritional calculus. Volpe, a professional athlete on the USA Masters field hockey team, said she will “hydrate better if I drink more.”

Consuming a beverage that tastes better than water can improve overall fluid intake. If a sports drink gets someone to stay properly hydrated during exercise, as long as they do not have diabetes or are trying to lose weight, the modest caloric cost might be worth paying. “I'd say go for it,” she said.

Jagim and Antonio agree valuable future research would be testing different treatment groups using different versions of the same drink. “Then you'd be able to answer that question of which ingredient is the more important one here,” Jagim said. “Is it the carbohydrate or the caffeine? Or is it truly, when we combine them, we get that synergistic benefit, where they collectively help each other make you feel better and perform better?”

Antonio, Jagim, and Volpe reported having no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

 June 18, 2025  

Pre-workout supplements are gaining popularity in Brazil because of their promising effects, including increased focus, energy, endurance, enhanced performance, and reduced muscle fatigue. A growing number of brands are now available in specialty stores, pharmacies, and supermarkets.

However, with so many options in the market, are consumers aware of the risks and product components, and do these products benefit physical performance?

Typically sold in powdered soluble form, but also available as capsules, gummies, gels, or ready-to-drink liquids, pre-workout supplements combine various substances, such as caffeine, beta-alanine, arginine, taurine, and creatine, with formulas that vary by brand.

“Pre-workout [supplements] usually have a combination of multiple elements, such as vitamins, proteins and amino acids, but only a very small portion actually have any effect with proven scientific evidence on sports performance,” said Cristiano Barcellos, PhD, director of the Department of Sports and Exercise Endocrinology at the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism.

Metabolic effects vary depending on the dosage of each component. Barcellos identified four substances with “robust evidence” supporting their benefits in physical activity:

In addition to the aforementioned substances, a wide variety of others are also present in pre-workout supplements. These include citrulline, malate, arginine, taurine, tyrosine, branched-chain amino acids, and other adaptogens. Although they may produce the desired effects, current evidence supporting their impact on performance remains weak to moderate. Further studies are required to understand their mechanisms and effectiveness.

Without understanding these components, individuals may take pre-workout supplements designed for short, high-intensity workouts but engage in prolonged aerobic activities, such as long-distance running or soccer. In such cases, in addition to a possible worsening of performance, there is a risk for unexpected adverse effects.

“There are reports of cases that require hospitalization and, occasionally, even result in death. The person ends up being exposed only to the side effects of these substances, so I personally do not recommend the use of these ready-made combinations,” said Barcellos. “Qualified professionals, such as nutritionists or sports physicians, should advise using only the necessary components individually,” he concluded.

Caffeine, one of the most common components in pre-workout supplements and proven to be effective as a stimulant and improve focus, is also among the most concerning. Some ready-made products exceed the recommended limit of 200 mg and contain up to 1 g of caffeine, posing a major health risk to consumers.

Given the wide variability in dosages, inconsistent formulations, and often a lack of transparency in product labels, Luiz Eduardo Ritt, MD, PhD, president of the Department of Ergometry, Exercise, Nuclear Cardiology, and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation at the Brazilian Society of Cardiology, also advises against the use of ready-made blends.

“There is a large variation in the individual response to each pre-workout [supplement], with reports of patients who developed arrhythmias when making a more strenuous effort, both atrial and ventricular, the latter being more severe and with the potential to progress to cardiac arrest,” he said.

Ritt emphasized a particular concern when caffeine is used in combination with hormones or antidepressants, which can increase the risk for arrhythmias.

“The mechanism involved is often related not only to increased adrenergic tone, which makes the heart more susceptible to arrhythmias, but also to the widening of the QT interval, a factor directly related to the occurrence of malignant arrhythmias, such as ventricular arrhythmias,” he explained.

Beta-alanine, another common component of pre-workout supplements, raises concerns due to paresthesia, a side effect that causes tingling sensations in the extremities. Although this effect is common, it is not typically harmful.

“This effect is still being studied. We do not know exactly why this occurs, but we know that beta-alanine can bind to a neurologic receptor in the skin that is associated with the transmission of painful impulses to the brain, causing tingling. This is a temporary and self-limiting effect, with no apparent severity,” Barcellos explained.

The National Health Surveillance Agency in Brazil (ANVISA) delayed the approval of beta-alanine due to several factors and only authorized its use in November 2020 after pressure from the sports sector. 

Until then, access was limited to imported products or compounded formulations, although this substance has been used internationally.

A detailed review by the International Society of Sports Nutrition confirmed the ergogenic effects of beta-alanine, particularly in short, high-intensity workouts, and established a recommended dosage and favorable safety profile.

Pre-workout supplement use should be personalized. “It is necessary to analyze which product is being used, in what dose, individual sensitivity, and whether there is concomitant use with any other substance. The risks accumulate with each of these variables,” Ritt stated.

A basic electrocardiogram can help detect cardiac rhythm abnormalities and elevated cardiovascular risk. “We assess for signs of hypertrophy, ventricular dysfunction, impaired contractility, valvular abnormalities, or insufficiencies. Combined with a thorough medical history and physical examination, these findings help identify higher-risk individuals,” he said.

All supplements and physical activities should be accompanied by a balanced diet. Natural foods have beneficial metabolic effects on humans.

“Nitrate is one of the most natural and effective compounds found in many vegetables, such as beetroot. It favors long-lasting activity by stimulating nitric oxide production in the arteries. There is no need to rely on powdered supplements if beetroot juice can provide the same effect,” said Barcellos, noting that nitrate is the only natural product with a proven effect on individual performance.

Other natural products may have ergogenic properties without the need for commercial pre-workout supplements. These include coffee and guarana powder, which act as stimulants, and cinnamon and ginger, which are potentially beneficial for improving physical performance.

“Some vitamins and teas commonly used in nutrition also combine compounds with ergogenic potential. However, the effect varies from person to person, and excessive use can be risky, particularly because of possible liver toxicity,” Ritt noted. “Natural does not mean harmless. Each factor must be carefully considered.”

He also emphasized the importance of hydration in this regard. “If physical exercise is intense, in conditions of high heat and humidity, and there is no adequate hydration, disorders may arise that lead to changes in sodium levels and hypernatremia. An excessive increase in body temperature can also lead to sudden illness, resulting from the combination of all these factors.”

A recent study from Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, and Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, found that the artificial sweetener neotame is present in many popular disposable electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) sold in the US, regardless of whether they contain nicotine. Neotame is several times sweeter than sugar or aspartame, and some products in European Union markets also contain it.

Although the additive is considered safe in food, reliable data on its inhalation are lacking, which is a critical knowledge gap, given its prevalence in e-cigarettes.

A spokesperson for the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment told Medscape Medical News, “The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has not yet addressed neotame in its assessments of e-cigarettes and has no information on its prevalence in e-cigarettes on the German market.”

Manufacturers of tobacco and nicotine products have always relied on flavours to enhance the taste of their products and to appeal to young consumers. Sweet, fruity, and cooling additives are widely used in e-cigarettes. They not only enhance the appeal but also raise the likelihood of trials. Despite their key role, sweeteners in these products remain unregulated in both the US and Europe.

Recently, neotame has received particular attention due to its unique properties. This chemical substance is 7000-13,000 times sweeter than table sugar and 35-65 times sweeter than aspartame. E-cigarette manufacturers prioritise neotame for its intense sweetness and thermal stability. It is used particularly in fruity or menthol-like “cooling” flavours to intensify the taste and create a pleasant vaping experience. One example is the Cherry Lemonade flavour offered by the brand Tauro Vape.

The researchers investigated which e-cigarettes available in the American market contained neotame. Their focus included the most commonly used disposable products, nicotine-free e-cigarettes, devices with synthetic nicotine analogues such as 6-methyl nicotine, and products either approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA; eg, Vuse and NJOY) or submitted for approval (eg, JUUL). In most cases, neotame was not listed in the outer packaging.

A total of 73 e-cigarettes sold in the US were analysed to check for the presence of neotame. These included 11 popular disposable brands, 4 nicotine-free products, 2 with synthetic nicotine analogues such as 6-methyl nicotine, all FDA-approved cartridge systems (eg, Vuse and NJOY), and two products purchased in 2021. Most packaging did not list neotame. For comparison, the team assessed a commercially available mint candy.

Scientists dissolved e-liquids in methanol or water and measured the neotame using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, gas chromatography was used to detect nicotine, menthol, and synthetic cooling agents similar to menthol but without its typical taste, such as WS-3 and WS-23.

Neotame was detected in 57 of the 73 e-cigarette samples (78%). The average concentration was 1.75 µg/mg of liquid, which is approximately 4.6 times higher than the neotame concentration in a strongly flavoured mint candy used as a comparison product. Neotame was found in all tested disposable products, all nicotine-free e-cigarettes, and all devices containing the nicotine analogue 6-methyl nicotine. In contrast, neotame was not detected in any of the FDA-approved cartridges, such as those from Vuse, NJOY, or any JUUL device.

Two of the four e-cigarettes purchased in 2021 suggested that neotame has been increasingly established in e-cigarettes for several years. Devices with 6-methyl nicotine showed particularly high levels (average 2.69 µg/mg, range up to 18.3 µg/mg).

The study indicated that neotame is deliberately used to optimise flavour, thus making e-cigarettes more appealing to adolescents and young adults. Previous research has shown that sweetening and cooling additives, such as sucralose or menthol, can significantly enhance the appeal and addictive potential of e-cigarettes.

However, some crucial questions remain. “We don't even know exactly how much of the neotame in the liquids ends up in the aerosol of an e-cig,” said Hanno C. Erythropel, PhD, lead author and research scientist at the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Yale University. “And how much of that neotame actually reaches the sweet taste receptors to produce a sweet sensation? These are complex questions influenced by the type of e-cigarette, the power output of the device, the design of the device, and the user's puffing behaviour — to name just a few factors.”

Heat during evaporation could produce chemical degradation products whose effects on the lungs, immune system, or central nervous system have not yet been studied. The relative heat stability of neotame compared with that of other sweeteners likely explains its use by manufacturers and poses a potential risk to consumers.

In light of these findings, researchers have advocated the stricter control of sweetening additives in e-cigarettes. Disposable products, popular among youth and often containing high-potency sweeteners such as neotame, are of particular concern. From a scientific perspective, this is concerning, as even nicotine-free versions could have a significant addictive potential due to their appealing taste.

Therefore, researchers urge comprehensive studies on the toxicological effects and abuse potential of these substances. Only on this basis can a decision be made as to whether neotames should be more strictly regulated or banned in the future.

A new study from The University of Texas at Arlington reveals that people who live in rural areas are more likely to have chronic pain than those in urban settings. They're also more likely to go from having no pain or occasional pain to chronic pain. The findings may help explain higher opioid prescription rates in rural communities and could guide future research into the root causes of this disparity.

""We already know about the rural-urban gap in mortality and life expectancy,"" said Feinuo Sun, UT Arlington assistant professor of kinesiology and lead author of the study in The Journal of Rural Health. ""But when you look at pain, especially chronic pain, it becomes clear that rural residents face additional burdens.""

Chronic pain has been previously linked to higher risks of disability and mortality and contributes to increased health care costs-an estimated $261 billion and $300 billion annually in the U.S. One key takeaway from Dr. Sun's study is the importance of timely intervention for middle-aged adults in rural communities as they are among the most vulnerable to developing chronic pain.

Without early intervention, it can have serious long-term consequences, including premature mortality. That's why targeted outreach and early pain management strategies are so important.""

Feinuo Sun, UT Arlington assistant professor of kinesiology and lead author of the study

In her research, Sun, who has expertise in demography and population health, uses national data and a spatial analysis approach-a way of mapping how factors like health care services, job types and regional economic conditions shape health outcomes depending on where people live. In a 2024 study she authored, she found that rural residents expect to live more years with chronic pain than suburban and urban residents.

Sun's latest findings suggest the chronic pain disparities are not solely due to limited access to health care in rural communities. Rural residents are more likely to work physically demanding jobs and experience higher poverty rates, both of which contribute to chronic pain. Elevated pain levels, along with fewer treatment options, may help explain the heavier reliance on opioids in these communities.

Sun's research seeks to distinguish the root causes for higher opioid demand in rural areas.

""The goal for future research is to understand the causes of these disparities and to examine how differences in pain treatment between rural and urban areas contribute to the overall pain gap,"" she said.

A new genetic study shows that just one extra cup of instant coffee a day could significantly increase your risk of developing dry AMD, shedding fresh light on how our daily beverage choices may shape long-term eye health.

Study: Genetic Correlation and Mendelian Randomization Analyses Support Causal Relationships Between Instant Coffee and Age-Related Macular Degeneration. Image Credit: RPA Studio / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Food Science & Nutrition, researchers utilized an extensive genomic dataset comprising more than 500,000 individuals, along with advanced genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses, to investigate the causal associations between coffee consumption and the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Study findings revealed a statistically significant genetic causal association between instant coffee intake and the subsequent risk of dry AMD. In contrast, ground coffee and decaffeinated coffee demonstrated no such associations, highlighting that based on this research, adverse coffee-AMD links appear to be exclusive to instant coffee. The study found that each standard deviation increase in instant coffee consumption corresponded to a substantially increased risk of the disease.

Genetic correlation was exclusive to instant coffee. Only instant coffee showed statistically significant genetic overlap with dry AMD (rg=0.07, p<0.05), while total, decaf, and ground coffee showed no such link.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an ocular disease characterized by damage to the macula, resulting in blurry vision that progressively deteriorates. AMD is the leading cause of vision loss among older people worldwide, estimated to impact 8.7% of adults (196 million cases in 2020). As the global population ages, AMD prevalence is expected to surge in the coming decades (~240 million cases by 2040).

While recent genetic research has identified several correlations between individual genotypes (susceptibility genes) and AMD development, the disease's underlying mechanisms and modifiable risk factors (health behaviors like diet and physical activity) remain comparatively understudied. While dietary supplements and clinical interventions (e.g., laser treatment) can slow AMD progression, the condition is irreversible, underscoring the need for prevention-focused research and policy.

While only a handful of epidemiological studies have investigated the role of coffee, one of the world's most popular beverages, in the pathology of AMD, they report mixed and sometimes conflicting results. Most of these investigations are cohort studies and are therefore vulnerable to biases (e.g., reverse causation, confounding factors), which limits their clinical reliability. Furthermore, none of these studies have differentiated between coffee subtypes (decaffeinated, ground, or instant).

Processing byproducts may activate harmful pathways. The paper specifically implicates advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in instant coffee that bind to retinal cells, potentially triggering inflammation and oxidative stress.

Biobank & Finngen) in tandem with genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to establish causal associations between different forms of coffee consumption and subsequently AMD risk.

Coffee consumption data were obtained from the UK Biobank GWAS summary statistics, including type (total coffee, n = 105,037; decaffeinated, n = 62,072; ground, n = 72,276; or instant, n = 180,764) and amount of coffee intake. AMD data were obtained from the Finngen GWAS dataset, including wet AMD (case = 5,890, control = 300,152) and dry AMD (case = 7,589, control = 298,486). The study's Mendelian Randomization approach used genetic variants as a proxy for coffee intake, a method that inherently minimizes the influence of traditional confounding factors like diet and lifestyle. This approach relies on key assumptions, including that the selected genetic variants influence AMD only through their effect on coffee consumption and not through other biological pathways (a concept known as pleiotropy), for which the researchers conducted sensitivity tests.

The study design and analyses adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology using Mendelian Randomization (STROBE-MR) guidelines and comprised the following:

First, linkage-disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) analyses were used to quantify whether genetic variants associated with subtype-specific coffee intake also correlate with AMD risk. Second, two-sample univariable Mendelian randomization (UVMR) models were used to assess causality using GWAS-derived single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Finally, Bayesian colocalization analysis was used to identify shared genetic variants between subtype-specific coffee consumption and AMD risk.

Colocalization revealed no shared DNA variants. Despite the causal link, researchers found zero genetic regions simultaneously influencing both instant coffee consumption and AMD development.

Genetic correlation (LDSC) analyses revealed a significant overlap between the genetic predisposition to instant coffee intake and the subsequent risk of dry AMD, suggesting shared DNA signals between the two traits across the human genome. In contrast, other subtypes of coffee consumption showed no such correlation. Furthermore, no association was observed between coffee intake and the risk of wet AMD.

UVMR analyses confirmed these findings and established a causal link. Specifically, each standard deviation increase in instant coffee consumption was associated with a 7.92-fold increased risk of dry AMD (Odds Ratio [OR] = 7.92; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.79 to 35.15; p = 0.006).  After statistical correction for multiple comparisons, the finding remained significant (adjusted p = 0.048). Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to support the robustness of these results.

Colocalization analysis did not detect any shared genetic variants or genome regions between coffee intake and AMD incidence. These findings suggest that processing byproducts, additives, or chemical alterations resulting from dehydration and reconstitution methods unique to instant coffee may contribute to the risk of dry AMD. The paper suggests that instant coffee can contain acrylamide, oxidized lipids, and other compounds not present in fresh brews.

The present study establishes a statistically significant causal genetic association between the consumption of instant coffee and the risk of dry AMD, though the precise magnitude of this risk has a wide margin of uncertainty, as indicated by the broad confidence interval. While the study datasets were derived from a predominantly European cohort, thereby limiting their global generalizability, the causal nature of the observed results prevents their dismissal due to dietary confounds.

Study results suggest that patients with early-stage AMD and individuals with a genetic predisposition to AMD might consider reducing their intake of instant coffee, opting instead for fresh brews. Clinicians and public health policymakers should weigh this evidence when advising patients about the potential drawbacks of highly processed foods like instant coffee.

In a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, a group of researchers investigated the relationship between a composite Lifestyle Risk Factor Index (LSRI) and the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a multi-ethnic population.

Every 1 in 10 adults globally is living with diabetes, and by 2045, over 780 million people are expected to be affected, and more than 90% will have T2DM. Both genetics and modifiable lifestyle factors, such as smoking, physical activity, unhealthy diet, and alcohol, influence T2DM. T2DM is associated with various complications, such as chronic kidney disease, eye damage, peripheral neuropathy (causing amputation of lower extremity), and significantly higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as blindness and limb amputations.

Studies show that combining these behaviors into a lifestyle index may better predict disease risk than evaluating them individually. However, previous studies focused on short follow-up periods. The substantial economic impact of T2DM, through both direct medical expenses and indirect costs such as reduced work capacity and life expectancy, underscores the need for effective prevention. Hence, further research is needed to understand how combined lifestyle behaviors influence T2DM risk across diverse populations over time.

The present prospective cohort study utilized data from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), which included 215,903 adults aged 45-75 years from Hawaii and California, representing five ethnic groups: African American, Native Hawaiian, Latino, Japanese American, and European American. After excluding participants with incomplete data, those with T2DM at baseline, and ethnicities outside the five main groups, 165,383 individuals remained for analysis.

Researchers used a baseline questionnaire to collect data on demographics, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and dietary habits. Ethnicity assignment was based on a priority ranking when mixed ancestry was reported. It should be noted that data on lifestyle factors were collected at baseline and not updated for changes over time.

T2DM cases were identified via self-reported diagnoses, medication usage, and Medicare claims data up to 2016. The primary exposure was the LSRI, a composite score (0-4) that awarded one point for each of the following: not currently smoking, engaging in ≥150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per week, consuming less than 2 (men) or 1 (women) alcoholic drinks per day, and adhering to at least 3 of 7 cardiometabolic dietary recommendations.

These seven dietary recommendations included: ≥3 servings per day of fruits, ≥3 servings per day of vegetables, ≥3 servings per day of whole grains, ≥2 servings per week of fish, ≤1.5 servings per day of refined grains (with only 3% of participants meeting this guideline), ≤1 serving per week of processed meat (24%), and ≤1.5 servings per week of non-processed red meat (with only 6% adherence).

Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for age, education, and BMI. Subgroup analyses were conducted by sex and ethnicity to explore variations in T2DM risk associations.



Adherence to LSRI components and dietary recommendations (%) by ethnic group. Adherence by ethnic group: (a) LSRI components and (b) dietary recommendations in percent (%) 1≥3 of 7 foods, no current smoking, ≤ 2 (men) or ≤ 1 (women) alcoholic drinks/day, ≥ 150 min/week physical activity 2Servings: ≥3 per day of fruits, ≥ 3 per day of vegetables, ≥ 3 per day of whole grains, ≥ 2 per week of fish, ≤ 1.5 per day of refined grains, ≤ 1 per week of processed meat, and ≤ 1.5 per week of non-processed red meat

Over a mean follow-up of 17.2 years, 44,518 participants (27%) developed incident T2DM. The largest ethnic group was Japanese American (29%), followed by European American (27%), Latino (22%), African American (16%), and Native Hawaiian (7%). The average LSRI score was 2.73, with most participants scoring 2 or 3 points.

Although only 22% of participants met dietary adherence guidelines, adherence was highest among moderate alcohol consumers (86%), followed by those who were no current smokers (84%) and those meeting physical activity recommendations (81%).

Adherence to most individual dietary components was very low, with the exception of fish intake. For reference, only 3% of participants met the recommendation for refined grains, and just 6% for non-processed red meat, with intermediate adherence for fruits (24%), vegetables (22%), and processed meats (24%), and highest adherence for fish (73%).

The incidence of T2DM was inversely associated with LSRI scores. Participants scoring 4 points had a 16% lower risk of T2DM compared to those scoring 0-1 (HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.80-0.88), even after adjusting for BMI. Every increase in 1-point, LSRI was associated with a 6% reduced risk of developing T2DM (HR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.93-0.95).

Among individual components, no current smoking and adequate physical activity showed strong inverse associations with T2DM in all models, while moderate alcohol consumption was surprisingly linked to a 19% increased risk. It is important to note that the “moderate alcohol” group (≤1 drink per day for women, ≤2 for men) also included abstainers.

Dietary adherence, although low, was weakly associated with a reduced risk of T2DM in models excluding BMI, but not in BMI-adjusted models. Sensitivity analyses using an LSRI composed only of smoking and physical activity yielded similar or slightly stronger inverse associations with T2DM, indicating that these two factors were the primary drivers of the composite index.

When examined across different ethnic groups, higher LSRI scores significantly correlated with lower type 2 diabetes risk among African Americans (27% reduction for highest versus lowest LSRI), Latinos (18%), and European Americans (14%). However, no significant association was found among Japanese Americans or Native Hawaiians after BMI adjustment. Physical activity adherence was notably lower among Latinos and African Americans, while dietary adherence was generally poor across all groups, with only fish consumption exceeding 50%.

BMI had a stronger association with T2DM risk than LSRI. Participants categorized as obese (BMI over 30 kg/m²) were over three times more likely to develop T2DM compared to those with a normal weight. The effect of BMI also varied across ethnic groups, being especially pronounced in Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians, possibly due to differences in visceral fat distribution.

To summarize, this study highlights the value of combining modifiable lifestyle behaviors such as non-smoking, physical activity, moderate alcohol consumption, and a healthy diet into a composite LSRI to assess T2DM risk. A higher LSRI score was linked to significantly lower T2DM incidence, particularly among African American, Latino, and European American groups. However, not all lifestyle factors had equal influence, and BMI played a stronger role in predicting diabetes risk.

The LSRI was not associated with T2DM risk in Japanese Americans or Native Hawaiians after BMI adjustment, underscoring the importance of considering physiological differences, such as visceral fat distribution, in T2DM development in these groups.

A key limitation is that the LSRI assumes equal weighting of each component, which may not accurately reflect their true importance for T2DM risk, and lifestyle was only assessed at baseline rather than over time. These findings suggest the need for culturally tailored public health strategies that promote sustainable lifestyle improvements while also addressing obesity to effectively reduce Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) across diverse populations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Combination therapy may improve health outcomes in adolescents with type 1 diabetes","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250617/Combination-therapy-may-improve-health-outcomes-in-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes.aspx","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 02:37:00 GMT","

A clinical trial involving adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has found a combination therapy may reduce chronic kidney disease and improve health outcomes. The findings could help guide more precision care for young people with T1D. 

Led by Dr. Farid Mahmud, Associate Scientist in the Translational Medicine program and Staff Physician in the Division of Endocrinology, at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and published in Nature Medicine, the study evaluated a therapy that combines standard insulin treatment with the investigational drug dapagliflozin. Results of this combination therapy showed improved blood sugar control and kidney function, and reduced weight gain in adolescents with T1D. 

T1D is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar levels. While most people with T1D are diagnosed as adults, the condition often starts in childhood and early adolescence. 

T1D requires insulin therapy throughout a person's life, which can lead to side effects such as weight gain and chronic kidney disease. In the trial, participants who received dapagliflozin alongside insulin had fewer of these side effects and better overall health outcomes. 

Our findings showed that adolescents who received this combination therapy were able to improve many symptoms typically associated with insulin-managed type one diabetes. This could inform a new early intervention strategy for the growing population of teenagers with type one diabetes."" 

Dr. Farid Mahmud, Associate Scientist in the Translational Medicine program and Staff Physician, Division of Endocrinology, SickKids

While previous research has shown similar results in adults, Mahmud's team focused on designing a clinical trial specifically for teenagers, a group often underrepresented in clinical trials. Hormonal changes, psychological development, and the shared responsibility between teens and their parents for managing treatment protocols can make trial participation more complex for this age group. 

To address these challenges, the research team worked closely with patient partner Lynne McArthur. Together, they enrolled 98 participants between 12 and 18 years old in the study, known as the ATTEMPT study, across three sites. 

McArthur's involvement in research began when one of her twin sons was diagnosed with T1D following a trip to the SickKids emergency department at just 18 months old. A few years later, his twin was also diagnosed. That experience led McArthur to become more involved in research efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment options for families like hers. 

Now that her sons are older, McArthur continues to be involved as a patient advisor. She reviews recruitment materials and provides feedback on trial design, helping ensure the research stays connected to the lived experience of people managing T1D. 

""Participating in research, whether in a trial or as an advisor, is hugely rewarding. With my experience as trial participant, I can see how the plans on paper would impact the real lives of people living with diabetes,"" explains McArthur. 

The trial provides a valuable foundation for future research into precision medicine for children and adolescents with T1D. One of those opportunities is the Empowering diVERse Youth with diabetes thrOugh precisioN mEdicine, or 'EVERYONE', study, which builds on this approach by focusing on how individual factors influence treatment response. 

Aligned with Precision Child Health, a movement to individualize care for patients and families at SickKids, the EVERYONE study will explore how a youth's unique characteristics such as their insulin sensitivity, immune response, metabolism, genetics and social health impact how they respond to insulin treatment. By understanding these differences between patients, the team hopes to one day inform tailored treatments to optimize outcomes for youth with T1D. 

""This is opening exciting new treatment opportunities for youth with type one diabetes,"" says Mahmud, who is also an Associate Professor in the Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Medical Science at the University of Toronto. ""We're giving them options that are grounded in science and designed to help them thrive throughout their lives."" 

This study was funded by Breakthrough T1D (formerly known as Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, JDRF) and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Strategies for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Aquatic therapy eases back pain and boosts mental health","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250617/Aquatic-therapy-eases-back-pain-and-boosts-mental-health.aspx","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 02:48:00 GMT","

A new Concordia study suggests that aquatic therapy for individuals with chronic low back pain can do more than strengthen the muscles around the spine. It can also have a beneficial impact on the negative psychological factors that are often associated with the disabling disease.

The study used a randomized controlled trial involving two groups of chronic low back pain patients. It found that participants who took part in aquatic therapy reported improvements in pain-related fear and sleep disturbance compared to those who followed standard care programs.

The authors believe that this study shows preliminary evidence that links aquatic therapy with improved psychological outcomes for individuals with low back pain. Their findings were published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports.

""Getting into water makes people feel better right away, because it takes away loading on the spine,"" says corresponding author Maryse Fortin, an associate professor in the Department of Health, Kinesiology and Applied Physiology.

""This made aquatic therapy an interesting medium to study people who have pain-related fear like kinesiophobia (the fear of movement stemming from a fear of pain or injury) and pain catastrophizing, and how those relate to spinal musculature.""

The study looked at two groups of 17 participants (34 total) with chronic low back pain. They were randomly assigned to either an aquatic exercise program or to a standard treatment program for low back pain. Both were supervised by graduate students who are also certified athletic therapists, at Concordia's SwimEx pool or the School of Health Athletic Therapy Centre.

Participants attended two sessions weekly for 10 weeks where they engaged either in a standard treatment (which included land-based exercises) or in a standardized aquatic therapy strengthening program focusing on exercises targeting the torso and hips. They also completed questionnaires about pain, disability, quality of life, pain-related fears, depression, anxiety and sleep quality.

All participants completed their questionnaires and underwent strength tests and MRI scanning before their first session and again after the last one following the 10-week program.

The aquatic therapy group showed significant increase in muscle size in the multifidus and the erector spinae in the upper spine, two sets of spinal muscles that are crucial to spinal stabilization. However, the increases were not noted in the lower lumbar spine, which is most subject to muscle fatty intrusions and degradation and is considered the most problematic area for people with low back pain.

Both the aquatic and standard care groups showed marked improvements in mean and maximum lumbar strength.

Combined with the reduction in anxiety, pain-based fears and sleep disturbances, these make for really interesting findings, and we definitely need to look at that relationship more closely. The changes were clinically significant, not just statistically significant, meaning they have a true impact on how the participants feel.""

The study's lead author is Brent Rosenstein, PhD 25. Co-authors include Chanelle Montpetit, Nicolas Vaillancourt, Geoffrey Dover, Christina Weiss, Lee Ann Papula and Antonys Melek.

The study received support from the Fonds de recherche du Québec - Santé and from the R. Howard Webster Foundation.

CAR-T therapy has been transformative for patients with hematological malignancies who failed numerous prior treatments. However, conventional CAR-T therapies have not yet been as successful at treating patients with solid tumors. This challenge is what Calibr-Skaggs' switchable CAR-T cell therapy platform was designed to address.

The sCAR-T platform developed by Calibr-Skaggs is designed to enhance the precision and safety of CAR-T therapies, and has demonstrated promising preliminary results in a phase 1 clinical trial for hematological malignancies. Additionally, initial results have demonstrated CLBR001 sCAR-T cells can expand in the body in significantly greater numbers than conventional CAR-T cells, affording a better chance of penetrating the hostile solid tumor microenvironment. And the switch offers an added advantage by allowing the cells to ""rest,"" potentially avoiding CAR-T exhaustion.

There's a critical need to develop gene and cell therapy approaches that are able to recreate the success observed in blood cancers for patients with solid tumors like breast cancer. By integrating an antibody-based 'switch,' there's the potential to enhance the precision of targeting solid tumor cells, while also mitigating potential safety risks.""

Travis Young, PhD, vice president of biology at Calibr-Skaggs

The clinical trial testing CLBR001 + ABBV-461 is now underway in the US. CLBR001 + ABBV-461 is being developed in collaboration with AbbVie.

Could your diet help control IBD flares? New Dutch research uncovers the hidden food compounds that may tip the balance between remission and relapse.

Study: Food Compounds Associated With Disease Activity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Image Credit: Food Photo Master / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, researchers in the Netherlands identified food compounds linked to disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Food is vital in health and disease, including IBD. However, there is no consistent evidence that a well-defined diet can modulate the disease course in IBD. The commonalities among the most studied diets include avoiding processed and canned foods and promoting the intake of vegetables, fruits, chicken, and lean meat.

Nevertheless, the diverse nutritional recommendations and approaches about specific foods make comparing studies difficult. For instance, the Mediterranean and Groningen anti-inflammatory diets encourage wheat intake, whereas most IBD diets exclude wheat. Studies on IBD and diet have primarily assessed food groups or select nutrients.

While these studies have been valuable, food contains a large number of different compounds. Each compound is unique and may have specific health effects alone or in combination with others. As such, research on food compounds offers more comprehensive insights into the effects of individual food compounds or their combinations.

In the present study, researchers evaluated whether specific food compounds and their combinations are associated with disease activity in IBD patients. They obtained dietary and disease status data from patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease at a university medical center in the Netherlands. Patients were stratified into the flare or remission group based on whether they experienced flares or remained in remission during follow-up, respectively.

Flares were defined as active IBD-related hospitalization or surgery, step-up in medication, or endoscopy revealing active disease. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) adapted for individuals with IBD was administered at baseline. The authors previously linked two food compounds databases (Phenol-Explorer and FooDB) to NEVO, the Dutch food coding system, generating an integrated database with concentration values of 1,160 compounds, of which 768 were analyzed in this study (those consumed by at least 80% of participants).

Using this database and FFQ data, dietary data of IBD patients were translated into intake levels of food compounds. A random forest analysis was performed to explore compounds associated with remission and flares. Compounds contributing the most to the random forest were assessed for potential biological relevance by examining literature on gut health, IBD, or immunomodulation.

Overall, the study included 135 patients aged 19-68, who were in endoscopic or clinical remission at baseline. A disease flare occurred in 41 patients during a median follow-up of 29 months. The median time from baseline to relapse was 14 months. The median body mass index (BMI) was 23 kg/m2 for the flare group and 25 kg/m2 for the remission group. The random forest analysis was applied to the intake values of 768 food compounds.

Among the random forest models, those based on up to 75 food compounds showed optimal performance overall. Models performed particularly well in remission prediction, with negative predictive values and specificities up to 79% and 77%, respectively. Overall, 35 compounds, henceforth “selected compounds,” contributed the most to the random forest.

Of these, 25 were fatty acids, including short-chain, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, saturated, and unsaturated fatty acids. The remainder were ethanol, cellobiose, vanillin, kaempferol-3-glucoside, haem iron, molybdenum, acetylglycine, kaempferol-3-O-acetyl-glucoside, 4-hydroxyproline, and heptadecanoyl carnitine.

Among the 29 compounds with increased intakes in the remission group, butyric acid, capric acid, 4-hydroxyproline, and trans- and cis-linoleic acid reportedly attenuated inflammation in IBD, augmented barrier function, were gastroprotective, or were associated with a lower IBD risk. However, some findings appeared contradictory; for example, palmitic acid and myristic acid, which were also higher in the remission group, have previously been reported to impair intestinal integrity and increase the risk of flare.

Immunomodulatory effects were identified for 11 compounds, while 13 compounds lacked relevant literature regarding their impact on gut health, IBD, or the immune system. Among the six compounds with increased intake levels in the flare group, molybdenum might promote dysbiosis and aggravate colitis.

Conversely, cellobiose and kaempferol-3-glucoside have been reported to attenuate experimental colitis in mice. Suspected immunomodulatory effects were found for trans-11-docosenoic acid. The remaining two compounds had inconsistent or no data on the effects on the immune system, gut health, or IBD.

In sum, the random forest models based on up to 75 compounds achieved optimal performance. Fatty acids were the compounds that contributed the most to the models.

The contribution to the model by a compound may stem from a biologically relevant difference in intake between flare and remission groups. For some compounds, however, this may also be due to coincidence or co-occurrence in the diet with other compounds that have biological effects. This may help explain some of the contradictory findings.

The study also highlights the importance of considering ""reverse causation,"" where the disease itself influences dietary choices. For instance, patients who experience frequent flares might strictly avoid fatty dairy products. While this may help alleviate symptoms, it could also unintentionally reduce their intake of beneficial fatty acids, such as butyric acid, potentially worsening their condition over time. This complexity is revealed by the compound-level analysis; the study noted that while patients in remission ate less dairy overall, their intake of specific beneficial fatty acids from sources like fatty butter and cheese was actually higher.

The analytic approach used in this study may also help uncover diet-disease relationships in other chronic conditions.

Further research is needed to clarify these associations and validate their biological significance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","OU researchers launch innovative study to track e-cigarette habits in young adults","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250618/OU-researchers-launch-innovative-study-to-track-e-cigarette-habits-in-young-adults.aspx","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 04:53:00 GMT","

Electronic cigarettes, or vapes, are widely used and available in hundreds of different types and flavors, yet researchers lack information about the everyday e-cigarette habits of young adults. The National Institutes of Health, in partnership with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has funded a University of Oklahoma study that will investigate how, when and why young adults use e-cigarettes and how that use may relate to health risks. The results will help the FDA make decisions about regulating the makers of e-cigarette products.

Emily Hébert, a member of the TSET Health Promotion Research Center at OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center and an assistant professor of family and preventive medicine in the OU College of Medicine, earned the $3.1 million, five-year NIH grant to conduct the study, which will begin enrolling young adults this fall. The study is a novel departure from the surveys that have been used to conduct such research in the past. Rather than relying on a person to remember their vaping habits over the past month, Hébert and her team will check in with study participants daily via a smartphone platform. Called ecological momentary assessment, the technique is designed to capture young adults' routines and motivations in the moment.

Surveys typically ask about average behavior, and they are subject to recall bias. We needed a different methodology to understand exactly which product characteristics are associated with which use patterns. What we want to know is, are there certain characteristics – like candy flavors or nicotine concentrations – that may carry higher public health risks or appeal disproportionately to youth, which is important for the FDA to know.""

Emily Hébert, member of the TSET Health Promotion Research Center at OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center

Study participants will be prompted for input multiple times daily for a month, then again in six months, in five different waves, helping researchers gather both short-term and long-term data. Hébert said researchers will ask about the types of products being used, what participants' moods are like, whether they're alone or with friends, whether they're also using other products like cannabis or traditional cigarettes, and if they have symptoms like respiratory problems.

In pilot studies, Hébert said she found that many young adults use multiple vaping products over the course of a month, not necessarily showing loyalty to a particular brand – and there are hundreds of different products to choose from, which can be purchased in person and online.

""Because we are collecting data so often, we can quickly monitor any market changes,"" she said. ""Study participants can also upload pictures so we can see exactly what type of product they're using.""

Understanding young adults' frequency of e-cigarette use is also important, Hébert said. Existing research shows that many young adults use e-cigarettes all day long.

""If people are using e-cigarettes to quit traditional cigarettes or are vaping just once or twice a day, we want to know that, but that's not necessarily what we're seeing,"" Hébert said. ""We're seeing many young adults who have never smoked initiating e-cigarette use and, in some cases, reporting frequent use that may indicate early signs of dependence. Like other common substances, such as caffeine, frequency and intensity of use matter. Heavy use may indicate risk that warrants further investigation.""

The FDA has approved approximately 30 e-cigarettes to be marketed in the United States, all either tobacco- or menthol-flavored. These authorizations are based on evidence that the products are suitable for protecting public health, taking into account factors such as youth appeal, addiction potential, and the likelihood of helping smokers transition away from combustible cigarettes, Hébert said. However, hundreds of other e-cigarette products remain on the market without FDA authorization. While enforcement is challenging, Hébert's study may shed light on the extent to which these unauthorized products are being used by young adults.

Hébert said she is excited to get started on her study because it offers the potential to gather information previously unavailable to the FDA.

""Young adults are comfortable using smartphones to communicate, and we anticipate getting rich, real-time data,"" she said. ""This is a fulfilling type of research because your findings can lead to changes in policy. It is a unique area of tobacco regulatory science.""

A new lipid-based pathway essential for memory formation has been discovered by University of Queensland researchers – a breakthrough that could lead to treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Led by Professor Frédéric Meunier from UQ's Queensland Brain Institute, the team found a saturated fat called myristic acid is released by an enzyme, DDHD2, which is then used to chemically ""tag"" proteins where neurons connect and communicate with each other.

From our previous research we know myristic acid is essential to making memories stick.

In new this study, we found myristic acid hooks onto proteins and alters their membrane association, thereby driving memory formation.

Crucially, without this fat-tagging step, these proteins in dendritic spines can't do their job, and the neuron can't strengthen its connections.""

Professor Frédéric Meunier from UQ's Queensland Brain Institute

Blocking this fat-signalling pathway in mice prevented the brain from undergoing these critical protein changes that occur during memory formation, providing strong evidence this process is essential to learning.

""This could mean we've found a way to temporarily interfere with how the brain stores memories,"" Professor Meunier said.

The National Study of Mental Health and Wellbeing 2020–2022 shows an estimated 11 per cent of Australians experience PTSD in their lifetime. 

Co-author Dr. Nathalie Dehorter said the discovery has significant implications for understanding brain plasticity and offers a potential therapeutic target for preventing the consolidation of traumatic memories.

""However, those clinical applications are still a long way off, and any approach to controlling memory would require careful ethical consideration,'' Dr Dehorter said.

The brain is the body's fattiest organ, with fatty compounds making up 60 per cent of its weight and this study further underscores the vital role that fats play in brain function.

The research was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Clem Jones Centre for Ageing Dementia Research and supported by UQ's Clinical Research Mass Spectrometry Facility and UQ's Biological Resources facility.

The research is published in The EMBO Journal.

A new meta-analysis shows that even modest increases in ultra-processed food intake can drive up type 2 diabetes risk, especially when consumption exceeds 300 grams per day.

Study: Ultra-Processed Food Intake and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies. Image Credit: rafa jodar / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Diabetes and Metabolism Journal, researchers investigated the associations between ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

UPFs are industrial formulations made from fractions of whole foods, often modified and enhanced with food additives. UPFs are typically energy-dense, rich in sugar, sodium, and fat, and low in fiber. As such, UPF intake could lead to poor diet quality and excess energy intake, contributing to higher risks of obesity and other diseases. High UPF consumption may also impair insulin signaling and increase the risk of T2D. Food additives in UPFs, such as artificial sweeteners and emulsifiers, may also contribute by disrupting gut microbiota and promoting insulin resistance.

Processed meats showed the strongest diabetes link among UPF subgroups—34% higher risk per serving, outpacing sugary drinks and other categories.

In the present study, researchers meta-analyzed the relationship between UPF intake and T2D risk. First, they identified studies from PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases, using relevant search terms. This meta-analysis was limited to prospective studies that reported relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the associations between T2D risk and UPF intake. Studies not following the Nova classification (of food groups) were excluded.

The following data were extracted from eligible studies: sample size, age, follow-up duration, dietary assessment methods, exposure range, covariates, relative risks (RRs), and timing of UPF assessment, among other variables. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria were used to assess the risk of bias and the level of evidence, respectively. DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models were used for the meta-analysis comparing the highest versus the lowest UPF intake and individual UPF subgroups.

Further, non-linear and linear dose-response meta-analyses were performed for different UPF units (serving/day, absolute grams (g)/day, and percentage of g/day), using the two-stage random-effects model with restricted cubic splines and the two-stage generalized least squares trend estimation method, respectively. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test and funnel plots.

Sensitivity analyses were performed by sequentially excluding each study from the meta-analysis to evaluate the robustness of the findings. Heterogeneity was examined using the I-squared statistic and Cochran's Q test. Further, subgroup analyses were performed on methodological characteristics and potential effect modifiers to identify the sources of heterogeneity.

Whole grains in ultra-processed cereals likely drove their unexpected protective effect, highlighting that not all industrial foods share identical risks.

Overall, the study included 10 publications across 12 prospective cohort studies. Most studies were conducted in Europe (five) and North America (four). Seven publications were of high quality, while three had moderate quality. The meta-analysis of the highest vs. lowest UPF intake categories included 38,308 cases of diabetes from over 714,000 participants.

The summary RR was 1.48 for T2D risk, with moderate-to-high heterogeneity. Despite the heterogeneity in RR magnitude across studies, a consistent positive association was observed. No publication bias was noted. Among studies that reported associations for individual UPF subgroups, sugar- and artificially sweetened beverages, as well as processed meats, were positively associated with T2D risk.

Conversely, packaged sweet snacks and desserts, as well as packaged savory snacks and ultra-processed cereals and breads, were reported as inversely associated, although the inverse association for sweet snacks and desserts was not statistically significant (RR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–1.00). These inverse associations may be partly explained by factors such as flavanol content in chocolate-based products or the inclusion of whole-grain breads within the cereal subgroup.

In subgroup analyses by region, higher summary RRs were observed for European and North American studies compared to studies from other regions. This regional variation may be linked to higher intake of processed meats in Western populations, which was the UPF subgroup most strongly associated with T2D. The summary RRs for the highest versus the lowest UPF intake categories were comparable across studies using different UPF units.

Asian and South American populations showed milder UPF-diabetes links than Westerners, likely due to different dietary patterns and smaller portion sizes.

Eight studies reported associations using the percentage of g/day as the unit of UPF intake. Each 10% g/day increment in UPF intake was significantly associated with a 14% higher risk of T2D, with no evidence of non-linearity. Four studies used absolute g/day as the unit of UPF intake. Each 100 g/day increase in UPF intake was associated with a 5% increased risk of T2D.

A non-linear relationship was observed only for absolute g/day intake, with a steeper increase in risk at intake levels exceeding 300 g/day. Likewise, four studies used servings per day as the unit of UPF intake. A one-serving-per-day increment in UPF intake significantly elevated the risk of T2D by 4%, and this association was linear.

Further, results remained robust in sensitivity analyses that excluded one study at a time.

In summary, the meta-analysis revealed a positive association between UPF intake and T2D risk. Higher UPF consumption was associated with a 48% increased risk of T2D. The association remained statistically significant after adjusting for body mass index (BMI), though the effect was partially attenuated, suggesting BMI may mediate part of the relationship.

The associations also held after adjustment for diet quality and total energy intake, suggesting an independent effect. A non-linear relationship was observed specifically for absolute g/day intake, with a steeper increase in T2D risk at intake levels exceeding 300 g/day of UPF. Given the growing surge in UPF intake, more efforts are needed to decrease UPF consumption by increasing access to minimally processed or unprocessed foods.

A record-breaking measles outbreak concentrated in Texas and New Mexico reveals the consequences of falling MMR vaccination rates and signals the urgent need to rebuild trust in public health before eradicated diseases return for good.

In a recent perspective piece published in the journal New Microbes and New Infections, researchers described the current state of measles outbreaks, with a focus on the United States, and highlighted risk factors for the disease, as well as recommendations for public health policy and clinical practice.

Without immediate action by policymakers and medical professionals, many communities could be at risk of severe disease outbreaks, leading to the return of endemic measles transmission across the U.S.

The Centers for Disease Control had reported 884 cases of measles across the U.S. by April 2025, with 11 outbreaks spanning 29 states. Texas was the hardest hit, reporting 646 cases, while New Mexico reported 65.

Most infections are clustered along the border shared by Western Texas and Southern New Mexico, accounting for over 90% of Texas cases and nearly all New Mexico cases. Gaines County in Texas has 393 cases, accounting for more than any individual state, and saw two child deaths, both unvaccinated, with one child from the local Mennonite community. Both children died in Lubbock. A third fatality, an unvaccinated adult, occurred in Lea County.

During the pandemic, parents stayed home, and doctors focused on COVID-19, causing many children to miss routine vaccinations, a gap that still hasn't been closed.

These figures marked the highest measles numbers the U.S. had seen since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. Previous spikes were far lower, with 667 cases in 2014 during the “Disneyland Outbreak” in California or 1,274 in 2019 among New York Orthodox Jewish communities. Alarmingly, 2025 numbers nearly surpassed the 2019 total within just a few months.

As of the latest CDC update, the U.S. has now reported 1,197 measles cases, just 77 cases short of the 2019 total, which had been the highest since the national elimination of measles was declared in 2000. Measles activity has now been confirmed in 35 states, up from 34 the previous week, likely reflecting Arizona's first reported cases of the year. Four new outbreaks were reported, bringing the total to 21 nationwide, compared to just 16 outbreaks in all of 2024. Notably, 90% of this year's measles cases have occurred as part of outbreaks, a rise from 69% last year, indicating the expansion of clusters of sustained transmission.

Internationally, measles cases have also been surging.

Europe is experiencing record levels, particularly in Kazakhstan and Romania. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has reported that, in the 12 months from April 2023 to March 2024, there were 56,634 measles cases across 41 countries. Five countries, Kazakhstan, Romania, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, and the Russian Federation, accounted for 85% of all cases. Alarmingly, 11 countries reported more than 100 cases per million population, far exceeding the World Health Organization's (WHO) threshold for measles elimination. Hospitalization was required in 71% of reported cases, and five measles-related deaths were documented. This escalation highlights immunity gaps and declining vaccination coverage in parts of the region, posing challenges to achieving elimination goals.

Africa remains heavily affected, with no country achieving elimination. These patterns highlight the growing global hesitancy towards vaccines.

Measles' immune amnesia has a hidden long-term cost: It can increase the risk of death from other infections like tuberculosis for up to two years, especially in regions with high infectious disease burdens.

The current surge in American measles cases is not driven by immigration but by declining vaccination coverage and domestic transmission. Most cases originate from American residents who traveled abroad and returned infected.

Because measles is extremely contagious, around 95% of the population should have immunity to prevent outbreaks, but national vaccination rates fall short. In 2023, less than 93% of children had two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and coverage is even lower in certain communities.

These estimates also exclude some undocumented and homeschooled children, who are less likely to receive vaccines, leaving numerous unprotected clusters. This year, 97% of measles cases occurred in individuals who were not vaccinated.

One example is Gaines County in Texas, which has the state's lowest vaccination rates and the highest number of cases. A major factor is the Mennonite community in the Old Colony, which maintains conservative traditions, resists assimilation, and has low access to healthcare and public health messaging, partly due to language barriers. This group is distinct from the Mennonite Church of America and typically speaks a Low German dialect. Although their doctrine does not explicitly prohibit vaccinations, cultural conservatism and historical exclusion from public health initiatives contribute to under-vaccination.

Their low vaccination rates mirror other under-vaccinated groups like New York Orthodox Jews, the Ohio Amish, and clusters in California, each of which has faced recent outbreaks.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted routine vaccinations and amplified public skepticism about all vaccines. Even after pandemic restrictions were lifted, MMR vaccine uptake has continued to decline, fueled by political polarization and growing far-right ideologies that promote distrust of science and public health.

This trend aligns with global patterns; worldwide MMR vaccination rates fell to a 20-year low in 2021 and remain below target levels.

Additionally, rising anti-immigration sentiment affects healthcare access for undocumented immigrants, who face barriers like cost, fears of deportation, and language obstacles.

Texas, with the second-largest undocumented population, risks expanding vulnerable groups. Ensuring equitable vaccination is vital for protecting public health and maintaining herd immunity.

Getting to 'yes' on vaccines takes time and empathy: Parents often need multiple non-pressured conversations to move from hesitation to acceptance, as pushing too hard can backfire.

Measles poses significant risks mainly due to its serious complications, including pneumonia and brain inflammation, which can be fatal.

Measles also weakens the immune system, leaving individuals more vulnerable to other infections for up to two years afterward. This “immune amnesia” may raise death rates beyond the initial illness, especially in areas with other widespread diseases, underscoring the urgency for sustained and comprehensive prevention strategies.

Healthcare providers, particularly primary care physicians, play a crucial role in increasing vaccination rates. They must engage parents in ongoing, respectful conversations, addressing fears and misinformation without judgment.

Children should receive routine MMR vaccines at 12 and 60 months of age, with early or accelerated doses administered when the exposure risk is high.

Refusing care to families who decline vaccines is not proven effective; instead, repeated, empathetic discussions can gradually change minds.

Public health efforts must also address the cultural, religious, and political influences behind vaccine hesitancy. Successful campaigns must consider community beliefs, as shown by an effective faith-led vaccination drive in India. This approach can inform local outreach efforts, such as those in Gaines County, where religious communities have low vaccination rates.

Without more decisive local and global action, communities remain vulnerable to measles and other preventable diseases, raising concerns about the possible return of endemic measles in the United States. The authors describe measles as a “canary in the coalmine,” signaling broader population vulnerability to vaccine-preventable diseases.

Cannabis use is linked to a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, with significantly heightened risks of having a stroke or acute coronary syndrome-sudden reduced or blocked blood flow to the heart-finds a pooled analysis of real world data, published online in the journal Heart.

The authors of a linked editorial call for the drug to be treated like tobacco-not criminalized, but actively discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand vapour inhalation.

The use of cannabis and cannabinoids has soared over the past decade, note the researchers. Legalising cannabis in certain jurisdictions and expanding its use for medicinal purposes has probably changed people's risk perceptions of the drug and helped drive its growing popularity, they suggest.

While previously published studies have linked cannabis use to cardiovascular problems, the magnitude of the risk hasn't been clear. This is an important gap in light of the recent major changes in consumption and the increased potency of the drug, they add.

To strengthen the evidence base, therefore, the researchers scoured research databases looking for large observational studies, published between January 2016 and December 2023, which explored cannabis use and serious cardiovascular outcomes: cardiovascular disease death; and non-fatal acute coronary syndrome to include heart attack and stroke.

From an initial haul of 3012 articles, 24, involving around 200 million people, were included in a pooled data analysis of the results: 17 cross-sectional studies, 6 cohort studies, and 1 case-control study.

Study participants were mostly aged between 19 and 59. And in those studies where sex was recorded, cannabis users tended to be mostly male and younger than non-users.

The analysis revealed heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome; 20% higher for stroke; and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The researchers acknowledge that there was a moderate to high risk of bias in most of the included studies, largely because of lack of information on missing data and imprecise measures of cannabis exposure. And most of the included studies were observational, precluding the ability to draw causal inferences from the data. Several used the same data.

Notwithstanding these caveats, the researchers say that theirs is an exhaustive analysis of published data on the potential association between cannabis use and major cardiovascular disease and provides new insights from real-world data.

In a linked editorial, Emeritus Professor Stanton Glantz of the University of California at San Francisco and Dr Lynn Silver of the Public Health Institute, Oakland, California, and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California at San Francisco, say the study ""raises serious questions about the assumption that cannabis imposes little cardiovascular risk.""

More research is clearly needed to clarify whether cardiovascular risks are limited to inhaled products or extend to other forms of cannabis exposure, they suggest. Cannabis is now generally more potent and has diversified into a wide array of inhaled high potency cannabis concentrates, synthetic psychoactive cannabinoids, and edibles, they point out. 

""How these changes affect cardiovascular risk requires clarification, as does the proportion of risk attributable to cannabinoids themselves versus particulate matter, terpenes or other components of the exposure,"" they say.

They conclude: ""Cannabis needs to be incorporated into the framework for prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease. So too must cardiovascular disease prevention be incorporated into the regulation of cannabis markets. Effective product warnings and education on risks must be developed, required, and implemented. 

""Cardiovascular and other health risks must be considered in the regulation of allowable product and marketing design as the evidence base grows. Today that regulation is focused on establishing the legal market with woeful neglect of minimising health risks. 

""Specifically, cannabis should be treated like tobacco: not criminalized, but discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand exposure.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Heart disease markers may predict future cancer risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250618/Heart-disease-markers-may-predict-future-cancer-risk.aspx","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 04:21:00 GMT","

Cancer and heart disease, two leading causes of death worldwide, may be more connected than we previously thought, according to a new UCLA Health study revealing that certain cardiac blood markers can strongly predict future cancer risk-even in people with no history or symptoms of heart disease.

The study found that very small elevations in two cardiac biomarkers-high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)- are strong and independent predictors of overall cancer risk, with a higher incidence in specific types of cancer. While elevated baseline levels of both hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP were associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, NT-proBNP alone was also linked to a higher risk of developing lung cancer.

""These biomarkers are already well-known indicators of cardiovascular risk, but our findings suggest their predictive power may reach well beyond heart disease to encompass cancer risk too, says Dr. Xinjiang Cai, a UCLA Health cardiologist and physician-scientist, and lead author of the study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Advances. ""The idea that slight elevations of heart-related blood markers might also help flag cancer risk in people with no known heart problems highlights how interconnected cardiovascular health and cancer may be, beyond just their shared common risk factors.""

The study analyzed data from 6,244 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective cohort study of adults aged 45 to 84 years who were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer between 2000 and 2002. Participants were followed for a median of 17.8 years, during which incident cancer events were obtained through hospitalization records.

Researchers measured participants' baseline levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and examined the association between these levels and subsequent cancer risk."" These findings can help bridge the knowledge gap at the intersection of preventive cardiology and oncology and can lead to better risk prediction and prevention strategies for both diseases,"" Cai said.

Co-authors of the study include experts in cardiovascular medicine, epidemiology, and population science from five leading academic institutions across the United States-UCLA, the University of Washington, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Inova Heart and Vascular Institute, and the Lundquist Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.

ATLANTA (June 18, 2025) – U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes has named the 25-player training camp roster for the upcoming matches against the Republic of Ireland on June 26 at DICK's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colo., presented by Allstate (7 p.m. MT / 9 p.m. ET on TBS, truTV and Max, Universo & Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports)and on June 29 at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio (3 p.m. ET on TNT, truTV and Max, Universo & Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports)before taking on Canada on July 2 at Audi Field in Washington, D.C. in the Allstate Continental Clasico(7:30 p.m. ET on TNT, truTV & Max and Universo &Peacock in Spanish and on the radio via Westwood One Sports).

Tickets for all three matches are available on ussoccer.com.

As Hayes shared last week, the roster does not feature almost all of the USA's European-based players with those players getting this FIFA window off to rest and recuperate after long European seasons. Only defender Naomi Girma of Chelsea FC currently plays her club soccer abroad, meaning 24 players on the roster are from National Women's Soccer League clubs. Hayes will name 23 players to suit up for each of the three matches.

GOALKEEPERS (3): Angelina Anderson (Angel City FC; 0), Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 0), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 3)

DEFENDERS (10):Kerry Abello (Orlando Pride; 1/0), Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 0/0), Naomi Girma (Chelsea FC, ENG; 46/2), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 0/0), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 6/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 4/0), Izzy Rodriguez (Kansas City Current; 0/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 4/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 108/2), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC; 3/0)

MIDFIELDERS (6): Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit; 3/0), Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 35/2), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 3/0), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 110/24), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC; 0/0), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 7/2)

FORWARDS (6): Lynn Biyendolo (Seattle Reign FC; 80/24), Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 6/1), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 9/0), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 5/1), Ally Sentnor (Utah Royals; 9/4), Alyssa Thompson (Angel City FC; 19/1)

The roster features four players earning their first-ever call-ups – defenders Jordyn Bugg, Lilly Reale and Izzy Rodriguez and midfielder Sam Meza -- meaning Hayes has now given 27 players their first USWNT call-ups. Six players on the roster have yet to be capped at the senior level and 19 players (76% of the roster) have fewer than 10 caps.

“We want to continue to improve our understanding of how we want to play and widen the player pool, and those are some of the key goals of this three-game window,” said Hayes. “On this roster, we have players with a varied amount of experience, and my priority is to deepen the exposures required for international soccer. These are three challenging matches and as always, we want to win, but also to make sure we are ready for the next steps.”

The roster does include the return of World Cup and Olympic champion midfielder Rose Lavelle, owner of 110 caps, 24 international goals and a goal in the 2019 Women's World Cup Final. Lavelle has recovered from ankle surgery and will suit up for the USA for the first time in about six and half months, last playing for the USWNT in the final match of 2024 against the Netherlands in The Hague.

Lavelle's inclusion will give her the chance to play in her hometown of Cincinnati, where she attended Mount Notre Dame High School and is one of the most popular local athletes of the last decade.

The roster features just six players who have played in a world championship at the senior level, and one of those is midfielder Croix Bethune, the 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year and a member of the 2024 Olympic Team (she played in one match in France), who returns after a long recovery from knee surgery. She has not played with the USA since the Olympics. Houston Dash forward Yazmeen Ryan also returns to the roster after being unavailable for selection during the last FIFA window due to injury. 

The other five players on the roster who have world championship experience are forward Lynn Biyendolo --who had a two-goal performance in her last USWNT outing in a 4-0 win over Jamaica on June 3 to bring her international goal total to 24 in 80 caps–defender Emily Sonnett (108 caps), midfielder Sam Coffey (35 caps), Girma and Lavelle. Fourteen players on this roster were on World Cup Teams for the USA at the U-17 or U-20 levels or both.

Ally Sentnor, who notched her first two-goal game in a U.S. uniform on June 3 against Jamaica, gets another call-up. She and the other five forwards on the roster have combined for 19 goals in the NWSL so far this season.

Croix Bethune and Tara McKeown will join USWNT for friendlies against Ireland and Canada 

Washington, D.C. (06/18/2025) – Washington Spirit midfielder Croix Bethune and defender Tara McKeown have been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) for the side's June/July friendlies, U.S. Soccer announced today. The U.S. will take on Ireland and Canada in three friendly matches beginning later this month. 

Bethune makes her return to the USWNT for the first time since helping the side win the gold medal at last summer's Olympics in France. The midfielder made her senior team debut during the United States' friendlies last July before making her major tournament debut in the side's final Olympic group stage match against Australia.  

McKeown earns her fifth consecutive call-up to the U.S. senior team in just her third season at center back. Making her first appearance and start for the USWNT against Colombia in this year's SheBelieves Cup, McKeown also tallied her first international assist when she connected with Ally Sentnor for a second half goal. The defender has collected six total appearances for the USWNT. 

USWNT's June/July 2025 Friendly Schedule: 

Bethune began her pro career in style last season with the Spirit, tallying five goals and ten assists (matching an NWSL single season record) en route to Rookie of the Year and Midfielder of the Year honors despite missing nine matches due to injury. She made her return from injury earlier this season in April. McKeown moved from forward to defender after the 2022 season and has been a stalwart for the Spirit, appearing in 59 regular season matches since. An NWSL Defender of the Year finalist in 2024, the standout completed her first career Iron Woman season last year. 

Fans' next chance to see their favorite Spirit players in action will be at the team's Open Training event next month. Taking place on Saturday, July 19 at George Mason University, fans are invited to come out and watch as the team gears up for the second half of the season. Limited tickets are available here. The Spirit will take the pitch at home again on Sunday, August 3 following the NWSL's July break. Facing off against Portland Thorns FC, the Spirit will host its first-ever Throwback Day at Audi Field. Single match tickets are available here.

The Latest | Jun 18, 2025

KANSAS CITY (June 18, 2025) — A trio of Kansas City Current players in forward Michelle Cooper, midfielder Claire Hutton and defender Izzy Rodriguez have been called up by the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) for three international friendlies later this month. U.S. Soccer announced its 25-player roster on Wednesday as it continues preparation for Concacaf World Cup qualifying in Fall 2026.

After featuring in the Futures Camp earlier this year, Cooper and Hutton both got their first senior national team call-up in February for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup presented by Visa and have since appeared in two subsequent USWNT camps. This is the first time Rodriguez has been called up by the USWNT in her career.

The Stars and Stripes will play the Republic of Ireland for two contests, the first which will be held at DSG Park in Commerce City, Colo., on Thursday, June 26, at 8 p.m. CT. The teams then square off again in Cincinnati, Ohio, at 2 p.m. CT on Sunday, June 29, at TQL Stadium. The USWNT will conclude its trip in Washington, D.C., by facing Canada on Wednesday, July 2, at 6:30 p.m. CT for the Allstate Continental Clásico at Audi Field.

Fans can watch the first match against Ireland on TBS, TruTV, Universo, Max and Peacock, and can tune into TNT, TruTV, Universo, Max and Peacock for the second game. The Allstate Continental Clásico will air on TNT, TruTV, Universo, Max and Peacock.

Cooper made her USWNT debut during the 2025 SheBelieves Cup, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2-0 victory over Colombia on Feb. 20. In the team's next match against Australia, the forward scored her first international goal in the 68th minute which stood as the game-winner in a 2-1 win. Most recently, she dished out an assist in a 3-0 shutout over China PR on May 31. Cooper also had a decorated youth national team career, highlighted by winning the Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the 2022 Concacaf U-20 Championship as well as captaining her team at the 2022 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

Like Cooper, Hutton's first USWNT appearance was in the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year when she started against Australia and logged 70 minutes. She joined the starting lineup again – and played every minute – in an April friendly against Brazil, also putting in an 80-minute shift as a starter vs. Jamaica on June 3. Hutton's international debut was with the U.S. U-17 Youth National Team at the 2022 Concacaf Championship where she scored six goals. She was also tabbed captain of the U-19 squad at the 2023 PanAm Games and played at the 2024 FIFA U-20 World Cup, earning bronze in both events.

Receiving her first USWNT nod is Rodriguez, who has appeared in all 12 games of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season so far with nine starts. Her three assists are tied for third in the league and she was named to the NWSL Best XI for April, the second such honor of her career. Rodriguez has donned the red, white and blue on the international stage before: She helped the USA win the 2016 Concacaf U-17 Championship and played at the 2016 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Two years later, she guided the U.S. to a runner-up finish at the 2018 U-20 Concacaf Championship and had two appearances at the 2018 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

The Kansas City Current is back on the pitch on Friday, June 20, welcoming Angel City FC to CPKC Stadium to close out the first half of NWSL regular season action. Kickoff is at 7 p.m. CT and the match will broadcast on Prime Video. The action will also air on 90.9 The Bridge, and fans can tune in to hear the match in English, Spanish or Portuguese on the KC Current App.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Biyendolo, Bugg, Dickey and Meza Called Up to United States Women's National Team","https://www.reignfc.com/news/biyendolo-bugg-dickey-and-meza-called-up-to-united-states-womens-national-team","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 13:33:12 GMT","

Four Seattle Reign FC players have been named to the United States Women's National team 25-player roster for the upcoming international window by Head Coach Emma Hayes – Lynn Biyendolo, Jordyn Bugg, Claudia Dickey and Sam Meza.

The United States is set to take on Republic of Ireland twice, on June 26 and 29, and Canada once, on July 2. The roster does not feature the vast majority USA's European-based players, with the exception of defender Naomi Girma of Chelsea FC. For each of the three friendly matches, Hayes will name 23 of the 25 total players to suit up.

""Having four players called into the senior U.S. Women's National Team — including first-timers Sam Meza and Jordyn Bugg — speaks volumes about the level of talent and commitment we have at this club. Whether it's Claudia and Lynn continuing to raise the bar, or Sam and Jordyn stepping onto the senior stage for the first time, we're incredibly proud to see the Reign so well represented,” said Seattle Reign FC General Manager Lesle Gallimore.

Forward Lynn Biyendolo brings the most experience of the four Reign players called up with 80 caps and 24 goals. She is one of just six players included on the roster to have played in a world championship at the senior level. Most recently, Biyendolo scored a brace for the USWNT in the team's 4-0 win over Jamaica. Much like her role with the Reign, the attacker will bring a reliable sense of leadership to the United States roster.

Goalkeeper Claudia Dickey continues her standout season, getting called up to camp once again after earning her first game call up during the May-June international window.  The 25-year-old is still looking for her first cap, along with five other players on the roster. All three of the goalkeepers called up to this camp have earned first call-ups this year or at the end of last year and have experience with the U.S. U-20s. 

Defender Jordyn Bugg and midfielder Sam Meza, two of the Reign's rising young stars, have been called up to the senior national team for the first time ever. They both have extensive experience at the youth national team level and are two of four players called up for the first time during this camp.

All four of the first-time call ups have previously appeared on a U.S. roster in FIFA Youth World Cup. Bugg, the youngest player in camp, played in the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup while Meza was on the USA's 2018 FIFA U-17 WWC Team but did not see action. The midfielder has won a Concacaf title at the U-15, U-17 and U-20 levels. Both Bugg and Meza were most recently called up to the United States Under-23 Women's Youth National Team for a trip to Germany when the Americans split games with the Germans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Rose Lavelle to play for U.S. Women's National Team June 29 at TQL Stadium","https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/soccer/2025/06/18/rose-lavelle-to-play-for-u-s-womens-national-team-at-tql-stadium-world-cup-fifa-gotham-fc-uswnt/84244491007/","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 14:09:24 GMT","

Rose Lavelle is coming back to play in her hometown.

The United States Women's National Team announced Wednesday that the Mount Notre Dame graduate will be in uniform then they play three friendlies this summer, including June 29 against Ireland at TQL Stadium. That news came with the unveiling of their full training camp roster for the matches.

Lavelle, who turned 30 in May, had been out for six months with an ankle injury that required surgery. She recently returned to action for her Gotham FC club in the National Women's Soccer League, coming on as a substitute for the final 15 minutes during two games on June 7 and June 13.

She helped the USWNT win the 2024 Olympic gold medal in France but has not played for the National Team since the end of 2024. She currently has 110 career caps (appearances for the national team in international play) and 24 career goals for the USA, including in the 2019 World Cup which she played a key role in the USWNT winning.

Lavelle is currently in New York City with Gotham FC. She addressed her injury and the joy she feels coming back to Cincinnati in a virtual interview session from there with local media Tuesday in advance of the announcement.

“It just so special,” she said. “Everything is so much joy, bringing everyone to Cincinnati, show them how great a city it is.”

“It was a pretty big surgery, so it honestly might be a while until my ankle is 100 percent,” she said. “The rest of me feels great, though, so that's a good thing. (The surgery) was kind of treacherous. I definitely didn't know what all coming back from surgery entailed, so it was a harder process than I anticipated. But the med staff at Gotham has been great. I felt in such great hands. They really took great care of me and helped me get back to the point where I am, to be in the position to get back into camp and to get back into the game for Gotham. It was definitely a really, really tough process, but I think I'm better for it and I feel really grateful for the support system I had throughout it all.”

She said because she has only played limited minutes with Gotham so far that it's unlikely she'll play the full 90 minutes in Cincinnati, but she's working on it.

“Coming back from injury, how much I'll be available to play, hopefully some good amount, but obviously I can't go in and play maximum minutes,” she said. “It's my first camp back in and everybody's mentality going into camp is 'I have to go back in and earn spots.' It's something (that) having been in camp and with the national team for so long, it's a familiar position I'm in, to go back and an environment where we really have to compete and push each other.”

The ankle injury is the most serious one Lavelle has dealt with in her career, but it has come at a decent time in the soccer schedule.

“Any time I've had to take time away from the game, specifically when I've been injured, I think there's always a silver lining,” she said. “A lot of that is being able to reflect on knowing what all you still want. I want to win an NWSL championship. We have another cycle starting up, (we) qualified for the World Cup and Olympics and kind of go from there.

“I think it's kind of nice because I've been able to take a step back and reflect on and off the field. I feel like there's not really ever an ideal time to get an injury or have surgery, but I feel like if it was going to happen this year, it was probably the best time. I feel like it's allowed me to really prepare and reflect on the next couple years out.”

Gotham lost to Kansas City 2-1 on June 7 and beat Utah 3-0 on June 13. Gotham hosts Bay FC Saturday.

“It was such a long journey, so to finally get back on the field with Gotham and with my teammates was so fun,” she said. “Obviously, first game we lost, so that wasn't fun at the end of it, but during I enjoyed it. And then our last game, it got kind of wild and we were down two men because of red cards by the end of it. So it was kind of funny because when I was going in, we were 11 people on the field, we were up 3-0, that was so fun. And then as soon as I started going in, then they were reviewing for a red card and I was like, ‘OK I'm gonna be running.'”

When Lavelle helped the United States win the World Cup in 2019, she was a 24-year old phenom supported by older big names such as Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan. Now she's one of the older, most experienced players on the roster. She has the most career caps for the national team (110) of anyone on the current 25-player roster. Only four other players have more than 35, and the average age of the roster is 24.5.

Lavelle has been a mentor to her Gotham teammates this year, and is looking forward to doing everything she can for the national team, even if she can't play as much as she would like.

“I think it's really allowed me to step into more of a leadership role off the field,” she said. “So how can I still be a good teammate to them? How can I still use my voice and help the team whatever way I can, so I feel like I grew so much in that area during this past six months and I feel like I can use that going into camp.

“It still feels weird for me to think of myself as a veteran player, but I am, and with the past couple of (USWNT) rosters, it's been a really young new group. I've been that player before: The young inexperienced one. I always feel like I had such great veteran players to look up to, so I hope I can be that for them, help them feel a little more comfortable in an uncomfortable environment and hopefully set them up to be the best version of themselves in camps.”

Lavelle follows FC Cincinnati, and she's disappointed that the city didn't get an NWSL franchise in the recent expansion window.

When asked about it, she sighed and got emotional.  

“I was so sad,” Lavelle said. “I would have loved to see Cincinnati get a team and I would love to still see them get a team at some point. I think it's just such an underrated soccer city. The community and the friends rally around FCC so much, and I know it would have been the same for the women's team.”

Lavelle will be 36 when the U.S. hosts the World Cup in 2031. There's a possibility that Cincinnati could host games in the tournament. Whether she's still playing for the national team or not, she hopes it happens.

“I don't know if I'll be around that long, but regardless, I always say Cincinnati is such an underrated soccer city,” Lavelle said. “I feel like so much talent comes out of it. I think what FCC's been able to do has been so amazing and the way the city has rallied around all of the players that have come from Cincinnati that play in the league now, and FCC itself. So, I love any opportunity for people to be able to visit Cincinnati and see how amazing it is, and I think it would be such an amazing way to showcase the city, the soccer talent, the community.”","{'href': 'https://www.cincinnati.com', 'title': 'Cincinnati Enquirer'}","soccer"

NWSL

It's less than a year out from the 2026 men's World Cup, hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and there's suddenly plenty of drama happening with the U.S. men's national team that isn't about their recent form.

The back and forth between captain Christian Pulisic and head coach Mauricio Pochettino over the Milan forward's decision to sit out the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer has earned plenty of headlines and sustained a couple of weeks' worth of podcast episodes. It has been fascinating to watch from a distance via the lens of covering the U.S. women's national team.

Having reported on the USWNT at the World Cups in France in 2019 and Australia/New Zealand in 2023, and at the Olympics in France last year, I have never seen anything like this on the women's side of the sport.

There will always be tensions between players and a head coach to varying degrees. The closest comparison I could come up with was Ali Krieger's long call-up drought before suddenly coming back into the fold for the 2019 World Cup, though it's not a perfect comparison, as public comments from either side stayed polite. Even new head coach Emma Hayes' surprising decision to leave Alex Morgan off the 2024 Olympic roster was largely covered as a pure soccer decision (and rightly so).

With the men, there are some inciting factors ramping up the heat. And the two former Chelsea colleagues, as managers of the London club's men's and women's teams during the 2023-24 season, find themselves in opposite scenarios.

An imminent World Cup being played largely on American soil, increasing workloads for players, the changing media landscape and the weight of former player voices, and even the high-profile nature of the men's head-coaching role for U.S. Soccer, are all escalating this from a single player's choice to contentious national discourse.

On the field, the USMNT's recent form — Gold Cup opener aside — has been lackluster, and the pressure is on to not just be prepared for a home World Cup but to perform well in it.

Meanwhile, for the USWNT, 2025 has been a rare release of the pressure valve that's usually on the women's game's perennial winners. This year is a slow build into World Cup qualifiers next summer, and the team is at the start of a new cycle leading into the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil and 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

For the women, the pressure is to win. For the men, it feels like something much closer to avoiding embarrassment on the international stage. The long shadow of Couva and the failure to qualify for the 2018 men's World Cup still lingers, even as the player pool has largely turned over in the years since.

Playing at home in a World Cup now less than 12 months away has cranked up pressure on the USMNT program to a level they've never actually experienced before.



Workload is also a factor.

It is not new or unique to Pulisic, to the USMNT or to men's soccer — but it does feel like players in general are beginning to reach a breaking point with the combined demands of club and international football, and are more willing to acknowledge their own need for rest as they put more and more minutes on their bodies.

There are legitimate concerns about player workload, something FIFPro, the sport's global players' union, has made a top priority, and the idea that footballers should feel enabled to take breaks for their physical or mental well-being is valid. Maybe we're just more used to these ideas on the women's side, since so much of the discussion around that branch of the game has come through the lens of players battling for better conditions, especially here in the United States.

It's not perfect yet by any stretch, but from the equal-pay fight to the NWSL abuse scandal, every person in the women's game has needed to grapple with player health and safety in a way the men's side has yet to be faced with.

After criticism over his decision to rest — including from former USMNT players such as Landon Donovan and Tim Howard — Pulisic wanted to clarify he was open to playing in two of the recent warm-up matches, but not the Gold Cup. Pochettino responded that while he understood Pulisic's line of thinking, he selected the same roster for those friendlies as the tournament itself because he considered it “a really important competition.”

But Pochettino's full response is where the discourse fully leapt into drama, even as he said his communication with Pulisic is “good,” though the same as he would have with any other player.

“I don't prioritize,” the former Argentina international said. “You say (Christian is) the best player. Yes, he's a good player, of course. But he needs to perform. Because I'm going to judge him like Diego (Luna, the attacking midfielder sitting next to him as he spoke to reporters), like another player. If he performs well and he is the best, it's normal he's going to have a place in the national team. It's not because a player (is saying), ‘I want to play', ‘I want this', ‘I want that'.

“When I signed my contract with the federation, it said I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin.”

the USMNT drama right now is🍿😭 and half the country is oblivious

When Hayes did not rotate her lineups during the Olympics, a tournament known for its compressed schedule and increased demands on players (and in that case, happened mostly in the high summer temperatures of southern France), she faced questions about workload. Hayes coached her players through those three weeks by comparing the tournament to a “pain cave”, a concept used by ultramarathoners running hundreds of miles.

“The reason I want to play the team together for as long as possible is because I want them to develop that. I want them to suffer. I want them to have that moment, because I do not believe you can win without it,” Hayes said as the USWNT advanced to the gold-medal game — and eventually took the title home.

Pochettino made a similar justification when explaining why he wanted the same roster for the Gold Cup and the two friendlies leading up to it.

“(Pulisic) contacted us with the concern about how he explained about how he was tired, that (he) was worried about different things,” Pochettino said before the Gold Cup, where his team will play up to six matches. “It's true that he wanted to come to be involved in the two friendly games — how he said. But it's common sense for us to build a roster to come to these two friendly games (in order) to prepare for the Gold Cup, because, for us, the Gold Cup is an important tournament.”

In this clear juxtaposition between the two U.S. national teams, Hayes has actively chosen to give almost all of the team's European-based players a rest for the upcoming camp and three friendlies. Her roster, announced Wednesday, featured only one player who plays in Europe — vice-captain and now Chelsea defender Naomi Girma was included in the majority NWSL player group as she builds back from an injury in March that meant over a month on the sidelines.

“This is the first opportunity, and the only one for them, to take a break between now and the World Cup in two years,” Hayes said, “and player welfare and rest and recovery are also important for these players.”

Hayes said Wednesday that while the increased player load across club and country is a conversation she can be a part of, but only influence via communication with U.S. Soccer and NWSL clubs, her specific role is to work with each individual player.

“All I can control is that in 2027, there is a World Cup and this player has this number of games, this is their season window, this is the international call-ups that they might receive, this is their off-season, this is their rest period,” she said. “Every one of them is different. My job is to educate the player.”

While Hayes viewed differences in player load between the European club game and the NWSL right now, the end goal was the same for her.

“Our players need to develop resilience to be able to tolerate the load,” she said

That said, how she manages a player like Emily Fox, who just won the Champions League with Arsenal, is different from an older player with a history of injuries or a young debutante with the national team who's stayed healthy.

While Hayes has the luxury of two years to build to Brazil 2027, Pochettino was brought in to replace Gregg Berhalter last September. There is a difference between the demands of a major tournament and the games one year out from one. Regardless, the discussion hasn't stayed on the actual structural issue at fault because the drama has superseded it.

Maybe this was unavoidable, though, thanks to U.S. Soccer's approach to hiring.

For both the men's and women's national teams, the federation has gone out and hired big-name coaches who create news cycles and have drawn off some of the coverage that might have otherwise gone to the players. Pochettino is already in an uncomfortable spot, due to the state of his team. Defensiveness should not be surprising.

There is a break in the clouds, at least. The USMNT got their opening win in the Gold Cup, 5-0 over Trinidad & Tobago, giving the team a chance to cut through the “noise” of the building negativity over the past few weeks.

While a result like that always helps things smooth over, there's still plenty to be resolved (at least publicly) between Pochettino and Pulisic — and it feels like everyone will still be waiting to see how this plays out.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","The USMNT Is Going Nowhere","https://defector.com/the-usmnt-is-going-nowhere","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 16:02:00 GMT","

12:02 PM EDT on June 18, 2025

The United States will host the men's World Cup in a little under one year. The vibe around the program could not possibly be worse, and enthusiasm levels could not possibly be lower.

Some of this funk can be explained by the U.S. team getting embarrassed on the field. Until they hung five goals on poor Trinidad and Tobago over the weekend, the USMNT had lost four straight games by an aggregate score of 9-2. Two of those were competitive games against CONCACAF rivals and two were friendly losses to legit European teams, though there's little point in drawing a distinction between the pairs of matches, because the stakes in both were the same: nothing. Losing is one thing. The larger and thornier issue is that if the team were winning, all they could win would be a reprieve from people paying attention to the program's structural bustedness.

Unless they are qualifying for or playing in the World Cup, every U.S. match is a either an actual friendly or a primped-up one in the guise of a match that matters. The Gold Cup, which is happening now, and the Nations League, which apparently happened in the spring, have occasionally played host to great, interesting matches, though neither tournament is capable of being anything more than a place for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to have something to do while the major soccer nations in the world are engaged in (more or less) meaningful continental competition. By their nature, they cannot be real tests.

One could make a counterargument that even fake tournaments give the team and its players time to develop chemistry. Rather, one could make that argument if the real team was playing in these fake tournaments. Maybe two of the starters in the T&T game would feature in the national team's actual best XI. Several of the other nine would-be starters are hurt, yet a handful, including the team's best player, have made the correct choice to prioritize their club careers over playing for their country in a fake tournament. Christian Pulisic is coming off of two of perhaps the best-ever seasons by an American player in Europe, and he is justifiably spending his summer recuperating rather than thrashing his body around some more. He is the poster boy for an uncomfortable reality for U.S. national team hardcores: no matter how much he succeeds in Europe, only the World Cup truly matters.

Pulisic's absence has not gone over well with said hardcores. Landon Donovan said Pulisic skipping the Gold Cup pissed him off, which got Pulisic's father to escalate the dust-up by calling Donovan out for taking a break from the USMNT over a decade ago, also before a World Cup summer. Ever since USMNT players started flocking to Europe en masse, Donovan's main public position has been one of skepticism: towards the idea that Serie A or the Bundesliga is actually better than MLS, towards people finding his own club career disappointing because he mostly played in MLS, and towards the idea that making it big on the largest stage and in the hardest competitions matters more than beating Jamaica like 15 times a year.

Unfortunately, Pulisic responded. ""When it comes to those guys, I don't know, I guess it is tough because I looked up to those guys growing up,"" he said. ""Some of these guys were my idols and I respect them so much as players."" He said he offered to play in the two pre–Gold Cup friendlies, which Mauricio Pochettino took issue with. ""With Christian, he explained that he wanted to be involved in the two games and, knowing that, I respect and understand him. I understand him, but I don't need him to understand our decisions,"" the manager said. ""Players need to listen and stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan.""

This whole saga is frustrating in its particulars. I'd prefer if the team didn't lose four in a row, mostly because smirking gasbag Alexi Lalas would not have a plank on which to advance his solution to the USMNT's woes, which is: it's time to get racist. I'd also prefer that everyone was not fighting all the time, that Pulisic could be left to rest, and that the American soccer world would not throw a fit about anything having to do with the Gold Cup.

But a stronger feeling than frustration here is malaise. The long-prophesied mass soccerification of American men's athletes has finally happened and it mostly has not mattered. MLS is still ass, dozens of players have crossed the Atlantic and proven their skill at a bunch of the biggest cubs in the world, and even though the U.S. has produced one elite player, the national team is basically as successful as it was 20 years ago. It is cool for American soccer players to finally be able to play in Europe, but it is hard to shake the slow-dawning realization that this is probably as big as soccer in America ever gets. The team will be better with Pulisic, Weston McKennie, and Tim Weah back in the fold, but you'd have to be delusional to think they can even come close to making the semifinals next summer.

If all those guys were around for the Gold Cup, the team would probably perform better, which would only serve to underscore the unavoidable point that the USMNT is a big fish in a small pond. If the U.S. were in, say, CONMEBOL, they would be regularly exposed to and in all likelihood humiliated by some of the best teams in the world. They would have legitimate competition more often than every four years, and fans would be able to feel like more games mattered than the one knockout-round match the team qualifies for and loses in the World Cup. Instead, as we have it now, the club-soccer aspect of American soccer legitimating itself has happened, and not only has national team success failed to follow, there are not even real games to play.

That is part of why the looming specter of the 2026 World Cup feels like a threat more than a promise. The rest is, well, everything else happening in the United States, both on and off the nation's soccer fields. Nobody is attending the U.S.'s big World Cup prep tournament, and the biggest story beside the empty stadia is FIFA announcing the return of racism. The U.S. government is also busy trying to terrorize and deport as many people as they can. It's not hard to imagine the Trump administration shrugging their shoulders as their ICE goons are unleashed en masse on the horrified millions of fans who travel to see their teams play in the U.S. next summer—though given the recent history of autocratic governments who have hosted the World Cup simply pausing the most public parts of their engines of violent repression for a few weeks, the more likely bad outcome is a bunch of fans simply choosing not to travel.

American soccer has always been interesting because of its contradictions. The U.S. is the most sports-upped nation in the world by every metric (Olympic success, financial heft of the stateside sports industry, etc.) except for success in the most important tournament for the most popular sport in the world. Unlike gargantuan TV rights deals or even Olympic medals, World Cup success can't be bought, and the success of much smaller countries with much richer soccer traditions compared to the U.S. bumbling its way around despite having the most money and nearly the most people suggests that there is something about winning international soccer tournaments that transcends actuarial analysis.

Enthusiasm for the American soccer project is understandable, then, both on its own terms and also because it represents the quest to find an answer to the much more complex question of what makes people good at sports. The conventional wisdom was always that the U.S. could be the best men's soccer nation in the world if our best athletes simply played soccer instead of spreading themselves thin, with the unspoken assumption of inevitability. But even that assumes a determinism that doesn't, and shouldn't, exist. And I expect the 2026 World Cup to demonstrate that.

CWC news, 5pm BST / 12pm EDT game in Philadelphia

Read today's edition of Football Daily | And email Niall

74 mins: The fans in Philly get what they want – a shot on goal from Haaland. It's created by an excellent forward run from Rico Lewis, who lays off to the striker. On the half-turn, his shot is well hit but fizzes a foot over the bar.

72 mins: Ederson takes four Wydad attackers out of the game with a chipped pass to O'Reilly and City can break – only for the ball through to Oscar Bobb to be cut out.

70 mins: This second half has definitely lacked the fizz of the first period. Reijnders looks for Savinho, who has switched to the left, but his pass is overhit.

68 mins: Gundogan comes on for Marmoush as we take a drinks break, with Wydad's Mouthi down getting treatment from cramp.

67 mins: Rico Lewis tries to thread a pass through to Haaland but can't quite find a way through the massed defenders between them.

65 mins: Rodri misplaces a pass, sending the ball out for a throw. More like Rusti, am I right? Anyway, Ilkay Gundogan is also coming on, probably for Reijnders.

“Wydad sounds suspiciously like something my sons repeatedly asked me when they were little,” writes Peter Oh. “Granted, it's probably pronounced more like Wii Dad, which is also a phase I went through.”

60 mins: Mickael Malsa replaces Zemraoui for Wydad, and he wins them a corner straight away. The first is cleared for another corner, before a foul hands City a free kick.

​59 mins: Savinho wins a corner, and that means it's time for changes. Cherki, Foden and Doku are replaced by Rodri, Haaland and Oscar Bobb.

58 mins: Wydad's system is more of a 5-3-2 now, with Amrabat alongside Lorch. That defensive setup is about to be tested by the arrival of Rodri and Haaland.

56 mins: Foden spins on the ball and shoots, but his effort is closed down and Savinho is eventually penalised for handball.

54 mins: Big chance for Doku! Wydad try to play out from the back and Ferreira slips, presenting the ball and a shooting chance. Doku's effort is well saved by the keeper, if a little central, and Wydad escape.

53 mins: The sun is out and the pace has dropped a touch after a lively first half. City's all-star substitutes are out on the touchline, warming up menacingly.

52 mins: Doku is flagged offside within 10 yards of the centre circle; Wydad break but Lorch is caught offside at the other end.

51 mins: Zemraoui plays a nice diagonal in behind, which Ederson is out to deal with. And the offside flag goes up eventually.

50 mins: City have appointed a set-piece coach this summer – James French, who previously worked at Liverpool – and it's fair to say they've offered a threat from corners thus far.

49 mins: Savinho gets down to the byline and keeps the ball in with an elastic stretch to win a corner, which is headed over at the near post by Vitor Reis.

48 mins: Zemraoui gets free down the left, and though he looks a yard offside, we play on. His shot is blocked, then the flag goes up.

47 mins: Lorch – who's on loan from another Club World Cup side, Mamelodi Sundowns – cuts in from the left and has a shot from 25 yards that flies wide of the far post. A better effort than Moufid's a moment before.

46 mins: Doku looks to play in Marmoush down the left, but Benabid is out quickly to gather the ball. At the other end, Moufid drags an ambitious shot well wide of Ederson's goal.

One change for Wydad: Cassius Mailula is replaced by Mohamed Rayhi up front. Rayhi isn't a natural No 9, and it looks like the lively Lorch will shift to centre-forward.

Catch up with this week's Knowledge:

Some big news relating to the other English team in this tournament: Chelsea's Mykhailo Mudryk could face a four-year ban after being charged with doping offences.

“I'm sitting at home about 8 miles from Lincoln Financial Field, which is a great stadium, with many happy memories for me (the Philadelphia Union's first home game thanks to a hat-trick by Seba LeToux, U2 concerts, Eagles wins etc.etc.),” writes Justin Kavanagh.

“However, the Trump-endorsed Club World Cup? No thanks. I feel like my old man when he said to me the first time The Stones played Slane Castle: ‘Those lads? I wouldn't open the curtains if they were playing out the back garden.'”

There's the half-time whistle. City lead 2-0, an early Phil Foden goal added to by Jeremy Doku, and have survived some dodgy defensive moments. It's like they never went away.

48 mins: Marmoush tries to link up with Cherki, who goes over cheaply on the edge of the area. The referee waves him up.

47 mins: At the other end, Amrabat lofts in a nice cross but finds nobody in support.

46 mins: Three minutes of added time. In the first of those, Cherki's long-range cross is headed over by Doku.

45 mins: Wydad win a free kick upfield and after it's half-cleared, Lorch pounds a long range shot wide of the far post. He's been their most dangerous player so far.

44 mins: The new-fangled Ref Cam shows us Ake and Amrabat wrestling just behind Doku. The goal stands, if anything it looked like the Wydad player started it, even if he ended up on the deck.

City double their lead! Foden swings in an excellent corner that fizzes across goal and Doku is there to meet it with a Haaland-esque volley.

40 mins: Cherki and Savinho have some fun on the edge of the area, linking up and jinking around defenders before the former wins a corner …

38 mins: O'Reilly, who is stepping into midfield from left-back in time honoured Guardiola style, tries to tee up Doku but the Belgian is muscled off the ball.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

Club World Cup

live

Updated 39s ago

Jeremy Doku has doubled Manchester City's lead in the first game of their Club World Cup defence against Wydad AC.

The Belgium forward took advantage of some static set-piece defending to poke in at the back post. It came after Phil Foden had given City the lead with the fastest-ever goal scored in the history of this tournament.

Wydad had caused plenty of problems at the other end of the pitch, but failed to take any of the big chances they created.

The Club World Cup's brightest young players – including Doue, Bellingham and Bayern's new Robben?

75' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Erling Haaland has barely touched the ball since coming on, but that was good centre-forward play.

With City bringing the ball forward outside the box, he backed into his marker, preventing him from challenging for the ball, then stepped back into a pocket of space so Rico Lewis could find him.

One touch with the sole of his foot to set up the shot... but he got too much on it, powering the ball over the bar.

74' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

He does seem the ultra-composed type, Ederson, doesn't he. So laid back as to be almost supine.

The Brazilian is closed down by Lorch outside his box, but instead of just clearing it, he takes a cute touch around the attacker, before slipping a nice pass into a team-mate.

72' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

City have completed 400 passes to Wydad's 199, almost exactly double, but that one wasn't so good!

Rodri puts too much juice on a pinged ball out to the left wing and Savinho, and the ball slips out of play.

Savinho frustrated, as is Rodri, though the City subs on the sidelines clap encouragingly in commiseration.

Not often you see two poor Rodri passes in the same game!

68' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Smart from Pep Guardiola, as you'd expect.

With Wydad retaining some threat on the counter-attack, City sacrifice forward Marmoush for midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, changing the formation to a more defensively minded 4-3-3.

Both players take on some fluids at a break in play with a Wydad player down receiving some treatment. Guardiola wipes his sweaty scalp with a towel.

It's looking hot and humid out there in Philly.

Wydad are in this match. 

It's hard to see them coming back from two goals down but they have held their own and bounced back both times after conceding.

It would not be a surprise if they nicked a goal. 

Their fans are making a lot of noise and will certainly hope they will have something to cheer before full time.

66' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Rodri, Ballon d'Or winner... just passes it straight out of play.

Nice to see it can happen to the best of us, rather than just me at Sunday league.

63' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Finally Wydad have a focal point up top in Obeng.

A clever touch from Moufid, who takes a chipped ball from goalie Benabid down and side-steps Rico Lewis before sliding into Obeng, who caresses it out to the left wing with his first touch.

Decent ball in, Ake has to step in ahead of Obeng to put it behind. Ake clutches his calf in pain. Corner, dangerous, flicked behind for another... but there's a bit of push and shove in the box and the Brazilian referee gives City a foul.

The TV cameras pan to the Wydad fans behind the goal, who are literally bouncing up and down. Loud, proud, and colourful. Those fans are doing their club justice, and then some.

Super noise.

61' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Wydad respond with a couple of changes too. Midfielder Zemraoui and veteran winger Amrabat are off, target-man striker Samuel Obeng and Mickael Malsa are on.

60' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Off: Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki, Jeremy Doku.

On: Rodri, Erling Haaland, Oscar Bobb.

What do those changes mean? Rodri alongside Reijnders in central midfield, Bobb onto the right wing, with Savinho moving from the right to the left, Haaland alongside Marmoush up top.

Back four as we were.

59' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Just before the hour mark and City have a host of players ready to come on.

They have around half a billion's worth of players (in pound sterling) among their replacements!

54' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Doku should score! It's poor play from Wydad, sleepy. It's passed across from Meijers to Ferreira, summer signing to summer signing, but Ferreira's touch is poor and means he has to go back to the goalkeeper.

Again, sloppy, the pass is off-line and awkward for Benabid, who scrapes it back to Ferreira in the nick of time before Cherki slides in to intercept. Ferreira is unaware of Doku at his back, and his heavy first touch saw him robbed by the Belgian.

Doku one on one, he rather telegraphed his effort, opening up his body like Thierry Henry of old.

Benabid guessed right and plunged to his left to make the save. Good stop. Foden wanted the pass but he wasn't close enough really, right call to shoot from Doku.

52' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Sharp from City goalkeeper Ederson, wearing a garish fluorescent pink shirt. 

Zemraoui slid a clever through ball in search of Lorch, who was making a diagonal run, but Ederson raced out to smash it away. The offside flag eventually went up anyway.

Doku, then Lorch again, at the other end, are flagged offside in quick succession. Replays show Doku appeared to be onside. I know this is in opposition to the typical thinking in the sport at the moment, but let the move play out! 

51' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

City corner, and Vitor Reis, who hasn't had the greatest game of his career so far, latches onto it.

But the ball balloons high over the bar. Disappointing considering it was another testing delivery from Foden from the right.

Should do better.

48' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Lorch receives the ball and shoots on the bounce from a fair way out. Nordin Amrabat, the 38-year-old, kindly suggests he might have laid it off. He might have.

Lorch shrugs as if to say: ‘Might as well have a go, eh?'.

Ederson pauses over the goal kick, with five Wydad players committed forwards in the press. Ederson smashes it long downfield in search of Doku, who is challenging for the ball with Moufi, one on one.

Moufi does well, bringing it out, before being barged over by Doku. Foul, free kick.

46' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Like in the losing FA Cup final against Crystal Palace, City are looking for Doku at nearly every opportunity.

The danger man. They feed him the ball, he takes on Moufi, cuts inside into space, and releases Omar Marmoush with a nice through ball.

Just a tad overhit, though, and goalkeeper Benabid is on his toes and sprints off his line to gather the loose ball.

Back into the action we go!

Pep Guardiola was on the pitch moments ago waving his arms around with characteristic gusto.

Can Wydad get back into it and finally take an opportunity?

Only one way to find out, and only one place to do so: right here, right now.

Wydad knock the ball back. Let's go!

Confirmation, Rayhi replacing the booked Mailula.

No-brainer of a sub.

Wydad AC striker Mohamed Rayhi, profiled in our piece below, is warming up energetically on the pitch in Philadelphia.

It certainly appears as if he will come on at half-time to contest the second 45.

Wydad will hope the prolific striker, who was the joint-highest scorer in the Moroccan top division last season (with 11 goals) can get on the end of some of these dangerous Amrabat crosses.

...

“The environment,” Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca said, “was a bit strange.” When his team debuted Monday at the 2025 Club World Cup, a tournament FIFA has billed as a soccer “pinnacle,” Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Maresca noted, “was almost empty.” Even when late arrivers trickled in, there were around 50,000 unfilled seats in Atlanta. Elsewhere, through four days, a majority of the tournament's 12 games haven't reached half capacity; and none have been sellouts.

The swaths of empty seats have been a stain on the new-look Club World Cup, and have sparked debate around a simple question: Why?

The simplest answer is that FIFA, with “alarming” ticket prices and flawed messaging, priced out or put off significant chunks of would-be fans.

Diehard supporters of clubs from South America and Africa have taken to the tournament. But not all of them could afford (or were allowed) to travel to the U.S. for games. Local appetite, meanwhile, was misread by FIFA and beset by the perception that this Club World Cup is a “cash grab.”

And so, there were only 22,137 people at Mercedes-Benz Stadium to see Chelsea vs. LAFC, the first-ever “competitive” match between an MLS club and a European power. There were 30,151 at Lumen Field for Seattle Sounders vs. Botafogo — fewer than the Sounders average for MLS matches. There were 11,974 at the same stadium for River Plate vs. Urawa Reds two days later, and 3,412 in Orlando for Mamelodi Sundowns vs. Ulsan HD.

“If in America you fill soccer stadiums for friendly games, then when you come with a World Cup, with the best players to win a competition, for sure [stadiums will be full],” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in April.

But he was wrong. The following is an attempt to explain why.

The Club World Cup has averaged 36,126 fans at its first 12 games, and in a vacuum, that's not a terrible number. It's not the 53,191 average attendance at the 2022 World Cup, nor the 52,314 at Euro 2024, nor the 49,406 at last summer's Copa América. But it's a decent draw that's featured fun atmospheres in New Jersey and Miami.

The problem is that 10 of 12 games have been played at NFL stadiums or the Rose Bowl.

Overall, per FIFA's announced attendances and listed stadium capacities, only 54% of seats have been full.

The explanation for the empty 46% is twofold:

1. FIFA executives, reportedly bucking advice from their U.S.-based staff, chose to host most of the tournament at massive American football stadiums rather than smaller MLS grounds.

2. Their initial ticket prices for the Club World Cup, a start-up tournament, were among the most expensive for any major soccer tournament, ever.

When FIFA first released tickets in December, the cheapest for the opener were $223 (including Ticketmaster fees, but before taxes). Many upper-deck seats at a majority of group-stage games cost upwards of $100.

The prices were ""alarming,"" Bailey Brown, president of the Independent Supporters Council, a group representing soccer fans across the U.S. and Canada, told Yahoo Sports in an email at the time. They fell in line with a uniquely American trend of soccer organizations trying to milk as much money out of people as possible. Brown was “genuinely concerned” that “many of the most passionate fans will be priced out of enjoying the sport” as a result.

Months later, with sales lagging, amid increasingly desperate attempts to drum up interest for the Club World Cup, FIFA slashed most prices. Of the 39 group games for which sufficient and analogous data was available on Ticketmaster, 33 had seen prices drop by at least 25% since December; only two had seen prices increase by at least 20%. In late May, tickets to 26 of the 48 group games were available for less than $50.

But still, many weren't selling. Why?

Because FIFA, it seems, did not promote the tournament properly.

The Club World Cup has been plagued all along by resistance from the European soccer establishment. When Infantino and FIFA finally powered through the resistance, scored a Saudi-backed broadcast deal, and got the competition up and running, they had to sell it to a skeptical public.

Their apparent strategy revolved around a fancy trophy and Infantino, who would simply state, again and again, that the Club World Cup would be the biggest and best tournament imaginable.

It would feature “the 32 best clubs and best players from all over the world,” Infantino said at December's draw. “Two, three, four million fans will be coming to the U.S.; four, five billion will be watching from home.”

Never mind that plugged-in fans knew none of this was necessarily true.

Casuals, on the other hand, had heard these types of bombastic claims before, from promoters of preseason events like the International Champions Cup. What the ICC successfully sold for several years was a chance for U.S. fans to see soccer's biggest clubs in the flesh. What FIFA had to explain to those same fans was why the Club World Cup was not just another summer exhibition.

And FIFA never really did that. It sent Infantino on a media tour in April, and he kept making the overhyped claims. A relentless digital advertising campaign screamed “THE BEST v THE BEST.” A social media push featured influencers outlining why the Club World Cup would be “the biggest sports tournament of the summer.” FIFA rarely engaged with traditional soccer media; never directly confronted criticism; and never went beyond the surface level to detail its vision or rationale for the tournament.

So, its messaging felt empty, and its credibility — already low among Western fans — wore thin.

The irony is that many critical thinkers have come around on the concept of the Club World Cup. Many believe that, over time, as fans see that players care, fans themselves will care, and the tournament's popularity will grow. This is the arc of any unproven competition. It's currently happening with the UEFA Nations League. It can happen with this one.

The problem is that FIFA priced it, and talked about it, like a proven tournament.

And now, rather than full stadiums converting skeptics, empty seats are reinforcing the perception that these matches are empty of meaning — even as many players say the opposite.

They are most meaningful, it seems, in South America and Africa. In Argentina and Tunisia, and in other countries home to participating teams, the Club World Cup is front-page news. But, for many people in those countries and elsewhere:

A vacation to America is unaffordable.

The Trump administration's unwelcoming rhetoric has made such a trip less appealing.

A U.S. visa might be difficult to obtain.

It's impossible to gauge the impact of those three factors. But consider the story of Gamal Hosni, a 28-year-old who lives in Cairo and adores Al Ahly, Inter Miami's opponent in Saturday's opener. “I really wanted to go, man,” Hosni told Yahoo Sports in a video interview. So, he says, he applied for a visitor visa, and paid the $185 fee. But his application was denied; he was forced to cancel his plans, and instead watch the game from home at 3 a.m.

With some foreign fans restricted, attendance has largely depended on the U.S. market. Thus far, expats from Egypt, Brazil, Argentina, Tunisia and elsewhere have turned up. But the stark reality is that most sports fans in the U.S. have never heard of Espérance Tunis or Ulsan HD or Botafogo.

Perhaps they've heard of Chelsea. But Chelsea has now come to the U.S. four straight summers. So has Real Madrid. Manchester City has been here three of the last four. Bayern Munich, Atlético Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Juventus have also visited recently. Their presence is no longer novel; and when they come on preseason tours, their opponents are often better — or at least more famous.

Still, it is stunning that Chelsea's 12 preseason friendlies (excluding a double-header) averaged over 50,000 fans, and never drew fewer than 32,724, whereas its Club World Cup opener drew 22,137.

A significant factor in Atlanta, and on Tuesday in New Jersey and Seattle, were the kickoff times: 3 p.m. or noon on a weekday.

The reason for those: FIFA prefers to schedule each game in a unique broadcast window to maximize total viewership.

Doing so comes at the expense of the match-going fan, which is a defensible tradeoff; in some sense, it makes the games more accessible. The baffling choice was to still ask fans to pay premium prices for tickets — plus around $30 for parking at some stadiums, $30 for a drink and food, and perhaps a vacation day.

That, in a nutshell, is why many seats have been empty.

FIFA did not respond to a pre-tournament interview request nor to questions about its ticketing strategy.

It said in a news release Tuesday that “close to 1.5 million tickets” have so far been sold. Across 63 games, that would be less than 40% of the roughly 4 million cumulative capacity.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup has gone true to form through the first three days, and Real Madrid will hope to continue that trend against Al-Hilal in Miami on Wednesday afternoon.

The Spanish giants are -340 favorites against Al-Hilal, who finished as the runners-up to Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League this season. 

This will be the first match for Real Madrid under new manager Xabi Alonso, who takes over for Carlo Ancelotti.

Real Madrid's 2024-25 season was a disappointment by their lofty standards.

After signing Kylian Mbappe, it was expected that Los Blancos would add plenty of hardware to their mantle. Instead, they finished second in La Liga to Barcelona, lost to Barca in the Copa del Rey Final, and were defeated by Arsenal in the quarterfinals of the Champions League.

For most teams, that's a fine season. But Real Madrid is not like most teams.

Under Ancelotti, Madrid were passive and happy to counter-attack, but this will not be how Alonso wants his squad to set up. 

Alonso wants to press and turn the ball over up high, which is going to be a change of pace for this roster.

There's enough talent in Real Madrid's ranks that they can win under any system, but Alonso will want to use this tournament to get on the same page as his players.

The heavyweights have fared well out of the gates in the FIFA Club World Cup. Chelsea defeated LAFC, Bayern Munich scored 10 against Auckland City, and Paris Saint-Germain took care of Atletico Madrid.

You'd think that points to a victory for Real Madrid on Wednesday, and it's likely they do win, but the price is a bit lofty considering it is the first game in charge for Alonso.

Al-Hilal has plenty of talent on the roster, so don't expect this to be a walk in the park for the Spaniards.

Instead, this sets up to be a scrappy affair, with Real Madrid working out the kinks and Al-Hilal focusing on limiting scoring chances as the underdog.

The grass installed at MetLife Stadium is already under criticism a year out from the World Cup.

Soccer teams complaining about pitch conditions is truly a tradition unlike any other. If the turf isn't to a team's liking, the world will hear about it. Therefore, it should come as no surprise whatsoever that players and coaches are sounding off about the turf installed at MetLife Stadium for the FIFA Club World Cup.

The home stadium for both the New York Giants and New York Jets has long been known as having some of the worst artificial turf in the NFL. The real grass installed for the Club World Cup, a move required by FIFA, apparently isn't much better.

There is plenty of time between now and MetLife Stadium hosting the 2026 World Cup Final in July ‘26, but the fact that teams are already moaning about the playing surface isn't exactly the greatest vote of confidence about what is to come.

FIFA Renames MetLife Stadium With Dumbest Title Imaginable For 2026 World Cup Final

Porto took on Palmeiras in the first FIFA Club World Cup match at MetLife Stadium, and neither side was pleased with the playing surface.

""It's a different grass than in Europe. My feeling was the pitch was a little bit soft and it was a little bit, not dry, but I would say that the ball wasn't traveling so fast as we are used to,"" Palmeiras' Estêvão said, according to the New York Post. ""This is a little bit of what my impression is, what my feeling is. But, everybody has to work in the same conditions and we don't search for any excuses.""

Borussia Dortmund played to a scoreless draw against Fluminense on MetLife's surface as well, and Pascal Groß had similar concerns about the grass.

""It's just a totally different football pitch than what we played the whole year. It's nothing compared to the grass we play on,"" Dortmund's Pascal Groß said after the match. ""But I'm not a fan of excuses, so that doesn't matter for me. … We need to adjust quick. We need to be able to play on different pitches.""

Complaining about grass, the same grass your opponent has to play on as well, is always a questionable move. Add in the fact that these teams should have been well aware that the surface was a new one, and the complaints come across as nothing but a whine fest.

Having said that, the playing surface has to be pristine in time for the World Cup Final.

Club World Cup

The Athletic has live coverage of Manchester City vs Wydad and Real Madrid vs. Al-Hilal at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

FIFA has decided not to show any videos, signage or marketing assets in venues hosting the Club World Cup in the United States which explicitly mention challenging racism or discrimination.

Advertisement

According to multiple sources briefed on FIFA's planning for the tournament, the world football governing body did develop promotional materials in the months leading up to the tournament for their “no racism” and “no discrimination” campaign but it has not been visible during the opening round of fixtures at the tournament in stadiums or on social media platforms.

This approach represents a significant change from previous competitions, such as the Women's World Cup in 2023 in Australia and New Zealand and the men's World Cup in 2022 in Qatar when messages were shown in the stadium on big screens and on social media.

FIFA has also not performed any announcements within its stadiums explaining the anti-racism protocols or the organisation's “universal anti-racism gesture” which was rolled out in September last year and was supposed to be applied to all competitions.

FIFA did not respond when asked if it consulted competing clubs in the Club World Cup over its strategy on these matters.

The reasons for FIFA's apparent change of policy are not known. Earlier this year, the NFL Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles marked the first time since February 2021 that “End Racism” was not included as a message in the back of a Super Bowl end zone. This was widely interpreted as a nod to the current climate in the U.S. where many corporations and institutions are abandoning their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

FIFA's President Gianni Infantino has developed a close bond with President Donald Trump's administration, even attending a Trump pre-inauguration rally, the inauguration itself and visiting the White House. FIFA did not respond when asked if the current political climate in the U.S. played any part in their decision. They did point to their statutes, which say “FIFA remain neutral in matters of politics.”

At the Women's World Cup in 2023, FIFA also rolled out a series of social causes, with armbands at the Women's World Cup such as “Unite for Inclusion” and “Unite for Indigenous Peoples”, “Unite for Gender Equality”, “Unite for Peace”, “Unite for Education for All”, “Unite for Zero Hunger”, “Unite for Ending Violence Against Women” and “Football is Joy, Peace, Love, Hope & Passion”. These messages were visible on captain's armbands, as well as being shared on LED advertising boards around the stadium. They were also present on giant screens and on flags.

In Qatar, FIFA blocked a small number of European nations from wearing a ‘OneLove' armband, which was perceived to be challenging homophobia in a country that criminalises same-sex relations, but FIFA's own campaigns during the tournament included the following slogans: No Discrimination, Save the Planet, Protect Children, End Hunger, Education for All and Be Active.

At this tournament, the only visible signs have been the non specific “Football Unites the World” slogan, which has been present on captain's armbands, and a Dance Cam, partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO), which includes the strapline “Be Active.” FIFA have maintained their partnership with the WHO but President Trump has signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the organisation.

There has been no Twitter messaging at all on the official FIFA Club World Cup account about FIFA's no discrimination or no racism campaigns.

FIFA have been asked whether the World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada in 2026, will include messaging about its anti-discrimination and anti-racism campaigns but they did not answer the question.

Only last month, FIFA President Infantino urged policy makers and legislators globally to join FIFA in the fight against racism and discrimination by imposing criminal penalties on offenders, claiming FIFA cannot win the battle alone.

He said: “FIFA's Global Stand Against Racism called for the football world to take action, to educate, to raise awareness and, when necessary, to punish,” he said.

“Racism and discrimination — they are not just wrong, they are crimes.”

In a statement to The Athletic, FIFA did not explain why they have reduced their in-tournament messaging for this competition in the United States.

A FIFA spokesperson said: “FIFA has a firm, zero-tolerance stance against all forms of discrimination and racism. This commitment was recently reinforced through the unanimous approval by the FIFA Council of the revised FIFA Disciplinary Code, which introduces new measures to fight racist abuse — including increased minimum bans for racist incidents and enhanced financial penalties as duly informed to the 75th FIFA Congress in Asuncion in May 2025.”

They also said their three-step anti-discrimination procedure is in effect should incidents occur, while also saying a social media protection service is available to players and match officials, which helps hide abuse from their social media channels.

The 2026 tournament will feature more teams and more air miles travelled than ever, casting doubt upon ambitious climate goals

As next summer's World Cup approaches, excitement is building for the biggest global soccer tournament ever held, but so too are concerns over the viability and environmental sustainability of the vastly expanded competition.

Held across 16 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico, the 2026 World Cup will be marked by the tournament expanding from 32 nations to 48 competing for soccer's most coveted prize. It will be a tournament of unprecedented scale both in terms of the number of teams, and the vast geographical expanse it will cover. Both of these factors bring significant environmental concerns, however – particularly regarding the tournament's carbon footprint and the effectiveness of Fifa's proposed mitigation strategies.

Fifa first introduced its Climate Strategy report back in 2021 in response to growing environmental concerns, launching its initiative at the UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26) that year. In the plan, Fifa pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2040. The strategy included measures such as promoting sustainable infrastructure, enhancing energy efficiency and encouraging the use of renewable energy. It also included a fair amount of carbon offsetting – a process by which entities buy “credits” that go toward environmental protection, to theoretically make up for emissions produced.

However, it has been argued by critics that Fifa's reliance on carbon offsetting lacks transparency and may not be effective in mitigating the environmental impact of its expanded showpiece tournament. The organization's previous claims of carbon neutrality for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar were deemed misleading by a Swiss regulator. Responding to complaints raised by environmental groups in five different countries, the Swiss Commission for Fairness – which is based in Fifa's home city of Zurich – found the governing body was “not able to provide proof that the claims were accurate” and “did not set out a plan to define how it will further offset emissions”.

This raises questions about the credibility of similar assertions Fifa has made about the 2026 World Cup. The tournament will feature 80 matches, spread across the three host countries. The massive geographical spread will necessitate extensive air travel for teams and fans alike, contributing to the tournament's substantial carbon emissions.

United 2026, the joint bid by the host nations, has estimated that the event will generate approximately 3.7m tonnes of CO₂, making it the highest World Cup carbon footprint ever recorded. Of this estimate, travel accounts for 85% of the emissions – 51% from international travel and 34% from inter- and intra-city travel.

The 2022 World Cup faced significant criticism for its environmental impact, but that was to do with factors other than travel. The construction of new stadiums and infrastructure, coupled with the energy-intensive cooling systems required for the desert climate, contributed to the tournament's substantial carbon footprint. Fifa estimated that the tournament was responsible for emissions of approximately 3.6m tonnes of CO₂.

In contrast, Uefa's approach to Euro 2024 in Germany seems to offer a more sustainable model. The tournament used existing stadiums, implemented energy-efficient technologies and promoted public transportation for fans and teams. These measures led to a 21% reduction in carbon emissions compared to initial forecasts. Additionally, Uefa established a €7m Climate Fund to support sustainable infrastructure projects, leaving a lasting environmental legacy for the Euros.

In fairness to the hosts, 2026 is being played under different conditions to Euro 2024 and Qatar 2022. Those tournaments were played in a single country (a tiny country in the latter case). Meanwhile, 2026 will traverse North America. The vast distances between venues in Canada, the United States and Mexico make air travel the most practical option for many teams and fans, significantly increasing emissions.

While the use of existing stadiums reduces the need for new construction, the pressure on infrastructure and transportation systems remains a concern. Efforts to mitigate these challenges include promoting public transit and reducing reliance on air travel within host cities. However, the effectiveness of these measures depends on the availability, accessibility and affordability of sustainable transportation options, in addition to the willingness of fans and teams to utilize them. And, as anyone who has used public transport in the US will tell you, it can vary from rickety but effective in cities such as New York to almost non-existent in places such as Kansas City and Arlington.

Fifa's choice of sponsorship partners for the tournament is another area in which the World Cup has come under scrutiny for its environmental impact. Partnerships with fossil fuel companies and airlines contribute to soccer's carbon footprint and raise questions about the alignment of commercial interests with stated sustainability goals. Among Fifa's many commercial partners for the 2026 tournament are Qatar Airways and Aramco, officially known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Group. It could be argued that such sponsorships undermine the organization's efforts to promote environmental responsibility.

After facing pushback against their sustainability reporting in the aftermath of the 2022 tournament in Qatar, the 2026 World Cup presents fresh challenges for Fifa and its green initiatives. But it also represents an opportunity for the organization to demonstrate a genuine commitment to environmental sustainability.

Soccer's supposed commitment to reducing emissions and easing its environmental impact is more than a mere box-ticking exercise; it is a matter of increasing importance to fans. A new study commissioned by UK-based climate change charity Pledgeball, in conjunction with the Champions League sponsor Mastercard, polled over 1,600 fans – including attendees at last year's Champions League final – on the subject of environmental sustainability in soccer. It found that 81% of respondents said they are worried about the climate crisis, and 82% said they wanted their clubs to do more to combat it.

The majority of respondents also believed that it was incumbent on governing bodies such as Fifa to take the lead by implementing a top-down approach by overseeing explicit reporting requirements and meting out punishments to clubs responsible for the highest emissions.

The sheer scope of the expanded competition next year will provide the sternest possible test of the mitigation measures Fifa has put in place. And there will be an added expectation for a greater level of transparency when it comes to the postmortem reporting of the tournament's carbon impact, after Fifa's attempts to do so after the Qatar tournament didn't stand up to scrutiny.

Set in the biggest media market on the planet, the 2026 World Cup will have record-breaking reach, but also a record-breaking carbon footprint. How Fifa tackles that issue will determine the credibility of its grand green plans.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

FIFA claimed the Club World Cup would change football ‘for the better', but the tournament has endured an underwhelming start.

When the FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) opened on Saturday, Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest footballer, weaved his magic on the field as a cluster of former stars – David Beckham, Ronaldo, Kaka, Bebeto, Roberto Baggio and Javier Zanetti – watched on from their VIP seats at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

While Messi was unable to score any goals in Inter Miami's 0-0 draw against Egyptian club Al Ahly, football fans turned up in their thousands to watch the Argentinian lead his team in what could have been a goal-fest for the home side.

The organisers, led by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, appeared pleased with the tournament opener and would have hoped for the goals, spectators and popularity to increase as the Club World Cup progressed.

Infantino has treated the tournament as his personal project and aimed to bring the biggest names in football to the United States, one of the co-hosts for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

From Inter Miami's inclusion in the CWC under a special ‘host nation' spot for the regular-season winners of MLS (other football continents had different entry criteria for qualification), to Infantino's widely-reported comment that Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo “might play in the Club World Cup”, and increasing the winner's prize money by a whopping $35m, the FIFA chief has pulled out all the stops to support his claim that this competition is “the start of something historic that will change our sport for the better,” as he said earlier this week.

However, three days in, the CWC, billed by FIFA as the most elite global club competition, has yet to match the pre-tournament hype created by the sport's governing body.

Here's the key talking points after the opening 72 hours at the Club World Cup:

Kickoffs scheduled at noon and 3pm local time on scorching hot summer days have led to players dealing with difficult weather conditions in some fixtures.

In Sunday's PSG vs Atletico group match at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, the temperature was recorded at 31 degrees Celsius (87.8 Fahrenheit) shortly after kick-off at midday local time.

PSG coach Luis Enrique said the heat “had an impact on the game.”

“The rhythm of our play was a bit lower than usual,” Enrique said in a post-match interview.

“We did very very well in difficult conditions,” PSG midfielder Vitinha said.

Every team at the FIFA Club World Cup plays three group matches in the space on nine days.

While that schedule in itself is not unusual for an international competition, the CWC has been subject to criticism from players' unions long before the first kick of the opening game, as it comes off the back of a long domestic and international season in Europe and the Middle East for many clubs, while others – from the US, South America and Oceania – have hit pause on their regular seasons and will return to their respective leagues after the Club World Cup.

“The decision to schedule the FIFA Club World Cup between June 15 and July 13 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives,” FIFPRO – the global union representing professional football players – said in a statement when the tournament schedule was released in 2024.

“The extreme mental and physical pressures at the pinnacle of the game is the principal concern of players with multiple club and national team competitions, leading to exhaustion, physical injuries, mental health issues, diminished performance, and risks to career longevity,” the statement added.

FIFPRO called for the consideration of player health and safety regulations as a “matter of urgency” but that failed to deter FIFA from tinkering with the schedule.

FIFA says the protection of player welfare has always been at the core of its decision-making and has taken multiple tangible initiatives – many of them in close cooperation with FIFPRO, according to FIFA's press office – for the effective betterment of player welfare on several levels, including an additional player substitution at Club World Cup matches as well as a concussion substitute.

On heat management for players during CWC fixtures, FIFA will enact cooling breaks in the 30th and 75th minutes if the wet bulb globe temperature exceeds 32°C (89.6°F), according to FIFA's pre-existing international tournament guidelines.

Bayern Munich made history at the FIFA Club World Cup on Sunday as they became the first team to score double digits in a single game when they thumped Auckland City, a club made up of semi-pro players with full-time day jobs, 10-0.

The 34-time German champions, fielding a full-strength team, scored four goals in the first 21 minutes of the game in front of a hapless Auckland defence.

Add to it the fact that the fixture seemed more of a practice outing than a challenge for the Bundesliga side, with Bayern coach Vincent Kompany saying: “The next game against Boca Juniors will be the highlight of the group stage.”

While minnows and favourites are often pitted together in global tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, Auckland City – the Oceania champions and rated 4,957th in the world in the Opta Power Rankings – face strong opposition in their remaining group matches.

After losing to sixth-ranked Bayern Munich, they face 24th-ranked Portuguese side Benfica and Argentinian mega club Boca Juniors, who are ranked 131.

The next-lowest ranked clubs – Al Ain, Urawa Reds, Wydad Casablanca and Ulsan HD – are due to play their opening round matches on Tuesday and Wednesday.

While Messi-mania brought the crowds in the tournament opener in Miami on June 14, and European champions PSG thrashed Atletico Madrid in front of 80,000 Los Angeles fans at the famous Rose Bowl a day later, the same cannot be said for some of the other fixtures in the opening three days.

Monday's Chelsea vs LAFC encounter at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta was played out in front of 22,137 spectators – less than one-third of the stadium's 75,000 seat capacity.

Post-match, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, when asked to describe the atmosphere in Atlanta, said: “I think the environment was a bit strange.”

The Chelsea-LAFC encounter was not the only fixture to experience a low turnout.

On Monday, a Group C match between Flamengo and Esperance de Tunis attracted 25,797 fans to Philadelphia's 69,000-seat Lincoln Financial Field, representing a 37.4% attendance rate.

A Group B match on Sunday between Botafogo and Seattle Sounders, played at the 69,000-seat Lumens Field in Seattle, drew 30,151 spectators, or 43.7% of maximum spectator capacity, according to official match figures.

Also on Sunday, the 82,500-capacity MetLife Stadium, the venue for the FIFA Club World Cup final, was filled with 46,275 fans for the Group A clash between Palmeiras and Porto, representing 56.1% of the arena's maximum spectator capacity.

Of the remaining 36 group-stage games, 13 will be weekday afternoon kickoffs and it remains to be seen whether underwhelming ticket sales at some venues will continue throughout the first phase of the tournament.

FIFA has disclosed that fans from more than 130 countries have booked tickets to attend CWC matches and the organisation said on Tuesday that close to 1.5 million tickets had been sold.

The winger has emerged as a transfer target for the two English giants, as well as many others among Europe's elite

After something of a breakout campaign with Lyon, the early signs are that Malick Fofana could be at the centre of a multi-club tug of war this summer. Chelsea and Liverpool are said to have made their interest known, while plenty of others were already reported to be keen on the 19-year-old.

A tricky, two-footed winger who has the game intelligence to match his pace and skill with end product, the young Belgian has been earmarked to reach the very top for some time, and after just one-and-a-half seasons in Ligue 1, it seems his suitors believe he is ready to take a step up.

Indeed, it seems he will have no shortage of options, and he has all the attributes to succeed wherever he ends up. GOAL has everything you need to know about the prodigious teenager...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Happy Premier League fixture release day to all who celebrate one of the most anticipated dates in the footballing calendar. Just because the 2024-25 campaign has been extended into the Club World Cup doesn't mean we can't look ahead to the new campaign, after all.

The playmaker's relationship with his new boss will be fascinating to watch after being plagued by accusations of an attitude problem

Whenever footballers talk to the media, the club's press officer is hoping they will say as little as possible and ideally stay out of the headlines. As Peter Crouch put it: ""You're doing an interview for the newspaper but you're trying not to be in the newspaper. They were so nervous about you putting your foot in it.""

Rayan Cherki opted for a very different approach when speaking to journalists for the first time since joining Manchester City. In just a five-minute exchange with reporters in Florida as City were preparing for their opening game at the Club World Cup, he left a real impression.

He outlined his ambitions to win the Ballon d'Or, saying Rodri's success in 2024 showed him that City offered a platform to become the best player in the world. And, in a statement that immediately endeared him to his new club's supporters, he said he wanted to ""kill"" Manchester United after Lyon's painful Europa League defeat to the Red Devils in April. Before that quarter-final tie, incidentally, he said he was ""ready to go to war"" with Ruben Amorim's side.

Cherki's opening statements would not have surprised anyone who has followed the Frenchman's career. He has always looked to make a mark and often has done, having become Lyon's youngest-ever goal-scorer at the age of 16 before more than one coach complained about his attitude, which was regarded as his biggest obstacle to progress.

Still, Cherki can do remarkable things on the pitch, and last season finally found the consistency he craved, contributing to 34 goals in 44 appearances. His uptick in productivity led to his long-awaited first call up to the France senior team and he marked his debut against Spain by setting himself up to score a tremendous volley in the Nations League semi-finals.

That form has also earned him a move to one of the top clubs in the world, and now Cherki has the chance to showcase his talent on the world stage. His audacious comments merely confirmed his reputation as a maverick, but the big question now is: Will this ultimate individual be able to thrive under Pep Guardiola?","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Taylor Fritz has played and beaten some of the greatest players on the ATP Tour en route to becoming world number four.

The American star enjoyed a breakout year in 2024, reaching two ‘big' finals, at the US Open and ATP Finals.

Despite coming up short in both, Fritz reached a career-high ranking of fourth in the world.

In both the ATP Finals and the US Open final, Fritz lost to world number one Jannik Sinner, a player many consider to be the toughest challenge in tennis today.

However, when asked recently who the best player he's ever played against was, Fritz named a different ATP star.

During an interview with TNT Sports on Instagram, Fritz was asked several quickfire questions, the first of which was which opponent was the toughest he's played.

A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports)

“Probably Novak [Djokovic],” he answered.

When looking at Fritz and Djokovic's head-to-head record, it's no surprise he answered as he did, having lost all ten of their ATP Tour meetings.

Just once has Fritz pushed Djokovic to a deciding set, at the Australian Open four years ago, when the injured Serb battled through to reach the fourth round.

Fritz also took the time to answer several other questions about tennis.

“Going to have to go with Tommy [Paul], because we have an Olympic medal,” said Fritz.

“Indian Wells,” he said.

“Indian Wells,” he said.

“Serena [Williams],” said Fritz.

“Novak,” he said.

After losing in the first round of this year's French Open, Fritz couldn't wait to get off the clay and move onto grass.

Beginning his grass-court season in Stuttgart, the American eased into the final without dropping a set.

There, Fritz beat home favorite Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6, to clinch the fourth grass-court title of his career.

Having won his first title of the season, many expected Fritz to make another deep run when he headed over to London for the Queen's Club Championships.

Entering the tournament as the number three seed, Fritz came face to face with French qualifier Corentin Moutet in round one.

After three sets of gruelling action, Moutet emerged victorious, 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, knocking Fritz out of the competition.

While far from his best, it wasn't a terrible performance by the world number four, who won the exact same number of points as his opponent (117).

Fritz will now turn his attention to the doubles tournament at Queen's, where he and Jiri Lehecka will take on Alex de Minaur and Alexei Popyrin on Wednesday, June 18.

He is also scheduled to appear at next week's Eastbourne International, an event he's enjoyed real success at over the years.

The 27-year-old is the most successful player in the history of the event, having won the title on three occasions.

Searching for title number four in 2025, Fritz will have a great chance to get his Wimbledon preparations back on track.

The 2025 Eastbourne International is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 23.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Alcaraz – Munar: 19.06.2025 Time TBA
H2H: 2-1

Carlos Alcaraz has won 14 straight matches. His last match before the Queen's Club was at the French Open when he made an epic comeback against Sinner in the final. This week in London, the Spaniard defeated Walton in straight sets.

Jaume Munar has lost three of his last five matches. His last match before the Queen's Club was at the French Open when he lost against Fils in five tight sets. This week at the Queen's Club, Thompson retired after losing the opening set against Munar in the opening round.

According to the bookies, Alcaraz is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. Munar has no weapons for his game. Alcaraz is a way better grass-court player than Munar, and we expect him to dominate from the start until the end.

That being said, Alcaraz covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Carlos Alcaraz -5.5 games handicap @-126 @FanDuel

Fearnley – Moutet: 19.06.2025 Time TBA
H2H: 1-0

Jacob Fearnley has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Stuttgart, Fearnley lost against Nakashima in the opening round. Around this time last season, the Brit played at the Challenger Tour level, where he had a decent success. This week in London, he defeated Bolt in the opening round in straight sets.

Corentin Moutet has won four of his last five matches. This week in London, the Frenchman qualified for the main draw tournament, winning both matches in three tight sets. In the final qualifying round, he defeated Rinderknech. Moutet upset Fritz in the opening main draw round in three tight sets.

According to the bookies, Fearnley is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. Moutet had three consecutive exhausting matches. On the other hand, Fearnley dominated the opening round, and we expect him to do so tomorrow.

That being said, Fearnley winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jacob Fearnley winning @1.53 @bet365

Lehecka – Diallo: 19.06.2025 Time TBA
H2H: first meeting

Jiri Lehecka has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Stuttgart, Lehecka lost in straight sets against Shelton in the quarterfinals. His last appearance in London was in 2023 when he lost against Alcaraz in the 1/8-Finals. Lehecka defeated de Minaur in the opening round in straight sets this week in London.

Gabriel Diallo has won six straight matches. Last week in Hertogenbosch, Diallo surprisingly won the title. He defeated Bergs in the final in straight sets and secured his maiden ATP title. With his recent solid performances, Diallo also secured a top 50 ranking. This week in London, the Canadian defeated Harris in three tight sets.

According to the bookies, Lehecka is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He dominated against de Minaur in the opening round. On the other hand, Diallo struggled against Harris in the opening round. We expect Lehecka to be a better player tomorrow.

That being said, Lehecka winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jiri Lehecka winning @1.67 @bet365

 A total of 400 tour-level wins represents a lot of potential favourites to choose from for Daniil Medvedev. 

 The 29-year-old hit the milestone Wednesday by downing Quentin Halys 6-2, 7-5 at the Terra Wortmann Open in Halle. Medvedev, a former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and 20-time tour-level champion, later identified his 2021 US Open final triumph against Novak Djokovic as an obvious win that sticks in his memory. Yet he admitted he found it hard to narrow it down to just one. 

 “Honestly, if I had to choose one, I would say beating Novak to win the US Open, because it's my only Grand Slam [title], but I could easily name like 20 really big ones in different aspects,” Medvedev told ATPTour.com. “For example, I remember a win against Hubi [Hurkacz] in Toronto in 2021. First set, I didn't know what to do. He played good, I didn't play my best, and he was absolutely all over the place and didn't give me any chance. It was 6-2. 

 “I saved a break point early in the second set and I was saying to myself, ‘I'm not playing good, he's playing amazing, there is no way I will win this match'. Then I managed to serve better, I won the tie-break somehow 7/5, finishing with an ace, and then I won Toronto, which gave me a confidence boost. I won the US Open two weeks later.” 

HUGE 🤩 https://t.co/5uPKTJloAs

 Medvedev's 2-6, 7-6(6), 7-6(5) quarter-final win against Hurkacz in Toronto that year may not be etched in the memory of many fans nearly four years on. Yet the current World No. 11 says he sees his total win tally, and indeed his achievements in tennis as a whole, as a product of such small moments. 

 “There are many wins which by themselves don't really represent anything,” said Medvedev. “But if you didn't have them, maybe you would not have your first title, and you wouldn't have the career you have.” 

 Perhaps more understandably, a 6-3, 6-1 win against Horacio Zeballos on the grass of ‘s-Hertogenbosch in 2016 also sticks in Medvedev's memory. It was his first tour-level victory. 

 “I actually remember Zeballos talking about it to me,” recalled Medvedev. “He said that he just came after Roland Garros, so the transition [from clay to grass] was not easy. He was like, ‘OK, I'm playing some guy who is ranked like 250', so he was kind of happy about it. 

 “Then I beat him good, so that was a fun moment and it was of course a great feeling. I was very young, so it made a lot of adrenalin and emotion come out, and I was very happy about it.”

Awful Announcing

There were a lot of skeptics when TNT took the reins of the U.S. coverage of the French Open (more about the name below). The outlet hadn't aired tennis since 2003, the incumbent NBC had broadcast from the red clay for nearly half a century, and TNT's move was viewed as part of a desperate scramble to acquire rights to fill the void left by the loss of the NBA.

But the fortnight in Paris changed that outlook and left many tennis fans wishing TNT could do more tennis.  Beyond the solid ratings, studio commentators Andre Agassi and Sam Querrey were breakout stars, and the studio set outside the main stadium became a go-to stop for players (women's singles champion Coco Gauff appeared four times). TNT's efforts to mic players and coaches was illuminative, though limited and an area the network needs to work through to get more participants. 

Awful Announcing spoke with Craig Barry, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief content officer and veteran of sports telecasts about why TNT would not call the event the French Open, Andre Agassi's possible return, and TNT's coverage compared to the other three Slams. The conversation is edited for clarity and conciseness.

Awful Announcing: How was your first French?

Craig Barry: The thought process was can we create an experience for fans that is kind of more engaging and more fun… I want to be careful, because I'm not saying the older, the coverage before us is bad. I just felt like there was an opportunity to grow and push the sport forward…And whenever you feel like you've pushed something a little bit forward, or set the bar, humbly at a Pacific height that you've accomplished something that's pretty special in your career.

Tennis fans loved Andre Agassi's commentary. Will he be back, will his role expand?

Barry: This was the first time that Andre had done it. And there's no question his tennis IQ is next level to say the least. He brought a level of analysis that we haven't seen in the sport. His analysis, philosophy is just so unique and interesting that it's interesting for the hardcore player, and it's also interesting for the casual player. Look, this being the first time, I like to think that he had a good time, and he'd like to continue to contribute, but I can't speak for Andre. He came on the pretense of, ‘I'm going to try this out, and then we'll kind of see where it goes from here.'

Have you had any follow up discussions with him?

Barry: No; other than thanking him and telling him how special it was having him,

Another top new performer was San Querrey, why did you choose him?

Barry: The truth is John (Tobias) who represents Sam, sent me a bunch of links of him on Tennis Channel, and he was really, decent, like nothing that really stood out to be honest with you. And then I caught his podcast with (John) Isner and I was like, `Oh, this is interesting.' And then I went to social media, and I saw a bunch of his posts. Some were pickleball posts, some were tennis posts. And there I saw what I would say was the real Sam; kind of really opinionated, outspoken, really great timing, like some comedic timing, and he didn't take himself so seriously. Was authentic, everything that we believe in from our DNA. And that was all it took.

Going into the French TNT's plan was to mic coaches during matches and players at practice, but there wasn't a lot of this.

Barry: That's regulated by the (French Tennis) Federation. And then you have to go to each player. It's not like you're dealing with a players' union. You're dealing with each individual player and their ecosystem. And so you're going to each player individually, and then, of course, you're going to the Federation and saying, like, “Hey, is it okay if we do this or try this?:

So you have to get an agreement from the Federation, and then go and get an agreement from the player, and specifically the player's coach. And it took, it kind of took form in different ways. Ben (Shelton) was live on two different instances, Brian, his father (and coach), was live when Ben was playing, and (Darren) Cahill was, we would be live while he's practicing right where he was practicing with (his client Jannik) Sinner.”

TNT studiously called the event Roland-Garros, which while its formal name, is not what Americans know it as. Were you contractually obligated to do so?

Barry: It is called Roland-Garros.

TNT's Charles Barkley said calling it Roland-Garros and not the French Open is stupid.

Barry: Domestically, you can call it the French. You got to call it what it is. But if you refer to it as the French Open, I think it's fine; I reference it as the French Open occasionally, but when you're presenting it, it is Roland Garros… It's not a contractual thing.”

Do you want more tennis on TNT?

Barry: We'd love to do more, but, it comes down to rights and availability. I'm sure you're familiar with the NBA on TNT and NHL and TNT and in, I think, when you talk about what we were the most proud of it felt like it's a TNT show, right? Like it felt like it had TNT DNA.

• I talked docs and tennis with the great Richard Deitsch.

• Wimbledon targets India.

Onward …

Hi Jon,

Thank you for the mailbag as always.

The ceremony for [Rafael Nadal] at Roland Garros, the venue of his greatest achievements, was entirely fitting and wonderful to watch. It got me thinking of [Roger] Federer and [Andy] Murray, who had similarly fitting farewells at the Laver Cup and Wimbledon. They were all honoured in the places you might call their spiritual tennis homes.

It got me thinking of [Novak] Djokovic, whose own retirement is edging closer one way or another. Where would his grand send-off likely be? Australia is arguably the place of his greatest triumphs, but it is on another continent, and they also blocked his entry at one point. He deserves every bit the same honour, and has won in insane numbers pretty much everywhere. And yet nowhere is quite his.

I wonder if these thoughts entered his mind too? What are your thoughts?

Beate, London

• Great question. To be clear: We should all hope this ceremony is in 2040. It's Djokovic's decision. No one is pushing him out the door. But eventually, he'll retire and it's fair to speculate how and where.

You're quite right to note that while Djokovic saw his greatest (and first) success in Australia, it's too fraught. He's not going to hold his valedictory in the same country that detained and deported him. It's also too far—geographically and in terms of time zones—from his base in Europe.	

Djokovic has no real Laver Cup brand extension. He can't go to Roland Garros after Rafa-fest 2025. Wimbledon is an option—don't look now but Djokovic has won seven titles at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, as many as Pete Sampras. And only seven fewer than Federer—but that seems a little off.

My guess? Djokovic being Djokovic, he will do something off the menu, in complete resistance of convention. A mic-drop retirement, courtside with his kids. An elaborate ceremony on Stephen Schwarzman's balcony. A dinner theater song-and-dance revue doubling as a retirement announcement. Or, he will do something in Greece. Or, pending reconciliation, back in Serbia, celebrating his country in conjunction with his unparalleled achievements (and his inevitable pivot to politics).

Jon, how can tennis build on that great French Open. You and Andy were right to call it one of the best ever. But how can tennis make sure this isn't a one-off?

James, B.C.

• If only there were another big event right away that could draft off these good vibes … that was a joke. For as often as we lament the traffic jam that is the tennis calendar, it's a real benefit that we have another major starting in a few days. 

Obviously, if Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner can meet in the final again, another chapter in a gripping rivalry, it will help. And if Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka have another showdown with the trophy on the court, that would be great, too. 

Short of that, one hopes the casual fans who tuned into two classic sporting events stick around. (At least in the U.S., if ESPN could lean into this—and promote tennis during the NBA Finals the way that TNT did—that would be helpful.)

If this were a conventional business, there would be meetings discussing the precise point you raised. How do we keep this momentum going? How do we capitalize on this bump? What went right in Paris that we can incorporate going forward? If only tennis weren't so balkanized.

Hi Jon, Alcaraz and Sinner gave us a match worthy of Federer-Nadal Wimbledon 2008 and Borg-McEnroe Wimbledon 1980. If not quite as great as those, at least as memorable and drama-filled. And as in all truly great rivalries, it will drive both players to further excellence they would not reach otherwise. Let us hope they both stay healthy for many years to come, so they may continue to contend with each other and enthrall the tennis public. 

And why is it we so often see a player, even a great player, say that their opponent won because they themselves played poorly that day. Hadn't it occurred to them that the main reason they played poorly was in reaction and response to the better play of their opponent? Always best to be gracious in defeat. You look the better for it, always.

Thanks for your great coverage, as always. Looking forward to Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows!

Eric of Myrtle Beach (formerly of Jackson Heights)

• Thanks. Let's go in reverse order. Yes, some days you play better than others. But before denigrating your performance—and this goes way beyond tennis—it's helpful to ask why. Might it be because the opponent is creating circumstances that cause you to miss? Or adjust your risk tolerance? Or plays defense that stymies your offense? Like most sports, like most competitive endeavors, tennis does not exist in a vacuum. Your opponent has bearing on how well or poorly you play, whether you admit it or not.

“Where does this match rank?” was a question in heavy rotation last week, referencing, of course, Sinner and Alcaraz. After a week of cooling off, not much shine has diminished. Two rivals. No. 1 vs. No. 2. The match that had everything you could want in a sporting event: sways of momentum, endurance, shotmaking, mettle, inflection points, misses, defeat-from-the-jaws-of-victory and victory-from-the-jaws-of-defeat … all garnished with a sudden death ending.

This match was worthy and noteworthy, as well, for what it lacked: gamesmanship, controversy, injury, rain, etc. I'm biased toward the Federer-Nadal 2008 Wimbledon final. But if this match didn't overtake it, it is 1A in my book. Regardless, a sensational sporting event and a sensational day for tennis. 

Hi Jon,

As commentators have repeatedly labeled the Alcaraz/Sinner final as the second longest grand slam final, I can't help but think that the method of measuring match time is somewhat flawed. That 2012 outing down under between Nadal and Djokovic, the current acknowledged winner of “longest final”, was over-represented, in my opinion, given the pre-serve rituals of both players before a serve clock was implemented. I doubt anyone has compiled the actual time playing points for both matches, excluding incessant ball bouncing, but if they had, I have no doubt that Alcaraz and Sinner would reign supreme. 

Hudson, MA

Miles Benson

• Another defective tennis stat: time of match.Two players bounce the balls 25 times and/or go through an elaborate ritual before each serve? (Just hypothetically, of course.) It adds to match time. Players have a prolonged disagreement with the chair umpire, stop play and demand the supervisor make a cameo? It adds to match time. Players take bathroom breaks, sometimes dubiously to break opponents' rhythm and momentum. The meter is running. A spectator in the stands needs medical attention and play is stopped. The clock is still running. The time of match stat is wildly imprecise.

Note that in the case of Alcaraz and Sinner there were none of the above. Brisk pace of play. No long breaks. No unforeseen delays. It was five hours and 29 minutes, and the match seemed both longer and shorter, no?

Watching the women's Roland Garros final on TV—it seems Sabalenka's grunting is too loud and too long and should be considered a hindrance. Do you agree? And why is there no correction given to her?

Laura W.

• The periodic weigh-in here. I want to acknowledge that this is an issue for many of you. I also want to push back a bit and encourage differentiating between grunting that is strategic or gamesmanship and grunting that is the soundtrack of exertion and effort. I've always felt Sabalenka fell squarely in the latter camp. 

Again, I understand that grunting is annoying for many of you. I agree that the WTA's historic unwillingness to confront top players about it can come across as cowardly. But—especially when it's coming from the hardest hitters, male and female—I look at (hear it?) much as I do profuse sweating. It's a cost of doing business.

Hi Jon,

Why is Chris Evert talking so much about Serena Williams. It's time for TNT to find a new panel. They just spent the better part of the pre-final panel discussion talking about Serena Williams and as always, Chris Evert continues to bring her up during the matches also.

Time to move on … It's quite annoying.

Brian Krauel, Ottawa, Ontario

• No one puts Chrissy in a corner!

Distilled, this is the problem with TV. One person says, Why are you dwelling on Serena? The next person says, Serena retired with 23 majors. Why are the commentators ignoring her? The same way people say, We need more statistics, while the next viewer says, Why gum up this theater with math?

The women's world number one tennis player says she was ‘super emotional' and ‘completely unprofessional' after losing the French Open final to the American.

Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologise for the “unprofessional” comments she made following her loss to her American rival in the final of the French Open.

The top-ranked Sabalenka said on Tuesday that her remarks after her loss to Gauff at Roland-Garros were a mistake.

In her post-match media address in Paris, the Belarusian had suggested that the American's win was more due to her own errors than Gauff's performance.

Sabalenka had been poised for victory after claiming the opening set in a tiebreak, only to watch Gauff orchestrate a stunning 6-7(5) 6-2 6-4 comeback to claim her second Grand Slam title.

The 27-year-old made 70 unforced errors in the final and later said at the news conference that Gauff won “not because she played incredible, [but] because I made all of those mistakes” – comments she has since regretted making.

“That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka told Eurosport Germany.

“I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then. You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward – not immediately, but recently.”

She said she wrote to Gauff to apologise and “make sure she knew she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her”.

“I never intended to attack her,” Sabalenka added. “I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I'm not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realised a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?”

Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, had lost to Gauff in the 2023 US Open final, where she also won the first set.

“I kept getting so emotional,” Sabalenka added. “So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn't be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.”

Aryna Sabalenka has given Coco Gauff a written apology for her reaction after the pair's Roland-Garros final earlier this month. (Getty Images: Julian Finney)

Aryna Sabalenka has written to Coco Gauff to apologise for what she deemed to be an ""unprofessional"" reaction to the pair's French Open final.

Sabalenka initially suggested she had lost the final to Gauff down to her own errors, rather than Gauff's performance.

Her apology came after Gauff asked people to give the world number one ""a little bit of slack"".

Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologise for the ""unprofessional"" comments she made following her loss to her American rival in the final of the French Open.

Speaking to Eurosport Germany, the top-ranked Sabalenka said her remarks after her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 loss to Gauff at Roland-Garros this month were a mistake.

In her post-match press conference in Paris, Sabalenka had suggested that the result was more due to her own errors than to Gauff's performance.

""That was just completely unprofessional of me,"" Sabalenka said.

""I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then.

Coco Gauff continues a spectacular season for American women at the grand slams, battling from a set down to topple world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open final.

""You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward — not immediately, but recently.""

Sabalenka hit 37 winners but finished the final with 70 unforced errors — compared to Gauff's 30.

She said she wrote to Gauff to apologise and ""make sure she knew she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her"".

""I never intended to attack her,"" Sabalanka added.

""I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I'm not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realised a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?""

Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff in the 2023 US Open final, where she also won the first set.

""I kept getting so emotional,"" Sabalenka added.

""So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn't be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.""

ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.

Sabalenka's apology comes after Gauff said she was ""a little bit surprised"" by the reaction of the Belarusian superstar.

""At the end of the day, what happened, happened. I won because I earned that win,"" she told ESPN's First Take.

""We both had to play in the wind, we both had to deal with those conditions. I didn't feel great on the court at all.

""I went down 4-1 and I thought I was playing the worst tennis of the tournament, but the difference was, I was able to recognise that and find a different way to try and win that match.

""She's probably emotional about it, so I'm not going to take it too [personally]. I do hope people give her a little bit of slack too.""

Gauff and Sabalenka will both be in action at Wimbledon among the top seeds in the ladies' singles draw.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Carlos Alcaraz breaks his ban from coach as truth about Ibiza trip emerges","https://www.themirror.com/sport/tennis/carlos-alcaraz-french-open-wimbledon-1214999","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 11:16:00 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz continued his tradition of partying in Ibiza just days after his tennis coach advised against the move.

The Spaniard headed to the Balearic Island to celebrate his incredible French Open win, where he battled back from two sets down against Jannik Sinner to lift the Coupe des Mousquetaires. Alcaraz's coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, told El Larguero that he wanted the young star to have a good time, but it was ""no longer about the word 'party', but about disconnecting.""

He added: ""[It's about] being with his friends and not thinking about tennis and being a normal 22-year-old, and returning to work with enthusiasm.""

However, it seemed that Alcaraz enjoyed a fair amount of partying during the first night in Ibiza. Although he admitted that he has changed his ways slightly as he has gotten older.

Speaking to EFE, the 22-year-old stated that he was ""more lively"" in Ibiza previously, as he chose to avoid multiple late nights in celebration of his Roland-Garros triumph earlier this month.

Alcaraz said: ""They were fun, but this year was quieter than the previous one. Last year was more lively. I went out on the first night and then didn't go out at night on the other two.

""In bed by 12 on Tuesday and Wednesday, although I did go out in the afternoon. I'm getting older and my body can't handle it anymore.""

The two-time Wimbledon champion opened up about the criticism he's faced before for his youthful behavior. Alcaraz added: ""There are situations where many people might not agree, where you might think yes, but they don't agree, but in life, I want to make my own mistakes.

""I'm glad that this year, people are telling me to go wherever I want, to disconnect, because the support is good for me in certain situations. Maybe in a few years, I won't be able to go, but now these moments to disconnect are good.

""It's probably a tradition. It's mid-season. It's the best time after Roland-Garros for those holidays. It's not so much about where you go, but more about being able to refresh physically. Having that time off is great. And now I can come back with more energy.""

When asked if anyone on his team, including coach Ferrero, tried to shut down his Ibiza getaway, Alcaraz added: ""No, they didn't do it. They knew I was going to be 100%.""

The young tennis star admitted that his stunning turnaround in Paris even surprised himself by his own standards. Down 6-4, 7-6 in the early sets, Alcaraz bounced back in epic fashion to win the next three sets 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 in a marathon match clocking in at five hours and 29 minutes.

Reflecting on his emotions after the monumental triumph, Alcaraz said: ""I keep watching it, and I still can't believe I was able to come back from that.""

The Spanish sensation is back on the court at The Queen's Club in London ahead of aiming for a third straight Wimbledon title, escaping an upset by Australian lucky loser Adam Walton to advance to the last 16.

Petra Kvitova is returning to Wimbledon after the 2011 and 2014 champion was awarded a wild card Wednesday for this year's tournament.

Kvitova, 35, last played at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament in 2023. She became a mother for the first time when her son was born during last year's Wimbledon tournament.

She made her return to the WTA Tour in Austin, Texas, in February after 17 months away from the court and is currently ranked 572nd. Kvitova, a former world No. 2, lost in the first round of a WTA 500 event on grass at Queen's Club earlier this month.

Kvitova, from the Czech Republic, was the only non-British player to get a singles wild card to the main draw Wednesday.

The other seven players with wild cards for the women's draw include British players Heather Watson, Harriet Dart and Jodie Burrage, while Dan Evans is among seven British players given a wild card for the men's draw. One more men's wild card is due to be announced ""in due course,"" organizers said.

Sebastian Korda is among the early Wimbledon casualties, having been forced to skip the Grand Slam this year.

Korda once backed himself to win Wimbledon, but the American has only ever managed to reach the fourth round.

The grass court event gets underway in London later this month, following the Australian Open and French Open in the Grand Slam schedule.

ATP Tour number one Jannik Sinner successfully defended his title in Melbourne this year, with Carlos Alcaraz doing the same in Paris.

And the Spaniard will now be looking to repeat that trend at Wimbledon, having won the tournament in both 2023 and 2024.

But unfortunately for Korda, he will not be among the players looking to knock Alcaraz off his perch in the English capital.

Sharing an update on his Instagram story, the American posted an image of himself on crutches with his leg in a cast.

The 24-year-old accompanied that with the message: “Unfortunately no Wimbledon for me this year. Stress fracture in my shin during the clay. Been a tough 12 months but better days ahead.”

It is certainly a very unfortunate situation for Korda, who looks upbeat despite the disappointing timing of the injury.

He once reached a career-high ranking of 15th on the ATP Tour, but has recently dropped three places to 26th.

A further drop should be expected given his impending absence, but hopefully he can return to the court in the very near future.

Korda certainly isn't the only high-profile player to be missing from the All England Club this year, with Kei Nishikori withdrawing from Wimbledon due to injury.

Alejandro Tabilo is another Wimbledon casualty, but star names Sinner, Alcaraz and seven-time champion Novak Djokovic are all expected to take part.

Taking place in London, the iconic grass court Grand Slam is set to be played over 14 days from June 30 to July 13.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The couple that plays together stays together.

Australian No. 1 Alex de Minaur says he ""definitely"" aims to partner fiancee Katie Boulter in the US Open Mixed Doubles tournament this summer.



Nine of the world's Top-10 women and nine of the world's Top-10 men are in the US Open Mixed Doubles tournament, which will be played during US Open Fan Week on Tuesday, August 19, and Wednesday, August 20, at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

World No. 12 de Minaur told the media at Queen's Club the couple hopes to play the US Open together.

""Yeah, we're definitely going to be keen to try and play if they allow us to and if they want us to,"" de Minaur told the media at Queen's Club. ""If that's an option, then we'll definitely be up for it.""

One of tennis' top glamor couples announced their engagement on December 23rd on social media.

Earlier this season, de Minaur shared earning ""big bucks"" to pay for the wedding is one of his driving forces on court these days.

“Realistically, what's driving me at the moment is trying to earn some big bucks for this wedding budget,” De Minaur told Tennis Channel in April. “That's the only thing on my mind—trying to win as many matches as I can, because I've started to look at venues and it's expensive. I can tell you that.”

Given the US Open Mixed Doubles champions will earn $1 Million for capturing the 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles crown, that could be even more motivation for de Minaur and Boulter to join forces in Flushing Meadows and cover their wedding budget.

The entry list for the 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles Championship includes the following teams (listed by combined singles ranking):

Emma Navarro and Jannik Sinner
Qinwen Zheng and Jack Draper
Jessica Pegula and Tommy Paul
Jasmine Paolini and Lorenzo Musetti
Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz
Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev
Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe
Aryna Sabalenka and Grigor Dimitrov
Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud
Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas
Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz
Belinda Bencic and Alexander Zverev
Olga Danilovic and Novak Djokovic
Taylor Townsend and Ben Shelton
Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori
Naomi Osaka and Nick Kyrgios

In total, 16 teams have entered as of June 16th.

The entry window will close on July 28 at 12:00 ET, at which time the top eight teams with the best combined singles ranking at the time will officially be in the field/draw via direct acceptance.

The remaining eight teams will be determined via wild card and announced on a date to follow.

“In our initial discussions about reimagining and elevating the US Open Mixed Doubles Championship, we wanted to find a way to showcase the world's best men and women competing with and against one another, and we were confident that we would be able to get the top players in the game excited about this unique opportunity,” said Lew Sherr, CEO and Executive Director, USTA. “Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited.

""It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do, and we know that the fans will love it.”

...

Alexander Zverev breezed into the second round of the Halle Open on Wednesday, 6-2, 6-1 over American Marcos Giron, and also found time to help an injured spectator.

Second seed Zverev brought a bag of ice to a woman to ccol her neck where she was hit by a part of an advertising board that had fallen from an upper tier.

The 62-year-old woman was tended to by paramedics and taken to hospital for observation, but she appeared largely unhurt.

""This has never happened in the 32-year history of the tournament. We deeply regret the incident,"" tournament director Ralf Weber said, promising the women a free ticket for the whole tournament next year as a small compensation.

The match which was in the first set soon resumed, and Zverev won in 1 hour 19 minutes, with the help of 10 aces and 22 winners. He did not face a break point while breaking 43rd-ranked Giron four times.

""I hope the lady is OK. Something like that should of course not happen,"" Zverev said post-match.

""Of course I am happy with the way I played. But the most important thing is that everyone here goes home healthy and happy.""

Zverev is making another attempt at winning a first career grass court title. He was a Halle runner-up twice and last week lost another final on the surface, against American Taylor Fritz in Stuttgart.

Zverev, who next meets Italian Lorenzo Sonego, is the second seed in Halle, behind world number one and defending champion Jannik Sinner of Italy, who won his first match on Tuesday.

Other action Wednesday saw two Russians advance.

Mixed doubles has not been relevant since Roger Federer and Martina Hingis represented Switzerland at the Hopman Cup, or when Steffi Graf and Boris Becker did the same for Germany in the early 1990s.

The U.S. Open is attempting to revitalize the format by offering both riches and a platform to shine under the brightest lights.

On Tuesday, the organizers of the American major announced that high-profile names, including Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, will participate in a mixed doubles event between August 19 and 20. 

The tournament, preceding the main singles draw, will showcase 16 teams, including the top eight teams based on their combined singles rankings (ATP and WTA) as well as eight wild-card entries. 

The teams will vie for a prize of $1M while playing at the two largest stadiums of the U.S. Open: Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong Stadium.

While Sinner will team up with American world No. 9 Emma Navarro, Alcaraz is entered with 2021 U.S. Open winner Emma Raducanu. Djokovic will play alongside fellow Serbian Olga Danilovic, and teenage prodigy Mirra Andreeva will pair with fellow Russian Daniil Medvedev.The tourney will also feature All-American duos such as Jessica Pegula and Tommy Paul, Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Townsend and Ben Shelton. Furthermore, real-life couple Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas will compete for the $1M prize as well.

The USTA deserves kudos for attempting to rekindle fan interest in mixed doubles. According to Lew Sherr, the USTA's CEO and executive director, several top-ranked players voluntarily entered the mix, which left the organizers pleasantly surprised. 

""...We were confident that we would be able to get the top players in the game excited about this unique opportunity,"" he said. ""Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited. It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do, and we know that the fans will love it.""

2003 U.S. Open winner Andy Roddick feels the star-studded tournament could prove to be tennis' version of an All-Star weekend.

""Anyone who has questioned this move from the U.S. Open is wrong based on who's playing in this,"" he told The Tennis Channel. ""If our goal is to grow the game, this is the win. This is how it happens. I've always said tennis doesn't have an All-Star weekend. This could be our All-Star weekend.""

To Roddick's point, USTA has smartly organized the mixed-doubles event during the weekend before the main singles draw, giving fans a chance to warm up and get excited for the main tournament. The NBA similarly uses the All-Star weekend to get fans hyped about the second half of the season, a strategy that typically works in their favor.

If the event proves successful, it could propel other majors to follow suit. This could be a shot in the arm for the sport in general.

Defending US Open mixed doubles champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori have entered this year's overhaul of the competition alongside singles stars Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka, Naomi Osaka and Elena Rybakina.

At this year's US Open, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori will attempt to defend their mixed doubles crown in a brand new format that sees them joined by singles stars from Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka to Naomi Osaka and Elena Rybakina.

The Italian duo are the current holders of two of the four mixed doubles majors, having also added this year's Roland Garros trophy to their haul. The USTA's overhaul of the competition means that it will now be a 16-team field competing on August 19-20, the tournament's Fan Week. Matches will be best of three sets with no-ad scoring and a 10-point super-tiebreak in lieu of a full third set. Sets will be short sets (first to four games, or a tiebreak played at 4-4) except the final, which will be first to six games, with a tiebreak played at 6-6).

Errani and Vavassori are one of 16 teams who comprise the initial entry list, and are joined by a slew of singles stars from both the WTA and ATP tours. The only players in this week's Top 11 of either tour who have not entered are Coco Gauff and Holger Rune. In order of combined singles rankings, the list is as follows:

1. Emma Navarro (USA) and Jannik Sinner (ITA)2. Zheng Qinwen (CHN) and Jack Draper (GBR)3. Jessica Pegula (USA) and Tommy Paul (USA)4. Jasmine Paolini (ITA) and Lorenzo Musetti (ITA)5. Elena Rybakina (KAZ) and Taylor Fritz (USA)6. Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev7. Madison Keys (USA) and Frances Tiafoe (USA)8. Aryna Sabalenka and Grigor Dimitrov (BUL)9. Iga Swiatek (POL) and Casper Ruud (NOR)10. Paula Badosa (ESP) and Stefanos Tsitsipas (GRE)11. Emma Raducanu (GBR) and Carlos Alcaraz (ESP)12. Belinda Bencic (SUI) and Alexander Zverev (GER)13. Olga Danilovic (SRB) and Novak Djokovic (SRB)14. Taylor Townsend (USA) and Ben Shelton (USA)15. Sara Errani (ITA) and Andrea Vavassori (ITA)16. Naomi Osaka (JPN) and Nick Kyrgios (AUS)

Aside from Errani and Vavassori, the only players on the list to have reached a Grand Slam mixed doubles final to date are Townsend (the 2024 US Open runner-up with Donald Young and the 2025 Roland Garros runner-up with Evan King) and Pegula (the 2023 US Open runner-up with Austin Krajicek).

Four teams on the list have previously competed together before. As well as Errani and Vavassori, Danilovic and Djokovic compiled a 2-0 record at the 2024 United Cup; Andreeva and Medvedev lost in the first round of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games (to Errani and Vavassori); and Badosa and Tsitsipas lost in the first round of the 2024 US Open.

The entry window for the tournament will close on July 28, at which point the top eight teams with the best combined singles rankings will gain direct acceptance. The remaining eight teams will be determined via wild cards and announced at a later date.

Spanish sensation Carlos Alcaraz has declared fellow US Open champion Emma Raducanu will be the boss when they step out together in a revamped and experimental mixed doubles at the grand slam in New York in August.

As for Nick Kyrgios's high-profile partnership with Naomi Osaka, the champion who lit the Olympic Cauldron to start the Tokyo games in 2021? That might depend on whether the Aussie gets to the start line for the US Open's big gamble in tennis. 

Either way, those pairings are among the 16 star-studded combinations already entered for the reimagined event as US Open organisers wager on a format they believe will make mixed doubles a winner, with the victors pocketing A$1.54 million.

A single Tweet was all it took to get the world of tennis talking about an event that can be a side show in majors, with more than two million people having viewed the US Open's initial post about the 16-pair event within 12 hours of the confirmation of entrants.

To be played under the contentious Fast 4 format Australian officials deployed a few years back, it will feature eight seeded combinations based on singles rankings and another eight wildcard combinations, which is where Kyrgios would slot with Osaka.

Australian star Alex de Minaur and his fiance Katie Boulter, the former English No.1, could be among those to compete as well, with entries for the lucrative 16-pair format closing in late July.

People are talking and the timing of the announcement struck an ace, coming not long before dual-Wimbledon champion Alcaraz was about to speak at Queens following an opening round win over Aussie Adam Walton on Tuesday. 

Given Raducanu is a tabloid dream in the United Kingdom, with her every move covered at length four years after her improbable triumph in New York, it was a certainty her patnering with Alcaraz would get tongues wagging.

The Spaniard, fresh from a successful defence of his Roland Garros title, was happy to oblige, even quipping Raducanu played hard to get when he asked her to partner with him.

“She's going to be the boss,” he said, breaking into a smile.

“She took a while (to say yes). Not that much. But obviously she had to ask (her management) and she had to think a little bit.”









Alcaraz said that he was approached by US Open officials to take part and securing the biggest names is clearly important if the tournament, to be run over two days starting just 48 hours after the Cincinnati Open final, is to prove a winner.

“The US Open came to us and gave us opportunities to play mixed doubles. I'm super excited about it. I think it is going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament,” he said.

“I (have known) Emma since a really long time ago (and) I have a really good relationship with her, so it's just going to be interesting. Obviously (both) of us are going to enjoy it. for sure. I will try ... to put my doubles skill on it. We will try to win. But obviously it is oging to be really, really fund.”

Mixed doubles and doubles finals tend to be held as an add-on event to the singles finals, though they can draw a crowd. 

At Roland Garros, organisers open the major court to grounds pass holders for the finals, which boosts attendances and makes for a good atmosphere. But the US Open move will further the revenue earned at what is already a behemoth when it comes to making cash.





During a chat with a senior US Open official at Roland Garros earlier this month, there was confidence that the timing and nature of the format would draw big attendances and also significant viewership in the latest gambit to make grand slams three week events.

The Australian Open uses charity fundraises and exhibitions to boost attendances during qualifying week. At the French Open, the qualifying event alone is enough, with fans cramming into Roland Garros. Roehampton also draws crowds for Wimbledon qualifying.

Tickets for the mixed doubles tournament were selling for more than A$100 on Wednesday, but that is no surprise at a tournament where ground passes for the opening Sunday were priced at $423 on one on-sale service. That does not deter fans from attending.

Quizzed about concerns the format devalued what is still an event with a grand slam title, the official noted that the Fast 4 format is officially recognised by the International Tennis Federation and that the rules allowed majors discretion with mixed doubles.

US Open chief executive Lew Sherr expressed confidence “the fans will love it” while saying the initial pairings shows “the players are behind it”.

“Seeing the names that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited,” he said.

It is worth noting that the announcement comes at a time when the world's top players are pressing grand slam bodies about prize money amid a gulf in what is offered compared to the windfalls made by majors. 

At Roland Garros, several of the world's top ranked players met with representatives of the grand slam events including Australian Open officials to discuss the prizemoney percentage per tournament revenue disparity. 











Not everyone is happy, with former Australian Open chief executive Paul McNamee and esteemed coach Sven Groeneveld among them.

McNamee, who won the 1985 Wimbledon mixed doubles title, believes it devalues the integrity of the event by precluding doubles players from using their specialist ranking to enter.

“Much air play around the US Open mixed doubles entries” he noted on social media. 

“Have the event by all means, but do not diminish the integrity of a Grand Slam by awarding an official title. Imagine awarding the singles title if you could only use your doubles ranking to enter? Same same.”

Reshaping the event to reserve it for the world's biggest stars would also prove a case of the rich getting even richer, while talented players who use mixed doubles event to stay afloat are left without the chance to earn a decent cheque.

When one domino falls in a major, others tend to follow, as is the case with the Sunday starts at majors aside from Wimbledon that have had an impact on the smaller tournaments which are held the week before.

On Tuesday, tennis fans reacted with a mix of excitement and surprise as the first 16 teams for the 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles Championship were officially revealed. Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz and former US Open champion Emma Raducanu were a pair that stole headlines.

While many fans were thrilled to see the electric duo of Alcaraz and Raducanu unite, others voiced disappointment that Raducanu had not teamed up with fellow Brit and rising star Jack Draper, currently ranked No. 6 on the ATP Tour.

After winning his opening match at the HSBC Championships on Tuesday, Draper was asked about the decision. “Yeah, I mean, a wise person once told me you should find the best partner, and that's what she did in Alcaraz. I don't blame her at all for that,” Draper said.

“Yeah, I think she will have a lot of fun playing with Carlos. He's obviously the best player in the world, probably right now, along with [Jannik] Sinner. Great at doubles, as well. Saw that with Rafa [Nadal] at the Olympics. She's gone about and chose the best partner, for sure. Hopefully, they do well,” he explained.

Though fans may have hoped for an all-British dream team, Draper is set for a strong pairing of his own alongside WTA World No. 4 Qinwen Zheng. “Qinwen I know from the tour. I have seen her around. Obviously a great player herself and has a really good game,” he said about his partner.

Alcaraz and Raducanu have been respectful of each other for years, and fans have been wanting them to play together for a while. The pair already has a name on social media, “Alcaranu.”

“I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma,” the Spaniard said after defeating the Australian Adam Walton 6-4, 7-6 in the first round at Queen's Club. “I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me – I made that special request.”

Alcaraz added that Raducanu was initially hesitant before saying yes, he recounted with a laugh. “She's going to be the boss,” he said of the 22-year-old. “I've known Emma for a really long time and I have a really good relationship with her. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun.”

The 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles Championship begins August 19 at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, where all eyes will be on the new partnerships. However, the tournament hasn't been without controversy. Several established mixed doubles specialists have criticized the decision to exclude them from the initial lineup, arguing they weren't even offered a wildcard or a chance to compete. Still, despite the pushback, the new format remains in place, at least for now.

Alex de Minaur has personal links with both the Australian Open and Wimbledon.

De Minaur reached the Australian Open quarter-finals earlier this year, his best ever result at his home Grand Slam tournament.

While he may represent Australia, due to De Minaur's engagement to Katie Boulter he does also have links to the United Kingdom.

After losing his first round singles match at Queen's, De Minaur has given his verdict on what separates the crowds at the Australian Open and Wimbledon.

Former finalist De Minaur lost his only singles match at Queen's Club this year to Jiri Lehecka in straight sets.

After his defeat, De Minaur headed to his post-match press conference where he was asked about British number one Jack Draper and the pressure he may face at Wimbledon as the biggest local hopeful.

This is something that De Minaur can relate to as the top ranked Australian, and he praised Draper for how he has been handling the pressure of expectation so far.

“Yeah, obviously I think Jack's dealing with it incredibly well,” said De Minaur. “He's obviously had a stellar year and achieving some incredible things.

“He's playing in his home ground now. I'm sure he'll love to do well. I guess for me it's just trying to use all the energy from the crowd. 

“I know that the crowd is behind me every single point when I play in Australia, and that's something that definitely helps me a lot kind of calm the nerves and just focus on myself.”

De Minaur was then asked how he feels playing against a British player during the grass court season, but he suggested that the Wimbledon crowd is more tempered than at the Australian Open.

“Yeah, I would say the British crowd is a little different to the Aussie crowd,” De Minaur continued. “Mainly I would say it's because of Wimbledon. Wimbledon has so much history and heritage and kind of culture. It's a very — they're very polite, I would say. You know, probably in Australia they're a little bit louder.”

While De Minaur has given Draper a good chance of impressing at Wimbledon, he has recently been struggling to show the same form that has made him world number 12.

De Minaur recently admitted to feeling burnt out, and has now lost back-to-back matches for the first time since February.

This means that De Minaur will head into Wimbledon this year without a singles victory on grass this year.

The 26 year old produced his best result at Wimbledon last year by reaching the quarter-finals, but De Minaur was forced to withdraw from his match against Novak Djokovic with a hip injury.

While De Minaur will no longer be in singles competition at Queen's Club, he still remains in the doubles tournament.

Playing alongside his compatriot Alexei Popyrin, De Minaur will play Lehecka again who is partnered by Taylor Fritz.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

                Winner to face Medvedev or Halys in QF.            

Two big serving giants will meet on the OWL Arena on Wednesday, when Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex Michelsen look to grab a quarterfinal entry ticket at the 2025 Terra Wortmann Open in Halle, Germany. The two-time Grand Slam finalist is back on his least favourite surface, and an American mountain awaits him. Who will reign supreme?

Surprisingly, the Alex Michelsen match-up is one that hasn't been kind to Stefanos Tsitsipas. The Greek freak is yet to register a victory over his 20-year-old opponent. Michelsen boasts a 50% winning record in 2025 – his best performances include an Australian Open Round of 16 entry and a semifinal finish at Delray Beach. On the other hand, Tsitsipas won the Dubai Tennis Championships in February-March.

The 26-year-old has won 93% service games in his solitary grass court encounter thus far. Although his style of play means that he enjoys time on the ball and higher bounce which grass doesn't offer, Tsitsipas has the ability and adaptability to find success. His only title on this surface came at Mallorca in 2022.

0-2 is the head to head between Tsitsipas and Michelsen. The American has won both encounters in thrilling fashion against his Greek counterpart.

This will be the first match in this rivalry outside of outdoor hard courts. At the ATP-500 in Tokyo last year, Michelsen pulled off a magnificent comeback to pip Tsitsipas in the Round of 32. The Greek maestro seeked revenge at the Australian Open in early 2025, but failed to overpower the American young gun.

Contrary to what the rankings suggest, we predict Alex Michelsen to stun the former World No. 3 and retain his unbeaten record against Tsitsipas. The American can take advantage of the fact that Tsitsipas endured a draining match in Round-1. He also has the serve and groundstrokes to trouble the single-handed backhand of the Athens-born starlet, as was seen in their previous two tussles.

Prediction: Alex Michelsen in three sets.

 Is 2025 the year Alexander Zverev finally gets his hands on the trophy at the Terra Wortmann Open? 

 The home favourite and second seed made a confident start to his latest campaign at the grass ATP 500 on Wednesday in Halle, where he eased past Marcos Giron 6-1, 6-2 to reach the second round. Competing just three days after his Stuttgart final defeat to Taylor Fritz, Zverev stormed back to winning ways with an emphatic 79-minute victory inside OWL Arena. 

 “It was a great match from me. I thought it was quite high level,” said Zverev. “Maybe he wanted to play a bit better than he did, but I felt like I didn't let him play that well, which was important for me. A good start to the tournament and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.” 

All the love for a win at home ❤️@ATPHalle | #ATPHalle pic.twitter.com/tzo7CvZCuG

 Zverev is now 19-8 in Halle, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings previously reached back-to-back finals at the event (2016 l. to Mayer, 2017 l. to Federer), while he also made semi-final appearances in 2023 and 2024. 

 A 24-time ATP Tour champion, Zverev is chasing his seventh title on home soil. He won the sixth of those in Munich on clay in April, but he is yet to lift a trophy on German grass despite reaching three finals (Halle 2016-17, Stuttgart 2025). 

 After a hard-fought opening few games against Giron, Zverev took complete control of the match by reeling off seven straight games from 2-2 in the first set. The German was dominant on serve throughout, which allowed him to play with freedom in return games: Zverev did not face a break point and completed his win having won 82 per cent (28/34) of points behind his first delivery. 

 “I just felt aggressive generally, especially on the returns,” said Zverev of his approach to the match. “I felt like I was taking the time away from him. When he's on top of the ball and has time to play, it's very difficult with him because he moves quite well and can control the rallies quite well. I had to take that away. All in all I was happy with today.” 



 With his win, Zverev improved to 4-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Giron. The 28-year-old German also leads his second-round opponent, Lorenzo Sonego, by the same scoreline. Zverev will be aiming to down Italy's Sonego in the second round in Halle for the second consecutive year. 

 Karen Khachanov also made a rock-solid start to his campaign. The eighth seed overcame ‘s-Hertogenbosch finalist Zizou Bergs 7-5, 6-3 to set a second-round meeting with Felix Auger-Aliassime.

In second-round action, Daniil Medvedev and Alex Michelsen both advanced to set a quarter-final showdown. Medvedev's earned his 400th tour-level win with a 6-2, 7-5 result against Quentin Halys. The 2022 Halle finalist is 10th on the list of active players for most wins.

Michelsen edged Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-6(5), 7-5, improving to 3-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against the Greek and repeating the result from their Australian Open first-round meeting earlier this season. 

The American, who upset fifth seed Francisco Cerundolo in his Halle opener, did not face a break point against Tsitsipas until he was broken while serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set. Undeterred, he continued to target the Tsitsipas backhand and broke back immediately with a blistering forehand passing shot. In one final bit of drama, Michelsen was forced to save a break point—his second of the match, according to Infosys ATP Stats—as he served out the victory on his second opportunity.

 A total of 400 tour-level wins represents a lot of potential favourites to choose from for Daniil Medvedev. 

 The 29-year-old hit the milestone Wednesday by downing Quentin Halys 6-2, 7-5 at the Terra Wortmann Open in Halle. Medvedev, a former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and 20-time tour-level champion, later identified his 2021 US Open final triumph against Novak Djokovic as an obvious win that sticks in his memory. Yet he admitted he found it hard to narrow it down to just one. 

 “Honestly, if I had to choose one, I would say beating Novak to win the US Open, because it's my only Grand Slam [title], but I could easily name like 20 really big ones in different aspects,” Medvedev told ATPTour.com. “For example, I remember a win against Hubi [Hurkacz] in Toronto in 2021. First set, I didn't know what to do. He played good, I didn't play my best, and he was absolutely all over the place and didn't give me any chance. It was 6-2. 

 “I saved a break point early in the second set and I was saying to myself, ‘I'm not playing good, he's playing amazing, there is no way I will win this match'. Then I managed to serve better, I won the tie-break somehow 7/5, finishing with an ace, and then I won Toronto, which gave me a confidence boost. I won the US Open two weeks later.”

 Medvedev's 2-6, 7-6(6), 7-6(5) quarter-final win against Hurkacz in Toronto that year may not be etched in the memory of many fans nearly four years on. Yet the current World No. 11 says he sees his total win tally, and indeed his achievements in tennis as a whole, as a product of such small moments. 

 “There are many wins which by themselves don't really represent anything,” said Medvedev. “But if you didn't have them, maybe you would not have your first title, and you wouldn't have the career you have.” 

 Perhaps more understandably, a 6-3, 6-1 win against Horacio Zeballos on the grass of ‘s-Hertogenbosch in 2016 also sticks in Medvedev's memory. It was his first tour-level victory. 

 “I actually remember Zeballos talking about it to me,” recalled Medvedev. “He said that he just came after Roland Garros, so the transition [from clay to grass] was not easy. He was like, ‘OK, I'm playing some guy who is ranked like 250', so he was kind of happy about it. 

 “Then I beat him good, so that was a fun moment and it was of course a great feeling. I was very young, so it made a lot of adrenalin and emotion come out, and I was very happy about it.”

Before the world knew Carlos Alcaraz as a Grand Slam champion and one of the sport's biggest stars, Jaume Munar had a front-row view to his early promise.

“I remember playing him in Marbella,” Munar told ATPTour.com ahead of his second-round clash against Alcaraz at the HSBC Championships “He was a young kid, playing fast and easy. Back then, he couldn't always manage the moment and made a few more mistakes. But you could already see how talented he was, with so much power in every shot.”

That meeting came in April 2021, when a then-17-year-old Alcaraz was making his first significant strides on the ATP Tour. Munar won the match in straight sets at the clay-court ATP 250, but even in victory, he walked away impressed.

“I just remember the power that came from his shots. Just the aggressive play, the lack of time, the movement. I won the match but I knew he would come to the top,” Munar reflected.

On Thursday, the pair meets for the fourth time (2-1 Alcaraz) in the second round in London but Alcaraz is a different proposition to the one four years ago. Now a five-time major champion and at No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, the Spaniard, alongside Jannik Sinner, is the leading man in men's tennis.

Munar is proud of his countryman's rise and believes his down-to-earth demeanour has been important to his success.

“I have a good relationship with Carlos,” Munar said. “I'm about six or seven years older than him, so we didn't spend much time together when we were younger. But since he joined the tour, we've had a very good connection.

“He's an extremely nice guy. Down to earth, a fantastic person. Not just a great tennis player. He's the kind of personality that's really good for the sport, and also great for Spain and his personality has helped him I think.”

For Spanish tennis, which is entering a new era following the retirement of Rafael Nadal, the emergence of Alcaraz as a figurehead is especially significant.
“After Rafa, we still have a top figure in the sport, which is huge,” Munar said. “I've had a close relationship with Rafa since I was a kid, we're friends and I've spent a lot of time with him.
“I know Rafa better, but for Spain, it's special to have someone like Carlos at the top now. We've always had great players, but we also have to recognise the value of having someone leading the way like he is.”
While Alcaraz has become a staple at the top of the game, Munar is quietly putting together a consistent season. The World No. 59 reached semi-finals in Hong Kong and Dallas and the fourth round at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome.
Now the 28-year-old is determined to find the winning formula on grass, a surface on which he has won just four tour-level matches.
“I love this tournament. It's a special time of year, leading into Wimbledon and playing in a historic tournament like this at Queen's,” Munar said. “It's probably the month I enjoy most during the season.
“I'm feeling good. For the past couple of years I've been trying to make some changes to get better on grass. I think I did, and honestly, I'm feeling comfortable. It's definitely one of the more difficult surfaces for us because we only play on it for three or four weeks a year, so it's not easy to find rhythm. But this year, I've had quite a few practise sessions already. I started last Tuesday, so I've had a full week, and I'm feeling great.”

Those changes include tweaks and tactical shifts designed to help him adapt to the speed of grass.
“I changed the strings, which is important here. I play with natural gut, which I don't use the rest of the year, so I need a few days to adjust, but it helps a lot,” Munar said. “There's the movement, which is very difficult on grass. I've also adjusted my tactics. I am trying to play a bit more aggressively, moving forward more than usual. I think I'm really starting to feel comfortable in this type of setup.”
Munar will hope it all comes together when he meets the 2023 Queen's Club champion in the second round on Thursday. The 28-year-old was ‘honest' when reflecting on his chances but believes he has the ability to hurt the 22-year-old on the London lawns. 
“Honestly, my chances are low. That's the reality,” Munar said. “But if I have to face Carlos, doing it on a surface where he hasn't had much preparation is the best-case scenario for me. It's going to be a big challenge, but if I can play my best and he's not at his peak, I might have a chance. That's why we compete. That's why we're here.”
Regardless of the outcome, Munar knows this is more than just a match. It's a checkpoint in his own journey on the surface.
“Beyond the result, it's also a good benchmark, to see where my game is on grass right now,” Munar said. “Carlos is a former Wimbledon champion, so it's a great opportunity to test myself and understand where I can improve. I see it as a challenge, and after tomorrow, we'll see how it went and what's next.”

Lando Norris has mentioned how this year's McLaren does not give him the same level of confidence as last year's, and a key design feature could be the reason.

At a few of the hotter races so far this year McLaren has used a unique cockpit pre-cooling device.

It works when the chemical ingredients of dry ice are mixed in a container, placed in the car's nose, and the resultant emissions of the cooling vapour are pumped through the car for several minutes as it sits on the grid. The container is then removed before the nose is re-assembled ready for the race.

Furthermore, the underside of the McLaren seat and the floor beneath are coated in heat-deflecting gold foil.

Why so much attention to the cockpit temperatures of the McLaren? Possibly because the way the team runs the car means that the front skid blocks wear more than those at the rear, which is unusual.

What it also means is that the great heat generated by those skid blocks crashing into the ground is directly beneath the driver. In its running configuration, the McLaren seems to create more cockpit heat than other cars.

A notable feature of the design of the car is the extreme anti-dive of the front suspension geometry, allowing the car a very flat aerodynamic platform. With less dive under braking, the front ride height can be significantly lower. This might help explain the more forward-biased plank wear seen on the McLaren.

A downside of such extreme anti-dive geometry is that it reduces feedback through the steering and brakes to the driver. Lando Norris has, on several occasions, mentioned how this car does not give him the same level of confidence and feedback on corner entry as last year's car.

His driving style favours more combined braking and cornering than Oscar Piastri's and the reduced level of feedback seems to have affected him more.

Consequently McLaren has developed an alternative, mildly tweaked, geometry for Norris – and this made its first appearance at Montreal. Visually, it's virtually indistinguishable from the standard suspension but the upper rear wishbone's mounting point to the wheel hub has been re-angled.

The brake duct bodywork hides the new arrangement and so whether it uses a reduced level of anti-dive to enhance steering feel is not currently known. It may also be that the steering's king pin inclination – the angle to the wheel of the part around which the steering swivels and a standard way of enhancing the steering's feedback – has been altered.

If the anti-dive has been reduced on the new geometry, the downside of the improved steering feel would be that the car's aero platform won't be as flat and that its front ride height may need to be higher.

Norris stayed with the new suspension throughout the Canadian Grand Prix weekend. The new layout was available for Piastri but he opted to stick with the standard system.

“I could have run it if I wanted to, and I didn't really,” he explained of the new layout.

“It changes some things — some things are better, some things are worse. It's not as simple. It's not an upgrade, it's a different part.

""I've been happy with how the car's been so far this year and, again, I just wanted to keep consistency.”

Nico Hulkenberg converted his P11 grid slot to an eighth-place finish in Canada, as he scored more vital points for Kick Sauber.

Nico Hulkenberg is starting to make a habit of scoring points, as the Kick Sauber driver came home eighth in Canada to add to his brilliant fifth last time out in Spain.

His recent run of results has lifted Kick Sauber from the bottom of the table in the Teams' Championship, and they are now just eight points off P6 as the midfield pack tightens up once again.

For Sauber, it is further proof that their upgrade direction is the right one, with Hulkenberg able to use his updated car to good effect when fighting his midfield rivals. While he didn't quite have the pace to catch the Ferraris, like in Barcelona, the German was still proud of a race that included some “fun” overtakes.

“Well two times in [the top 10 in] a row, that's nice!,” Hulkenberg said after the race in Montreal. ""Would be nice if we can continue the trend from here but obviously definitely some momentum on our side.

“A bit as I suspected in race trim the car comes alive a bit more, the update really paying dividends and just having better consistency and a better balance in the car so yeah quite pleasant, made some good gains.

“Franco [Colapinto] and Alex [Albon] were fighting in Turn 9 Lap 1 and I managed to capitalise on that and was a pretty clean race. A couple of overtakes to do, pretty fun racing and managing tyres basically.”

Hulkenberg's race craft remains sharp, the German more than happy to pounce on that opening lap when his rivals tangled, before executing a one-stop strategy that saw him make his hard tyres last 51 laps.

While his drive lacked the showiness of his Barcelona race, where he overtook Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, it was his third score of the season and first in a race that didn't feature variables like rain or mid-race Safety Cars.

As such, there are high hopes of more points at the coming races – regardless of the characteristics of the tracks in question. Hulkenberg was asked if he can keep scoring, and he was clear that he sees no reason why he won't be featuring in the top 10 more often moving forward.

“We've had two very different tracks here and in Barcelona"" he said. ""On both we were competitive in the midfield so there's no reason to think why not.”

Team Principal Jonathan Wheatley was also quick to praise Hulkenberg's drive in Montreal, as the team's one-stop strategy “proved to be spot on,"" calling the atmosphere within the squad ""fantastic.""

Jeremy Strong also stars in writer-director Scott Cooper's feature that hits theaters this fall.

Jeremy Allen White is in his glory as Bruce Springsteen in the first trailer for Deliver Me From Nowhere. 


20th Century Studios releases writer-director Scott Cooper‘s biopic movie in theaters Oct. 24. White, known for his Emmy-winning role on The Bear, stars as Springsteen and does his own singing, while Jeremy Strong plays the musician's longtime manager and record producer Jon Landau.




Deliver Me From Nowhere focuses on the making of Springsteen's 1982 spare and deeply personal Nebraska, one of the most acclaimed albums of all time. Stephen Graham, Odessa Young, Paul Walter Hauser, Gaby Hoffmann, Johnny Cannizzaro, Harrison Gilbertson, Marc Maron, David Krumholtz and Chris Jaymes round out the cast.

	Footage from the film debuted at CinemaCon in April and included White's stirring rendition of Springsteen's 1975 single “Born to Run,” which became the singer's first Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.


	In the trailer, White declares about the album, “Don't need to be perfect. I want it to feel like I'm in the room by myself.” Strong's Landau later describes Nebraska by saying that with the album, Springsteen is “repairing that hole in himself. Once he's done with that, he's going to repair the entire world.”


	Cooper helmed the project from his own script that he adapted from Warren Zanes' 2023 book of the same name. Producers include Cooper, Zanes and Scott Stuber, along with Gotham Group's Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and Eric Robinson. Both Springsteen and Landau are involved with the film.


The Hollywood Reporter previously reported that record producer Dave Cobb, who has worked with Springsteen, is involved with the film's music.


	During his CinemaCon appearance, White called making the movie a “dream come true” and added, “I feel really lucky. We all had Bruce's blessing on this film.”

By inking a pact with French broadcaster TF1 to carry its live sports, drama series and reality shows, the streaming giant is evolving into a giant aggregator — that looks a lot like the Pay TV interface of old.  


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Netflix may entice its subscribers to chill, but the global streamer is working on new offerings and deals to future-proof its content lineup and business. In line with that, it made notable headlines on Wednesday, unveiling a carriage deal with French broadcaster TF1 at Cannes Lions that will see Netflix offering live broadcasts and on-demand content from the partner starting in the summer of 2026.


	“This is a first-of-its-kind partnership that plays to our strengths of giving audiences the best entertainment alongside the best discovery experience,” said Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix. “By teaming up with France's leading broadcaster, we will provide French consumers with even more reasons to come to Netflix every day and to stay with us for all their entertainment.”

					'Land of the Lost' Reboot Eyed at Netflix		
			









	How much of a game-changer the TF1 deal presents was a topic of industry discussion following the news, with several analysts predicting that more carriage and aggregation agreements in its vein would follow.


	Some pointed out that TF1 CEO Rodolphe Belmer sat on the board of directors of Netflix from 2018 until 2022, namely until he was named the French giant's boss. Last year, Netflix also partnered with France's Newen Studios and TF1 to co-produce the streamer's first-ever daily drama series for France. The series, Tout Pour La Lumière (All for Light), a family series set in the world of music and dance, became available on Netflix late last week before its free-to-air debut on TF1, along with its TF1+ platform, this week.

	











	“This is a very innovative deal,” with “nothing of the sort elsewhere,” Enders Analysis analyst François Godard tells The Hollywood Reporter. “It pivots Netflix into aggregation.”


	Will Netflix bring this approach to other markets? “They could,” the expert says. “They are a trial-and-error company. So maybe they will wait first to see how it goes in France.”


	PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore tells THR that for Netflix, the TF1 deal “makes perfect sense given its direction of travel.” He explains: “It is pivoting towards a platform for entertainment, and it was only a question of time before we saw typically big hits being streamed on the platform.”


	For broadcasters and others, collaborating with the global streamer is also appealing. “Everyone wants to work and distribute with Netflix,” he says. “It is the undisputed market leader and paved the way for others. While rivals grapple to understand streaming and continue to figure out what to do with legacy businesses, Netflix remains one step ahead. Free-to-air broadcasters have got no choice but to either collaborate with each other as a final resort or partner with a streamer.”


	Pescatore sees no losers in such carriage pacts. “It is a win-win for all parties,” he argues. “For free-to-air broadcasters, it gives them a new lease on life, for Netflix, a broad range of programming, and users [get] reduced fragmentation by having more in one place.”


	The PP Foresight expert sees more deals ahead, adding: “This is the start, and we will now see a chain reaction with others looking to replicate this deal.”

	











Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also forecasts more Netflix carriage deals in the future, telling THR: “They are trying to be a platform and be the starting point for any viewing.”

In a Hollywood struggling to mint new movie stars, the internet-anointed openly gay ‘Bridgerton' and ‘Wicked' breakout defiantly forged his own path. Can he bring his fanatical fanbase to ‘Jurassic World Rebirth' and emerge as a full-fledged movie star?


							By

	“I love him even more, now!” yells a young woman to her friends and anyone else within a 20-foot radius while exiting the Bridge Theatre in London after an afternoon showing of Richard II in early May. The friends reply in unison, “I knowww.”


	The group then hurries to the stage door, where they hope to see the object of their collective affection. But they won't find him there. A month into the show's run, its star had to stop greeting audience members because of a noise complaint received by the City Council. If you're wondering, that is not a typical problem at a matinee showing of one of Shakespeare's more esoteric historical plays.

	But this impassioned and predominantly female crowd assembled is not really here for Richard II. They have come for the man playing him: Jonathan Bailey, one of entertainment's hottest rising stars.


	Working at a steady pace since he was a kid, primarily in theater, the 37-year-old British actor broke out in Netflix's steamy period romantic drama Bridgerton, one of the platform's most-watched shows ever, and then last year made his big-screen Hollywood debut in the $700 million movie musical extravaganza Wicked.


	It's been a remarkably quick rise for an actor who defies a lot of the conventional wisdom about what makes a star: Despite never attending one of London's prestige drama schools, he came up through the Royal Shakespeare Company (before Richard II, there was Othello, King Lear and King John), and he's a proudly out actor who plays both straight and gay in both prestige and populist fare, becoming a sex symbol to both women and men.

	











	In a business ruled by quadrants, types, lists and lanes, Bailey has taken an alternative route. 


	“You have to unlearn a lot of narratives about yourself that an industry tells you,” he says, including, ”If you're gay, there's a glass ceiling.”


	Bailey has already won an Olivier for the 2018 West End revival of Company and earned an Emmy nomination for the HBO prestige drama Fellow Travelers, not to mention nabbed a fan-voted Sexiest Man Alive readers' choice honor from People in 2024. “It's hard to express how surprised I was every step of the way,” he says of his sudden and admittedly unforeseen mass appeal.


	It seems that even as Hollywood remains confounded about how to mint new movie stars in our modern age of too much choice and too little attention, audiences still have the power to anoint their own stars. Judging by the Instagram accounts, Tumblrs, an ungodly number of TikTok fancams (44 million, per a tally on the platform) and noise complaints, Bailey is an unquestionable fan favorite.


	The question looming now is where to place him in the Hollywood hierarchy of up-and-coming stars, which includes a strong U.K. contingent of Josh O'Connor, Harris Dickinson and Joseph Quinn. While audiences have made up their minds on Bailey's star power, the industry, as is often the case, is a step behind, awaiting even further confirmation. When asked about Bailey's potential, one studio head texts me that they are “not sure he can carry a movie on his own yet, but love him and want to see him in more and I am hopeful he becomes a star.”

	











	That hope will be road-tested in a matter of weeks, when he co-stars in the $300 million-plus Jurassic World Rebirth, the latest go-round of Universal's enduring multibillion-dollar franchises. Sure, he will be sharing the screen with box office heavyweight Scarlett Johansson and two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali, so the burden will not be his alone. But the glow of success, and even more so the pall of failure, is always shared. So this is the kind of proving ground for an actor that's becoming all the more rare.


Jurassic World Rebirth, out July 2, is already tracking for a monster $120 million opening weekend. And if Bailey can bring impassioned crowds to an obscure Shakespearean history (apologies to The Bard) then maybe it's not so big a stretch to think he can get them into a movie theater.


	***


	Perhaps it's all as simple as Jonathan Bailey is a good hang. 


	When meeting for the first time about the possibility of Bailey joining Jurassic World Rebirth, director Gareth Edwards remembers spending two hours talking about pretty much everything aside from the movie, or his potential role in said movie. Nary a dinosaur was named.


	“The producers called going, ‘How was it? How was he? What did he think of the role? Did he like the idea?' And I just had to sort of like half lie, ‘Yeah he was super excited!' ” recalls the director.


	Despite both working regularly in theater and even appearing in the same television series — Michaela Coel's Chewing Gum — Cynthia Erivo didn't meet Bailey until rehearsals for Wicked, in which they play onscreen love interests. “I keep making the mistake and saying that he went to [Royal Academy of Dramatic Art],” says Erivo. “In my head, I feel I've known him for such a long time that in my head we went to the same school. One day, he was like ‘Cyn, you keep telling people that we went to RADA together, but I didn't go to RADA.' ”

	











	Sure, many charismatic, hungry young stars know how to turn it on when they need to, especially for their fellow Hollywood travelers or the press. But Bailey has had the designation of being the best man for a half-dozen weddings. If that's fakery, it's also masochistic.


	In fact, one of the interviews for this story happened while Bailey set up for a bachelor party — this one for the close friend he lived with during the majority of his 20s — parrying questions as he blew up a giant inflatable zebra for the pool. “Have you seen the Whitney Houston challenge?” he asks. For the ill-informed, Bailey explains that you try to nail the iconic drum hit that comes before the key change in “I Will Always Love You.” For the bachelor party, it's been co-opted as a drinking game; Bailey also has timed the song to ensure his own success. He laughs, “Everyone else is going to be absolutely smashed.”


	See: good hang. And it's something that audiences pick up on.


	As Richard, a sociopathic monarch who (in this staging) snorts coke while calling for higher taxes on the commonfolk and luxuriates on the hospital bed that his uncle just died in, Bailey plays the part with such glee and abandon that, by the end of the show when Richard is in a body bag, the audience, despite all better judgment, thinks, “Maybe he wasn't so bad after all.”

	











	“He's just instantly likable,” assesses Edwards. “I don't know if he hates people saying that about him, but it's such a great trait because the biggest problem a filmmaker has when casting or writing a film is whether an audience will care about this person. If, within the first scene, while hardly saying anything, you go, ‘I like this guy,' it's worth its weight in gold.”


	Part of Bailey's appeal is that even when he's playing highbrow, he seems somehow rooted — and that much is true. When Richard II started rehearsals, Bailey, who lives in the English coastal region of Sussex, planned to stay at a central London hotel. But the schedule of hotel to theater to hotel, rinse repeat, left him drained, he says: “I felt like the fish in Blackfish. My dorsal fin, well and truly, started to fall to the left.” So he started crashing with childhood friends — he maintains many — and cycling miles to the theater.


	Bailey grew up in rural Oxfordshire, the youngest of four, all older sisters. It was in an after-school ballet class where he was scouted at age 7 by the Royal Shakespeare Company, landing in a 1995 production of A Christmas Carol. (“It's really easy to spot the one boy out of 400 girls,” Bailey says with a laugh.) He spent a chunk of his childhood traveling between home and London, playing Gavroche in Les Misérables and Prince Arthur in King John, performing four shows a week but never missing any class.


	By the time high school came around, Bailey traded dance and gymnastics for soccer and rugby. He was planning on attending university when, he says, “It just so happened that the day of my last A-level exam, I took over for the production of Beautiful Thing that Andrew Garfield had done.”

	











	This is how Bailey became a learn-on-the-job type, with a near religious reverence for performing, if not the formal higher education of many with whom he's shared the stage. Outside of theater, those jobs have included a children's BBC series about Leonardo da Vinci, the pre-Fleabag comedy from Phoebe Waller-Bridge Crashing and the Olivia Colman-led Broadchurch.


	Then came Bridgerton.


	***


	“I got sent it and I nearly didn't audition,” says Bailey of the Shonda Rhimes-produced Netflix juggernaut. The request came in during his second-to-last week performing Company, the 2018 gender-swapped revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical. After six months of shows, with three months of rehearsals before that, all Bailey wanted to do was disappear for a while. He remembers, “At that time, I was really done. I just needed to go and experience the world.”


	After it hit his inbox, Bailey forwarded the project to a friend he thought would be a better fit and had no plans of putting anything on tape himself until his agent, with whom he has worked since he was 15, advised him to audition for just one of the three parts he was sent. “I read for the Duke,” says Bailey of the role that would go on to be played by Regé-Jean Page.


	He left shortly after for a California road trip, traveling from San Francisco down Pacific Coast Highway, with a side trip to Coachella for good measure. Since he was on the West Coast, he was told to stop by the offices of Shondaland, which led to him being cast as Anthony, the attractively moody and attractively attractive eldest sibling of Bridgerton House.

	











	By the time the show debuted in 2020, Bailey had left London and moved back home, hanging out with his grandmother and, like the rest of the world, not doing much else. It was the first Christmas of the COVID lockdown, and Bridgerton — “the trinity of Shondaland, period drama, Netflix,” as Bailey assessed it — would be one of the final series that was able to finish filming before the pandemic. He says, “I remember just being like, ‘Wow, this is going to be massive.' “


Bridgerton, which is known for high drama interspersed with some sexually explicit scenes, was the biggest debut for an original series on the streaming service at the time, and Anthony — with obvious shades of Mr. Darcy (but a Mr. Darcy who gives oral) — quickly became a fan favorite. “The show itself has such a specific style and structure, and I noticed that within that world, Jonny was able to make bold, interesting and funny choices that gave the more serious scenes a real sense of life,” Luke Newton, Bailey's onscreen Bridgerton brother, says over email.


	As is the Hollywood way, actors with a hit on their hands are advised to capitalize on that momentum quickly and plot the next career move. But Bailey already knew what was next; he was locked into a second Bridgerton season where Anthony's love life would be the central story.


	“When you go and film something like Bridgerton, and you say goodbye to your friends, your family, it's all-encompassing,” says Bailey. “I read an interview with Walton Goggins where he was saying he was glad that even now White Lotus didn't happen to him 10 years ago because he wouldn't have known what to do with that. And I just feel that maybe Bridgerton was just a smidge quicker than I was prepared for,” admits the actor. ”Going back to theater, working with people that I know, that has helped.”

	













	For Bailey, getting back onstage is not only familiar but restorative. After he wrapped the eight-month shoot of Bridgerton‘s second season, he signed up for the West End revival of the drama Cock. Ten days into the run, Bridgerton‘s second season premiered.


	As Bailey remembers it, “Suddenly people were just coming. The crowd was changing every night.” A good portion of the audience was now coming to see Anthony Bridgerton, as much as they were the play. “It's different if they've just been spending eight hours with you on TV.”


	All the same, Bailey says he has no plans to leave Bridgerton.


	“I've never been someone who's like, ‘Thanks, bye.' It's not in my nature,” he says of remaining on the show, content with being a supporting player in coming years — the central plot revolves around a new character each season — even as his star continues to rise outside of the show. “There's a real sense of brotherly pride I feel in it,” says Bailey, who recently wrapped the show's fourth season, due out in 2026. “I was filming a wedding on a Monday morning,” he stops himself short, likely considering the long arm of the Netflix publicity machine: “People know that people get married in Bridgerton — that's not a spoiler, right?”

	











	While acknowledging that there may be a future season when the scheduling doesn't work or the storyline may not require Anthony, he's been happy to continue watching his co-stars from the wings: “I look forward to, in another however many years, when we've done the eighth season to sit around and be like, ‘Look what we all did together.' “


	Bailey also thinks about Bridgerton from the audience's perspective. “I know how much I love long-running series,” he says. “I know how important familiarity of character and story and consistency is in these long-running series.”


	***


	In Jurassic World Rebirth, which takes place five years after the franchise's last film fronted by Chris Pratt, dinosaurs have proved ill-equipped for the modern environment and have begun to die out, except along the equator. A pharmaceutical company sponsors a mission — executed by Johansson's skilled covert operative, Ali's fixer and Bailey's paleontologist — to collect genetic materials from the remaining dinos.


	The first time Bailey, as Dr. Henry Loomis, touched a dinosaur on set, it was an emotional experience. Yes, the dinosaur was just a giant blue cardboard tube with a crewmember named Colin inside, but he says it was emotional nonetheless.


	Edwards took a handheld camera, whispering direction to Bailey as he approached the dinosaur (Colin) in a grassy field in Thailand while the crew played orchestral music over the set's loudspeakers. It was a small, improvised moment within what can be the rigid nature of a blockbuster shoot. When Edwards called “cut,” he turned to his first assistant director, who had tears in his eyes.

	











	“Isn't that what all humans are really trying to find in their life, the equivalent of their passion in its natural environment?” offers Bailey of the outsized emotional impact of the scene. “It doesn't get more pure than that.”


	The same might be said of Bailey's own relationship to acting. “He loves working. Loves it!” says Erivo. “He's always searching for something, but he's playful at the same time, so the air is always light when you're around him.”


Wicked opened the door to Jurassic. While Edwards was casting his dino film, the studio was putting the final touches on the fervently anticipated musical adaptation. “Dancing Through Life,” Bailey's solo number as the devil-may-care Prince Fiyero, in which he tumbled through a moving tunnel of bookcases, was shaping up to be a standout sequence in what was looking to be a standout movie. Universal suggested Bailey as a possibility to join ScarJo.


	Edwards wasn't among the masses who binged Bridgerton. But his girlfriend was. “I mentioned Jonathan Bailey was someone they're talking about. Her eyes lit up and she was like, ‘That's fantastic! Is that for real? Is that going to happen?' ” The filmmaker figured this was a good sign.

	











	Bailey — who says the first movie that he remembers seeing in theaters with his family was Jurassic Park when he was 5 — was with his family when he received the news. “It was not really an experience I've had before, an assistant that goes — ” Bailey then drops into a pitch-perfect Southern California accent: ” ‘Hey, Jonny, I have …' ” By Bailey's count, roughly 20 names were then roll-called, from top studio brass to producers. He put the call on speakerphone so everyone could listen in. It was all very stereotypical Hollywood — except in one very major way.


	Bailey has navigated his adult professional career as an out gay actor, an identity he hasn't shied from. His early press coverage was in queer publications, and last year he launched The Shameless Fund, a charity focused on LGBTQ+ initiatives. “Being an out gay actor, historically, meant that you wouldn't be able to play straight and there weren't any gay parts to play, anyway,” says Bailey. “That's obviously changed, massively.” With Jurassic, he is co-leading one of the town's most lucrative blockbuster franchises, an area that's had, until late, a pretty weak track record of inclusivity. It's a reality that's not lost on him, but it's also one he doesn't want to dwell on.


	“There's moments where, yes, you have to be excellent to prove that you can do it. And it's not like I haven't felt that. There's the weight of history. And there's endless brilliant people who have come before you who have changed the way that people see sexuality.” He adds, “Any sort of sense of prejudice against sexuality is something to fight against, and what better way to do that than to go and play any kind of character.”


	As for what that next character is, Bailey doesn't have an immediate answer. Right now, he is staring down the barrel of one globe-spanning press tour (Jurassic), followed quickly by another globe-spanning press tour (Wicked: For Good, out Nov. 21). He says, “I'm sure it won't last long, but I think the idea of a few months [off] is just absolutely dreamy.”


	Otherwise, he just wants to continue casting a wide net, which is what got him here in the first place: “I've unlearned the idea of feeling limited.”

The Joseph Kosinski-directed movie, starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, speeds into theaters June 27.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Following the New York premiere of F1: The Movie on Monday evening, the first reviews of the film from critics have been coming in, and they've been generally favorable.


	The high-octane Formula One racing drama, directed by Joseph Kosinski (Top Gun: Maverick and Tron: Legacy), stars Brad Pitt and Damson Idris. The film follows Pitt's Sonny Hayes, a former F1 driver who comes out of retirement to mentor and team up with a younger driver, Idris' Joshua Pearce.




	As of Tuesday afternoon, F1: The Movie had a score of 84 percent from 58 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, and clocked in at 69 percent on Metacritic from 24 reviews.

					'F1: The Movie' Review: Brad Pitt and Damson Idris Power Joseph Kosinski's Exhilarating Motor Racing Drama		
			









	The film, from Apple Original Films and Warner Bros., speeds into theaters on June 27. It also stars Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem, Tobias Menzies and Kim Bodnia.


	Read on for key excerpts from some of the most prominent early reviews following the New York premiere of F1: The Movie.


The Hollywood Reporter‘s arts and culture critic Lovia Gyarkye wrote in her review, “The strongest scenes in F1, which boasts a two-and-a-half hour runtime, are these moments during race weekends, when Kosinki embeds his fictional team with real ones. Fans of the sport will recognize cameos from Verstappen, Leclerc, Carlos Sainz, Lando Norris and many more drivers. Hans Zimmer's adrenalized score ups the ante, adding tension to already nail-biting moments like a driver making a dangerous turn on a slick course or mechanics in the pit having mere seconds to switch out a car's tires. The impressive craft of these scenes extends to Kosinki's exploration of the various technologies, like road simulators, used to help drivers gain any advantage. Of course, there are some unrealistic elements in F1, moments that might have sticklers raising an eyebrow, but the film doesn't feel any less dramatic than the real thing.”

	











Screenrant‘s Mae Abdulbaki wrote, “F1 The Movie is essentially a two-and-a-half-hour commercial with a surprisingly compelling story. Brands are littered throughout the film, and the title itself is pulled from Formula One racing. It's not original at all, and yet I was riveted by every minute of the film. Directed by Joseph Kosinski (Top Gun: Maverick) from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger, F1 The Movie is engaging and entertaining, building momentum and laying the groundwork for character payoffs. It could've easily phoned it in, as so many brand-related movies are wont to do, but Kosinski's film makes us feel something.”


	Ross Bonaime, with Collider, wrote in his review, “Despite the excitement and stunning race footage that F1 provides, it's also placed in a story that we've heard countless times before. And while that's in no way damning here — not by a long shot — it is a bit silly at times in how much it plays in the clichés. Like a good racer, you'll probably be able to tell where every turn and twist is going to go, yet it's the quality and impressive nature in which F1 hits these turns that puts this in conversation for the best racing film ever made. When the excitement and tension of the races are as good as they are here, you can ignore a bit of canned dialogue or a goofy trope that has played itself out one too many times.”


The Guardian‘s Peter Bradshaw wrote, “With that amused-cowpoke face of his squashed into his safety helmet, making his sixtysomething cherubic chops bulge in towards his nose, Brad Pitt gets behind the wheel in this outrageously cheesy but fiercely and extravagantly shot Formula One melodrama. Along with a lot of enjoyable hokum about the old guy mentoring the rookie hothead (a plot it broadly shares with Pixar's 2006 adventure Cars), F1 the Movie gives you the corporate sheen, real-life race footage with Brad as the star in an unreasonably priced car, the tech fetish of the cars themselves (almost making you forget how amazingly ugly they are) with brand names speckling every square inch of every surface, the simulation graphics writ large, and the bizarre occult spectacle of motor racing itself.”

	











	Nicholas Barber, with the BBC, wrote, “The biggest issue with F1, though, is not its insistence on showing its leading man in a flattering light, but its equivalent, fawning attitude towards Formula One itself. Shot on real circuits with the full co-operation of the organisers and participants (Lewis Hamilton is credited as a producer), it's essentially a glossy corporate promotional film with so much distracting product placement that you're more likely to remember the brand names than the characters. There is no wisp of criticism or scepticism, and no hint of anything exploitative or sleazy. Formula One fans may be pleased by the glimpses of their favourite drivers, but F1 is so intent on being positive about its milieu that none of these men is allowed to be a proper antagonist, or even to say anything rude about Sonny. Nobody can misbehave, and nothing terrible can happen to any of the characters, so there is no tension to speak of. The story simply hops around the world, ticking off every Grand Prix in a season. In the first of these, Ruben's team fails miserably, but as the weeks go by… well, if you scribbled down what you guessed the structure might be, you'd be absolutely correct — except that your version might have some more high-stakes jeopardy than the actual film.”


IndieWire‘s head film critic David Ehrlich wrote in his review, “Formula One has always been a testament to the difficulty of striking the right balance between power and precision, and F1 embodies that aspect of the sport all too well. Always entertaining for how effectively it welds hyper-modern spectacle to the chassis of a classic underdog story (the latter part of that equation paving the way for Pitt's most Billy Bean-coded performance since Moneyball), Kosinski's film can be propulsive and exhilarating in spurts, but in working so hard to satisfy newbies and experts at the same time that it often struggles to seize on its simplest pleasures. Misfits becoming teammates. Losers finding redemption. Cars going really, really fast.”

	











	Sophie Butcher, with Empire, wrote, “For Formula 1 fans, the sheer accuracy of F1's depiction of the sport will be giddy-making; for agnostics, the races may feel a touch repetitive, and the level of detail may go over some heads. But whatever your relationship to the sport, the magnitude of what Kosinski and co have accomplished is undeniable. Fasten your seatbelts, and see this on the biggest screen you possibly can.”


USA Today‘s Brian Truitt wrote in his review, “The movie isn't shy about lapping many a trope, yet the white-knuckle action sequences are where F1 lives and breathes. Kosinski wants audiences to feel the danger of essentially sitting in a rocket that can go 200 mph, and the euphoria of passing a foe in a Ferrari or having a straight line to the checkered flag. Those go a long way in forgiving the multitude of subplots and the toolbox of car cliches.”


The Associated Press‘ film critic Jake Coyle wrote, “F1 steers predictably to the finish line, cribbing here and there from sports dramas before it. (Tobias Menzies plays a board member with uncertain corporate goals.) When F1 does, finally, quiet down, for one blissful moment, the movie, almost literally, soars. It's not quite enough to forget all the high-octane macho dramatics before it, but it's enough to glimpse another road F1 might have taken.”


	David Fear, with Rolling Stone, wrote in his review, “The way that Pitt injects his presence, his physicality, his charm, his well-honed screen persona, his particular mix of discipline and DGAF effortlessness, and his backhanded way of making outdated, Golden Age Hollywood roguishness feel completely somehow timeless is what makes this a winner. He even manages to upstage the cars. It's a turn that reminds you of Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster, William Holden, and, notably Steve McQueen, no stranger to movies about racing. (It can't be a coincidence that one of Hayes' Zen-like pastimes is throwing a ball against a wall like McQueen in The Great Escape.) F1 couldn't feel more contemporary in its focus over a sport that's the current obsession of millions, yet couldn't feel more like a flashback to a bygone age where a larger-than-life movie star was the only necessary I.P. This is what blockbusters used to look like. Come for the most impressive, lustrous car that a gajillion-dollar budget can buy. The reason to stay, however, is the driver.”

Alex Medeiros, head of drama, documentaries & film at Brazilian media and entertainment giant Grupo Globo's streaming service Globoplay, spoke at Conecta Fiction & Entertainment in Cuenca, Spain.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Conecta Fiction & Entertainment, taking place in Cuenca, Spain, this week, may be mostly a TV industry gathering, but Brazil's Oscar-winning movie I'm Still Here, directed by Walter Salles and starring Fernanda Torres, got a big shout-out at the event on Wednesday. 


	Alex Medeiros, head of drama, documentaries & film at Brazilian media and entertainment giant Grupo Globo‘s streaming service Globoplay, appeared at Conecta in a session entitled “American Commissioners Uncovered,” and he touted the movie's success. Highlighting that the story of a family broken apart by dictatorship was the first movie from the company after it merged its two film brands under the Globo Filmes banner, he said: “We're extremely happy and proud that we won Brazil's first-ever Oscar for best international feature.”

	The executive then quipped: “Well, it's only downhill from there, but this is really a great moment for us, and we hope to keep investing in the theatrical experience.” 


	Globo brings films to cinemas first and then to its streaming platform, and there is a good reason for that. “We still think that the better they do theatrically, the better they will do on the platform, and so far, that has been the case,” Medeiros explained. 


	Next up for Globo is School Without Walls, a film about a public school in one of Brazil's biggest favelas directed by Cao Hamburger, that is a co-production of Brazil's Gullane, Portugal's Ukbar Filmes and France's Playtime Group that is also backed by Telecine. Julio Andrade stars as an inspirational headteacher in the movie.

	











	“We are shooting in two weeks,” Medeiros shared at Conecta. “We have high hopes for this movie. It's a beautiful, true story about a guy who implements a very revolutionary methodology in a school in a very difficult area of Sao Paulo.”


	On Tuesday at Conecta, executives from the likes of Gaumont Television and Warner Bros. Discovery had discussed their original programming plans and the state of the TV industry.

Ozzy Osbourne is officially the Prince of Immortality, or at least, he's giving fans a shot at it. 


	In one of the most bizarre and perfectly on-brand collaborations of the year, Liquid Death has announced it will sell a limited run of iced tea cans containing traces of Osbourne's actual DNA.


	The ultra-limited release, dubbed Infinite Ozzy, features 10 cans of Liquid Death Iced Tea that were each consumed by Osbourne before being sealed to preserve his DNA, with each can coming in a lab-quality display container and is hand-signed by the rock legend. The drop will go live Tuesday (June 17) at liquiddeath.com/ozzy, with each DNA can priced at $450.

	The campaign arrives just weeks before Osbourne is set to return to the stage for what's being billed as the final Black Sabbath show. The metal icon recently revealed that he's undergoing intense training to prepare for Back to the Beginning, the massive July 5 hometown concert at Villa Park in Birmingham, England — his first full performance since 2018.


	“I haven't done any physical work for the last seven, six and a half, seven years,” Osbourne shared during the latest episode of his SiriusXM show Ozzy Speaks. “By hook or by crook, I'm gonna make it [to the stage at Villa Park].” The star-studded farewell show is set to feature appearances by Metallica, Mastodon, Pantera, Slayer, Anthrax, Gojira, Alice in Chains, and a supergroup composed of members of Guns N' Roses, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine and more.

	“I've got this trainer guy who helps people get back to normal,” he added. “It's hard going, but he's convinced that he can pull it off for me. I'm giving it everything I've got.”

	











	As for the Liquid Death collab, the brand says the goal is to preserve Osbourne's DNA in case fans want to clone him in the future, once technology and law allow. The campaign leans heavily into Liquid Death's signature over-the-top style, which previously included Tony Hawk skateboards infused with his blood.


	A teaser video shared with press ahead of the launch shows Osbourne deadpanning: “My DNA is in this can. You could clone me — but why the f**k would you want to?” Only 10 Infinite Ozzy cans exist.


	Osbourne's most recent studio album, Patient Number 9, debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 in 2022. Despite major health setbacks, including spinal surgeries and a Parkinson's diagnosis, he has remained creatively active and continues to embrace his role as heavy metal's most enduring provocateur.

The singer appeared to be agitated by the sight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arresting people on the streets.

	Like the reported five million plus Americans who took to the streets across the country over the weekend as part of the massive “No Kings” rallies, Bad Bunny is not happy with the Trump administration's recent actions. In a video posted to his Instagram Story on Tuesday (June 17), the singer lashed out at what he said was a raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in his native Puerto Rico.

	











	“Those motherf–kers are in these cars, RAV4's,” Bad Bunny can be heard saying in the video in Spanish over footage of a scrum of unmarked SUVs blocking the street and seemingly apprehending some people on what the singer said was Avenida Pontezuela in Carolina, Puerto Rico. “They came here… sons of b–ches, instead of letting the people alone and working.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	At press time it was unclear what the footage Bad Bunny posted was depicting, but if the action was part of the Trump administration's stepped-up ICE raids all over the U.S. it comes after the president surged more than 4,000 National Guard members and 700 active-duty Marines into Los Angeles — over the objections of both the mayor and the state's governor — to quell what have been mostly peaceful protests against the ICE raids in that city.


	Though Trump promised to remove criminals who are in the U.S. without proper documentation, the ICE raids have so far targeted a much wider swath of folks. NPR reported recently that the raids in Puerto Rico have mostly rounded up Dominican immigrants in actions that harken back to the island's “long history of anti-Dominican racism,” with racial profiling possibly playing a role in the arrests. 

	











	Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico Rebecca González-Ramos said agents on the island nation have done surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, questioned people in the street and asked workers at the department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the estimated 6,000 people who got licenses under an immigrant-friendly law that opened driving privileges to people without legal status, according to NPR. 


	González-Ramos added that so far ICE agents in P.R. have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the first four months of Trump's second administration, less than 80 of whom had criminal records; three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals.


	Bad Bunny joins a rising chorus of artists who've lashed out at the ICE raids. Over the weekend, Olivia Rodrigo posted her thoughts on the ICE deportations, saying, “I've lived in LA my whole life, and I'm deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration. LA simply wouldn't exist without immigrants.”


	Addison Rae also said she was “so disappointed and disturbed by what is happening across our nation. This country could not exist without immigrants. Every human being deserves the right to exist in an environment that makes them feel safe, lovingly protected, and embraced.” Finneas claimed he was tear-gassed during a peaceful protest in L.A. earlier this month, writing “F–K ICE… If you are into this fascist s–t you are small and weak and will lose.”


	Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong has also hit out at ICE, in addition to Katy Perry who has called the raids a “huge injustice,” while Shakira said she lives in “constant fear” as an immigrant in the U.S. Others who protested the actions in L.A. include Tyler, the Creator, The Game, Kehlani, Tom Morello, Reneé Rapp and Rebecca Black.

	











	Earlier this month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration to end what he said was the “illegal and unnecessary takeover of a CalGuard unit, which has needlessly escalated chaos and violence in the Los Angeles region.” The lawsuit names Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Department of Defense, in a filing that outlines “why the takeover violates the U.S. Constitution and exceeds the President's Title 10 authority, not only because the takeover occurred without the consent or input of the Governor, as federal law requires,  but also because it was unwarranted.”


	Trump responded over the weekend by saying that ICE must “expand  efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” cities the president described as “the core of the Democrat Power Center.”

The news comes after Jimin and Jung Kook were recently released from their mandatory army service.

	In addition, Big Hit said, “We are always grateful for your unwavering love and support for SUGA. Our company will continue to put our utmost effort into supporting our artists. Thank you once again for your continued love and support for BTS.”

	At press time it was not known exactly when Suga will be released, but when he is discharged he will be last member of the group to complete the nation's 18-21 month mandatory military service; due to a prior shoulder injury, Suga did an alternate national service. Last week, Jung Kook and Jimin were discharged, joining RM, V, Jin and J-Hope in finishing their obligations, paving the way for the septet to reconvene after they went on hiatus in 2022.

	











	After his discharge last month, J-Hope told fans, “To all the ARMYs who have waited for us in the military, I want to say I am truly, truly grateful. Please wait just a little longer and we will return with a really cool performance.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:billboard.com","The 75 Best R&B Artists of All Time (No. 75-11): Staff Picks","https://www.billboard.com/lists/best-rb-singers-all-time/","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 16:40:48 GMT","

Billboard's special salute to Black Music Month continues its rollout with the next 25 artists on our all-time top 75 list.


	What a difference 10 years can make. That was the last time Billboard tackled the monumental feat of ranking the top R&B artists, dating back to the ‘50s. Michael Jackson, whose grew from his R&B roots to capture the King of Pop crown, ruled over that 2015 tally. Now as the music industry and fans celebrate Black Music Month 2025, Billboard is picking up the “best of all time” gauntlet once again.


	Expanding from 35 to 75 entries, this latest iteration kicked off Monday (June 16) with the reveal of the artists ranked 75-51, and continued yesterday with Nos. 50-26 — with both updates already eliciting spirited discussions online. Now the countdown moves forward today (June 18) with Nos. 25-11. From there, the final curtain-raising will come on Juneteenth (June 19), as we reveal the top 10 honorees.


	Staff discussions on how to go about determining the entries and rankings were, to say the least, heated. Helping to fuel these illuminating and sometimes raucous discourses were generational debates over old school vs. new school. At the same time, “Mount Rushmore” debates were also raging on the social media front, as fans weighed in on which R&B artists — like Jackson, Chris Brown, Luther Vandross, R. Kelly and Usher — truly deserve to have their images carved in stone for all time.


	In the end, Billboard staffers agreed on the following criteria: vocal prowess, body of work, career longevity, industry achievements, game-changing influence and enduring generational/cultural impact. While some singers who made the list are also known for their lyrical skills, songwriting wasn't a major deciding factor in this instance. And legendary singers best known for fronting groups versus their solo work were not included — which means a ranking of the best R&B groups of all time is no doubt in the offing.


	In the meantime, any best-of compilation automatically invites naysayers to the party. As these 75 singers are revealed, the expectant clamor will rise in response to our staff's effrontery in deciding who's now on or off the list, who's risen or been dropped or who still has never made this latest version or the 2015 ranking.


	More crucial, however, is understanding a chief intention behind Billboard's 75 Best R&B Singers of All Time. It's a teachable moment at a time when Black history, culture and its achievements are being erased or revised across the board. Black Music Month originated in 1979 via the efforts of the observance's co-founders Dyana Williams, Kenneth Gamble and Ed Wright. And each year it drives home an insightful comment made by author/activist Maya Angelou: “You can't know where you are going until you know where you have been.”


	So here's to the rich past and the unlimited future of the multifaceted jewel that is R&B as the reveal continues.




	Before Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin constructed their own melodious upper floors, Atlantic Records was known as “the house that Ruth built.” One of the first artists signed to Ahmet Ertegun and Herb Abramson's newborn label, Brown rocketed to a top five debut on the R&B chart with her 1949 debut single “So Long.” She reigned at No. 1 for multiple weeks just a year later with “Teardrops From My Eyes.” That song was the first in a remarkable — and then-unheard-of — string of No. 1 and top 10 hits throughout the ‘50s, including “5-10-15 Hours,” “(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean,” “Oh What a Dream” and “I Want to Do More.” Nicknamed Miss Rhythm for her versatile vocal expertise, described alternately as sassy, stately, playful but always powerful, Brown later won a Tony, appeared in the 1988 film classic Hairspray and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. — GAIL MITCHELL


Must-Listen Song: “Teardrops From My Eyes”


	Summer Walker solidified herself as one of contemporary R&B's most blunt voices with a fusion of traditional melodies, moody trap production and unfiltered songwriting. Her 2018 debut mixtape Last Day of Summer introduced her twinkling late-night musings on heartbreak and healing, with breakthrough lead single “Girls Need Love” receiving a Drake remix. The following year, Walker continued telling melodramatic romantic tales through digital-era references and nods to '90s R&B classics on debut album Over It, which logged the biggest week for an R&B album by a female artist in over three years. Two years later, Still Over It proved Walker's pen is her best weapon for seeking vengeance. It not only marked her first Billboard 200 No. 1 LP, but also the first R&B album by a woman to top the Billboard 200 in more than five years — plus the largest streaming week ever for an R&B album by a woman. Hell hath no fury like Summer Walker scorned.  — HERAN MAMO


Must-Listen Song: “Girls Need Love”


	In a career spanning 60 years, beginning as a teen in the R&B/jazz girl group the Creolettes — rechristened by Black bandleader-mentor Otis James as the Peaches — Etta James (born Jamesetta Hawkins) remains one of the most iconic voices in R&B. Scoring her Peaches breakthrough in 1955 with the chart-topping “The Wallflower,” James started cementing her legend status through solo turns such as “All I Could Do Was Cry,” “Trust in Me” and what became her signature track, 1960's “At Last.” Pop and R&B icon Beyoncé later portrayed the inimitable Rock and Roll and Grammy Hall of Famer in the 2008 film Cadillac Records, a bio-drama about James' longtime label Chess Records. James helped usher in a vital era of blues and R&B, as she battled personal demons along the way, to ultimately become an undeniably influential force in music history. — ANGEL DIAZ


Must-Listen Song: “At Last”


	Known as “Mr. Excitement” for his electrifying performances and expansive voice, Jackie Wilson's presence as a R&B/pop star between the ‘50s and ‘70s inspired icons like Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. The Detroit singer, a former gospel group member and amateur boxer, re-energized his solo career in 1957 thanks to songs penned by Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr.  including the international hit “Reet Petite” and the No. 1 R&B/No. 7 pop hit “Lonely Teardrops” in 1958. Wilson is also credited as a major player in steering the progression of old-school R&B into soul music, with songs like “(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher” easily standing the test of time. — WILLIAM E. KETCHUM III


Must-Listen Song: “(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher”


	Over 20 years ago, Keyshia Cole swept through the R&B circuit like a hurricane. Her piercing vocals and soul-baring lyrics cut deep, brimming with heartbreak and grit, as proven on songs like “Love,” “I Changed My Mind” and “I Should Have Cheated.” But when Cole wasn't seething at her ex-lovers like a ball of fury, she knew how to let her hair down and have fun. “Let It Go” remains an instant party starter, while her scene-stealing feature on Diddy's “Last Night” shines bright as an indelible gem in her decorated catalog. Cole's raw girl-talk energy lit the fuse for future storytellers like Summer Walker and SZA. — CARL LAMARRE


Must-Listen Song: “Love”


	Since adopting the stage name H.E.R. in 2016, the singer born Gabriella Wilson has been shrouded in mystery: she eschewed photographs and videos altogether for years. And even after finally revealing herself, it's rare that you'll see her without a pair of oversized sunglasses covering most of her face. But the Grammy, Emmy and Academy Award-winning singer-songwriter's music more than speaks for itself. Her name is an acronym for “Having Everything Revealed,” and through a string of EPs released in the late 2010s before her 2021 studio debut Back of My Mind, she pairs prodigious instrumental talents (playing piano, drums, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and bass guitar) with vulnerable, open-hearted songwriting, yielding such songs as“Could've Been,” “Hard Place,” “Fight for You” and “I Can't Breathe.” — W.K.


Must-Listen Song: “Damage”


	When Bobby Womack scored his first hit in 1962 as part of family group the Valentinos – the sweet soul single “Lookin' for a Love” – few would've guessed he'd have a generation-spanning career as an R&B stalwart. But he grew with the genre, scoring an inner-city classic with “Across 110th Street” (and revamping “Lookin'” as a solo smash) in the ‘70s, giving the Quiet Storm radio format one of its most classic ballads with “If You Think You're Lonely Now” in the ‘80s, and returning to 21st century relevance through his collaborations with across-the-pond acolyte Damon Albarn, who co-produced his 2012 comeback album The Bravest Man in the Universe and featured him on the Gorillaz' 2010 hit “Stylo.” Womack's gravelly voice and full-gravity delivery made him an indelible element of soul music right up until his 2014 passing. — ANDREW UNTERBERGER


Must-Listen Song: “Across 110th Street”


	Phyllis Hyman's mellifluous contralto and inventive embellishments transformed every song into magic. She covered “Betcha by Golly Wow” on Norman Connors' 1976 You Are My Starship set and sang the Barry Manilow-produced “Somewhere in My Lifetime” on her Arista debut. From the uptempo “You Know How to Love Me” to ballads “Can't We Fall In Love Again?” with Michael Henderson, “No One Can Love You More,” and “I Refuse to Be Lonely,” Hyman poured raw emotion onto every track. A riveting live performer, Hyman starred in Broadway's Sophisticated Ladies and appeared in Spike Lee's 1988 sophomore film School Daze. Tragically, she ended her life in June 1995. — JANINE COVENEY


Must-Listen Song: “Living All Alone”


	Tank's songwriting and production prowess has been employed by other superstars like Aaliyah, Beyoncé, Chris Brown and Kelly Rowland. But his solo career is just as prolific. He's got more than 20 years under his belt when it comes to satisfying traditional and contemporary R&B fans with songs like “Maybe I Deserve” and “Please Don't Go.” Ever the collaborator, he also formed the group TGT with fellow R&B stalwarts Ginuwine and Tyrese, with their 2013 album Three Kings earning him a fourth Grammy nomination. He's also dedicated to supporting the genre beyond his own music, co-hosting the award-winning R&B Money Podcast with J. Valentine. — W.K.


Must-Listen Song: “Maybe I Deserve”


	Before Bobby Brown took the genre to the very top of the Hot 100 in 1989 with “My Prerogative,” Keith Sweat established the mainstream bonafides of New Jack Swing with 1987's Make It Last Forever album, matching slamming hits like “I Want Her” with smooth-sounding ballads like the title track. Platinum albums would follow for the rest of the 20th century, peaking with Sweat's 1996 grown-up, self-titled effort and its smash ballads “Twisted” (with Kut Klose) and “Nobody” (with Athena Cage). Even today, any “King of R&B” discussion still needs to include this seasoned performer who helped bring the genre into the modern age. — A.U.


Must-Listen Song: “Make It Last Forever”


	A songwriter, musician and producer, Teena Marie fought labels to make her own kind of music. Starting in 1979, hits “I'm a Sucker for Your Love,” “Behind the Groove,” “Lover Girl,” “Ooo La La La” and her timeless “Fire and Desire” duet with frequent collaborator Rick James — as well as album track faves such as “Déjà Vu” — placed Marie in the pantheon of influential R&B artists. Though audiences didn't initially realize she was white, Marie's passionate vocals and impressive musicality were steeped in Black idioms and musical traditions. Her 1981 hit “Square Biz,” featuring her indelible rap skills, further legitimized hip-hop as a mainstream genre. A popular live performer, Marie passed away in 2010 at age 54. — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “Out on a Limb”


	Initially drawing buzz in the early ‘00s with indie releases SoulSinger and Feeling Orange but Sometimes Blue, Ledisi's four-octave mezzo soprano vocal prowess continues to mesmerize — most recently when the singer-songwriter performed a compelling live rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Black national anthem, at this year's Super Bowl LIX pre-game festivities. Telling DownBeat magazine that “I'm not your boxed R&B singer,” the prolific Ledisi has steadfastly crafted a catalog of 12 studio albums featuring colorful forays into R&B/soul, funk, pop and jazz. Fan faves paving that journey include “Alright,” “In the Morning,” “I Blame You” and “Anything for You” — the latter of which yielded her first Grammy for best traditional R&B performance in 2021. — G.M.


Must-Listen Song: “Pieces of Me”


	With a moniker like Musiq, the Philly-bred singer had no choice but to live up to it. In 2000, Soulchild's brainchild Aijustwanaseing vaulted him into R&B prominence, courtesy of his personal touch and delivery on songs like “Just Friends (Sunny)” and “Love.” Soulchild straddled R&B and neo-soul with the grace of a poet and the soul of a preacher, sculpting ballads like “halfcrazy” and “Dontchange” as well as uptempo charmers like “B.U.D.D.Y.”  Musical peers have also enlisted his distinctive vocals for their projects including India.Arie, Robert Glasper and Kehlani. Soulchild's boundless creativity and depth made him an R&B dark horse who was never shy to run a race against some of the genre's best. — C.L.


Must-Listen Song: “Love”


	As the sound of popular music shifted throughout the ‘00s and ‘10s, Charlotte, N.C.-bred crooner Anthony Hamilton kept good old-fashioned, cornbread-fed soul at the forefront. From his 2003 breakthrough hit “Charlene” to later hits like 2008's “The Point of It All” and 2011's “Best of Me,” the Grammy-winning singer's raspy, gritty baritone has made him one of the most beloved traditional male R&B vocalists of the 21st century. With four No. 1s from 12 top 10 hits on Adult R&B Airplay, Hamilton's career also includes a stint as a backing vocalist for D'Angelo and leading the HamilTones, a soul, gospel and hip-hop-bridging group comprised of his background singers. — KYLE DENIS


Must-Listen Song: “Best of Me”


	Before Ashanti bloomed into a full-blown R&B superstar in the 2000s, she was a burgeoning songwriter lobbing assists with Chris Paul precision to rap giants. After leaving her fingerprints on Big Pun's “How We Roll,” Irv Gotti's R&B golden child became a force, creating magic on Hot 100 thrillers like Ja Rule's “Always on Time” and Fat Joe's “What's Luv,” which held down the top two spots on the Hot 100 simultaneously in 2002. That same year, Ashanti catapulted to fame with the release of her debut single as a lead artist, the heartbreaking “Foolish,” which spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100. From 2002 to 2003, Ashanti's torrid run was untouchable, as she scorched earth with a bevy of top 40 singles like “Baby” and “Happy,” plus the back-to-back Billboard 200 chart-toppers, Ashanti and Chapter II. — C.L.


Must-Listen Song: “Foolish”


	Ne-Yo's three-album run from 2006 to 2008 — In My Own Words, Because of You and Year of the Gentleman — was a game-changer within the R&B landscape. Debut album In My Own Words aptly showcased the Grammy winner's precocious songwriting skills and his ability to switch from debonair to savage, all while maintaining his unique, silky falsetto. Melancholic hits such as “So Sick” and “Do You” resonated strongly with audiences, while his cogent hooks on hip-hop classics like Fabolous' “Make You Better” and Plies' “Bust It Baby” — as well as his featured role on Pitbull's 2014 top 10 party jam “Time of Our Lives” — solidified Ne-Yo's status as the Swiss army knife of 21st-century crossover R&B. — C.L.


Must-Listen Song: “Miss Independent”


	Fantasia first captured listeners' hearts in 2004 as the winner of American Idol, drawing comparisons to legendary singers like Aretha Franklin and Tina Turner with her powerful, church-honed vocals and unshakable stage presence. “I Believe,” her first single after winning the show, debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, putting her in rarified air with Ms. Lauryn Hill. But in the years since, she's proven that she's more than a lightning-in-a-bottle reality TV star. Garnering a best female R&B vocal performance Grammy statuette for “Bittersweet” in 2011 after a dozen nominations, Fantasia has also showcased her talents in the Broadway and film adaptations of The Color Purple. — W.K.


Must-Listen Song: “When I See U”


	Propelled by the midnight ballad “Feel the Fire” in 1977, Robert “Peabo” Bryson became one of the smoothest balladeers and songwriters of the R&B/pop genre. A string of wedding themes and bedroom grooves followed, including “If Ever You're In My Arms Again,” “I'm So Into You,” “Can You Stop the Rain” and “Let the Feeling Flow,” capitalizing on Bryson's drama-drenched tenor. He was also a popular duet partner, teaming with Roberta Flack for ‘Tonight, I Celebrate My Love” and earning Grammys for two Disney movie themes: “A Whole New World” with Regina Belle from Aladdin, and the Beauty and the Beast title track with Celine Dion. — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “Reaching for the Sky”


	Introduced by Quincy Jones on “Tomorrow,” the lead single from his Grammy-winning 1989 album Back on the Block, Tevin Campbell was just 14 when he recorded his 1991 debut album T.E.V.I.N. But he had truly found his voice by the time his sophomore album arrived in 1991. I'm Ready paired his sweet tenor with songwriting and production by GOATs like Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds and Prince. Two of Edmonds' contributions, “Can We Talk” and the title track, are songs that allowed Campbell a chance to deliver earnest, wholesome longing for love – sentiments that made for some of the sturdiest ballads that R&B had to offer in the ‘90s. — W.K.


Music-Listen Song: “Can We Talk”


	With a career spanning over three decades, Joe's tantalizing vocals were always soothing and entrancing for love-drunk couples eager for late-night romance. His third album, My Name Is Joe, was a breakthrough, featuring the top five Hot 100 hit “I Wanna Know” — which became the singer's crown jewel and foreshadowed Joe's grown-man appeal lasting well into the 2010s. The singer-songwriter's ability to cater to different R&B audiences was evident in his cinematic Hot 100 No. 1 “Stutter,” as well as his timeless features on G-Unit's “Wanna Get to Know You,” Big Pun's “Still Not a Player,” and Mariah Carey's “Thank God I Found You.” — C.L.


Must-Listen Song: “I Wanna Know”


	She was the daughter of Nat “King” Cole, the jazz/pop singer and pianist behind such classics as “Mona Lisa” and “The Christmas Song.” But the younger Cole became a star in her own right. Her ecstatic 1975 debut single “This Will Be” opened the door to a best new artist Grammy, and the first of six R&B No. 1s, a run also including “I've Got Love on My Mind” and “Our Love.” A vocal virtuoso who flipped effortlessly from R&B and pop to funk, jazz and rock (covering Bruce Springsteen's “Pink Cadillac”), while employing colorful ad libs and scats, Cole came full circle with her father's legacy when she recorded standards he'd performed for 1991's multiplatinum Unforgettable … With Love. The title track — a duet with her late dad — won record of the year, while the project itself won album of the year. — G.M.


Must-Listen Song: “This Will Be”


	With her incredibly intricate, rapid-fire riffs ready to color her singular, idiosyncratic songwriting, Jazmine Sullivan stands as one of contemporary R&B's greatest treasures. Heavily inspired by the neo-soul of her native Philadelphia, Penn., Sullivan's two-time Grammy-winning catalog explores the ins and outs of modern Black love and relationship dynamics while maintaining her connection to blues, jazz and gospel. She's collected two chart-toppers from six Adult R&B Airplay top 10 hits, and each of her full-length projects has spun out several cult classics and street hits – from 2008's “Need U Bad” to 2020's “Pick Up Your Feelings.” — K.D.


Must-Listen Song: “Masterpiece (Mona Lisa)”


	As Erykah Badu and D'Angelo became more musically and spiritually ambitious around the turn of the century, attempting to touch the cosmos with their sprawling, soul-searching LPs, Jilly from Philly emerged as the girl from the neighborhood happy to just take a long walk with you. While proving herself both a brilliant lyricist and powerhouse singer in her own right over a decade and a half of acclaimed and increasingly successful albums – her final two releases to date, 2011's The Light of the Sun and 2015's Woman, both topped the Billboard 200 – Jill Scott never lost that approachability, and her Mother's Day Verzuz with Badu in 2020 remains perhaps the series' most charming, thanks largely to her relentless likability and her consistently winning catalog. — A.U.


Must-Listen Song: “The Way”


	The powerful voice of Brooklyn's own Stephanie Mills as Dorothy in Broadway's 1974 smash The Wiz — defying her diminutive stature — stunned and mesmerized audiences. With the show's “Home” becoming her signature song, Mills launched a recording career that soared in the late ‘70s with dancefloor hits “Put Your Body In It,” “You Can Get Over,” gold-certified single “What Cha Gonna Do With My Lovin',” “Sweet Sensation” and the Teddy Pendergrass duet “Two Hearts.” Equally adept at mid-tempo ballads, Mills earned her first and only Grammy in 1981 for the R&B/pop crossover hit “Never Knew Love Like This Before.” Still a popular concert draw, Mills recently joined fellow R&B legends Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle on the Queens! 4 Legends. 1 Stage tour. — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “I Feel Good All Over”


	Before he was a four-word catchphrase, Rick James carried the Motown banner into the 1980s with a delicious blend of funk, rock, disco and R&B nearly unrecognizable from the storied label's clean-cut, friendly 1960s and 1970s classics. But that was James, a free-spirited author who wrote his own rules. And while that often came with personal costs, his boldness forged a rich catalog whose highlights – “Give It to Me Baby,” “Mary Jane” and the like – build on the creativity of contemporaries like Stevie Wonder, Parliament and Prince. And long before TikTok was the engine for throwback revivals, Chappelle's Show enshrined the man's name into immortality with a simple declaration: “I'm Rick James, bitch.” All right then. — TREVOR ANDERSON


Must-Listen Song: “Give It to Me Baby”


	Hailed for his poignant songwriting, buttery smooth tenor and mastery of the piano, John Legend exploded into stardom with his timeless debut single “Ordinary People.” From there, the R&B star went on to make history as one of the few artists to achieve EGOT status and, in turn, creating one of the best-selling digital singles of all time with “All of Me.” Bringing an assured emotional depth to his music, Legend's mix of modern and classic soul music has impacted hundreds of fans across multiple generations. Beyond that chart success, he has been hailed for his activism and intoxicating live performances. It's undeniable that Legend remains a defining figure in contemporary soul music. — MACKENZIE CUMMINGS-GRADY


Must-Listen Song: “All of Me”


	After his antics as New Edition's roguish sex symbol crossed the line from charming to dangerous, Bobby Brown split with the enormously successful R&B/pop group. And after a brief false start, he embarked upon a solo career that took him to even greater superstardom. His 1988 blockbuster Don't Be Cruel topped the Billboard 200 and spun off a whopping five Hot 100 top 10 hits, including the chart-topping, backlash-dismissing “My Prerogative.” Cruel pushed the sound of ‘80s R&B into the ‘90s with a largely up-tempo and attitude-driven sound, filtered through pop mega-hooks that polished the Teddy Riley-pioneered New Jack Swing sound into something ready for top 40 domination — with Brown its leading purveyor. His reign didn't last, but his impact did. You can feel Brown's DNA in later crossover stars like Usher, Chris Brown, Justin Bieber and even Britney Spears. — A.U.


Must-Listen Song: “My Prerogative”


	From her melodic contributions on the Fugees' 1996 blockbuster sophomore set The Score to her own groundbreaking 1998 debut with The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Ms. Lauryn Hill effortlessly toed the line between hip-hop and R&B. Her genre-shifting talents across those two albums reoriented perceived musical boundaries between R&B, funk, jazz, boom-bap and pop. While no sophomore effort has yet appeared, Miseducation alone was enough for the polymath to nab five Grammys in 1999, including album of the year and best new artist. The test of time has been extremely kind to her work as her R&B and hip-hop prowess continues to influence many of today's buzzing new singers. – M.C.G.


Must-Listen Song: “Ex-Factor”


	The Weeknd's irrefutable influence in R&B will go down in history. His three mixtapes in 2011 – House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence – were foundational platforms for the alternative R&B (aka PBR&B) movement of the 2010s. His hauntingly beautiful falsetto and stirring melisma relayed stories about unfulfilling bed-hopping and pill-popping rendezvous in the wee hours and melancholic musings about failed relationships and the detrimental effects of fame. He sampled indie and post-punk bands like Siouxsie & the Banshee and also incorporated trip-hop and ambient music to add a darker tint to the genre. Even as the underground cult figure evolved into one of the 21st century's most reliable hitmakers, with his Michael Jackson-esque Hot 100 No. 1 “Can't Feel My Face” and the synth-pop juggernaut “Blinding Lights,” R&B still stands at the heart of his artistry and legacy. — H.M.


Must-Listen Song: “Wicked Games”


	Rihanna's genre-bending sound, anchored by her Caribbean roots, has made her one of the most successful crossover artists in R&B/pop. Her first two albums, Music of the Sun and A Girl Like Me, flaunted her youthful fusion of breezy dancehall rhythms, sultry R&B melodies and radio-friendly, dance-pop sensibilities. But 2007 LP Good Girl Gone Bad marked a career turning point with the emergence of Bad Gal RiRi, characterized by synth-heavy electronic production, hip-hop swagger and a grown & sexy persona that persisted throughout subsequent albums. Then Rihanna brought R&B back to the forefront of her sound on 2016's chef-d'oeuvre ANTI, recognizing old traditions like the doo-wop-inspired ballad “Love on the Brain” and the bluesy ditty “Higher” to riding the alt-R&B wave with her Tame Impala cover “Same Ol' Mistakes” and the SZA-featuring “Consideration.” While her musical career hangs in the balance, Rihanna's reign won't ever let up. — H.M.


Must-Listen Song: “Umbrella”


	From “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” sex symbol and music video innovator to elusive, enigmatic Black Messiah, D'Angelo has assumed many outer skins across his storied career. 1995's Brown Sugar and 2000's Voodoo proved seminal neo-soul works that continue to serve as key references for their era and genre, while 2014's transcendental Black Messiah helped bring his Grammy win total to four. His catalog may be brief, but it's near peerless, as evidenced by his 2021 Verzuz, which eschewed the battle format in favor of a solo set featuring his collaborators. The Richmond, Va.-hailing singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist boasts five Adult R&B Airplay top 10 hits, including enduring anthems like “Lady” and “Cruisin.” — K.D.


Must-Listen Song: “1000 Deaths”


	SZA's girl-next-door charisma and emotional complexity attracted awkward Black girls everywhere, but her boundary-pushing R&B has since expanded her audience. The beautiful, eccentric melodies and indie rock, neo-soul and trap influences on 2017 debut studio album Ctrl gave SZA an edge. And her diaristic songwriting explored adolescent anxieties and insecurities, from questioning if she's beautiful enough to empathizing with those trying to get their s–t together in their 20s. Its long-awaited sequel, SOS, took everything up a notch: diversifying her sound by diving into gospel, grunge and surf rock. SOS continues to smash chart records – like spending the most weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 among albums by women – proving that artists with an R&B foundation like SZA can successfully break through the genre's borders and ascend into pop's upper echelon. — H.M


Must-Listen Song: “Love Galore”


	Dionne Warwick is often seen these days dropping the occasional wisecrack on X. But that belies the fact that she's one of the most-charted vocalists of all time. Beginning her career in the early 1960s, she paired her dynamic, distinctive vocals over pop gems by revered songwriter/producers Burt Bacharach and Hal David — one of the few Black artists to score major crossover success during that period. From there, Warwick ventured into jazz, R&B and gospel. She counts 56 singles that charted on the Billboard Hot 100 between 1962 and 1998, with 12 of them making the top 10 from “I Say a Little Prayer” to “That's What Friends Are For.” Warwick has continued to occasionally release new music in her golden years and, as recently as June 2025, she's still impressing live audiences with her fabulous, lilting vocals. — W.K.


Must-Listen Song: “Walk on By”


	The late Barry White was nicknamed “The Walrus of Love.” And few nicknames were so fitting: his deep, rumbling bass voice and irresistibly romantic demeanor made him a popular R&B heartthrob in the ‘70s, the peak of a decades-long, Grammy-winning career as a solo singer. Backed by his own Love Unlimited Orchestra — earning him a second nickname as “The Maestro” — White cast a host of romantic spells through songs like “Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe,” “You're the First, the Last, My Everything,” “Never, Never Gonna Give Ya Up” and “Practice What You Preach.” And who can forget his MVP assist on Quincy Jones' “The Secret Garden”? Those Quiet Storm staples are just morsels in a prolific discography comprised of 20 studio albums as well as 20 gold and 10 platinum singles. — W.K.


Must-Listen Song: “Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe”


	The head-bobbing 1990s singles “I Wanna Be Down,” “Baby” and “Sittin' Up in My Room” (from the 1995 film Waiting to Exhale) proved that teen phenom Brandy Norwood possessed widespread appeal. After teaming with producer Rodney “Darkchild” Jenkins, she scored additional hits with “Best Friend” and the Grammy-winning Monica duet “The Boy Is Mine.” Brandy's down-to-earth style and honeyed vocals kept her on the charts into the new millennium with fan faves “Almost Doesn't Count,” “Top of the World,” and “What About Us.” A star in other mediums as well — the television series Moesha and Disney's 1997 update of Cinderella, handpicked by Whitney Houston for the title role — Brandy celebrated her 30th anniversary in music in 2024. — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “Have You Ever”


	Despite an all-too-brief life, Aaliyah shaped the first era of R&B stars reared in hip-hop culture. Describing her style as “sweet but street,” Aaliyah married her honeyed, airy falsetto with the exciting, street-savvy beats courtesy of her most frequent collaborators, Timbaland, Missy Elliott and R. Kelly, for gems such as “One in a Million,” “Are You That Somebody?” and “Try Again.” She further expanded that musical sense with an effortlessly cool demeanor in her fashion choices and music videos. Of course, we'll always wonder about the “what ifs,” but even with less than a decade between her career's start and her tragic death in 2001, Aaliyah created a legacy that has echoed for generations. — T.A.


Must-Listen Song: “Are You That Somebody?”


	Roberta Flack is often credited with helping to build the foundation for Quiet Storm, the popular radio format that became as one of the foremost platforms for R&B in the 1970s and 1980s. The vocalist, songwriter and keyboardist merged R&B, soul, jazz, pop and folk into her music that also showcased her warm, caressing vocals. She scored three Hot 100 chart-toppers: “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” “Killing Me Softly With His Song” and “Feel Like Makin' Love.” Not to mention two top five hits with fellow R&B icon Donny Hathaway, “The Closer I Get to You” and “Where Is the Love.” Flack was the first artist to win the Grammy for record of the year for two consecutive years. She passed away in February 2025, but not before receiving a Grammy lifetime achievement award in 2020. — W.K.


Must-Listen Song: “Killing Me Softly with His Song”


	You can't tell the story of neo-soul without acknowledging the contributions of Maxwell. Emerging in 1996 with debut album Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite, he was part of a cadre of artists — including Erykah Badu and D'Angelo — who, between the mid- and late ‘90s, distinctively reshaped the look and sound of R&B. Since then, Maxwell has continued to pave his own singular lane of swoon-worthy, grown & sexy R&B well into the 2010s by way of his undulating tenor and tender falsetto. Cuts like “Fortunate,” “Lifetime” and “Pretty Wings” are just as lush and soul-bearing as they were more than a decade ago — as witnessed during the Grammy winner's 2024 NPR Tiny Desk performance, which has drawn nearly six million views. — W.K.


Must-Listen Song: “Lifetime”


	Christopher Breaux went by Lonny Breaux when he wrote songs for R&B heavyweights like Beyoncé, John Legend and Alicia Keys. But as Frank Ocean, he changed the genre forever. His 2011 debut mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra recontextualized the conversational flow of hip-hop and the gritty, trippy instrumentation of indie and classic rock (borrowing from the Eagles, MGMT and Coldplay) while keeping R&B/soul's emotional vulnerability at the heart of his music. Ocean's 2012 Grammy-winning debut album Channel Orange then rewrote the narrative for Black queer artists in the R&B/hip-hop space. After dropping cult-favorite visual album Endless, Ocean independently released Blonde. The experimental magnum opus features flashes of psychedelic pop, avant-soul and electronica, accented by multi-layered, pitch-changing vocals outlining the artist's continued exploration of queerness, Black masculinity and existentialism. The project reinforced Ocean's ongoing status as a culture-shifting genius — despite his vexatious absence. — H.M.


Must-Listen Song: “Thinkin Bout You”


	L.A. Reid and Babyface tapped this sultry alto from Arista Records' sister act The Braxtons to record a scratch vocal for “Love Should Have Brought You Home,” featured on the 1992 film soundtrack Boomerang. And a star was born: Braxton's sexy, smoky vocals on “Another Sad Love Song,” “Seven Whole Days” and “Breathe Again” propelled the quintuple-platinum success of her 1993 eponymous debut album while inspiring a million pixie cuts. Braxton's 1996 follow-up Secrets proved even more popular (8x platinum), owing to songs such as “You're Makin' Me High” (her first double No. 1 on the Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs) and the international pop hit “Un-Break My Heart.” The seven-time Grammy winner has also appeared on Broadway, TV and in films. — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “Breathe Again”


	Take only the songs he's written and produced for other artists – timeless classics by Boyz II Men, Toni Braxton, Tevin Campbell, Whitney Houston, TLC, SZA and even non-genre performers like Madonna and Fall Out Boy – and Babyface would still be virtually impossible to keep off an R&B list like this. But the man born Kenneth Edmonds could just as easily mount a claim based on his decades of hitmaking as a performer, first alongside fellow industry legend L.A. Reid as part of The Deele (“Two Occasions”), then as the solo hitmaker behind “Whip Appeal,” “Soon As I Get Home,” “When Can I See You” and “There She Goes,” a decades-spanning run that proved his gentle falsetto is just as nuanced and irresistible as his truly peerless pen. — A.U.


Must-Listen Song: “Soon as I Get Home”


	Breaking through by imitating an orgasm on 1975's 17-minute “Love to Love You Baby,” Donna Summer actually got her start singing in church before landing a role in a German production of the hit musical Hair in 1968. Throughout her reign as the Queen of Disco in the latter half of the ‘70s, Summer drew on both backgrounds to deliver some of the most vocally impressive dance-oriented R&B of her era. She brought the resonant tones of gospel to Giorgio Moroder's runaway synths (“Sunset People,” “I Feel Love”) and an unforced theatrical flair to everything from a duet showdown with vocal ace Barbra Streisand (“No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)”) to her 1979 magnum opus Bad Girls, which along with Off the Wall, ushered in a new era of R&B-indebted pop. Though her voice was drenched in sensuality, there was an ache inside her tone, too. Summer made music for those who hit the dancefloor to fill a void and, more often than not, her music did just that. — JOE LYNCH


Must-Listen Song: “On the Radio”


	A piano-playing savant, Alicia Keys brought a classicism to R&B in the 2000s with a soulful coo that took her from Hell's Kitchen to the top of the Billboard charts at just 20 years old. Hits like “No One,” “Fallin'” and Usher's “My Boo” have become ingrained in and part of the DNA of 21st century R&B. Keys joined fellow New York dignitary Jay-Z to craft the unofficial Big Apple anthem: “Empire State of Mind” in 2009, which topped the Hot 100 and has since been certified diamond by the RIAA. A 17-time Grammy Award winner, Keys is the living embodiment of reaching the highest commercial heights of R&B while never sacrificing an ounce of creative integrity in her vision. — M.S.


Must-Listen Song: “If I Ain't Got You”


	Vocalist, songwriter, producer, TV personality. Lionel Richie remains a force after nearly six decades. His mastery of booty-shaking funk (“Brick House”) and aching ballads (“Easy,” “Sail On”) for the Commodores — showcasing his engaging country-tinged rasp and crooner vocals — led to creating hits for Kenny Rogers (“Lady”) and his Diana Ross collab (“Endless Love”). Launching his solo career with a self-titled album in 1982, Richie followed its success through “You Are” and “Truly” with 1983's Can't Slow Down. The sophomore set spun off two of Richie's most popular songs in his estimable catalog: “All Night Long” and “Hello.” Richie also co-wrote (with Michael Jackson) the historic all-star charity single “We Are the World.” With an Oscar, four Grammys, the Gershwin Prize and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022, Richie is one of the most honored artists in history. — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “Three Times a Lady”


	Whether Beyoncé is covering her songs or Kendrick Lamar is name-checking her in his album intros, Anita Baker always finds a way to remind the world that she's one of the queens of Quiet Storm. Hailing from Detroit, Mich. by way of Toledo, Ohio, the eight-time Grammy winner has earned five Adult R&B Airplay toppers – including 1994's “I Apologize” and 2004's “You're My Everything” — thanks to her rich, expansive contralto. Her 1986 Rapture LP ranks among the best and most impactful R&B albums of its time, even penetrating top 40 with the now-signature hits “Sweet Love,” “Caught Up in the Rapture” and her cover of “You Bring Me Joy.” Still a consistent touring act in the 2020s, Baker also emerged victorious in her fight for ownership of her masters, underscoring her impact outside of the studio. — K.D.


Must-Listen Song: “Been So Long”


	Glorious Gladys Knight delivered soulful immediacy to early hits with the Pips: “Every Beat of My Heart,” “I Heard It Through the Grapevine,” “Midnight Train to Georgia,” “Neither One of Us” and “Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me.” After connecting with producer Curtis Mayfield for the 1974 Claudine soundtrack (“On and On”), the group disbanded in 1988 with Knight continuing as a solo artist. She joined the star-studded cast of the Grammy-winning song “That's What Friends Are For,” which also featured Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, and Elton John. With one Bond theme (1989's “Licence To Kill”), seven Grammys (four as a soloist), induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with the Pips and a seven-decade career — recently teaming with Chaka Khan, Patti LaBelle and Stephanie Mills for The Queens tour — the “Empress of Soul” remains an American treasure. — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “That's What Friends Are For”


	As the leader of the Supremes, Diana Ross led the girl group juggernaut to a staggering 12 Hot 100 No. 1s between 1964-69. Her Motown material was effervescent pop buoyed by Ross' gossamer tones. So when she set out to establish herself as a proper R&B vocalist in the ‘70s, there were skeptics – and she spent the next decade-plus (and six solo No. 1s) proving them wrong. From soul with gospel in its bones (“Ain't No Mountain High Enough,” “Touch Me in the Morning”) to dancefloor-ready funk (“Upside Down,” “I'm Coming Out”) to jazz (her portrayal of Billie Holiday in Lady Sings the Blues earned an Oscar nom) to immaculate R&B balladry (“Endless Love” with Lionel Richie, one of the biggest hits of all time) to lush, manic disco (“Love Hangover”) to down-home R&B (“Ease on Down the Road” in The Wiz), Ross demonstrated a vocal versatility her Supremes' material only hinted at. But one thing didn't change throughout her career: The class and elegance she exuded, a quality that everyone from Beyoncé to Taylor Swift has emulated. — J.L.


Must-Listen Song: “Love Hangover” (album version)


	As one of neo soul's pioneers, Erykah Badu emerged in 1997 as a rebellious and uncontainable force. Seamlessly intertwining R&B with African rhythms, jazz and hip-hop, Badu's groundbreaking debut album Baduizm — featuring “On & On,” “Otherside of the Game” and “Next Lifetime” — redefined what was possible in soul music. Her reflective themes about relationships, social justice and self-empowerment made her as lyrically profound as the most impactful rappers. After the Grammy-winning Baduizm, Badu and her elastic, emotive vocals further cemented her icon status thanks to insightful albums and cultural touchstones such as “Tyrone,” “Bag Lady” and “Back in the Day.” Aside from Badu's musical artistry, her mesmerizing live performances, cutting-edge fashion sense and savvy business acumen are just a few more reasons why she's one of the most important singers in R&B history. — M.C.G.


Must-Listen Song: “Didn't Cha Know”


	With bared midriff, a crown of natural hair and powerhouse vocals, Chicago-born Chaka Khan launched '70s band Rufus into the stratosphere. Khan's powerhouse vocals on “Once You Get Started,” “Sweet Thing,” and “Tell Me Something Good” sounded like no one else. During and after her Rufus tenure (formally exiting the group in 1982), Khan extended her run of hits with popular solo turns like “Ain't Nobody,” the sizzling Prince cover “I Feel for You” and her signature “I'm Every Woman” — while solidifying her star status. Through the ‘80s, “This Is My Night,” “You Can Make the Story Right” and crossover ballad “Through the Fire” exposed her to wider audiences. Khan, who has recorded rock, pop, soul and jazz projects, is also a 10-time Grammy winner. — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “I Feel for You”


	A teenage Chris Brown exploded onto the R&B scene in the mid-2000s with an undeniable charm that sparked major heart-fluttering across the globe. Breezy's engaging four-octave range and smooth dance moves drew comparisons to Michael Jackson as he's since evolved into one of music's premier all-around entertainers. The Virginia native also continues to churn out hits with ease: 17 Hot 100 top 10s to be exact, not to mention 118 total entries and counting on the chart. That impressive tally includes breakthrough single “Run It!,” “She Ain't You,” “No Guidance,” “Under the Influence” and “Residuals.” Now celebrating his 20th anniversary in music with the global stadium tour Breezy Bowl XX, Brown has developed a diehard fan base that's stuck with him through thick and thin. A 25-time Grammy nominee, Brown won his second gramophone in February for best R&B album with 11:11 (Deluxe). — M.S.


Must-Listen Song: “Forever”


	Patti LaBelle is one of the most beloved songstresses in R&B. She launched her five-decade career in the 1960s as the frontwoman of The Blue Belles, a group that eventually rechristened itself as Labelle and released the Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart-topper “Lady Marmalade” in 1974 before disbanding a couple years later. From the late ‘70s onward, the prolific Labelle earned the nickname “The Godmother of Soul” owing to more than a dozen solo albums and the crafting of classic slow jams like “If Only You Knew” and “Love, Need and Want You,” her emotion-wringing “On My Own” duet with Michael McDonald and her energetic vocal flexing on “New Attitude” and “Stir It Up” from 1985's Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack. — W.K.


Must-Listen Song: “Love, Need and Want You”




	Arriving on the scene at the relatively late age of 33, Bill Withers didn't waste any time playing catch up. The former commercial aircraft worker made a lasting impression in 1971 with debut single “Ain't No Sunshine” (Withers reels off the phrase “I know” in the song 26 times). Helping to set the firestorm created by that career jumpstart: his bluesy/folksy guitar playing and easygoing, southern-flavored vocals by way of his West Virginia upbringing. More hits ensued with themes involving love won/lost, family and social activism. Those classics range from the friendship anthem “Lean on Me,” “Use Me” and “The Same Love that Made Me Laugh” to “Grandma's Hands,” “Lovely Day” and the wartime ode “I Can't Write Left-Handed.” Though the self-described “left-field singer” opted not to sign with another label after 1985, Withers' short career still stands the test of time: The three-time Grammy winner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. — G.M.


Must-Listen Song: “Use Me”


	The band wasn't named after him, but there was no question who the star was: Philly's Teddy Pendergrass had the Force 10 gale of a voice and the cool to match, powering Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes slow-burners like “I Miss You” and disco barnstormers like “The Love I Lost” to near-double-digit-minute lengths and still leaving audiences begging for more. And when he went solo in the mid-‘70s, Pendergrass quickly became the baddest dude in R&B, scoring hits with lushly produced loverman classics like “Close the Door” and “Love TKO” and inspiring a live audience fervor that would make Tom Jones blush – even playing women-only concerts in the late ‘70s. A 1982 car crash left him paralyzed from the chest down, but the soul ran too strong in Pendergrass for that to stop him, as he still delivered an iconic performance at 1985's Live Aid benefit and scored a late-‘80s R&B Songs chart-topper with the ecstatic “Joy.”


Must-Listen Song: “The Love I Lost”


	Luther Vandross will always be on a first-name basis with R&B lovers. A gifted singer, producer and songwriter, Vandross initially established himself as a backup vocalist for icons such as Stevie Wonder, Roberta Flack and David Bowie before starting his solo reign in the 1980s-'90s as one of R&B's most dominant forces. Beyond a long list of Vandross-stamped songs such as “Never Too Much,” “Any Love” and “Dance With My Father,” there are the dulcet-toned duets with Mariah Carey, Beyoncé and Janet Jackson, plus his unique reinterpretations of songs like Dionne Warwick's “A House Is Not a Home.” Years after his passing in 2005, the “Velvet Voice” was introduced to a whole new generation when Kendrick Lamar sampled Vandross and Cheryl Lynn's 1982 take on Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell's “If This World Were Mine” for their own chart-topping duet “Luther,” further underscoring Vandross' lasting legacy. — W.K.


Must-Listen Song: “Never Too Much”


	Through such gems as “The Ghetto-Part 1,” “Someday We'll All Be Free” and the holiday perennial “This Christmas,” Hathaway became an enduring R&B influence, with his mellifluous vocals, gospel keyboards and sensitive songwriting. His 1972 album Live remains one of the best-selling live albums of all time. Pairing with Howard University colleague Roberta Flack for the romantic duets “Where Is the Love,” “The Closer I Get to You,” and the Grammy-winning “Back Together Again” gained Hathaway even more popularity, and added another chapter to his influential legacy. His untimely death in 1979 at the age of 33 cut short his brilliant career. Hathaway — the father of Grammy winner Lalah Hathaway — received a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018. — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “Little Ghetto Boy”


	Otis Redding's death at the age of 26 in a 1967 plane crash is one of the greatest losses in music. Over the course of his brief but incalculably influential career, Redding reinvigorated R&B as rock music threatened to eclipse it in the mid ‘60s, inspiring everyone from Aretha Franklin (whose signature song “Respect” was written by him) to the Rolling Stones. Redding could slide from lost and lovelorn to fervent and furious almost imperceptibly over the course of a two-minute single. As remarkable as his rough, raspy tone was, his pen was just as mighty, with Redding writing everything from the playful “Mr. Pitiful” and “Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)” to the bluesy, begging “Ole Man Trouble” to all-timers like the posthumously released “(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay” and the aforementioned “Respect.” But to get a full picture of the breadth of his talent and the immensity of his loss, go no further than the explosive, runaway train version of “Try a Little Tenderness” that he brought to the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967; more than half a century later, it's still drenched in sweat. — J.L.


Must-Listen Song: “Try a Little Tenderness”


	As the debonair falsetto lead of the Miracles, William “Smokey” Robinson was Motown's ambassador of cool sophistication and style. Penning ‘60s hits like “Tears of a Clown,” “Tracks of My Tears” and the Temptations' “The Way You Do the Things You Do” and “My Girl,” Robinson married clever Tin Pan Alley lyrics to a soul sound that also clicked with middle America. After leaving the Miracles in 1972, Robinson released Quiet Storm, his debut solo set of midnight moods (featuring the No. 1 R&B hit “Baby That's Backatcha”) and, in the process, also launched an entire radio format. He went on to notch more R&B/pop crossover hits with “Cruisin',” “Being With You,” “Just to See Her” and a 1983 duet with Rick James, “Ebony Eyes.” More than six decades into his career, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Robinson continues to perform and record, guesting on Anderson .Paak's 2019 Hot R&B Songs hit “Make It Better.” — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “Ooo Baby Baby”


	Al Green – who still holds church in Memphis as the Rev. Al Green on Sundays – wasn't the first artist to seesaw between crooning about God and sex, but he just might be the best. His unmistakable vocal tone is soaked in that push-pull tension: sweet yet lascivious, secular yet spiritual, gritty yet tender. Backed by come-hither horns and a metronome-tight rhythm section, Green set the standard for soul music sensuality in the ‘70s with his nimble falsetto and aching moans, trotting out an effortlessly sexy, smooth run of LPs on Hi Records. While other R&B singers begged or peacocked around their partners, Green played it cool, stating his case on low-key but irresistible soft sells such as “Let's Stay Together” and “Call Me (Come Back Home).” And when he stretched his Memphis funk muscles on classics like “Take Me to the River” and “Love and Happiness,” Green proved that gospel was part and parcel of his palette well before he officially pivoted to religious music in the ‘80s. — J.L.


Must-Listen Song: “Tired of Being Alone”


	As the ninth child of America's musical version of the Kennedys, Janet Jackson could have easily lingered behind her brothers' shadows. But Jackson didn't just forge her own success, she ruled the charts for 15 years as a sonic chameleon, pushing her sound to match a changing culture. Trace the journey from Jackson's early, industrial-grind hits such as “Nasty,” and “Miss You Much” to the carnal, lush odes of an “Any Time, Any Place” or “I Get Lonely” and the jubilation of turn-of-the-century tracks in “Doesn't Really Matter” and “All for You.” It's hard to believe they're all from the same catalog. But Jackson's range illuminates the five-time Grammy honoree's unique spot in the R&B canon. Should someone ask what a typical Janet Jackson song sounds like, good luck narrowing it down. — T.A.


Must-Listen Song: “I Get Lonely”


	Mary J. Blige turned her pain into gold and platinum plaques as she rose to prominence in the early ‘90s, singing about love and empowerment, which resonated with millions looking inward as Blige's brutally honest vocals pierced their souls. The Yonkers native, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year, redefined R&B at a time when New York hip-hop was entering its golden age. Rappers from 50 Cent to Jay-Z and Ludacris turned to the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul to further elevate their tracks with a fierce vulnerability they couldn't get anywhere else. Blige's triumphant anthems invoking joy and sadness — among them “Love No Limit,” “I'm Going Down,” “Not Gon' Cry” and the Dr. Dre-produced party jam “Family Affair” — have become as symbolic as the nine-time Grammy winner's signature thigh-high boots. — M.S.


Must-Listen Song: “Real Love”


	Paving his way as a session musician, in-house songwriter and producer at pioneering soul label Stax Records (credits include Sam & Dave's “Soul Man”), Isaac Hayes pushed beyond R&B's then-traditional boundaries with the release of sophomore album Hot Buttered Soul in 1969. The four-song project included a 12-minute rendition of Dionne Warwick's pop classic “Walk on By,” which became a Hot 100 top 40 hit in its own right. Hayes then hit a career jackpot with the Shaft movie soundtrack in 1971. He not only scored his sole Hot 100 No. 1 with “Theme From Shaft”; he also won the Academy Award for best original song. Over the years, Hayes' influence has stretched to hip-hop as his spoken-word lyrical style was a precursor to the way verses have been laid down in contemporary rap. In fact, the late pioneer's seminal work on Black Moses has been sampled countless times by hip-hop producers. — A.D.


Must-Listen Song: “(They Long to Be) Close to You”


	With his funky falsetto, Chicago-born Mayfield first showecased his brilliance as songwriter and performer with 1960s Impressions hits “People Get Ready,” “I'm So Proud of You” and “Keep on Pushing.” A knack for civil rights anthems, impeccable storytelling, and grooves like “Freddy's Dead,” “Pusherman” and the title track made 1972's Superfly soundtrack into searing social commentary. The landmark album — only Mayfield's third as a solo artist — is preserved by the Library of Congress National Recording Registry. His 1974 Claudine was a tour-de-force of first-person character development while 1976's Sparkle gave us the Aretha Franklin hits “Jump” and “Giving Him Something He Can Feel.” — J.C.


Must-Listen Song: “Superfly”


	Even though Sam Cooke was only on this earth for 33 years, he was still able to change the game during that short time. Born in Mississippi and raised in Chicago, Cooke is often credited with being the King of Soul, a nickname he was given after leaving gospel group The Soul Stirrers to venture out on his own. With his honeyed, versatile tenor, Cooke clocked nearly 30 top 40 hits on the Hot 100. That run, which influenced pop music as we know it today, began in the late ‘50s with his barrier-breaking No. 1 R&B and Hot 100 single “You Send Me.” He reached his stride in the ‘60s with classics such as “Wonderful World,” “Chain Gang,” “Twistin' the Night Away” and “Another Saturday Night.” After his untimely death in 1964, “A Change Is Gonna Come” was released as the B-side to his top 10 hit “Shake,” and became one of the civil rights movement's empowering anthems. — A.D.


Must-Listen Song: “A Change Is Gonna Come”


	The ultimate triple-threat entertainer, Usher personified the gold standard of R&B hitmaking in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, with songs like “You Make Me Wanna,” “U Remind Me” and ‘U Got It Bad.” Then his magnum opus arrived in 2004 with the diamond-certified Confessions album. The Grammy-winning, 14 times platinum project debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and produced four No. 1 singles (“Yeah!,” “Burn”, “Confessions Part II” and “My Boo”) for as dominant a commercial run as the genre has ever seen. Two decades later, Usher embarked on a well-deserved victory lap while headlining the Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show and showcasing his live performance mastery. Usher has proven to be the blueprint for achieving a sustainable, successful career, rising from childhood star to R&B deity — while his baby face hasn't aged a day in the process. — M.S.


Must-Listen Song: “Confessions Part II”


	Ray Charles, a.k.a. “The Genius,” first struck a powerful chord with music fans in 1955 when the singer-songwriter landed his first No. 1 on the R&B charts with “I Got a Woman.” From there, he lobbed a steady trajectory of hits across the net, featuring innovative genre fusions that stemmed from his no-holds-barred forays into blues, jazz, gospel, rock ‘n' roll and country. But first came Charles' soul juggernaut, melding blues, gospel and R&B and fueling an estimable tally of additional hits through the rest of the ‘50s and on through the ‘60s — like “A Fool for You,” “Drown in My Own Tears” and “Hallelujah I Love Her So” — before also crossing over into the pop arena with “What'd I Say (Part I),” “Georgia on My Mind,” “Hit the Road Jack” and “I Can't Stop Loving You.” Also known as “Brother Ray,” Charles' warm, gritty vocals and animated piano playing were also instrumental in molding his still influential, multi-genre legacy. — A.D.

The MC appeared at Westminster's Magistrates Court in London in relation to the charge 


													By
												

	Thomas Smith



Kneecap's Mo Chara appeared at Westminster's Magistrates Court on Wednesday (June 18) in relation to an alleged terror offense.


	In May, the MC (born Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh) was charged for allegedly showing support for militant organizations Hamas and Hezbollah – both of which are defined as terror groups by U.K. law – in newly surfaced videos from a past concert. The video appeared to show Chara shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” and displaying a Hezbollah flag at a show in London in November 2024.


	During the hearing, Mo Chara spoke only to confirm his name. The Press Association reports that Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring, presiding over the case, released him on unconditional bail and set a hearing date of Aug. 20. Mr Goldspring said that the 27-year-old must attend court on that day. Prosecutor Michael Bisgrove told the court: “This case is not about Mr hAnnaidh's support for the people of Palestine or his criticism of Israel.” (via The Irish News)

	Campaigners supporting the group were present at the court's entrance, with the band and its label Heavenly encouraging fans to attend.

	The Belfast trio, made up of Mo Chara, Móglaí Bap and DJ Próvaí arrived to court wearing “Free Mo Chara” t-shirts. In the build-up to the court case, Kneecap had “plastered” London with billboards with the message ‘More Blacks, More Dogs, More Irish, Mo Chara,' in reference to the discriminatory slogan that was present at some London pubs in the 1950s and '60s.


	Speaking on their social platforms, the group called the charge “a carnival of distraction” from what they see as the real issue at hand: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes.”

	











	The group say that their pro-Palestine views have been weaponised against them and claimed that their artistic free speech has been infringed. A number of artists including Massive Attack, Fontaines D.C., Paul Weller and IDLES signed an open letter backing the trio. On Monday, The Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr shared a statement showing support for Kneecap, and called for them to remain on the bill at Glastonbury Festival next week (June 27-29) despite calls for a boycott.


	The Northern Irish hip-hop trio released their breakthrough album Fine Art in 2024 alongside a self-titled biopic which saw critical acclaim, and was nominated for an Academy Award as well as winning a BAFTA prize.


	In April 2025, the group ended their Coachella sets with a message that stated: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes. F–k Israel; free Palestine.” A number of industry names including Sharon Osbourne called for them to be removed from the bill and their work visas to be revoked.


	Past videos of the band soon began to surface, including one from November 2023 with the group allegedly saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” Kneecap issued a statement on the remarks, offering an apology to the families of Sir David Amess and Jo Cox; both were killed while standing as MPs in separate incidents in 2021 and 2016, respectively. 


	“Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah. We condemn all attacks on civilians, always. It is never okay,” the group said. “We know this more than anyone, given our nation's history. We also reject any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever. An extract of footage, deliberately taken out of all context, is now being exploited and weaponised, as if it were a call to action.” The group were not charged in connection with this incident.

	











	During the fallout, a number of the band's shows were cancelled by organisers, including TRNSMT in Glasgow, Scotland and the Eden Sessions in Cornwall. Kneecap announced – and promptly sold out – make-up shows for fans in those cities.

The all-star July 5 gig in Birmingham will feature the rock icon's first full performance since 2018.

	Gil Kaufman



	If you can't make it to Birmingham, England on July 5 for what is being billed as the final-ever show by Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath don't sweat it, the Prince of Darkness has you covered. A video posted on Osbourne's socials on Wednesday morning (June 18) shows a massive crowd joining the metal icon in an “ay-ay-ay” shout as the screen fills with comments from fans asking (and begging) for the Back to the Beginning show to be livestreamed.


	“Your prayers answered!” reads a bold font message, followed by vintage footage of Ozzy saying “it's time to go back to the beginning.”  

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Ozzy, 76, recently said he will make it to the final show by Sabbath — with original bandmates guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Bulter and drummer Bill Ward — in their hometown of Birmingham no matter what it takes. As he trains for his first full concert since 2018 following a series of surgeries and health setbacks, Ozzy recently said on his “Ozzy Speaks” SiriusXM show that he will make it to the stage in Villa Park “by hook or by crook.” 

	











	Sabbath's final show will feature them joined by Metallica, Mastodon, Anthrax, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Gojira, Slayer and a supergroup featuring members of Guns N' Roses, the Smashing Pumpkins, Limp Bizkit, Judas Priest, Rage Against the Machine among many others.


	The livestream ticket will cost $29.99 and include access to watch the entire show beginning at 10 a.m. ET on July 5, with VOD replay access to rewatch the whole event from July 5th shortly after the event's conclusion until 10 a.m. ET on July 7; click here for details on livestream tickets.


	Osbourne's wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, recently said she'd removed a band from the Back to the Beginning lineup after a dispute with the unnamed group's manager, which made her feel “the worst way I've felt in years… I had a huge, huge to-do with a manager over this celebration for Ozzy and Sabbath. And it was probably the worst way I've felt in years. And I don't care what this person says about me, thinks about it, because he doesn't know me. And he's now going around making up bulls— lies because I threw his band off the bill.” At press time it was unclear which band Osbourne was referring to.

EXCLUSIVE: Terrifier trio Cineverse, Bloody Disgusting and Iconic Events Releasing are reteaming on the domestic theatrical releases of horror reboots Silent Night, Deadly Night and Return to Silent Hill.Silent Night, Deadly Night character Billy Chapman will make his return to theaters on December 12.

Nelson (Wrong Turn) and stars Rohan Campbell as Billy and Ruby Modine as Pamela, along with Mark Acheson, David Lawrence Brown and David Tomlinson. Iconic Events says the movie will have an unrated wide release.

Return to Silent Hill is the third installment in the game-to-screen horror film franchise, marking its 20th year since the first film, Silent Hill, was released in theaters.

Return to Silent Hill hits theaters at the perfect time following the successful recent launch of the Silent Hill 2 game remake that the movie is based on, while also celebrating the 20th anniversary of the start of the horror film franchise.”

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


	Aaron Guzikowski (Raised by Wolves) has signed to write the screenplay for an adult-targeted animated feature inspired by Hideo Kojima's hit action-adventure video game Death Stranding.


	The signing was announced by Japanese games maestro Hideo Kojima's Tokyo and L.A.-based Kojima Productions and L.A.-based animation company Line Mileage.


	The partners say the movie, which is currently in development, will be in a similar vein to adult-targeted, animated genre films such as the recently announced John Wick animated prequel and sci-fi horror Predator: Killer of Killers, which released on this month on Hulu and Disney+.

	It will feature an original story unfolding in the universe of Death Stranding, set in the wake of a series of cataclysmic explosions around the world which result in the dead and living becoming connected.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Guzikowski has won praise for his emotionally charged storytelling, with credits including sci-fi show Raised by Wolves and 2013 abduction drama Prisoners directed by Denis Villeneuve. 


	“I love the world of Death Stranding, it's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honored that Hideo Kojima, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe,” said Guzikowski.


	“Drawing and animation have always been near and dear to my heart, so to finally get to play in this space is a dream come true.”

	











	Directed by Kojima and featuring performances by Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, Léa Seydoux, Guillermo del Toro, Death Stranding has been credited with redefining the dramatic potential of video games. A new version of the original game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach – adding Elle Fanning to the cast – is due out on June 26.


	The new animated feature project is separate from a previously announced live-action adaptation being developed by Kojima Production with A24.


	Line Mileage is the animation production company of partners Jacob Robinson (Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft), Daniel Dominguez (Seis Manos), and Brad Graeber (Castlevania).


	Specializing in adult genre storytelling across animation, the team brings deep experience in adapting IP across games, comics, and beyond.


	Line Mileage CCO Daniel Dominguez said the cinematic quality of Death Stranding meant the game lent itself well to an animated movie adaptation.


	“As an avid gamer I can say, unequivocally, Death Stranding is the most cinematic, thought-provoking video game I have ever played,” he said.


	“Playing it gave me the same emotional rush, visceral punch, and intellectual pleasure I had the first time I watched Blade Runner, or Ghost in the Shell. Adapting it into a form it so naturally evokes is an honor. And for Aaron Guzikowski to lend his talents, whose authorial mind and creative energy humble me… needless to say, this project is a dream come true.”


	 Guzikowski is represented by Verve, Lit Entertainment Group and attorney Jeff Frankel.

International TV Co-Editor


	The BBC has confirmed an all-star cast for its latest drama from Hugo Blick.


	Deadline brought you news that Bill Nighy was in talks for Clifftops back in February and the BBC has confirmed the show, now titled California Avenue, will star Nighy, Helena Bonham Carter, Tom Burke and Erin Doherty, the latter of whom is fresh off the back of the runaway success of Netflix's Adolescence.


California Avenue is set in a secluded canal-side caravan park deep in the luscious English countryside, where its peace is irrevocably disrupted by the arrival of Lela (Doherty) and her 11-year-old child, both on the run, looking for refuge in this hidden world. It is here that a fractured family will come together, ghosts and demons will firmly be put to rest and an unexpected love is forged. Nighy and Bonham Carter star as Jerry and Eddie, Lela's parents, while Burke is showman outcast, Cooper.

	French viewers will soon be able to watch TF1 on a new platform — Netflix.


	Billed by the U.S. streaming giant as a “new kind of partnership,” TF1's commercial stations and on-demand content will be available on Netflix from summer next year. Financial details were not disclosed.


	The seemingly landmark distribution agreement is the equivalent of NBC, or another major American commercial network, handing over its output to Netflix. 


	It is further evidence of Netflix's growing power over traditional TV networks, as well as a marker of the ambition it has for its ad business. If successful, it could prove to be a test case for similar deals as Netflix aims to cement its position as the world's TV channel.

	Netflix said French viewers will be able to watch TF1 shows like The Voice “without ever having to leave the service” — an unambiguous statement about its desire to keep members locked in.

	Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix, said: “This is a first-of-its-kind partnership that plays to our strengths of giving audiences the best entertainment alongside the best discovery experience.”


	Rodolphe Belmer, CEO of TF1 Group, added: “As viewing habits shift toward on-demand consumption and audience fragmentation increases, this unprecedented alliance will enable our premium content to reach unparalleled audiences and unlock new reach for advertisers.”


	Peters flew into France to attend Cannes Lions, the ad market festival where the deal was announced. It signals a deepening of ties between Netflix and TF1 after they partnered on co-productions like Les Combattantes and L'Agence.

	











Last November, Netflix, TF1, and Newen Studio collaborated on the streamer's first daily drama series in France. Tout Pour La Lumière will be available on Netflix five days before its free-to-air broadcast on TF1.

Celebrity chef Anne Burrell, known for her vibrant personality and signature spiky blonde hair, has died at age 55. The Food Network star passed away on June 17 at her home in Brooklyn, her family confirmed in a statement.

“Anne was a beloved wife, sister, daughter, stepmother, and friend—her smile lit up every room she entered,” her family shared with E! News. “Anne's light radiated far beyond those she knew, touching millions across the world. Though she is no longer with us, her warmth, spirit, and boundless love remain eternal.”

Her last television appearance was on an episode of Food Network's “House of Knives,” which premiered in March 2025.

A post shared by SCREEN THRILL| Movies & TV (@screenthrill)

Burrell was widely recognized as the host of popular Food Network series including “Worst Cooks in America” and “Secrets of a Restaurant Chef.” Her legacy in food television spans nearly two decades, starting in 2005 when she first appeared as a sous chef for Mark Ladner on “Iron Chef America.”

Beyond her television career, Burrell was classically trained at the Culinary Institute of America and studied abroad at the Italian Culinary Institute for Foreigners. She later served as a sous chef at Felidia in Manhattan and as head chef at Savoy in SoHo. Her talent and charisma earned her an Emmy nomination and two bestselling cookbooks.

Burrell often emphasized bringing joy into the kitchen. “I truly, in my heart, feel that your food knows how you're feeling when you cook it and it reacts accordingly,” she told Tasting Table in April. “I like to put happy and joy into my food, and it's not so serious… take the fear factor out of it and put the fun factor in.”

A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)

As reported by E News, Burrell had taken up improv comedy classes in New York City in the months leading up to her death. “I showed up on the first day and [was] by far and away the oldest person in my class and the only one without a theater degree,” she said. “You go for three hours a week and it's playing games… and it's so fun.”

She performed her final improv set on June 16—just one day before her death, per US Weekly. Her last Instagram post, shared days prior, featured a selfie with the Green Lady of Brooklyn. “I'm not going to lie—I have been keeping an eye out for her… She is just lovely!!!” Burrell captioned the photo.

A post shared by Food Network (@foodnetwork)

The Food Network posted a heartfelt tribute to their official Instagram page, writing, “We are deeply saddened to share the news that beloved chef, Anne Burrell, passed away this morning. Anne was a remarkable person and culinary talent – teaching, competing and always sharing the importance of food in her life and the joy that a delicious meal can bring. Our thoughts are with Anne's family, friends and fans during this time of tremendous loss.”

According to People, Burrell is survived by her husband Stuart Claxton, her stepson Javier, her mother Marlene, and her sister Jane. No cause of death has been disclosed.

Amy Jo Johnson is honoring the memory of her late “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” co-star Jason David Frank with a heartfelt tribute. The actress, best known for her role as Kimberly Hart, the original Pink Ranger, shared a rare photo of the duo in an Instagram post following her appearance at the Niagara Falls Comic Con earlier this month.

The 90's star captioned the post, “💕 thank you to whoever it was who gave me this photo at Niagara. 💕 miss this guy, as we all do. 🦋,” Johnson captioned the image, which shows her smiling beside Frank.

Frank, who portrayed Tommy Oliver on the beloved 1990s series, died by suicide in November 2022 at age 49, as reported by Deadline. The photo, which resurfaced during the fan convention, quickly sparked an emotional response from fans who fondly remember the chemistry between the two characters on screen.

A post shared by Tammie Frank (@tammie_frank)

Through tears, she said, “I just came on here because I was feeling really sad and really it's really hitting home today what had happened and that he's gone. I don't know. I just thought of all of you guys because I know how much you all meant to him and how much you guys are probably in the same amount of pain and so sad.”

She went on to describe Frank as “such a force and such a bright, bright, crazy, wild, funny light. I just can't even believe it. My head hurts so bad.”

Before ending the livestream with a song, Johnson delivered a powerful message to anyone struggling with their mental health. “Anybody who is out there who is feeling depressed and like there's no hope, just know that that's not the way and there is help and you do have a community here,” she said. “Just reach out. Reach out for help if you are feeling like that. F—. It f—— sucks. Sorry for the swearing, but it really f—— sucks. Sorry.”

At the end of her livestream, Johnson added, “I know how much you all meant to Jason, and it sucks. But we're all going to be okay.”

Jason David Frank was a mainstay in the “Power Rangers” franchise and a fan-favorite at conventions around the world. His legacy continues to resonate deeply with fans and co-stars alike.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Justin Bieber's WILD & Luxurious First Father's Day with Baby Jack Blues","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/justin-biebers-fathers-day-with-baby/","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 02:30:58 GMT","

Justin Bieber rang in his first Father's Day as a dad on Sunday, June 15, sharing glimpses of his celebration with wife Hailey and their 9-month-old son Jack Blues Bieber across social media. The 31-year-old singer documented the special day through Instagram posts that showcased everything from lavish presents to sweet family moments.

The “Baby” singer kicked off his Father's Day posts with his signature humor, sharing a selfie featuring a fake tiny hand giving the middle finger. “I'm a dad that's not to be [expletive] with,” Justin captioned the photo.

His celebration included an impressive haul of luxury gifts, including an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch valued at $38,000, two Prada backpacks, and a new Apple laptop. The singer playfully captioned his gift photo with “Happy daddy day to me u lil ho.” 

A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber)

Despite ongoing speculation about their relationship status, the Biebers spent the holiday together. Justin would document their romantic getaway on Instagram. “Made it home from a lil date night getaway 🛸,” he wrote alongside photos of Hailey walking into their home.

The couple's son, Jack Blues, joined the celebrations in an adorable way. Justin shared videos of the baby at the piano with his mom, Hailey. In one clip, the singer filmed from the ground as his wife and son enjoyed music time together. Little Jack even sported a gold bracelet featuring his initials “JBB,” adding a touch of baby bling to the festivities.

Some outlets claimed Hailey “snubbed” Justin by not posting on Instagram for Father's Day. However, the couple clearly celebrated together based on Justin's numerous posts showing their family time. Hailey's distinctive engagement ring was visible in the piano photos. She also shared one of the images on her own Instagram Story, further confirming their quality moments together.

A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber)

The couple welcomed Jack Blues in August 2024 after announcing their pregnancy in May of that year. A source close to the family told People shortly after the birth that Justin was already “great” at being a dad. They noted, “They're both overjoyed. The baby is such a miracle. He's adorable and doing well. The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for.”

Justin has already expressed enthusiasm about sharing his passions with his son. During a February 2025 charity hockey game, he told reporters he wanted to get Jack on the ice “as soon as possible,” joking, “It's never too early.” 

For her part, Hailey recently described motherhood as the “wildest, coolest thing I've ever done” in an Instagram post marking International Women's Day. The couple, who married in September 2018, continue to navigate parenthood together while sharing selective glimpses of their growing family with fans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hulk Hogan Debunks Rumors Amid Hospitalization","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/hulk-hogan-wwe-health-update-hospitalization/","Wed, 18 Jun 2025 16:23:39 GMT","

When it comes to the WWE, few names hold as much weight as the legend of Hulk Hogan. However, he has recently been at the center of some pretty severe rumors regarding his health, stating that he may be on his deathbed. Now, a rep for Hulk Hogan is denying the claims. 

Hulk Hogan's representative told TMZ that the rumors about his client were false. Instead, the person said that Hulk has simply been dealing with the same issues he's had for a while. Notably, the former WWE star underwent neck surgery in May, and the representative says he's moving around already. 

As everyone knows, Hulk Hogan, like many former WWE stars, has lasting injuries from what he went through in the ring. This is particularly the case when it comes to his neck and back. 

Hulk Hogan's days of being in the ring for WWE fights may be over, but he's still involved with the sport. First, he remains a brand ambassador for the organization. As a result, he frequently makes public appearances and has merchandise opportunities related to approving new items. Notably, he hosted WrestleMania 37 in 2021. 

Outside of the WWE, Hulk Hogan co-founded the Real American Freestyle League in 2025. The league will focus on unscripted events similar to Olympic-style wrestling. According to AP News, it will hold its inaugural event in Cleveland, Ohio, at the Wolstein Center on August 30th. 

Hulk Hogan said of the event, “Cleveland is an incredible city, and Real American Freestyle is channeling its rock and roll style into this first event.” The league has already signed some notable talent. This includes Olympic medalists and NCAA heavyweight champions. 

It has a roster of 40 athletes. Chad Bronstein and Israel Martinez are the other two founders. Left Lane Capital backs the league. 

Naturally, Hulk Hogan is famous for his time in the WWE. However, a part of his notoriety comes from the way he has evolved his look over the years. According to The Economic Times, Hulk recently appeared on television sporting a two-tone beard look. 

A post shared by OK! Magazine (@okmagazine)

During his appearance, Hulk Hogan had a combination of black and white facial hair. While some were shocked, long-time fans know he originally began using the look in 1996 when he joined the New World Order wrestling group. Still, this evolution, like his others, is one reason he's still one of the most talked-about WWE members.

The professional dance world is mourning the loss of a huge talent within the industry. David Lee Scott Jr., who worked as the choreographer in residence for “Dancing With the Stars” in season eight, has died at the age of 52. Scott was also a choreographer for “So You Think You Can Dance” from season three onwards.

Scott's family posted the news on his official Instagram, writing in a statement, “Today we have lost an icon, a legend, a father and a dear friend. The weight of this loss will send ripples through time. But his memory and legacy will continue to live on.”

The family's statement on Instagram continues, “We love you, Dave Scott, and everything you've accomplished, and the joy and comfort you've brought to people will never be forgotten. Everyone is invited to share this post and let it reach everyone around the world. Show your love and support for this amazing individual and share the footprint he has left on this earth.”

A post shared by Dave Scott (@theofficialdavescott)

Dave's family also asked for financial help for his memorial expenses, saying, “The link in the Bio is for donations to the family to help with memorial arrangements and to celebrate Dave Scott's life with a proper send-off in a celebration of life.”

Needless to say, once the news broke of Dave's passing, the tributes began rolling in.

The legendary Debbie Allen memorialized him on Instagram, saying, “Dave Scott, one of the most gifted and influential choreographers and creative directors in the Film, Television, and Hip Hop worlds, breathed his last 5 6 7 8 yesterday and joined God's crew. His light, laughter, and legacy will forever live in our hearts. We will always speak his name. Rest well, my dear friend.”

Scott's fellow “So You Think You Can Dance” choreographer Mia Michaels wrote, “My Dave. I love you forever. You will never be forgotten.”

Comfort Fedoke, a “SYTYCD” alum, also posted a tribute on her Instagram, writing, “My heart is heavy… really heavy… but I'm beyond blessed to have gotten to know the man who was one of the people that first inspired me to dance. His work moved me before I ever met him. @theofficialdavescott.”

She continues, “What makes this loss even more profound is that Dave was the one who created the routine ‘Forever' — a piece I danced with big bro Stephen (rest in power). That was my bridge to knowing Dave on a personal level & the beginning of a creative relationship I'll always cherish. And now… I find myself singing Forever again, but this time for you, Dave. Forever in my spirit. Forever thankful for your talent and our bond. Forever in our hearts.”

Scott also choreographed for the films “Stomp the Yard,” “Step Up 2: The Streets,” and “Step Up 3D.”

Kathryn Bigelow is bringing her acclaim to Netflix. The Academy Award-winning director makes her return to filmmaking with thriller “House of Dynamite” set at the White House after a missile is launched at the U.S. 

The project was announced in 2024 with a Puck report confirming that “Jackie” and “Zero Day” scribe Noah Oppenheim was writing the original script. The film will be set in real-time and share a sensibility with Bigelow's previous films “Zero Dark Thirty,” “Detroit,” and “The Hurt Locker.”

Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Jared Harris, Greta Lee, Gabriel Basso, Anthony Ramos, Tracy Letts, and Moses Ingram will star in “House of Dynamite,” along with Jonah Hauer-King, Jason Clarke, Kaitlyn Dever, Willa Fitzgerald, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Malachi Beasley, Kyle Allen, Francesca Carpanini, Brian Tee, Brittany O'Grady, Abubakr Ali, and recent IndieWire Honors winner Aminah Nieves of “1923” fame.

The logline reads: “When a single, unattributed missile is launched at the United States, a race begins to determine who is responsible and how to respond.” 

 










“House of Dynamite” will premiere in select theaters in October and on Netflix October 24. This is a milestone for both Bigelow and Netflix: Amid the push from filmmakers such as Rian Johnson and Greta Gerwig to have theatrical releases for features, Netflix is putting Bigelow's on the big screen. 

“House of Dynamite” is Bigelow's first film since 2017's “Detroit.” She was previously developing an adaptation of David Koepp's novel “Aurora” also for Netflix, but the film was scrapped in 2022.

Nieves told IndieWire that none of the cast of “House of Dynamite” even knew the title of the film while in production. “It's wild, because I don't even know the name of the movie, and I don't know when it's coming out,” Nieves said. “All I can say is that it is completely different than what you've ever seen me do — which is not a lot — but still completely different and it was a very challenging role in regards to the time I spent with it and what it asked out of all of us.”

Bigelow was the first woman to win an Oscar for Best Director in 2009 with “The Hurt Locker.” Bigelow told IndieWire in 2017 while promoting “Detroit” that all of her films have “meaningful messaging,” especially about the government. 

“At the end of the day, entertainment needs a shred of messaging to it. That's a real motivator,” she said. “The genre element is captivating and attractive, both as a viewer and a filmmaker, but using it as a vehicle to move a conversation forward or at least shine a light on a conversation is extremely exciting. [‘Detroit' was] challenging material, but so were ‘Zero Dark Thirty' and ‘Hurt Locker.' When you work in this space where entertainment alone is not enough, you're using it as a delivery method for meaningful messaging, so you're operating in a more journalistic mode. I think if it's a good story and there's significant personal commitment from the filmmaker, it will find a way to reach an audience.” 

 










The iconic “Point Break” director added, “I'm always encouraged by the commitment and dedication of a filmmaker who lives in their material. Usually, that belief translates to the screen and therefore the audience. That's what moves me — truth and integrity… there's an integrity with respect to the choice of material by the filmmaker and how he or she realizes the story.” 

“House of Dynamite” is produced by Bigelow, Oppenheim, and Greg Shapiro. Brian Bell and Sarah Bremner executive produce.

Jeremy Allen White is showing off his voice for his latest film, “Deliver Me from Nowhere.” The actor transforms into iconic rocker Bruce Springsteen for the biopic, which is set in the early '80s during the recordings of “Born in the USA” and “Nebraska.” 

Jeremy Strong portrays Springsteen's manager Jon Landau, with  “Adolescence” star Steven Graham as Springsteen's father.  Paul Walter Hauser, Marc Maron, Gaby Hoffmann, Odessa Young, and David Krumholtz co-star. “Deliver Us from Nowhere” was written and directed by Scott Cooper, who adapted the story from Warren Zanes' Springsteen biography. 

 










Springsteen said during Variety's Awards Circuit podcast that he was approached to partake in the film that only spans a sliver of his life and career. “They pitched the idea, and I said, ‘It sounds like fun,'” Springsteen said. “It's an interesting concept, because it's only a couple of years out of my life. It's '81, '82, and centered around the creation of that particular record while I was simultaneously recording ‘Born in the USA' and also going through some personal difficulties that I've been living with my whole life. But it's fantastic.”

He also told The Hollywood Reporter that he hopes the film is a “surprise” for fans. “I don't want to talk about it too much, except saying that Jeremy Allen White did a fantastic job,” Springsteen said. “As did Jeremy Strong, and there's a young woman, Odessa Young, in the picture, she's incredible also.”

“Deliver Me from Nowhere” is the latest musical biopic starring an in-demand rising actor: “A Complete Unknown” landed a slew of Academy noms, including a Best Actor nod for Timothée Chalamet as Bob Dylan. The four-part Beatles biopic is also in the works, with Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison, Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr, and Harris Dickinson as John Lennon.

In the meantime, “Deliver Me from Nowhere” star White could land his first Oscar nom for this feature. “The Bear” actor already has two Emmys under his belt. 

20th Century Studios will release “Deliver Me from Nowhere” in theaters on Friday, October 24. Check out the trailer below.

It isn't every day that individual artists and creators and mega-studio conglomerates are actually aligned in what they want, but that's just the sort of villain that artificial intelligence has become when it comes to the entertainment sphere.

Last week, both Disney and NBCUniversal sued AI company Midjourney in a case of copyright infringement. For several years, there have been countless lawsuits filed by individuals against companies such as Midjourney objecting to the use of copyrighted material in the training of AI models and in these models' outputs. But two major studios teaming up to sue one of the bigger AI image generation tools for the same reason is a big step.

 








Related Stories Gary Oldman Says He Was ‘Typecast' as a Bad Guy for Years: ‘We Need a Villain and We'll Get Gary' Everything Coming to Hulu and Disney+ in July 

Before we start holding up any studio as a defender of artists' rights, there's a very good chance that how this lawsuit ultimately plays out will inform Disney, NBCUni, and other studios' own playbooks in building their own AI models. For now, the Midjourney suit has the potential to set a precedent around artificial intelligence, how AI companies can operate or train their models, and have an impact on all creatives.

 










“It's going to be an important case that'll affect the rights held by almost all creatives, regardless of how large they are,” said Ray Seilie, a trial attorney with Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir. “It's a rare alliance in the legal industry, or the entertainment legal industry, where you see studios actually doing something that artists are 100 percent behind.”

The 143-page lawsuit against Midjourney filed last Wednesday is a simple copyright lawsuit, even if it comes at the intersection of AI and bigger legal debates about whether AI-generated material can be considered copyrightable. Disney and NBCUniversal allege that Midjourney is willfully infringing on their biggest characters and IP and making a profit from doing it. It claims that anyone with a subscription to use Midjourney's image generating tool — and soon its video generation tool — can prompt the AI model to create an image of Darth Vader or the Minions, and it will spit out an almost perfect copy.

The lawsuit includes some convincing side-by-sides of the real movie stills and the images Midjourney has created. It's not as if those examples are a close facsimile that can be mistaken for something else, they're not a parody, and they're not a transformed iteration of existing characters; it's just an AI-generated copy. That's going to be a problem when Midjourney — which has yet to file a response to the complaint — tries to say it's just fair use.

 










“Just candidly, I think it is hard to see how the courts will let Midjourney keep doing what it's doing without any kind of restriction,” Seilie said. “To me, I think the studios have a very strong case here.”

Seilie said Midjourney will likely try to say that it is just the middleman providing the tools, and it's the users creating the images who are violating the copyright and are breaking the terms of service. That is a stretch, since Midjourney profits off subscriptions and controls what its users can and can't do.

Case in point: the lawsuit says Disney and NBCUniversal tried to get Midjourney to restrict users from creating images of copyrighted material, but it has ignored those pleas. Midjourney already prevents users from generating images of a violent or sexual nature, so why can't they just flip another switch to keep people from generating Yoda?

“Legally speaking, it's clear that Midjourney is willfully infringing. They're intentionally infringing, and it sounds like they didn't take any steps to try to mitigate or limit what the users could do on their platform,” said entertainment attorney Dale Nelson, who works with Donaldson Callif Perez and is former in-house counsel for Warner Bros. “And willful infringement is far worse than infringement of the type where you have a good faith belief that what you were doing was okay. So the fact that they didn't respond to the studios' letters just doesn't look good for Midjourney.”

 










Nelson said Midjourney may also argue that any ruling against them could have unintended consequences on the whole industry and what AI models are able to do. But the studios' lawyers have thought of that too. 

“I think that they have made very specific factual allegations in their complaint, probably wisely so, that it's not a lawsuit just about all AI. This is a very specific use that they're complaining about,” Nelson said. 

All this matters to Disney and NBCUni because it represents lost revenue. If someone can just generate an image with AI of their favorite “Star Wars” character, why would they want to buy anything specific from Disney itself? It could also be damaging to Disney's brand if AI can easily generate images of Disney characters that are more adult in nature than they'd prefer and let the average user distribute that image widely on the web. 

Seilie said this could be a very narrow ruling, one that only impacts Midjourney and how it operates or needs to operate moving forward, but more likely, any ruling will cause other AI companies to be proactive and change what their models can do or how they're trained based on what the court decides. They don't want their own lawsuits if they can avoid them. It could also just be settled with Midjourney agreeing to pay Disney and NBCUniversal a licensing fee to keep creating copies of their IP. 

 










But Seilie expects this to go deeper and believes the studios will want a ruling of some kind — and will fight until they get one. Seilie believes Disney and NBCUniversal will want discovery with the ability to get a clear sense of exactly how Midjourney's models were trained and how they're used.

“The studios want the precedent here,” Seilie said. “They want a district court opinion that says that scraping data for a training engine or using copyrighted material in training data is a copyright violation. I think they're gonna want a ruling that says that, and it'll probably go through appeals.”

Precedent is the crux of the issue here, giving the studios clarity on exactly what can and can't be used in training AI models, whether it's licensing someone else's to make movies or training their own internally. Because the flip side, should the courts rule in favor of Midjourney, could be “earth shaking” for how the studios do business. 

“It would be a sea change in the way that copyrighted material works,” Seilie said. “We would see a lot of changes in how studios operate or how creatives, frankly, operate.”

The annual UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report is continuing to chart the spaces in which filmmaking remains unequal. The 2025 report, which examined the top 100 English-language film releases on major streaming platforms (Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Netflix, Paramount+, and Peacock) in 2024, found that, while films with more racially diverse casts performed better on streaming platforms, female filmmakers are still underrepresented when it comes to big budget features.

“We're glad to see gains for diversity with streaming films, but the gap between movie budgets for streaming and theatrical releases gets wider and wider,” Michael Tran, a sociologist and co-author of the report, said in an official statement. “It's especially troubling since only a select few, specifically men, are given the chance to dip into the upper echelons of financial backing.”

That gap had a staggering discrepancy: No woman or other-gender person, regardless of race or ethnicity, had the opportunity to direct a streaming film with a budget of $100 million or more in 2024. White women continue to be the most likely to direct films with the smallest budgets; all of their films had a budget less than $20 million, except for the animated “Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie.”

 










The UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report began separating streaming films from theatrical releases for analysis in 2023. At the time, white men still directed the “supermajority of big budget films,” with 56 percent of white women directors having budgets smaller than $20 million. 

Two years later, and the statistic is not much different. 

In total, 65.5 percent of the top streaming films had budgets less than $20 million, compared to 34.6 percent for theatrical films. On the other end, only 4.4 percent of streaming films had budgets of $100 million or more, which is almost 6 times less than the 26 percent share in top theatrical films. And male filmmakers were the “only directors with this level of resources,” as the study found. 

Yet streaming still remains more diverse than theatrical: Directors of color accounted for four out of 10 directors for streaming-released films, as opposed to only two out of ten for theatrical movies. “Hollywood loves formulas, but they need more elements that resonate with the audiences of today,” Ana-Christina Ramón, co-founder of the report and director of the Entertainment and Media Research Initiative at UCLA, said in a statement. “You can't expect an increasingly diverse population of avid movie viewers and ticket buyers to settle for a generic film with little to no diversity that may have been a hit over ten years ago. In order for Hollywood to survive financially and to remain relevant, it must invest in storytellers who bring diverse perspectives and new ideas to the table.”

 










Ramón added, “Streaming platforms are one of the few places where the stories and faces that reflect the people of this country can be found on and off screen.”

The Hollywood Diversity Report series is in its twelfth year. While there are still strides to be made for behind the camera gender equity, the study discovered a milestone for on-camera parity: In 2025, the report found that for the first time, 1 in 2 leads of streaming films were people of color, which is almost double the percentage for top theatrical films.

“Films should reflect the realities of this country in terms of representation,” Darnell Hunt, the executive vice chancellor and provost at UCLA, and co-founder of the report, said in a statement. “We're past the point where we can let the wholesale erasure of people's identities, perspectives and experiences slide. Having diverse stories pushes the boundaries of what we know and understand. Inclusive storytelling is needed now more than ever.”

The first trailer for the new Bruce Springsteen movie, Deliver Me From Nowhere, is here. The clip offers another glimpse of Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen, as he creates the 1982 classic Nebraska. The trailer also features Jeremy Strong as Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau; Marc Maron as producer Chuck Plotkin; Johnny Cannizzaro as Steven Van Zandt; and others. Watch the trailer below.

Deliver Me From Nowhere, a 20th Century Studios film, hits theaters on Friday, October 24, 2025. The movie's director, Scott Cooper, said in a press statement, “Making ‘Springsteen' was deeply moving as it allowed me to step inside the soul of an artist I've long admired—and to witness, up close, the vulnerability and strength behind his music. The experience felt like a journey through memory, myth, and truth. And more than anything, it was a privilege to translate that raw emotional honesty to the screen, and in doing so, it changed me. I cannot thank Bruce and Jon Landau enough for allowing me to tell their story.”

Along with the aforementioned cast members, Deliver Me From Nowhere stars Paul Walter Hauser as guitar tech Mike Batlan; Stephen Graham as Bruce Springsteen's father, Doug; Odessa Young as a love interest name Faye; Gaby Hoffman as Springsteen's mother, Adele; and David Krumholtz as Columbia Records executive Al Teller. The film's producers are Scott Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Eric Robinson, and Scott Stuber, and its executive producers are Tracey Landon, Jon Vein, and author Warren Zanes.

Kneecap's Mo Chara was today granted unconditional bail on a controversial terror charge linked to an alleged display of support for Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, BBC News reports. Hundreds of supporters cheered, chanted “Free Palestine,” and waved Irish and Palestinian flags outside Westminster Magistrates' Court, where a preliminary hearing took place before legal arguments commence on August 20. Wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, Mo Chara, whose real name is Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, spoke only to confirm his identity. If convicted, he faces up to six months in prison and a fine, according to The New York Times.

During the brief hearing, prosecutor Michael Bisgrove told the court that the case is not about the rapper's “support for the people of Palestine or his criticism of Israel,” adding, “He is well within his rights to voice his opinions and his solidarity.” Instead, Bisgrove said, the case rests on footage, from a London concert in November 2024, that appeared to show Mo Chara draped in the Hezbollah flag and shouting, “Up Hamas! Up Hezbollah!” Public support of Hamas or Hezbollah is banned in the United Kingdom under anti-terror laws.

The Belfast rap trio came under scrutiny from the Metropolitan Police after displaying pro-Palestine and anti-Israel messages at this year's Coachella, which led to the recirculation of that 2024 footage. Mo Chara's defense lawyer, Brenda Campbell, argues the charge falls outside a six-month limit, Reuters reports. “If we are right in relation to that, then this court has no jurisdiction and there ends the case,” Campbell told the court.

Since the charge was filed, Kneecap have released a statement saying, “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah. We condemn all attacks on civilians, always. It is never okay.” On social media, they called the charge “political policing” and “a carnival of distraction.” The group has long been vocal in its support of Palestine and the Palestinian people, and has redoubled that support in light of Israel's continued assault on Gaza and the West Bank.

Mo Chara was joined today by bandmates Naoise “Móglaí Bap” Ó Caireallain and JJ “DJ Próvaí” Ó Dochartaigh. Kneecap rose to the public eye last year, when they released the album Fine Art and the semi-autobiographical film Kneecap. Their stance on Palestine has led to calls for them to be pulled from festivals, as well as a groundswell of support from fans and fellow artists. Among them is Paul Weller, one of the many present outside the courtroom today.

Haim say I quit as in, I'm done caring. Here's an album based on all the oldest California-isms in the book: Seek and you will find. Live your truth. Let go of what does not serve you. Or, quoting Alana Haim in the press release, “Every single song has a theme of quitting something that isn't working for us anymore.” I quit also proudly advertises its credentials as American rock'n'roll, quoting Abraham Lincoln and Bruce Springsteen in opener “Gone,” exploring acoustic folk with fresh attention on soon-to-be-underappreciated hits like “Love You Right” and “Blood on the Street,” and inviting co-producer Rostam Batmanglij's love of vintage acoustic texture, breakbeats, and left-field sound design into a combination of influences that sometimes goes a little haywire.

That's right, it's those same girls who made Women in Music Pt. III: They sense your impulse to treat them like a grown-up Sweet Valley High triple threat doing a band because it really does make for great content—all that purposeful walking!—and they know it doesn't matter how many stone-cold classic rock references you make or how many surreally cool Paul Thomas Anderson projects you star in, some people are never going to treat you like the other guys. Not that there's anything wrong with making pop music! They are, in their own words, “becoming the band we've always wanted to be.”

Talk like this gives me a migraine, but as I understand it, I quit is announcing its intention to be as emotional, self-indulgent, conflicted, silly, stoned, and heartsick as any woman on Stevie Nicks' green Earth has a right to be. Like MUNA, Haim are chanting a hook about doing “what[ever] I want.” Like on Solar Power, they're interpolating one of George Michael's all-time biggest hits. (“HAIM dug deeper into the pop archives and sampled… ‘Freedom! '90,'” writes the author of this album's official bio, who's never been below sea level.) The sound is sturdy but a little more laid-back, even for this famously sun-dazed group. The problem is that I quit is uneven, even within songs: often equivocating instead of disarming, partially vested in several musical directions, sometimes landing a devastating blow, and sometimes vastly overshooting its lyrical ambitions.

Imagine going out with a bang: what you'd say, to whom. I quit starts so strong: “Can I have your attention please/For the last time before I leave?” Danielle Haim begins, and then, “On second thought I changed my mind.” As in real life, I quit's declarative force is shadowed by indecision and the accumulated weight of all one's previous choices. Or: “Wasting time driving through the Eastside/Doing my thing 'cause I can't decide if we're through,” as Haim put it to a dusty hopscotch beat on will-they-or-won't-they-break-up lead single “Relationships,” a pool-party jam with an appropriately tortured backstory that pays off for a reportedly challenging recording process that overlapped Danielle and longtime producer Ariel Rechtshaid's breakup.

The best songs on I quit zero in on the freedom of an overdue split, the mood of the much-memed Nicole Kidman paparazzi shot referenced in the “Relationships” single art. “I didn't think it could be so easy till I left it behind,” belts the narrator of “Down to Be Wrong,” sounding heroic, boarding a one-way flight with an apathetic adieu. That main emotional register—I quit as in, I'm done caring—is accompanied by another crucial emotional register: You stopped caring first. “I swear you wouldn't care/If I was covered in blood lying dead on the street,” goes “Blood on the Street,” a rustic, vivid, Cat Power-esque farewell to a hard-drinking ex that goes on to clarify, “It's not that I'm holding a grudge.” Because that would mean caring. “I can count on my one hand all the times that you really made me feel free… but my hand's stronger than how it was played,” Danielle sings. Devastating. Peace out.

What does I quit care about? It can't resist a calculated dose of nostalgia: “Take Me Back” hews to a list-of-stuff format, flashing by like pages of a stranger's yearbook while Rostam plays the glockenspiel, which sounds like 2008 indie rock. But the preeminent mood of rock nostalgia right now is shoegazing, and Haim deliever the fuzz-walled, MBV-tinted love song “Lucky Stars,” which hauls up the overburdened metaphor, “Trying to heal myself with all the/Roaring trains of change and doubt that/Pulled in the station.” Choo choo? It's around this point that the album glides into a new-wavey frictionlessness—call it the Zooropa zone—where it begins to feel like nothing ever really happens.

A brutally honest edit might have reconsidered the more stylistically anonymous or lyrically thin concepts. “Lucky Stars,” “Million Years” (“I'd stop every war/Even if it takes a million years”), “Spinning,” and the bad Coldplay song/good Kelly Clarkson song “Cry” are B-sides struggling to compete with more nuanced counterparts like “Relationships” and “The Farm,” a warm, slack, acoustic breakup ballad that's comfortable enough to get candid about just how tough it can be to walk away: “The distance keeps widening/Between what I let myself say/And what I feel.” The tender folksinging trio of “Love You Right” or the steady backing band supporting the jazz horns at the end of “Try to Feel My Pain” are the moments on I quit when Haim's music feels most like a communal experience and least like a placeless video clip narrated from the front seat of a car.

This brings us, with reservations, to the final track, “Now It's Time,” a bizarre combination of rigid boom-bap, swingless Madchester, a Rostam piano run, a Disney-worthy empowerment message (“The real barrier to break is the one I feel inside”), and as a kind of Hail Mary, an “In the Air Tonight”-style drum fill on the way to its own would-be “Freedom! '90” breakthrough moment. It is, in a word, exhausting. At the very end, kind of buried in the mix, one of the Haims says, “Am I reaching out to say/I never gave two fucks anyway?” A wise question, and one we should all ask ourselves more often, particularly before sending texts.

With “Now It's Time,” Haim appear to recognize the need for immediacy, for a way to recenter in the moment and prove Semisonic were right about new beginnings. But the real juice of life—and breakup songs—is in the tensions of caring and then not caring, of relationships that work and then don't. On I quit, much of this action seems distant, as if fading in the rearview. But I'm just living my truth.

DERBY's debut album Slugger presents an interesting paradox: How can an album this derivative also feel authentic, even original? Single “Gold” seems like a slick attempt to recreate Dijon's fast and free songwriting magic, his big-feeling bravado, his Americana-twanged R&B; “Jenny” draws clear inspiration from Alex G; his frequent use of pitch-shifted vocals and flanged guitars are siphoned from the Bible of Blonde. Yet DERBY—a Houston native who now lives in New York and whose real name is Craig Caldwell—has talent that continues to reveal itself even after you clock the comparisons and a perspective that cuts through the references. Slugger captures a world of quotidian intensity and rural nostalgia: shooting a deer through the eyes with a double-barrel shotgun, blasting the radio on a hundred-degree day, dancing in the kitchen with your sweetheart as rain pings the tin roof, watching TV together after an argument, wondering who'll apologize first. These scenes feel fresh within DERBY's off-kilter sonic palate, his quixotic romanticism shot through with a touch of dirty realism.

DERBY has been careful to keep his personal life, and image, out of the spotlight. The avatar for Slugger's art and promotional materials is a deer; the few photos of him online are taken at twilight, his eyes and face shadowed by a camo hat. His only other release, 2021's Hiraeth, has a few interesting moments but fails to produce a song worth listening to again. Although remaining mysterious has its advantages—most listeners will encounter DERBY with no context, expectation, or visual association—not establishing a unique persona may hinder an artist hoping to avoid the Dijon and Frank Ocean copycat tag. But in a hyper-commodified, identity-forward industry, it's admirable for DERBY to eschew an elaborate public presence, to stand behind his art and allow the music to communicate whatever it will.

And his music, fortunately, needs no out-of-frame persona to work its wonders. His plug-in-warped indie pop bears traces of folk and rap, emo and outlaw country, R&B and hyperpop. Slugger's songs are scaffolded by warbly guitars and dry drum kits, its melodies simple and arresting. DERBY's voice is almost always pitched up and routed through plate reverb, phaser, and Auto-Tune, a form of masking that makes it easier to be excessively vulnerable in his writing. Opener “Deer in the Belly of the Snake” roils with analog hiss and aggressive pitch correction, which serve as the perfect cloaks for DERBY to sad rap some of his most cutting lines: “Sucks, suck it up/Sucker punch to the teeth/Teach you how to speak in his name/Show you how to act in his presence/Lessons burned into your brain.” Elsewhere he's getting into fist fights and admitting he's a bastard, shivering violently while begging his baby to come home. These scenes don't come across as cloying or cheap in part because it's all so startlingly sincere. DERBY's searching far and wide for connection and forgiveness, hoping something somewhere can eradicate all that painful, inconsolable stuff inside him.

The best songs arrive as unique bursts of inspiration, limber expressions of DERBY's genre-agnostic sensibilities. “Glow” layers pedal steel with jersey club percussion, DERBY's sped-up singing floating over spacy guitar chords, while “Money Fight” feels plucked from a childhood memory, its emotional core urgent and disorienting, its climax building and sloping and stampeding toward irresolution. Slugger can lose its dream-like momentum when the ideas feel forced and over-considered, like on the Alex G-indebted “Jenny” or the sedated closer “Armored,” neither of which home in on their emotional potential. Still, Slugger  is one of the most surprising indie pop records of the year, an album that understands something sacred about art-making: If you lay yourself as bare as possible, something special is almost certain to emerge.

The first entries in Lucy Gooch's discography—a pair of five-track ambient pop EPs doused in reverb and multi-tracked glossolalia—suggested that the York, England musician was venturing deeper into the uncanny. Trading her Roland for a Prophet between the recording of 2020's Rushing and 2021's Rain's Break, Gooch began to decorate her brief, beatless songs with more ornate synthesizer arrangements. While the former used sustained, misty drones as blank canvases for her interweaving choral arrangements, the latter felt more like a more traditional synth record, dropping plucky bass pulses and squelching arps into the chordal abyss to observe their behavior. Her emphasis on operatic vocal toplines and expressive delivery over lyrical prose have drawn comparisons to 4AD's early catalog, particularly the entries by Cocteau Twins and This Mortal Coil, though her preference for unearthly, artificial textures was more aligned with Eno's Apollo than the Baroque tastes of Robin Guthrie and Ivo Watts-Russell.

Gooch's first full-length album, Desert Window, inverts her trajectory, weaving earthy, organic timbres into more ambitious compositions. Most songs stretch past five minutes as the record brings live string and brass arrangements along for a surprisingly dissonant ride, encasing straightforward moments of ethereal beauty between vast expanses of understated tension. In Cocteau Twins terms, it's The Moon and the Melodies meets Twinlights.

The record's two-part epic “Night Window” exemplifies her tendency to shift between these mystical and theatrical modes. In its first moments, insectoid synth drones swarm into the soundfield, melodies breaking from the cluster but never quite resolving. Gradually Gooch's vocals come into focus, outlining the shapes of words that barely register as language. Typically, voice acts as a catalyst for crescendo in this sort of new age-adjacent composition, soaring above the ambient backdrop. Here, it's intentionally submerged, tinting an already hazy composition. In the second half, more acoustic instrumentation enters the fray, with struck keys and brassy bleats teasing an emotional overflow. It's the moments leading up to catharsis, though, that Gooch is interested in highlighting: the full 10-minute suite keeps the listener at a knife's edge, holding out for the melodic phrase that makes sense of it all. Even waiting can be a thrill, when it's well-composed.

Opener “Like Clay” is the biggest departure from Gooch's earlier work, building from shimmery fingerpicked guitar into layer upon layer of interlocking takes, which loop and commune beneath a single, repeating couplet: “To wake up in morning, too long asleep/Like clay in the ground, exiled deep.” Though the words quite literally illustrate the record springing to life, they're more like a vehicle for improvisation and experimentation. Her delivery slightly morphs with each go-around, and the surrounding harmonic ecosystem follows suit, background chirps becoming yawps as she adds a slight lilt to the end of a line. The folk trappings and ASMR-inducing field recordings on “Jack Hare” make for another fresh approach, particularly the tasteful way they decorate the song's concluding burst of existential rumination, where Gooch mutters that “I am kiss, and I am croak, and I am wax,” and so on.

“Keep Pulling Me In,” Desert Window's longest track, is the only song that feels more meandering than meaningful. Though Gooch cleverly uses repetitious traits of reverb and delay to accentuate lyrics about a tumultuous relationship, her instrumental choices feel directionless. There are blissed-out stretches of glossy stillness, creeping vocal leads, and even a shuffling drumbeat that pops out of left field: The individual sections are pretty but too self-contained compared to the rest of the record's more fluid progression. It's a stagnant stretch on an otherwise thrilling album.

Where Rushing and Rain's Break worked in tight, polished pop increments, Desert Window privileges Gooch's more eccentric instincts, conscripting strings, brass, and charged pockets of silence along the way. The record's strongest moments originate in its audacity rather than precision: Desert Window opens up the ambient ideas she's perfected in the past into riskier, roomier territory.

							By 

	Alan Sepinwall



	When one starts watching Adult Swim's Common Side Effects, it's easy to feel confused about exactly what it is. Is it a comedy? A thriller? A drama? A sci-fi epic? A bizarre drug trip? 


	After a while, though, it becomes clear that the answer to all those questions is the same one. Just as it is for the question of whether this is one of the best new shows of the year: 


	Damn right it is.  


	The animated series, which debuted back in February, was created by Joseph Bennett and Steve Hely, and produced by King of the Hill co-creators Greg Daniels and Mike Judge, the latter of whom plays a few supporting characters. It tells the story of Marshall (Dave King), a fungus expert who discovers a rare mushroom that, when consumed, will cure any ailment, from dementia to seemingly mortal injuries. He unfortunately finds himself using it a lot for the latter purpose, since the pharmaceutical industry — and the many government agencies in bed with it — would very much prefer that the world not learn about a natural phenomenon that would put every drug company out of business. 

	











	Marshall reaches out to his high school lab partner/crush Frances (Emily Pendergast), not realizing that she's the executive assistant to Rick (Judge), the CEO of the drug company that seems to be endangering these miracle mushrooms. As various forces conspire for and against Marshall, we meet a pair of DEA agents, Copano (Joseph Lee Anderson) and Harrington (Martha Kelly), who are best friends with similarly quirky, low-key tastes; evil Swiss financier Jonas (Danny Huston), who will stop at nothing to eradicate the mushrooms; Hildy (Sue Rose), Marshall's mentor, whose goals for the mushroom are far less altruistic than his; Amelia (Shannon Woodward), a mycologist whom Harrington lists in her phone as “Amelia Mushrooms” after the DEA hires her to help with this case; Jimmer (Judge) and Rusty (Hely), a pair of backwoods North Carolinians who prove surprisingly helpful to Marshall; Marshall's half-brother Zane (Alan Resnick), who illegally imports exotic animals, and thus has access to material that can help Marshall.

	Zane is usually high on psychedelics whenever Marshall visits him, and Common Side Effects both looks and feels like something Zane might see only when he's tripping. The characters generally have stubby limbs, oversized heads, and eyes that are either very small or very large, but always with giant, solid black irises in the middle. It's the closest thing I've seen in a while to evoking the design aesthetic of legendary cartoonist Bill Plympton, though the way the animation moves is very different from his work. The aesthetic is simultaneously off-putting and endearing, as if this is obviously not what people should look like, but in a way that suggests how hard it is for them to navigate this strange and broken world in which we all find ourselves. The mushroom's healing properties also lead to hallucinations, often involving mysterious white imps, who should be adorable and instead come across as menacing little ghouls. 


	The humor's often dry, particularly in the hugely charming rapport between the DEA agents, but Bennett, Hely, and company are also smart about when and how much to deploy jokes. Rick is often presented as too insulated by his wealth and power to know how to do basic things, like getting the TV in his hotel room to stop showing the channel about the hotel. But he also seems to understand other people's basic emotional needs when they're shoved right in front of his face, and when Frances demonstrates what the mushroom is capable of, he seems genuinely excited by the possibility that it can help lots of people — even if he also thinks his company can patent it and make a fortune off of helping said people. It's a vicious satire of late-stage capitalism that, despite its medium, doesn't treat the most powerful members of that system — or even the weakest ones like Rusty — as total cartoons.

	The plot keeps escalating, in a way that occasionally raises questions about how Marshall keeps surviving all the forces arrayed against him, mushroom or no mushroom. Yet by the season finale all the sides of this mess converge in a way that feels satisfying and inevitable, based on all the wild things that have happened to this point. Adult Swim has already ordered another season, and I can't wait to see what comes next, no matter how much Common Side Effects may occasionally make me wonder if I took the wrong medicine right before watching. 


All 10 episodes of Common Side Effects are now streaming on Max.

	The New Avengers are coming home. Marvel‘s latest adventure, Thunderbolts*, will hit video on demand on July 1 on platforms including Prime Video, Apple TV, and Fandango at Home. The film will also get a 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD release on July 29, with preorders coming soon. 


Thunderbolts* stars Florence Pugh as Yelena, David Harbour as Red Gaurdian, Wyatt Russell as John Walker, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster and Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, a ragtag team of antiheroes who are pitted against each other by Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.


	While Thunderbolts underperformed at the box office, it was well-received by fans and critics, and seen as a return to form after Marvel's at-best uneven Phase Five. Or rather, as Rolling Stone critic David Fear put it, “Don't call it a return to form so much as a much-needed, extremely welcome return to a winning formula.”


	The July 1 streaming date means fans who missed it in theaters will be able to rent or buy it at home, although there's no word yet on a Disney+ release date. The 4K Ultra HD digital and physical release will feature Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, as well as bonus features like deleted scenes, a gag reel, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and commentary by director Jake Schreier. 




	Marvel is also releasing collectible versions of the Blu-ray, including a SteelBook version featuring custom artwork, plus a Walmart-exclusive Blu-ray featuring pop-up artwork.

	The Trump administration is once again targeting LGBTQ+ youth — this time by ending the contract between LGBTQ+ nonprofit group The Trevor Project and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.


	A suicide prevention nonprofit, the Trevor Project was founded in 1998 to address the high rate of mental health problems and suicidal ideation that LGBTQ+ youth face. According to 2024 data from the group, close to 39 percent of queer youth consider attempting suicide, a rate that is heavily impacted by anti-LBTQ+ policies and administrations. The nonprofit says it's helped more than 1.3 million LGBTQ+ youth since it was started.


	Trevor Project CEO Jaymes Black announced Wednesday that the group has been given a stop work notice ending its “Press 3” program with the federal government. Introduced in 2022, the “Press 3 option” allowed Suicide & Crisis Lifeline callers to be connected with a mental health counselor who specialized in LGBTQ+ issues and concerns. In a statement, SAMHSA called the shuttering of the “Press 3” program a move to “focus on serving all help seekers” through the suicide hotline. But the statement only mentioned the LGB+ community, omitting the markers for transgender and queer individuals, continuing the Trump administration's outsized targeting of the transgender community. 












	“Counselors who supported the press three option were trained specifically to support LGBTQ+ young people, because having someone who truly understands the unique needs and challenges of LGBTQ+ young people isn't just helpful. It can be the difference between saving a life or losing one,” Black said in a video statement. “When a questioning youth calls because they're terrified and they're alone, they need someone who can say, ‘You are not broken, you are loved exactly as you are.' When a transgender teenager calls because they're being bullied at school and contemplating suicide, they need someone who knows that their identity isn't a phase to be counseled away.”

	Representatives for the Trevor Project did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. According to Black's statement, the stop work order gives the Trevor Project 30 days before the LGBTQ+ option of the national suicide lifeline is shuttered. Young people who require help will still be able to contact The Trevor Project directly.

	“This is this is not about politics. This is about people. This is your neighbor's kid. This is your coworker's daughter who sees no tomorrow. This is someone's baby who just needs to know that they matter,” Black added. “Every LGBTQ+ youth, listen. Your life has meaning. You are our artist and athletes and dreamers and leaders, and you are perfect just the way you are. You are our future, and we will never stop fighting for you.”


If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.  Dial 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

	The “No Kings” protests were historic. Millions of American activists turned out to protest President Donald Trump's authoritarian impulses, on his birthday, Saturday, June 14, when the president threw himself a massively expensive, poorly attended military parade in Washington, D.C., replete with tanks and helicopters. (The parade was ostensibly also a celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Army.)


	With more than 2,000 protests from big cities to small towns, in red states and blue states, No Kings created one of the largest mass demonstrations in modern memory. Organizers peg the turnout at 5 million. Independent observers say it could have been as high as 7 million. It was in any case millions more than the number of people who showed up for Trump's sad, tin-pot spectacle.No Kings organizers held a call Monday night to celebrate the achievement, as well as to announce the next steps for building a popular pro-democracy movement, including mass protests, leadership trainings, and consumer boycotts.Those next steps include a new national protest, dubbed “Good Trouble Lives On.” That protest is scheduled for July 17, and honors one year since the passing of Civil Rights icon and Congressman John Lewis, who called on Americans fighting for justice to create “good trouble” in the name of redeeming the soul of America. The rallying cry for the march is “March in Peace. Act in Power.” The protest already has dozens of planned demonstrations. The other action announced on the call is called “1 Million Rising.” Organized by Indivisible, the progressive grassroots juggernaut, the initiative seeks to harness the energy of protesters to build long-term political power. One Million Rising describes itself as “a national effort to train one million people” to become pro-democracy movement leaders, with “the skills to lead others.” The initiative aims to “build people power that can't be ignored” and has as its mission statement: “1 Million Trained, Millions More Empowered.”


	The consumer boycotts against Elon Musk and Tesla are also snowballing. The call featured the announcement of a Musk Must Fall protest, organized by Tesla Takedown activists on June 28, in honor of the birthday of the billionaire “broligarch,” who has departed from his destructive stint in the White House and has since publicly feuded with Trump. These protesters are now also targeting Musk's business partners, including pressuring wireless giant T-Mobile to end its partnership with Musk's satellite company, Starlink.

	The Monday call was, by turns, jubilant and somber. The organizers celebrated the massive win of mobilizing millions to the streets. But they marked tragedies as well. These included the assassinations in Minnesota, which left the Democratic former state speaker and her husband dead. They also mourned gun violence at a No Kings protest in Utah, where a protester was shot and killed. (According to police and news reports, a 39-year-old fashion designer was killed by a stray bullet, fired by an armed protest security volunteer who was seeking to confront a man with an AR-15 assault rifle. That man has been charged with murder.)

	











	The central message, though, was one of uplift — and determination to build on the momentum of Saturday's happening to ensure that the energy of protest is channelled into movement-building. Ezra Levin, a cofounder of Indivisible said that millions of Americans needed to celebrate the achievement of turning out in defiance of Trump's “ridiculous, authoritarian, theatrical, shambolic event.” He insisted Trump's “authoritarian” parade “was worse than ridiculous. It was dangerous. This is the kind of thing you expect to see in North Korea and in China, not in the United States of America.” Levin said protesters had shown grace under pressure and trying circumstances adding: “I'm proud to be in this movement with y'all.”Later in the call, an Indivisible colleague previewed the “1 Million Rising” initiative, aimed at building “power that lasts.” The organizer made clear that the initiative is the work of a coalition ranging from the League of Conservation Voters to the American Civil Liberties Union to the upstart grassroots group 50501. The point is not to have scores and scores of activists reinventing the wheel, but to give folks an opportunity to learn leadership skills and then “plug in” to organizations dedicated to the issues they are most passionate about, ranging from immigration and racial justice, to climate change, to voting rights and democracy building.

	For the protest-minded, the next mass mobilization will channel the spirit of the late John Lewis, in a demonstration called Good Trouble Lives On. As previewed on the call by Barbara Arnwine of the Transformative Justice Coalition, organizers are launching a series of weekly “host trainings” (beginning tonight, June 18) for activist who want to plan demonstrations in their own city or town. Different from the April Hands Off and the June No Kings protests, this mobilization is explicitly about countering “attacks on our civil and human rights by the Trump administration.”The call also featured a training from Maria Stephan of the The Horizons Project, who spoke about the impact of consumer boycotts in eroding support for Trump's authoritarian project. Stephan highlighted the impact of protests against Elon Musk's flagship company, Tesla, which she called “one of the most powerful consumer boycotts in recent memory,” causing Tesla shareholder value to plummet. “The company has become toxic.” She also highlighted the impact of the Black-led consumer boycott of Target, which seeks to punish the company for its retreat from diversity initiatives. 


	Stephan painted consumer activism as a powerful complement to street protest. The point, she insisted, is to change the incentives for powerful corporations, and their large shareholders (often including universities and pension funds). Success, she added, looks like “pulling them away from supporting authoritarian regimes, and towards supporting our pro-democracy movement.”

I
t's a hot-as-fuck Los Angeles morning. Near 80 degrees at 8 a.m., and Stephen A. Smith is having half of a lightly jellied bagel. We're near a big-ass private park that abuts a 40-story black glass building rumored to house or have housed NBA super-agents, pop stars, white-hot young creators, and various and sundry Middle Eastern royalty. The structure feels too tall for the quaky City of Angels, and one can only hope it stays as unshakable as its most garrulous current resident, Stephen A. Smith. 


	Because sports media has belatedly begun a messy process of reinvention, and Smith, 57, is flourishing. The Bronx-born journalist who made his bones covering the Philadelphia 76ers' radical Allen Iverson era recently signed a five-year, $100 million contract with ESPN, making him the network's highest-paid on-air personality not tied to a licensing deal. Last year, First Take, the Monday-through-Friday morning talk show he hosts, led ESPN's studio programs with 21 consecutive months of year-over-year audience growth; so far this year, it maintains daily audiences of 450,000 to nearly 670,000 viewers and is trending upward. Salary-wise, Smith's deal places him ahead of nighttime titans like Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon. He's on ESPN air more than any other talent, and yet Smith wants a sports broadcaster's holy grail: Last September, he said he'd love to be on Monday Night Football. 

	











	Smith is engineered for this moment. On camera, his smile goes from Cheshire Cat to Mona Lisa to Grinch. His insight, grouchiness, intensity, and loudness lure, as he's labeled everything from “most annoying” to “just noise” to “a left-wing shill” to a “megaphone for MAGA.” And whether you think he's a mascot for the demise of sports journalism or the epitome of bootstrappy brilliance, Smith has been so vocal about national politics, his name has come up as a possible presidential candidate. 

	











	But there's more. Since 2016, Smith has had a recurring role as a surveillance expert on ABC's General Hospital. He recently appeared as a sports agent on Law & Order. He shows up talking to Sean Hannity on Fox News. His 2023 memoir, Straight Shooter, is a New York Times bestseller. New media is on the rise, and charismatic younger broadcasters are coming into their own. But Stephen A. has the energy of one in the catbird seat.

	“All of these people that are doing their podcasts, or they're reporting on stuff, or they're coming at Stephen A. and they're saying, ‘Who is he? What does he know?' They're forgetting my résumé,” he says, his voice hoarse even as he was on his way, after our conversation, to tape NBA Countdown. “I've been doing this. I've been a journalist for 20 years before I ever came on First Take. That's why First Take can come on the air every day and I can do what I do with passion and fervor.”


	There's a quiet mania about people like Stephen A., who work both morning and late shifts, on the same days. Their tightly managed fatigue can't hide a vanity they have about the simple fact of experiencing more hours: living more life. This affectation can become so steadying a force that it morphs into their personality. That's why, in the blistering sun and brutal pollen in the private park, I had to press Stephen A. about who exactly Stephen Anthony Smith is. I think he almost told me.


How has sports fandom changed from when you were covering the 76ers in the Nineties and aughts? Fans are more invested because sports gaming has entered the fray. There's a lot more at stake, because you're not just rooting, you're betting. And because you're betting, you become a bit more hostile. Social media has a profound impact as well. Everybody has a voice now. Or they think they do. And sometimes the people talking are the athletes themselves — clapping right back. Technology compels athletes, coaches, and teams to react to all of that, no matter how much they deny it.

Do you feel like the fandom around you is different these days? People either love Stephen A. or they hate Stephen A.That's always been the case. I've always been intensely polarizing. Either you're for me or you're against me, but that's the way I like it. That's what I signed up for. I'm a trained journalist. You have people who are going to question your truth, or people who despise you for telling them what they know to be true. I've never been in this business to be liked. It's nice to be liked. To be loved. But it's not an expectation. Not something I'm entitled to. It's not something I care about when it comes to how I approach my job.

	











Does that carry over into your personal relationships?I don't understand that question.


As you say, it's nice to be loved, to be liked. But it's not required.I wouldn't say that. I've got a wonderful family. Two daughters. Four older sisters. Fifteen nieces and nephews. I've got friends that I grew up with in Hollis, Queens, in New York. I've got my buddies I went to Winston-Salem State University with. I got boys all over the country. There's no absence of love. It buffers me, and strengthens me professionally. I don't have any needs, professionally, other than to do my job. There's not this salivation for love, adoration—


From your audiences.Right. Respect is what I earn, and I gotta wake up and earn that every single day. But affection, love, all of those goody-two-shoe feelings? No. That's not my profession. Not if you're about doing this right. Because there are going to be times where even the people that you've cultivated a relationship with, that you care about, that you wish nothing but the best for — you're gonna have to call them to the carpet.


I've seen you do it.When necessary. It hurts to do it. But that's the job. I let anybody that does business with me understand, up front, that's who I'm going to be. Don't cultivate a relationship with me if your objective is to ensure that you divert me away from doing my job. If that's your goal, you're going to be disappointed.

“I don't concern myself with my enemies, because most people ain't my friends.”


What really were the odds of young Steven Anthony becoming Steven A.?Oh, extreme. If I could add a word on top of extreme, I would. To get left back in the fourth grade, with a first-grade reading level. To have undiagnosed dyslexia that my mother and my sister ultimately discovered. To graduate from high school with honors — but from a vocational technical high school where I studied electrical installation and stuff. To go to Winston-Salem on a basketball scholarship, only to crack my kneecap in half my first year there, and never be the same— 


I've heard you use that phrase before.Which phrase?


Cracked your kneecap—Patella.


—in half.Yes.


I've often thought you have good insight into injury. Is this why?Yeah. Because it wasn't just the injury. It was the rehab. It was the absence of access to top-notch technology because it was a Division II school. I literally had to leave for a full semester, go home to New York for rehabilitation, because my mother's insurance would not pay for it if I stayed in North Carolina. The school didn't cover us like that. 


When you went down there to try out, you hit a whole bunch of—Seventeen. Seventeen three-pointers. I never did it again. It's a miracle that I didn't miss.

	











You know how difficult it is to shoot the ball from the three-point line and beyond, and make it. Oh, man. It's very difficult — for those not accustomed to doing it. But the one thing that I could do throughout my life was shoot the basketball. 


And now?I can go out to a court and play, but my knees are sore for a couple of weeks if I do that. With my schedule, it's just not worth it. 


Right now, fans, commentators, everybody seems to hate three-point shooting.It's simple. A lot of guys can't shoot. But the league has changed its philosophy where everybody's looking to jack up open three-point shots. It elevates the pace. It peels you away from the physicality of the game, the banging down the side, elbow swinging, and everything else. The combination of those things lends itself toward a more attractive brand of basketball. Plus, it's lethal: When somebody's knocking threes down on you, it demoralizes the opposition, because there's little to nothing you can do about it. 


When was the first time you had a fist fight?Seventh grade. I don't remember the guy's name. He caught me in the temple, dropped me to one knee, and then was coming to finish me. He left his guard down and then I got up and caught him with a straight right.


Do you remember the reason for the fight?Kids arguing in seventh grade.


What about your last one?Got in a fight with one of my classmates in my senior year of high school. We were arguing about something intellectual, and he was upset at me, and then he was talking junk about how he was gonna bust my ass on the basketball court. So we went out there after school and I busted his ass on the basketball court. He threw the ball in my face, and we started fighting. That's all. It broke up real quick.


There was a time after you got let go from ESPN—When I departed ESPN in 2009, I had nothing. I had no prospects. 


What does that mean?I had nothing. Just what I said.


You had a huge career.No. It was stripped from me. When I was let go in May of 2009, I had no job opportunities, no other network wanted me.


Why?I don't know. No other network. No other network. I assumed I was blackballed, that the message was sent that I was somebody you wouldn't want to work with.


No one called you for meetings?Nobody. No one. I was unemployed from April of 2009 to February 2010. Living purely off savings. Then an old agent of mine by the name of Steve Mountain helped me get a job at Fox Sports Radio. Then ESPN Radio in New York — led by a guy who's still my boss, Dave Roberts — desperately wanted me back, and brought me back in February of 2011. I was restricted to radio: a two-hour show in New York and then a two-hour show in L.A. 


How'd you get back on television?Skip Bayless was the star of First Take. He and I had always wanted to work together. We'd done a pilot for Fox, Sports in Black and White. They loved it, but at the 11th hour and 59th minute, Fox Sports pulled it. Fast-forward. It's 2012. [Media executive] Jamie Horowitz convinces ESPN to let me come on at least once a week with Skip on First Take. When I showed up on Wednesdays, the ratings went through the roof. Horowitz and Bayless convinced ESPN — Let's have him sitting across from Skip every day.

	











Were you surprised to be back?Of course. Because once they let you go, you never assume they're gonna want you back.


A lot of what I've heard about you is that Stephen A., one, is always playing chess, and two, Stephen A. keeps his enemies close.I don't concern myself with my enemies, because most people ain't my friends. In terms of playing chess — that could be true, just not in this particular instance. When the Worldwide Leader [in Sports] lets you go, they usually don't bring you back. When they let me go, I was making $1.3 million a year. When they brought me back, they paid me $400,000 for two radio shows. And you had people in New York and L.A. getting that for one show. So I was grossly underpaid. I was humbled — which I happen to know was the goal of one of the leading executives there. And I learned a lot from it. I certainly didn't feel that way at the time. But as life has gone on, I've been grateful for the experience. It's enabled me to be who and what I am.


Are we going to talk about you being ruthless?I don't think I'm ruthless. Why would you say I'm ruthless?


Because not many get to a position such as yours without being ruthless — especially in sports.Yeah. But that don't make me one of them.

“I'm a never-ending process. I'm the engine that doesn't cut off.”


If you weren't ruthless on your journey to the top, what were you?I worked hard. Put my head down. I'm about the work. I'm not about the sizzle. I'm the guy that went to a White House Correspondents' Dinner through the back door. I didn't want to be on the red carpet. “Ruthless” implies you're uncaring. That all you care about is your mission. Nothing else in life matters, other people's lives don't matter. I've never been that guy. Intentionally willing to hurt other people? I'm never that guy.


Ever.Ever. Because I assure you, especially now, there's a whole lot of people I can hurt — who would deserve to be hurt. And I don't waste my time thinking about it. I'll leave them alone.


Because?Because that's not who I am. I'm not gonna put that on my soul. I'll let God take care of that. Some people deserve it. I won't mention their names, but it ain't hard to figure out. Some of the things that people … woooooo! — things they say? And who they are? They ain't shit, and I know it. But, I'm not gonna waste energy trying to hurt them and do things wrong to them. I don't give a damn who you are, I want you to eat. I want you to have a roof over your head. I want you to be able to live your life. We're as strong as our weakest link, and whether it's individually, family, or societal, you can't ignore the weak. Because if you're weak, you're desolate or whatever, and you're ignored, all you're gonna do is bring the collective down.


I see people trying to knock you off your spot.That comes with anybody that's on top. All they do is validate for me that I am on top — because what you worried about me for? I'm not trying to act robotic and inhuman, and tell you that if I read something or hear something that it doesn't bother me, in the moment. But the key words there are “in the moment.” Is this something that I carry with me on my shoulders every day, thinking about the negative things people say? I don't, because I wouldn't be able to do my job. I have alligator skin in that regard. 

	











You and First Take have changed the way sports are covered.When people say that, I take it with a grain of salt because, depending on who you are, you might feel it's a positive or you might feel it's a negative. My response would be a question: How exactly is it that I cover sports? 


At the poles. There might not be as much nuance or old-school Sports Illustrated-style seriousness. It's “Who's the king? Who fell off?”I pay very little attention to people who say that. Here's the reason why. So I might have a conversation about LeBron James or Michael Jordan being the GOAT.

“LeBron and I don't like each other. We're never gonna like each other. It's not gonna stop me from doing my job.”


You might?Right. It may be several times. We are on First Take two hours a day, five days a week, and in my case, a minimum of 44 to 45 weeks a year. We're talking about 450 hours. I can assure you, that [James-versus-Jordan conversation] doesn't even equate to 10 percent of our content. People peel out what they want to peel out. It's just like when they were talking to me about Colin Kaepernick: “When we gonna get back to sports? All we talk about is race. All we talk about is Black and white and police brutality.” Really? So we had a two-hour show and we talked about Colin Kaepernick for two segments. Well, there's 15 segments. What about the other 13? 


Were you saying this in meetings?No, no, no. Not in meetings. I said it on the air. Like, ain't nobody hiding. I'm the executive producer of First Take, so I'm not running. I'm paying attention. And I'm going, “Y'all really complaining? But then why are we number one for 13 years?” We've been number one since I arrived. Bayless has come and gone. Max Kellerman's come and gone. A potpourri of other people have come and gone. I've been there for 13 years. We've been number one for 13 years.  


Not a potpourri.It is a potpourri. And I've been number one for 13 years.


I'm clear.Why? If you're complaining about it, why? Because you know it's a lie. It's not all we talk about. We talk about everything. We talk football, basketball, we talk about issues.

	











You do.OK? We're not a one-dimensional show. We pay attention to what the audience is paying attention to. We know what's trending. That's our job. And then we touch on the subjects they want us to touch on. How we touch on it is where I come in — because you're not gonna tell me how to speak. I have guests who think the opposite of me. And the theme could be surmised, over the last four or five years, as Stephen A. against the world. Because every analyst comes in to go against me. How did that happen, Danyel? Because I invited it.


Oh, you invited it.I invited it.


This is why I say chess, not checkers. You could go on all day and say Michael Jordan is forever king. But I believe you might say that even if you didn't believe it, because you know that that position gets clicks and eyes.I do believe it. But here's the thing. Like anybody in today's generation, of course, clicks, ratings, etc., are what you covet in this business. But my authenticity is my brand. I mean what I say and I say what I mean. Unless I'm openly joking. When I'm serious, which is most of the time, you know I'm deadly serious. I'm not faking a take. I gotta live with that lie.


Are you being authentic when you talk about running for president?Yes. Because I'm not talking about running for it. I said I'll leave the door open because elected officials, my pastor, my friends, and people in the streets have asked me. I have repeatedly stated I have no desire to be a politician. I was wrong to call them “professional beggars.” That is disrespectful to politicians. But needing to curry favor, whether it's with other legislators, constituents, donors — I can't imagine ever wanting to live that life. Not to mention the fact that I would have to give up money that it took me a long, long, long time to earn. I just reached a contract extension with ESPN. I'm gonna pass up half that to run for office? I can't see it. But I care about the issues. I care about America. I care about what I see going on throughout the streets of America, and I do want to be a major player in terms of having a voice and influence with regard to the people that we select to run our country. In my perfect world, I'd be pushing candidates forward for America to look at as opposed to trying to push myself forward. 


Is that where Three Americans, the live event you did in New York in March with Bill O'Reilly and Chris Cuomo, came from? That came from O'Reilly. I was on the air with him and Cuomo, who has become a friend. He's never pushed me to be a politician, but he's like, “Look, you need to do more of this. Your voice is needed.” And when O'Reilly came on the air and started debating back and forth with me, and folks saw the dynamic, O'Reilly was like, “This is something we should do.” 


Where are you on the political spectrum, in relation to them?Chris is left. I think no matter what O'Reilly says about himself being an independent, he's right all the way. The Cuomo family is historically center-left, which is how I would describe myself. But I'm even more of a centrist than they are. I'm really right down the middle. There are times where I completely agree with what the Republicans are doing, and there are times that I completely agree with what the Democrats are doing, and there are times that I'm diametrically opposed to both.


When you say Republican, are you talking historic Republicans? Or Republicans as they exist today?I'm talking about historical Republicans. Republicans today are at the mercy of Donald Trump. I don't even view Trump as a Republican. He caters to the GOP because that's his base, and that's what got him in office. That's why he did it. You have to remember, I knew Trump before he ran for president. We used to go to his events at his casinos in Atlantic City, used to see him at games all the time. Donald Trump primarily was known as a Democrat. 

	











	Right now, we have concerns about Harvard. We've got concerns about HBCUs with him. We've got concerns about his administration's willingness to eradicate Black history. I'm telling you right now, you get a bunch of Black power brokers together and sit at a table with Donald Trump and convince him that going against what he's purported is in his best interest, he'll do it. He doesn't care. That's always been him. 


Is he a smart person?He's not dumb. I can tell you that. He's very shrewd. He's a dealmaker. Which is why I get upset at people on the left: We sent you to Capitol Hill to legislate. Find a way to work with him. Stop just hating, hating, hating him. Find a way to give him something he wants so you can get what you want. That's your job. Anybody can sit up there and say, “I'm gonna oppose everything that Trump throws out there.” That ain't working. Work is figuring out a way to serve your constituency. [As an example,] I sit up there and I get into something with LeBron James.

“When I'm serious, you know I'm deadly serious. I'm not faking a take. I gotta live with that lie.”


That viral moment at Crypto.com Arena in March at Lakers versus Knicks, where he approached you courtside and you two had words.And so I'm not gonna cover the Lakers? I'm not gonna talk about James now? What sense does that make? I have to cover the sport. He's a big part of the sport, which means I have to cover him, no matter what. Grown-ups understand that under the most hostile of circumstances, if you represent people, then it's about the people. It's not about you. 


What is going on with you and LeBron James?I have nothing to say about that. I don't like him, and he don't like me. He's one of the greatest players who's ever lived. I'm going to show him that respect, and I'm going to cover him objectively. When he does great, I'm gonna applaud. When he doesn't do great, I'm not gonna applaud. He hid behind his son [Los Angeles Laker Bronny James], tried to make something out of nothing, as if I was dogging his son, which I was not. The real issue was we don't like each other. And he used that as an excuse to confront me. I got it. 


When you say “I got it,” what does that mean?Meaning I understand that we don't like each other. We're never gonna like each other. It's not gonna stop me from doing my job. He'll be treated just like any other player I cover. Nobody is going to get me to compromise my professional integrity. I don't have to like you to be fair to you.

	











Is it a power dynamic? Is it personal? Is there an old beef that lingers? A personality thing?One could argue it's all of the above. Over the course of his 22 years in this league, and the stories that I've had to cover about him, about his teams, decisions that he's influenced his teams to make, trades, coaching firings, etc., etc. — all of which he's played a role in. I've had to cover things that have not made him very happy, and I don't care.


Do you think you're good to the women of ESPN?The women of ESPN?


Professionals. Journalists. I guess so.


You have a lot of women on your shows.I do. They deserve it.


They do.I don't think about it as being good to them. They've earned it. Monica McNutt, Andraya Carter, Chiney Ogwumike, Kimberley Martin, and of course my host, Molly Qerim. Mina Kimes. These are all ladies that contribute to the show. And they are nothing short of outstanding. What they've done for the industry, they deserve a lot of credit for, and they will always have my support.


You've said that there have been three times you feel like you made a misstep. One involved the Ray Rice intimate-partner violence situation, when the then-Ravens running back and his fiancée were arrested after video was released of him knocking her out cold in an Atlantic City elevator. I bring this up to say that your reputation with regard to how you may or may not view women has not always been super top-line. Nobody's perfect. Everybody and their mother advises me, “Don't revisit it. It's a no-win situation.” To me, that's cowardice. I know what I said. And what I did was utter the word “provoke.” A former colleague at ESPN took it, ran with it, and it went ballistic on Twitter. The leadership at ESPN reacted to that. When the heat elevated, [they] said, “We have to suspend you.” And that's a blemish on my career I do not believe I deserve. I've been consistent in that position. I'm a father of two daughters. I know what I've never condoned or excused. Unfortunately, we live in an immature society where people are not deducing right from wrong and contextualizing things properly. 


When you were on television in the aftermath of your mom's death a few years ago, you did not seem like the same person to me. You didn't seem to care about what had happened in the previous night's games. You were prepared and professional. But I thought in those moments that the person I was witnessing might be Stephen Anthony as opposed to Stephen A.I don't know. What I do know is I was like a zombie. That's not Stephen A. I was a zombie. Part of me had died. My mother is the greatest human being I've ever known. That I've ever loved. I mean, my daughters, obviously, but my mother is the reason I know there's a God, and why I believe in angels. I've never contemplated hell for two reasons. One, because I saw the hell she had to go through to take care of us. That look in her eye, that fatigue, that dire look of concern, wondering if anything that she did was gonna be enough to get us through — because Dad didn't help her. That was hell. But  also, in seeing her go through it, she made sure that I never felt it. And when she left, I had to go to therapy, because I was asked to. It was insisted upon by loved ones, by my pastor as well. A.R. Bernard at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, who's very dear to me. I cried every day for two years. 


It was hard to watch you. I was like, this is the definition of needing extended bereavement. The biggest reason [I came back back so soon] was that she wouldn't have had it no other way. I finished the NBA Finals and then spent the summer trying to get myself together, recalibrate.


	She's been gone now for eight years, June 1. Every day, I hear her as if she's still here. That used to sadden me. Now it makes me smile.

	











Talk to me about St. Thomas, where your family is from.That's where my mother and father were born and raised. It's the islands, you know? I was very mad at my father years ago, because he had promised some local senate candidate I was going to campaign for him. I don't remember the guy's name, but the point is, there was no way in hell I was going to do that. That's the kind of person my father would be at times, and I didn't like that at all. I can't just go home now and see everybody like I once did. Sometimes you get to a certain place and the people around you swear you changed, when in fact it's them who changed, and as a result, you just work through it and try to keep your distance.

“There are times where even the people that you care about, you're gonna have to call them to the carpet.”


Your sports journalism beginnings were quite traditional. I wrote, I covered the beat, then became an NBA columnist, and ultimately I became a general sports columnist. You didn't have a license to editorialize back in the day, before the advent of dot-coms and all of this other stuff. You had to climb charts to become a general sports columnist. In some people's eyes, [what I do is] performative, but it's only performative in terms of the energy I'm giving. Not the information I'm spewing. Because that I have been doing for 20 years prior to First Take. 


So when people say that Stephen A. is purely performative—  They know better. Not only do I not agree with it, I know they don't. They're lying. To say that I'm just performative is to ignore my journalistic background. I started off with the New York Daily News in 1993. I did four internships prior to the Daily News as a high school writer. In 14 months I got promoted to college beat writer with the Philadelphia Inquirer. How would you possibly think that I'm just performing? How, with the stories that I've broken, and the interviews I've done?

	











I can tell you why.You can tell me why, but you wouldn't be right.


I would be right. One reason is many people tend to minimize the work of Black journalists.But that's what I just said. I didn't paint it with a broad brush like that. But it's like, if I'm loud and I'm going off about something, I'm angry. If a white dude does it, he's passionate. I accept it. All I'm trying to say is that if you're on TV, aren't you supposed to perform? 


So when you're in your pajamas and your head is on your pillow, and your alarm goes off and you open your eyes, and you're becoming conscious, who is that person?That person is on a mission to give my audience exactly what they expect and more, over the course of two hours each weekday morning. They expect to see something from Stephen A. that leaves an indelible mark, and I believe that is why I am who I am. That's why I'm proud.


You're thinking of all of this in your pajamas?No. I simplified for you. I said, give the audience what they expect.


Who is the guy that wakes up before he becomes Stephen A. Who is Stephen Anthony Smith? Is he happy? Is he sad? I'm not happy. I'm not sad. I'm a never-ending process. I'm the guy who refuses to stand still enough to smell the roses. I'm the guy that got left back. I'm the guy that got fired. I'm the guy that walks around with that memory, that mark of failure draping over me to the point where I'm determined to make sure it never repeats itself. When I agreed to my contract extension with ESPN, I went out afterward and had a nice dinner. Celebrated. And I woke up the next day plotting for five years from now, to make sure I validate that I'm worth every damn penny they're gonna pay me. I'm the engine that doesn't cut off. 


	I'm not saying it's a good thing. I wouldn't advise most people to do it. But it's who I am. I'm 57. I lost over 30 pounds. I recovered from being a nearly full-blown diabetic. I recovered from nearly getting killed by Covid, and I'm in the best health I've been in in a quarter-century because I'm in the gym six days a week. I'm on the treadmill and the Peloton. I'm lifting weights and working out with my trainer. I box when I can. I'm in the cold plunge and the infrared sauna. I do whatever it takes, because my goal is to win. And even when I'm winning, I don't feel like I'm winning because that was yesterday. That's got nothing to do with today — I got more things to accomplish. It's hard to stop me because my attitude is they're all gunning for me, and it's just the way I like it. It fuels me. It doesn't shrink me. That's who I am every morning. Not at night, when I'm tired and it's time to get some sleep. But when I wake up? Yes, that is me.

	In the first official trailer for Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, Jon Landau (Jeremy Strong) wants to make a few things clear. “Here's what I want you to understand,” the longtime music manager tells Columbia Records executive Al Teller (David Krumholtz), “this is not about either one of us. This is not about the charts. This is about Bruce Springsteen. And these are the songs that he wants to work on right now.”


	Moments earlier, Jeremy Allen White‘s Springsteen settled behind a mic in his New Jersey bedroom — just him, some antiquated furniture, and Mike Batlan (Paul Walter Hauser), his recording engineer for the Nebraska sessions. “Don't need to be perfect,” he tells him. “I want it to feel like I'm in the room by myself.” In theaters Oct. 24, Deliver Me From Nowhere catches the musician during the making of Nebraska, his stripped back acoustic folk record that arrived in 1982.


	The biopic trailer offers glimpses into Springsteen's rugged childhood under the watch of his father (played by Stephen Graham), his whirlwind romance with a woman named Faye (Odessa Young), and his nights performing to sold-out crowds. The clip closes out with White doing his best take on the Springsteen classic “Born to Run” with lights flashing all around him and sweat pouring down his face. “I'm trying to find something real in all the noise,” he says.

	“Making Springsteen was deeply moving as it allowed me to step inside the soul of an artist I've long admired — and to witness, up close, the vulnerability and strength behind his music,” director Scott Cooper said in a statement. “The experience felt like a journey through memory, myth, and truth. And more than anything, it was a privilege to translate that raw emotional honesty to the screen, and in doing so, it changed me. I cannot thank Bruce and Jon Landau enough for allowing me to tell their story.”

	











	Cooper wrote the script for the film based on Warren Zane's 2023 book, Deliver Me from Nowhere. The film also stars Gaby Hoffman and Marc Maron. Deliver Me From Nowhere began production this past October. In November, Springsteen stopped by a shoot day in Bayonne, New Jersey, when the crew was capturing the moment he picked out his first car, a Chevrolet Z28 Camaro. The scene appears early in the trailer, with a salesman telling him, “It's awful fitting for a handsome devil rockstar — I do know who you are.” White's Springsteen responds, “Well, that makes one of us.”

The video was filmed on the Afghanistan/Pakistan border in 2020.

Stunning new UFO footage has surfaced, and it's nothing short of wild.

As OutKick readers know, there are few things that move the needle like videos and photos of unknown objects in the sky.

We have plenty of examples, and very few answers, which only further fuels conspiracies and speculation. Thus far, the government has shown very little interest in explaining what it knows.

That leaves the door wide open for theories to run wild.

*RELATED: Did Aliens Secretly Fight Soviet Soldiers? CIA Document Raises Strange Questions*

UFO researcher Jeremy Corbell, arguably the most notable journalist on the subject in America, released three videos Tuesday that needs to be seen to be believed.

The footage filmed by the Air Force in 2020 shows some kind of disk seemingly moving through clouds. The footage was filmed near the Afghanistan/Pakistan border, according to the Daily Mail.

You can watch the new videos released by Corbell below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

""This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public. It has implications that are huge,"" Corbell told the Daily Mail.

He further explained, ""You do not see plumes of heat coming off this disc-shaped object. This was captured on a thermal sensor - it should have detected heat if any traditional propulsion was present. But there's nothing. That's one of the wildest aspects.""

New UFO footage is going viral, and there's no clear explanation. (Credit: Getty Images Creatives)

Once again, we have more footage that simply has no explanation, but let me throw a theory out there. The Afghanistan/Pakistan border has been one of the hottest conflict zones on the planet going back to the 1980s.

It was then flooded with military equipment and gear following 9/11. It's very possible this disk object was some kind of highly-advanced drone doing recon.

I'm not saying that's what it was, but given the area it was filmed in, it seems like a reasonable guess. I've long believed that many UFO sightings are classified military equipment.

Not all of them, but we know for a fact the government has lied about UFOs to cover up classified programs.

On May 15, at age 84, the paranormal expert Jaime T. Licauco passed on to the realm beyond. He has authored many essays and books on the strange, which I keep copies of in my personal library. I met him once, in 2018, during a book fair. Licauco was a fantastic storyteller, and even though I found some of his stories a little too fantastical, they nevertheless remind us that there is more to the world than what we see with our eyes.

I have always been fascinated with what we call “kababalaghan.” When I was a little boy, I spent my afternoons browsing through my lolo's bookshelves. His collection included many books on mysticism and psychic experiments. (Yes, he also had Licauco's books!) 

Growing up, I also watched how my grandaunt healed people through prayer, and how some of her patients entered hypnotic states and started speaking in tongues. They were “slain by the Holy Spirit,” or, in other words, sinapian. 

I personally know so many people who can “see” entities, who have been healed by albularyos, who have been “courted” (niligawan) by engkantos, and who have had prophetic dreams. This may be a cultural thing, too—maybe our Indigenous worldview is just so open and affirming to the supernatural.

Aside from Licauco, there has always been sincere paranormal investigation in popular media. You may also know about Ed Caluag, and, in the '90s, there was Tony Perez's Spirit Questors. I know some people today who continue to investigate cases. Five days after Licauco's passing, Perez followed. He has been a guiding light for many spiritual seekers. 

There are many local TV episodes dedicated to folk beliefs and supposed cases of kulam—you can just search for them online. If you can recall, a few years ago, there was a woman who got possessed live on air while talking to a priest. People laughed at her on social media, but the fact that it happened shows how common sapi actually is in the Philippines—to the point that the first center for exorcism in Asia will be built here!

Among the academics, the person who first comes to mind is the priest psychologist Jaime Bulatao, founder of Ateneo de Manila University's psychology department. He dealt with many cases of sapi and household disturbances supposedly caused by duwendes. His students may also remember his classes on astral projection. I met him a few weeks before his death in 2015. 

In the '60s and '70s, scientific researchers from around the world would visit the Philippines to study the practice of psychic surgery, where healers would remove tumors from a person's body using prayers and their bare hands. Some came to debunk them, while others came to be healed—even some Hollywood celebrities!

Now, how can we explain these things? We do not have to prove or disprove anything. We already know that weird things are happening. But, as Father Bulatao said, we can separate our “experience” of something with our “interpretation” of it. In other words, something happened, but how we understand it can differ depending on culture and upbringing. For example, are we being haunted by a “ghost,” or are we being “haunted” by memory and trauma? Our folklore provides the colorful metaphors for very real psychological experiences. It is the task of the psychologist—or paranormal investigator—to interpret it appropriately. 

I was once told a story about a young woman who would be “possessed” by an engkanto every time a young man showed interest in her. This young woman never had a boyfriend, and often kept to herself. The people around her believed that an engkanto had fallen in love with her and claimed her for himself. So, he would assert himself every time someone new came along. Now that is the cultural interpretation of the paranormal experience. 

Let us attempt an alternative psychological interpretation. Maybe she was just not ready for a relationship. Maybe, to avoid having to deal with the awkwardness of romance, her mind created a familiar character (the folkloric engkanto) in order to escape the situation. It is like a child's selective listening when an authority figure is lecturing them—“Pasok sa isang tenga, labas sa kabila.” In that way, she does not have to be stressed about it. The treatment for this case will depend on what this young woman needs—counseling for her romantic issues, or even an exorcism, can be helpful in different ways.

I hope that more people get interested in this field and join me in exploring it in a psychological and culturally appropriate way, especially since kababalaghan is so common in our everyday lives. If you are interested, I have written an academic article entitled “Philippine Parapsychology,” which was published in an international journal last year. If you are affiliated with a university as a student or teacher, you can ask your library for help to access it. 

For my fellow kababalaghan enthusiasts, whether you are following the footsteps of Jaime Licauco or Jaime Bulatao, our task is not to judge people and their experiences. Our role is to understand them. Why is it so common among Filipinos? What is it about our folk psychology that is so open to the strange, spiritual, and supernatural?

MALVERN, PA — Those interested in all things eerie may want to join an upcoming battlefield tour that will search for paranormal activity.

Interstate Paranormal Research is leading an investigation from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday at Paoli Battlefield in Malvern.

Tickets for the investigative tour are $45. Get tickets online here.

Paoli Battlefield Historical Park will be closed to all visitors during the tour.

Drinks and bathroom facilities will be provided at the battlefield. 

Attendees should bring bug spray, flashlights, recorders, cameras, and any other devices they want.

The tour will take guests through the battlefield's wooded pathways and fields, so attendees are encouraged to dress for the season, including warm clothing and appropriate footwear.

Attendees who have trouble standing for long periods can also bring folding chairs or folding stools, but they should remember the tour will visit several different locations throughout the battlefield and in the woods.

""We have discovered over the years many different “hot spots” of activity located along the trail and in other areas around the battlefield of the 9th deadliest battle of the Revolutionary War,"" organizers said. ""This battle was a midnight bayonet and sword attack by the British as they swept across the camp of Anthony Wayne in three waves that sent his continental troops off in a panic. Many witnesses describe the attack and atrocities committed there by the British.

""Fifty-two soldiers from this battle are buried in a mass grave and there is one that is buried somewhere else in the battlefield. Wayne's troops were so incensed at the British atrocities that the coined one of our nation's first battle cry 'Remember Paoli.'""

Attendees are encouraged to email photos or recordings taken during the tour to Paolibattlefield@gmail.com.

TORONTO — For Domee Shi, making a movie about an introverted kid getting abducted by aliens felt oddly familiar.

Not because she's had any close encounters, but because she remembers being a teenager longing to be taken away to a world where her weirdness was understood.

The Toronto native co-directs “Elio,” a Pixar animated sci-fi film about an 11-year-old orphan who yearns to be snatched by extraterrestrials to escape his loneliness — and gets his wish when an interplanetary organization mistakes him for Earth's ambassador.

“He's this lonely artsy kid who just wants to belong somewhere. I definitely felt that way growing up,” says the Oscar-winning animator behind 2022's coming-of-age Toronto-set hit “Turning Red.”

Born in Chongqing, China and raised in Toronto after immigrating to Canada as a child, Shi grew up obsessed with anime. She describes it as an isolating experience. In high school, she was the vice-president of the anime club — a group that had only two members.

“Back in the '90s and 2000s, anime was popular, but it wasn't as popular, I feel, as it is now…. I really wished people cared about the same stuff that I cared about,” Shi says during a promotional stop in Toronto.

She recalls dreaming of going to animation school so she could “find people who understood me, who spoke my language, who understood all my nerdy-ass references.”

In “Elio,” out Friday, the film's titular character, voiced by Yonas Kibreab, finds a sense of belonging in the Communiverse — a kind of cosmic United Nations where alien civilizations convene to share knowledge and resolve conflicts. It's a far cry from life on Earth, where Elio feels out of place living with his stressed-out, overextended aunt Olga, voiced by Zoe Saldaña.

In real life, Shi says she found her own place in the universe at Anime North, an annual anime convention in suburban Toronto. She remembers attending for the first time as a teen.

“I had a really crappy ‘One Piece' cosplay on. I wore a straw hat and was dressed like a bad version of Luffy,” she says, referring to the protagonist of the Japanese manga series.

“But then I looked around and there were so many crappy cosplays around me, and people just wearing their nerddom on their sleeve…. I was like, ‘Oh my God, everyone speaks the same language as me.'”

It was there that Shi learned about the renowned animation program at Toronto's Sheridan College, which had propelled graduates into orbit at studios such as Pixar and Disney.

After graduating from Sheridan, Shi went on to work for Pixar as a storyboard artist for films including 2015's “Inside Out” and 2019's “Toy Story 4.”

Shi became the first woman to direct a Pixar short with 2018's “Bao,” a heartfelt tale about a Chinese-Canadian mother and her dumpling-turned-son that won the 2019 Oscar for best animated short. She broke new ground again with “Turning Red,” becoming the first woman to solo direct a Pixar feature.

“Elio” marks Shi's first time co-directing a feature. Shi says the film began as a project by ”Coco” director Adrian Molina, inspired by his isolated childhood growing up on a military base. After delays caused by the Hollywood strikes, Molina was tapped to co-direct “Coco 2” and handed the reins to Shi and fellow director Madeline Sharafian, who was a storyboard artist on “Turning Red,” to complete the story.

Shi describes the final product as “a beautiful mind-meld” of all three directors' styles. In addition to channeling her own teen experience, she infused the film with influences from her favourite sci-fi films growing up — including 1979's “Alien” and 1982's “The Thing” — as well as eerie stop-motion classics such as 1993's “The Nightmare Before Christmas.”

“I think kids can handle a little bit of scariness if it's more of a fun scary, like a thrill,” she says.

Shi notes there are some Canadian influences in “Elio” as well. 

“It's weird to say but I feel like diversity shows up very naturally in my work and I think that's because I grew up in a very diverse neighbourhood and city,” she says.

She says she doesn't even clock those multicultural touches until American colleagues point it out.

“People will be like, ‘Oh, are you doing that intentionally? Is it intentional that Mei's friends are all girls from different backgrounds?'” she says, referencing the quartet at the heart of “Turning Red.” 

“I mean, kind of, but that's also what my friends were like growing up. I grew up in East York, moved to Scarborough. That's just what kids looked like, and I'm just used to it.”

Elio's cultural background — half Mexican and half Dominican — is woven into the film with care and intention. His Mexican heritage draws from Molina's roots, while his Dominican side is brought to life through Saldaña's own background. Shi says the actor infused Olga with personal touches, including the suggestion of a Dominican song for one scene.

A nod to Shi's own heritage turns up in an unexpected way.

“I feel like the Communiverse could be an allegory for Canada,” she laughs.

“It's definitely a mishmash and a beautiful, chaotic mosaic of different cultures and species and aliens all working and living together.”

Every episode of Supernatural has something that makes it worth watching at least once, but I always skip certain episodes on a rewatch. With over 325 episodes, watching Supernatural is quite a commitment, but the show's characters and its unique blend of horror, humor, and heart make it well worth watching. Following brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester as they travel the country hunting monsters, Supernatural ran for fifteen seasons from 2005 to 2020 and developed a passionate fan base along the way.

To fully appreciate Supernatural, first-time viewers should take in every episode, as even the lackluster stories can have fun character moments or important revelations. But for a rewatch, some episodes can easily be skipped without impacting the overall story. Some viewers may want to focus on the season-long story arcs and skip some of Supernatural's monster-of-the-week episodes, while others may want to avoid episodes they found particularly scary or those where a beloved character dies. While I'm happy to rewatch most Supernatural episodes, there are a few that I don't mind skipping.

 Many of Supernatural's earliest episodes are standalone stories that play out like miniature horror movies. Episodes like ""Bloody Mary"" or ""The Benders"" may be too frightening even for Jensen Ackles or disturbing for viewers to watch twice, but other season 1 stories are weaker episodes that don't warrant a rewatch. ""Bugs"" is simply not a great episode, and while Sam and Dean have one interesting conversation about their dad, the story doesn't offer anything particularly insightful.

Supernatural changed a lot over its 15 seasons. While the show remains incredibly popular, returning to season 1 reveals some harsh truths.

""Bugs"" follows Sam and Dean as they investigate a town being invaded by deadly swarms of insects. With questionable CGI insects and a lackluster mystery, ""Bugs"" has achieved notoriety within the fandom as being one of Supernatural's worst episodes. Whether because the episode leaves me with the feeling that insects are crawling on me or because it's simply a mediocre episode, ""Bugs"" is one I usually skip.

""Route 666"" features a racist ghost truck and tries to tackle the serious and very real issue of racism, but unfortunately, it doesn't really work. The story begins when Dean's first love, Cassie Robinson (Megalyn Echikunwoke), calls him regarding the suspicious deaths of Black men in her town. While it was nice to get a glimpse of Dean's history, I wish it had come in a better episode.

Dean Winchester, of Supernatural fame, has a reputation for being a lady's man, but he proved that he is boyfriend material again and again.

Cassie herself is an interesting character, but she never returns in the series, which feels odd considering how important she was to Dean. I always wondered why Supernatural didn't have Dean (temporarily) settle down with Cassie rather than Lisa (Cindy Sampson) in later seasons. ""Route 666"" is one of those episodes that's entertaining enough on a first viewing, but doesn't really add anything on a rewatch.

 While Supernatural season 6 delivered the brilliant ""The French Mistake,"" it also delivered this bizarre episode that starts off okay but fizzles out in the end. The episode's first mistake is that it splits Sam and Dean up, as Dean travels to check on Lisa while Sam investigates a series of strange murders. The culprit turns out to be a vengeful ghost of a girl named Rose Brown (Christina Sicoli) who possesses mannequins to kill those who tormented her when she was alive.

After Supernatural season 5 ended with the spectacular ""Swan Song,"" some fans felt the series dropped off in terms of quality, and episodes like ""Mannequin 3: The Reckoning"" don't contradict that assessment.

This description alone could have led to a solid episode, but then the story takes a turn for the truly ridiculous. When destroying Rose's remains fails to stop her ghost, Sam learns that Rose had donated one of her kidneys to her sister, Isabel (Rosalie Ward). Even this could have maybe led to an interesting dilemma, but then Isabel is killed in a freak accident that ultimately ends the episode on a sour note.

Supernatural delivered its fair share of funny episodes, and many of them can be counted among the show's best. This episode, however, truly misses the mark and can easily be skipped over during a rewatch. It brings back an obsessed Supernatural fan named Becky (Emily Perkins), who has somehow convinced Sam to marry her. Understandably suspicious, Dean goes to investigate and ends up stumbling upon a case.

In a somewhat surprising cameo, Hamilton's Leslie Odom Jr. portrays a shady crossroads demon named Guy.

It's eventually revealed that Becky has been giving Sam a powerful love potion, and she considered making a deal with a demon to ensure she and Sam have a life together. ""Season Seven, Time For A Wedding"" plays this whole scenario for laughs, but it left me feeling deeply uncomfortable watching Becky take away Sam's autonomy. Fellow hunter Garth (DJ Qualls) makes his first appearance in this episode, but even that's not enough to make me want to rewatch it.

This found footage Supernatural episode offers a unique take on a classic monster hunt, but its biggest sin is sidelining Sam and Dean. Supernatural simply doesn't work without the Winchester brothers, and the characters at the center of ""Bitten"" aren't quite compelling enough to lead an episode. The episode's unique format makes it worth watching at least once, but I never feel compelled to rewatch it.

The story begins as Sam and Dean investigate a series of murders and stumble upon a laptop containing footage from a group of three college students. Most of the episode's runtime is taken up by this footage, which depicts the students' encounter with a werewolf that leaves two of them dead. Ultimately, ""Bitten"" has its moments, but the story has no bearing on the season's storyline and can easily be skipped.

 Even the worst episodes of Supernatural rarely stray into offensive territory, but ""Man's Best Friend With Benefits"" manages to be incredibly weird, uncomfortable, and borderline offensive. When a cop named James (Christian Campbell), who once worked with Sam and Dean, becomes a witch, he begins having murderous nightmares that seem to be coming true. His familiar, a woman named Portia (Mishael Morgan) who can turn into a dog, calls Sam and Dean to investigate.

While Supernatural kept things interesting, there are a few episodes that are difficult to watch due to bad writing, uncomfortable topics, and deaths.

Although James and Portia are supposedly in love, it's deeply uncomfortable seeing a woman, particularly a Black woman, wearing a collar and referring to her lover as her ""master."" The fact that Portia is sometimes a dog makes the whole thing even weirder and unsettling in the worst way. This episode is full of odd choices all around that left me wondering how it made it off the drawing board in the first place. I have no problem skipping this one on rewatches.

""Bloodlines"" is often regarded as one of the worst episodes of Supernatural, and like other episodes on this list, it shifts its focus away from the Winchester brothers. Meant as a backdoor pilot for a spin-off series, ""Bloodlines"" centers on a Romeo and Juliet-type love story set among monster crime families in Chicago. Sam and Dean stumble into the story, but they don't do much throughout the episode.

Supernatural had plenty of other characters and storylines that could have been successful spin-offs. I'm still upset that season 13's ""Wayward Sisters"" never became its own series.

Instead, ""Bloodlines"" focuses on its cast of feuding shapeshifters and werewolves, but none of the characters leave much of an impression. The story feels too disconnected from established lore to make for a successful Supernatural spin-off, so it's no surprise that ""Bloodlines"" never made it beyond this episode. Ultimately, ""Bloodlines"" felt too much like other teen supernatural dramas and not enough like Supernatural.

Supernatural's controversial series finale has its fair share of fans, but I was ultimately disappointed with how the show decided to end Sam and Dean's story. The episode has a promising opening, beginning with a classic monster hunt, but it quickly shatters that promise by killing off Dean Winchester in the worst way. I may be biased, as Dean has always been my favorite character, but if Dean had to die, it should've been as he was saving the world alongside his brother.

Despite still being divisive four years later, Supernatural's series finale concluded 15 years of television, even if some aspects weren't great.

Dean suffered so much throughout his life that to see him brought down by a poorly placed spike felt like an insult to his character. For me, the penultimate episode, ""Inherit the Earth,"" works much better as a series finale, and if I never watch ""Carry On"" again, I can continue pretending it doesn't exist. While the Supernatural spin-off, The Winchesters, helped redeem Dean's death a bit, I will likely continue to skip ""Carry On"" every time I rewatch the show.

I agree 100%

I am in total agreement with this list. I never rewatch 15/20 either. In my mind, 15/19 is definitely the better ending to the Winchesters story. And with Jack in charge why would there even be any more monsters??

I say bring on Season 16 and have the Season 15 episode 20 be all a dream. Where one of them wakes up and realizes all that was just a big nightmare. 

Friends is one of the most rewatchable sitcoms of all time, but as fun as it is, there are some episodes that can be skipped for different reasons.

According to a new, divisive Stranger Things season 5, Will Byers was never really rescued from the Upside Down in the hit Netflix show's season 1.

Joanne Froggatt talks the harrowing MobLand season 1 finale, how the accidental stabbing of Harry will impact Jan, and potential season 2.

Fans of Bob's Burgers must check out a five-season cult hit that features many of the same writers and stars, as well as the same unique visual style.

Cole Young may not be the most popular character, but replacing him as the lead in Mortal Kombat 2 may not be the best move for the franchise.

Atlus' RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army is arguably the definitive version of this cult-classic PS2 game.

TOPICS:

WASHINGTON (TNND) — Trump administration border czar Tom Homan on Tuesday announced illegal alien encounters at the southern border had fallen to the “lowest number ever recorded.”

Over the past 24 hours, he wrote, Border Patrol officials encountered just 95 illegal aliens. This, Homan said, marks a drastic contrast from the thousands per day which entered the country under former President Joe Biden.

“That is the lowest number EVER recorded,"" Homan wrote. ""On top of that, they released the vast majority into the US. How many were released under Trump for May? Zero. Compare that to the 62,000 aliens Biden released in May of last year.”



Homan continued by making an appeal for Congress to pass the “big, beautiful bill” to allow his teams to continue its mass deportation efforts.

“To continue this great work and make it more permanent, we need the Big Beautiful Bill passed so we can finish the job, to include the biggest deportation operation the American people voted for,” he added. “God bless the men and women of CBP and ICE.”

His comments follow widespread protests and riots to combat the immigration enforcement efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Homan most recently challenged California Gov. Gavin Newsom over his challenge to be arrested for supporting the display.

“No one is above the law,” Homan said in an appearance on Fox News. “If they cross the line, if they commit a crime, absolutely they can [be arrested].”

“All you hear is ICE being racists, being Nazis and Gov. Newsom feeds that,” he added.

Scientists have determined that a giant skull from an ancient human relative named the ""Dragon Man"" is actually Denisovan.

Using cutting-edge DNA analysis, scientists have uncovered the true identity of an ancient human relative nicknamed the ""Dragon Man.""

The mystery began with a giant, human-like skull discovered by a Chinese laborer in Harbin City, China, in 1933. In 2018, the man's family recovered the Harbin skull, which the laborer had buried in a well, and donated it to science. The enormous cranium features a long, low braincase and a massive brow ridge, along with a broad nose and big eyes. Based on the skull's unusual shape and size, experts gave it a new species name — Homo longi, or ""Dragon Man"" — in 2021.

But in the past several years, there has been intense debate about whether Dragon Man, who lived at least 146,000 years ago, is a separate species. Instead, some researchers have claimed that the Dragon Man skull may be from a group of ancient humans called the Denisovans, since no Denisovan skull had ever been found.

Now, in two studies published Wednesday (June 18) in the journals Science and Cell, researchers have proved that Dragon Man is indeed the face of Denisovans.

Scientists first attempted to retrieve an ancient genome from the bones and teeth of the Harbin skull, without success. But they were able to recover some DNA from plaque that had hardened on the teeth and some information on proteins from an inner ear bone.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is passed from mother to child, recovered from the skull showed that Dragon Man was related to an early Denisovan group that lived in Siberia from around 217,000 to 106,000 years ago, which means that Denisovans inhabited a large geographical range in Asia, the researchers wrote in the Cell study.

Additionally, the researchers investigated the skull's ""proteome,"" the set of proteins and amino acids found in the skeleton. By comparing the proteome to those of contemporary humans, Neanderthals, Denisovans and nonhuman primates, the researchers found a clear connection between the Harbin cranium and early Denisovans, they wrote in the Science study.

""We now have the first comprehensive morphological blueprint for Denisovan populations, helping to address an unresolved question that has persisted over the last decade on what Denisovans looked like,"" they wrote in the Science study. In short, Denisovans looked like Dragon Man.

While the mystery of the enormous skull has been largely resolved, experts still need to discuss its assignment to the H. longi species.

""This work makes it increasingly likely that Harbin is the most complete fossil of a Denisovan found so far,"" Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London who has worked on the Harbin cranium but was not involved in these new studies, told Live Science in an email. Stringer added that ""Homo longi is the appropriate species name for this group,"" although at this point, the group is small.

But Harbin's new identification as a Denisovan also requires experts to reconsider what they thought they knew about the evolution of humans in Asia, particularly in the Middle Pleistocene epoch, around 789,000 to 126,000 years ago. During this period, Eurasia was home to at least three different hominins — humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans — that frequently mated with one another, giving rise to the ""muddle in the middle"" nickname for this confusing period of evolution.

—New, big-headed archaic humans discovered: Who is Homo juluensis?

—In a 1st, ancient proteins reveal sex of human relative from 3.5 million years ago

Until now, the Denisovan group of early humans has been known mostly from their DNA and a tiny handful of fossils. This is in stark contrast to Neanderthals, whose skulls have been found throughout Europe and Western Asia for more than 150 years.

With the identification of the Harbin skull as Denisovan and the identification of a jawbone found off the coast of Taiwan as Denisovan in a study published in the journal Science in April, this means paleoanthropologists have definitive examples that other unknown skulls can be compared to.

Studies of the size and shape of Middle Pleistocene fossil skulls will remain crucial for testing relationships, Stringer said, particularly because DNA does not preserve well in most fossils, and these studies are important for identifying what Denisovans actually looked like. But ""there is certainly much more to come from extractions of ancient DNA and proteomes from human fossils,"" Stringer said.

            Barack Obama delved into domestic politics Tuesday night in a way he rarely does – and the content was pretty remarkable.
    


            Speaking to the Connecticut Forum in Hartford, the former president called for institutions, law firms, universities, members of both parties and even Justice Department figures to make “uncomfortable” sacrifices to defend a democracy he argued is increasingly under fire in President Donald Trump's second term. He suggested, without ever using Trump's name, that the US was “dangerously close” to a more autocratic government.
    


            “What's happening is that we now have a situation in which all of us are going to be tested in some way, and we are going to have to then decide what our commitments are,” Obama said, according to a transcript of his remarks provided by his office.
    


            “It will be uncomfortable for a time, but that's how you know it's a commitment – because you do it when it's hard, not just when it's easy, not just when it's trendy, not just when it's cool.”
    


            Obama specifically cited how law firms that don't cow to Trump will have to accept reduced billings — “which means you cannot remodel that kitchen in your house in the Hamptons this summer” — and businesses that resist the administration's bullying may have to deal with retribution like politically oriented investigations or mergers being held up.



            He even twice pointed to people who work in Trump's Justice Department, painting them as a bulwark in upholding the Constitution in the face of the president's threats.
    


            It was a significant call for a broad-scale resistance from the most popular and significant Democratic figure of the 21st century. And it comes at an important time, as the grassroots have risen up in protest like they haven't since the start of Trump's first term, but as the party still faces a remarkable leadership vacuum.
    


            His appearance, however, was also somewhat discordant.
    


            If you haven't heard much about Obama's comments, there's a reason for that. He chose to deliver them at an event at which audio and video recordings were prohibited. If the idea was to disseminate this clarion call to the broader public, it was a weird choice of venues.
    


            Obama never uttered the word “Trump” once. Throughout his remarks, it was clear what he was talking about. But he opted for broad generalities rather than specifics about who and what are threatening democracy.
    


            He did include winks and nods to what everyone likely knew he was talking about.
    


            “I mean, if you follow regularly what is said by those who are in charge of the federal government right now, there is a weak commitment to … our understanding of how a liberal democracy is supposed to work,” Obama said.
    


            He also warned about government being “captured by those who, let's say, have a weak attachment to democracy.”
    


            After some cheers and applause, Obama said, “Well, I don't even think that's a controversial statement at this point … It was a controversial statement; now it is self-acknowledged.”
    


            But is it self-acknowledged? Perhaps in a room full of people who would turn out to see Barack Obama.
    


            In the rest of the country, not so much. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS last month showed about half of Americans (49%) said American democracy is “under attack.” That sounds like a lot, but it's actually lower than most polls this decade.
    


            Democrats have warmed to this argument, as Trump's 2024 election has persuaded Republicans that democracy is in OK shape. But it's still only about 7 in 10 Democrats who view this as an immediate threat. And the trend line for independents is pretty flat.
    


            Obama's appearance was very much in line with how former presidents are supposed to conduct themselves after leaving office. The norm is that they resist criticizing their successors and stay above the day-to-day fray. Obama has generally adhered to this, save for when he's campaigned against Trump.
    


            But the 44th president is also talking about a historic moment in which the very foundations of our democracy are under attack. He's talking about how everyone needs to sacrifice in a historic moment, but he's clearly reluctant to go too far in using his own platform – at least for now. He's still clinging – to borrow a word – to the norms.
    


            It harks back to the generals who served under Trump. Some of them spent years inching toward publicly warning that Trump was dangerous and even a fascist threat, treating the situation gently because generals aren't supposed to get involved in politics.
    


            Their comments faded quickly from the campaign in part because they seemed to want to them to. Many of these criticisms surfaced indirectly, in books. The generals weren't out there giving TV interviews or press conferences. But that they didn't really press their case undermined the idea that they really thought Trump was this threat.
    


            Obama's decision to more subtly register these comments also comes at a time when Democrats are practically begging for a voice of authority to consistently drive these kinds of messages. The party faces a leadership vacuum like we've rarely seen, which makes competing with Trump's firehose of provocations much more difficult.
    


            There is one figure who could seemingly fill that void instantly. A Gallup poll earlier this year showed Obama is by far the most popular living president, with 6 in 10 Americans and even 1 in 5 Republicans having a favorable opinion.
    


            There are reasons for him to not want to get too involved, including so the next generation of Democratic leaders can assert themselves.
    


            But for now, he seems reluctant to step too far outside his own comfort zone.

For those of us who grew up in the decades after the Gulf War, certain shocks to the global economy seemed more an artifact of economics textbooks than reality.

Our formative macroeconomic experiences were not supply side shocks such as the 1973 OPEC embargo or Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, which drove up the price of oil and thus the costs of production. We were far more acquainted with drops in demand from repeated stock market bubbles and financial crises. For us, and the leaders of G7 nations in Kananaskis this week, the conflict between Israel and Iran is a reminder that old threats from the supply side are making a comeback.

In the almost 30 years between the end of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global business cycle was more or less defined by demand. As both the U.S.-led global order and market liberalization were ascendant, it was not supply chain disruptions and oil prices that posed the greatest threat to people's livelihoods, but the interrelated challenges of asset bubbles, currency crises and sovereign defaults, all of which are primarily demand-side risks.

Israel eyes the heart of Iran's nuclear ambitions

It is rather astonishing how stark this pattern was in that period. From domestic crises such as the housing crash of 2008 and the dot-com bubble in 2000, to events from abroad such as the Asian financial crisis in 1997 or the Argentine sovereign default in 2000, most macroeconomic shocks for nearly three decades were financial in nature. What these events had in common was that, in each case, an asset value collapsed, and the loss of wealth induced people and businesses to cut back their purchases, slowing economic activity. Unlike supply side shocks, demand shocks are not inflationary (prices do not rise if no one wants to buy things), and thus pose a far simpler challenge for central banks and finance ministries looking to get the economy back on track.

If the leaders at the G7 summit this week were under any illusions that this was still the world we lived in, Israel's unprecedented strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and key military officials last week should have jolted them out of it.

Iran's leader rejects call to surrender, says U.S. intervention would cause ‘irreparable damage'

Because oil, and energy more broadly, is a critical input to all production of goods and services, large oil price increases are the quintessential supply shock. The Israeli attack itself does not threaten oil supplies, but the most drastic of potential Iranian responses would. If Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei chooses to bomb oil assets in the Gulf states or, worse, block the Strait of Hormuz, the key shipping lane for around 20 per cent of global oil supplies, companies around the world will be forced to cut production, and consumers will see the cost of living rise again. Experts do not see these events as likely yet, but U.S. President Donald Trump's increasing willingness to get his country involved militarily is forcing Iran into a corner with fewer and fewer options.

The Israel-Iran conflict is part of a broader trend of countries emboldened to seek regional hegemony as the global influence of the U.S. wanes. But as geopolitical tension rises, so does its twin problem – the elevated risk of supply side shocks.

This was somewhat common before the nineties, as repeated wars and political crises in the Middle East put crude supplies at perpetual risk. But modern day Europeans are also familiar with this problem, since shipments of Russian gas halted from when Russia invaded Ukraine, sending European energy prices skyrocketing in 2022. Even Canada considered halting oil shipments in its trade war with the U.S. When international relations sour, energy supplies are among the first to go.

Opinion: For all the importance of G7, Canada's fortunes truly lie with China and India

But energy is not the only resource bottleneck at the whims of foreign affairs. China controls well over half the world's supply of rare earth metals, which serve as crucial inputs for everything from cars to computer chips, and around 85 per cent of processing capacity. The country has already exercised this leverage in retaliatory export controls in response to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Semiconductor chips are the key component in nearly all modern electronics, and more than 60 per cent of all semiconductors are manufactured in Taiwan, most by a single company. A war over, or blockade of, Taiwan could easily send prices soaring and grind production of many dependent goods and services to a halt. These threats would have been unthinkable 20 years ago, hence the West's willingness to allow these dependencies to grow unsupervised until now.

The economy is not even close to the most important victim of war. But in lessons from the past and present, even the most cynical Goldman Sachs analyst can see that peace pays. That we have returned to an era of politically driven supply side risks only adds increased urgency for our global leaders to work toward a more stable foreign-policy framework.

WASHINGTON—As the world holds its breath, anticipating President Donald Trump's next move on Iran's nuclear ambitions, he turned attention to a different front, installing two massive American flags, one on each side of the White House, part of a plan he first announced in April.

At a White House ceremony on the afternoon of June 18, Trump saluted as a giant American flag was raised high into the sky, while friends and family around him cheered.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"
