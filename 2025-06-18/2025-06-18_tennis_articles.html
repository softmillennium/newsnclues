                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Belleview tennis star DJ Bennett made history in making the NCAA singles tournament final the for Auburn Tigers in November. However, due to College International Tennis Association's changes to the NCAA collegiate tennis schedule, Bennett instead earned a bid to the 2025 American Collegiate Wildcard Playoff. 262 Mary Stoiana of Texas A&M, Amelia Honer of UCSB and Valerie Glozman of Stanford in the hunt for the American Collegiate Wild Card Playoffs singles division bid, but she's the only competitor to qualify for singles and doubles. “We're really proud of come out of the, you know, Belleview area is pretty amazing, because it's not a hotbed of tennis in Florida,” DJ's father Steve Bennett said. On Monday evening, June 16, Bennett, the third seed based on ATP or WTA rankings, was defeated in the singles semifinals. Meanwhile, Bennett's shot for a doubles spot in the US Open is alive and well. Auburn teammate Ava Hrastar joined Bennet in a 6-4, 6-3 win over South Carolina's Sarah Hamner and Kaitlyn Carnicella in a long-awaited rubber match. Bennett and Hrastar, the first seed in the double's tournament bracket, will play the winner of UCLA's Olivia Center and Kate Fakih and North Carolina's Reese Brantmeier and Alanis Hamilton on Thursday night, with a chance to advance to the US Open open before her senior year of college on the line.

It was my first time going to Roland Garros, and instead of dressing up in my classic Parisian fits, I found myself courtside in full Wilson gear and hitting on the red clay at a nearby tennis club. The trip was less about sitting pretty at a café, and more about actually moving in clothes that could handle shoulder season's unpredictable temps and still look good for a post-workout espresso. Wilson's latest Sport Professionals collection was launched with Roland‑Garros firmly in mind—designed to feel at home on clay but polished enough for everything off court. It was inspired by late-'90s aesthetics: so color blocking, and clean lines that pop against the red clay. But it has 2025 features like moisture-wicking fabrics, stink-fighting knits, and extra stretch. It feels dressier than last year's Challengers-core craze, which is much more in my style wheelhouse. However, what really stands out is how easy these pieces feel in so many settings. They kept me warm and dry on overcast afternoons, but still kept me looking and feeling cool during warm mid-day strolls along the Seine. Out of everything Wilson sent me, three pieces stood out right away: the Elite Tennis Performance Jacket, Peak Tennis Short, and the Daily Court Polo. They ladder up to Wilson's vintage-meets-modern vibe that doesn't feel like a costume. In fact, a colleague said I looked like an Alfred Hitchcock character (flex). It was easy to peel off and stuff in my tote without wrinkling, and it moved so well with my body that I forgot I was even wearing a layer. The tailored fit also gave it a cleaner silhouette than most warm-up jackets I've worn. They've got deep enough pockets to hold a couple of balls without them bouncing around, and the moisture-wicking fabric actually worked. I stayed pretty dry, even after 30 minutes of sprinting back and forth the court. I don't usually wear polos to play, but this one changed my mind. Made from a performance knit, it was soft, breathable, and didn't trap odor, even after hours in the heat. It made an activewear polo a whole lot dressier, and made me look like a million bucks while working out. And yes, I did grab a glass of wine afterward in a stylish Parisian neighborhood and didn't feel out of place, something I can't say for most of my workout tees. What I appreciate most about this collection is its versatility. I wore it all day—on court, courtside, walking through Paris, and even later back home in New York. These pieces look and feel like something more elevated than standard activewear. If you're someone who plays seriously, or just likes the idea of looking like you do, this collection checks every box. It's nostalgic but modern, polished but practical—and built to perform whether you're chasing rallies or chasing your dog through Central Park.

On Tuesday, tennis fans reacted with a mix of excitement and surprise as the first 16 teams for the 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles Championship were officially revealed. While many fans were thrilled to see the electric duo of Alcaraz and Raducanu unite, others voiced disappointment that Raducanu had not teamed up with fellow Brit and rising star Jack Draper, currently ranked No. “Yeah, I mean, a wise person once told me you should find the best partner, and that's what she did in Alcaraz. I don't blame her at all for that,” Draper said. “Yeah, I think she will have a lot of fun playing with Carlos. Saw that with Rafa [Nadal] at the Olympics. She's gone about and chose the best partner, for sure.

Alcaraz and Raducanu have been respectful of each other for years, and fans have been wanting them to play together for a while. The pair already has a name on social media, “Alcaranu.” “I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma,” the Spaniard said after defeating the Australian Adam Walton 6-4, 7-6 in the first round at Queen's Club. Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu at the Copa Davis/Billie Jean King Cup in 2024 (Getty Images) Alcaraz added that Raducanu was initially hesitant before saying yes, he recounted with a laugh. However, the tournament hasn't been without controversy. Several established mixed doubles specialists have criticized the decision to exclude them from the initial lineup, arguing they weren't even offered a wildcard or a chance to compete.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and 20-time tour-level champion, later identified his 2021 US Open final triumph against Novak Djokovic as an obvious win that sticks in his memory. “Honestly, if I had to choose one, I would say beating Novak to win the US Open, because it's my only Grand Slam [title], but I could easily name like 20 really big ones in different aspects,” Medvedev told ATPTour.com. First set, I didn't know what to do. He played good, I didn't play my best, and he was absolutely all over the place and didn't give me any chance. I won the US Open two weeks later.” Medvedev's 2-6, 7-6(6), 7-6(5) quarter-final win against Hurkacz in Toronto that year may not be etched in the memory of many fans nearly four years on. 11 says he sees his total win tally, and indeed his achievements in tennis as a whole, as a product of such small moments. “There are many wins which by themselves don't really represent anything,” said Medvedev. Perhaps more understandably, a 6-3, 6-1 win against Horacio Zeballos on the grass of ‘s-Hertogenbosch in 2016 also sticks in Medvedev's memory. “I actually remember Zeballos talking about it to me,” recalled Medvedev. “He said that he just came after Roland Garros, so the transition [from clay to grass] was not easy. He was like, ‘OK, I'm playing some guy who is ranked like 250', so he was kind of happy about it. “Then I beat him good, so that was a fun moment and it was of course a great feeling. I was very young, so it made a lot of adrenalin and emotion come out, and I was very happy about it.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Here's this week's Served podcast featuring special guest Darren Cahill: • Good soldiering: Surviving Ohio State premiered Tuesday on HBO. • I talked docs and tennis with the great Richard Deitsch. The ceremony for [Rafael Nadal] at Roland Garros, the venue of his greatest achievements, was entirely fitting and wonderful to watch. It got me thinking of [Roger] Federer and [Andy] Murray, who had similarly fitting farewells at the Laver Cup and Wimbledon. They were all honoured in the places you might call their spiritual tennis homes. It got me thinking of [Novak] Djokovic, whose own retirement is edging closer one way or another. Australia is arguably the place of his greatest triumphs, but it is on another continent, and they also blocked his entry at one point. He deserves every bit the same honour, and has won in insane numbers pretty much everywhere. I wonder if these thoughts entered his mind too? To be clear: We should all hope this ceremony is in 2040. No one is pushing him out the door. You're quite right to note that while Djokovic saw his greatest (and first) success in Australia, it's too fraught. He's not going to hold his valedictory in the same country that detained and deported him. Djokovic has no real Laver Cup brand extension. He can't go to Roland Garros after Rafa-fest 2025. Wimbledon is an option—don't look now but Djokovic has won seven titles at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, as many as Pete Sampras. And only seven fewer than Federer—but that seems a little off. A mic-drop retirement, courtside with his kids. An elaborate ceremony on Stephen Schwarzman's balcony. Or, he will do something in Greece. Jon, how can tennis build on that great French Open. You and Andy were right to call it one of the best ever. But how can tennis make sure this isn't a one-off? • If only there were another big event right away that could draft off these good vibes … that was a joke. For as often as we lament the traffic jam that is the tennis calendar, it's a real benefit that we have another major starting in a few days. Obviously, if Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner can meet in the final again, another chapter in a gripping rivalry, it will help. And if Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka have another showdown with the trophy on the court, that would be great, too. Short of that, one hopes the casual fans who tuned into two classic sporting events stick around. If this were a conventional business, there would be meetings discussing the precise point you raised. How do we keep this momentum going? How do we capitalize on this bump? What went right in Paris that we can incorporate going forward? If only tennis weren't so balkanized. And as in all truly great rivalries, it will drive both players to further excellence they would not reach otherwise. Let us hope they both stay healthy for many years to come, so they may continue to contend with each other and enthrall the tennis public. And why is it we so often see a player, even a great player, say that their opponent won because they themselves played poorly that day. Hadn't it occurred to them that the main reason they played poorly was in reaction and response to the better play of their opponent? Always best to be gracious in defeat. Thanks for your great coverage, as always. Looking forward to Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows! Yes, some days you play better than others. But before denigrating your performance—and this goes way beyond tennis—it's helpful to ask why. Might it be because the opponent is creating circumstances that cause you to miss? Or plays defense that stymies your offense? Your opponent has bearing on how well or poorly you play, whether you admit it or not. “Where does this match rank?” was a question in heavy rotation last week, referencing, of course, Sinner and Alcaraz. After a week of cooling off, not much shine has diminished. The match that had everything you could want in a sporting event: sways of momentum, endurance, shotmaking, mettle, inflection points, misses, defeat-from-the-jaws-of-victory and victory-from-the-jaws-of-defeat … all garnished with a sudden death ending. This match was worthy and noteworthy, as well, for what it lacked: gamesmanship, controversy, injury, rain, etc. As commentators have repeatedly labeled the Alcaraz/Sinner final as the second longest grand slam final, I can't help but think that the method of measuring match time is somewhat flawed. That 2012 outing down under between Nadal and Djokovic, the current acknowledged winner of “longest final”, was over-represented, in my opinion, given the pre-serve rituals of both players before a serve clock was implemented. I doubt anyone has compiled the actual time playing points for both matches, excluding incessant ball bouncing, but if they had, I have no doubt that Alcaraz and Sinner would reign supreme. • Another defective tennis stat: time of match.Two players bounce the balls 25 times and/or go through an elaborate ritual before each serve? Players have a prolonged disagreement with the chair umpire, stop play and demand the supervisor make a cameo? Players take bathroom breaks, sometimes dubiously to break opponents' rhythm and momentum. A spectator in the stands needs medical attention and play is stopped. The time of match stat is wildly imprecise. Watching the women's Roland Garros final on TV—it seems Sabalenka's grunting is too loud and too long and should be considered a hindrance. And why is there no correction given to her? I want to acknowledge that this is an issue for many of you. I also want to push back a bit and encourage differentiating between grunting that is strategic or gamesmanship and grunting that is the soundtrack of exertion and effort. I've always felt Sabalenka fell squarely in the latter camp. Again, I understand that grunting is annoying for many of you. I agree that the WTA's historic unwillingness to confront top players about it can come across as cowardly. Why is Chris Evert talking so much about Serena Williams. It's time for TNT to find a new panel. They just spent the better part of the pre-final panel discussion talking about Serena Williams and as always, Chris Evert continues to bring her up during the matches also. Time to move on … It's quite annoying. • No one puts Chrissy in a corner! One person says, Why are you dwelling on Serena? The next person says, Serena retired with 23 majors. The same way people say, We need more statistics, while the next viewer says, Why gum up this theater with math?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex de Minaur has personal links with both the Australian Open and Wimbledon. After losing his first round singles match at Queen's, De Minaur has given his verdict on what separates the crowds at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Former finalist De Minaur lost his only singles match at Queen's Club this year to Jiri Lehecka in straight sets. After his defeat, De Minaur headed to his post-match press conference where he was asked about British number one Jack Draper and the pressure he may face at Wimbledon as the biggest local hopeful. This is something that De Minaur can relate to as the top ranked Australian, and he praised Draper for how he has been handling the pressure of expectation so far. “Yeah, obviously I think Jack's dealing with it incredibly well,” said De Minaur. “He's obviously had a stellar year and achieving some incredible things. “I know that the crowd is behind me every single point when I play in Australia, and that's something that definitely helps me a lot kind of calm the nerves and just focus on myself.” Lehecka's Locked In 🔒@jirilehecka takes out former finalist Alex De Minaur 6-4 6-2 to move on at the #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/b7fLjG1xDB De Minaur was then asked how he feels playing against a British player during the grass court season, but he suggested that the Wimbledon crowd is more tempered than at the Australian Open. You know, probably in Australia they're a little bit louder.” De Minaur recently admitted to feeling burnt out, and has now lost back-to-back matches for the first time since February. The 26 year old produced his best result at Wimbledon last year by reaching the quarter-finals, but De Minaur was forced to withdraw from his match against Novak Djokovic with a hip injury. Playing alongside his compatriot Alexei Popyrin, De Minaur will play Lehecka again who is partnered by Taylor Fritz.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz continued his tradition of partying in Ibiza just days after his tennis coach advised against the move. The Spaniard headed to the Balearic Island to celebrate his incredible French Open win, where he battled back from two sets down against Jannik Sinner to lift the Coupe des Mousquetaires. Alcaraz's coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, told El Larguero that he wanted the young star to have a good time, but it was "no longer about the word 'party', but about disconnecting." However, it seemed that Alcaraz enjoyed a fair amount of partying during the first night in Ibiza. Speaking to EFE, the 22-year-old stated that he was "more lively" in Ibiza previously, as he chose to avoid multiple late nights in celebration of his Roland-Garros triumph earlier this month. Alcaraz said: "They were fun, but this year was quieter than the previous one. I went out on the first night and then didn't go out at night on the other two. I'm getting older and my body can't handle it anymore." Alcaraz added: "There are situations where many people might not agree, where you might think yes, but they don't agree, but in life, I want to make my own mistakes. "I'm glad that this year, people are telling me to go wherever I want, to disconnect, because the support is good for me in certain situations. Maybe in a few years, I won't be able to go, but now these moments to disconnect are good. It's the best time after Roland-Garros for those holidays. And now I can come back with more energy." When asked if anyone on his team, including coach Ferrero, tried to shut down his Ibiza getaway, Alcaraz added: "No, they didn't do it. They knew I was going to be 100%." The young tennis star admitted that his stunning turnaround in Paris even surprised himself by his own standards. Reflecting on his emotions after the monumental triumph, Alcaraz said: "I keep watching it, and I still can't believe I was able to come back from that."

Two big serving giants will meet on the OWL Arena on Wednesday, when Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex Michelsen look to grab a quarterfinal entry ticket at the 2025 Terra Wortmann Open in Halle, Germany. The two-time Grand Slam finalist is back on his least favourite surface, and an American mountain awaits him. Surprisingly, the Alex Michelsen match-up is one that hasn't been kind to Stefanos Tsitsipas. The Greek freak is yet to register a victory over his 20-year-old opponent. Michelsen boasts a 50% winning record in 2025 – his best performances include an Australian Open Round of 16 entry and a semifinal finish at Delray Beach. READ ALSO: Jakub Mensik vs. Roberto Bautista Agut Head to Head, Prediction and Betting Odds for ATP Queen's Club 2025 The 26-year-old has won 93% service games in his solitary grass court encounter thus far. Although his style of play means that he enjoys time on the ball and higher bounce which grass doesn't offer, Tsitsipas has the ability and adaptability to find success. His only title on this surface came at Mallorca in 2022. The American has won both encounters in thrilling fashion against his Greek counterpart. At the ATP-500 in Tokyo last year, Michelsen pulled off a magnificent comeback to pip Tsitsipas in the Round of 32. Stefanos Tsitsipas is the minnow in this encounter against Alex Michelsen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defending US Open mixed doubles champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori have entered this year's overhaul of the competition alongside singles stars Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka, Naomi Osaka and Elena Rybakina. At this year's US Open, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori will attempt to defend their mixed doubles crown in a brand new format that sees them joined by singles stars from Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka to Naomi Osaka and Elena Rybakina. Matches will be best of three sets with no-ad scoring and a 10-point super-tiebreak in lieu of a full third set. Sets will be short sets (first to four games, or a tiebreak played at 4-4) except the final, which will be first to six games, with a tiebreak played at 6-6). Errani and Vavassori are one of 16 teams who comprise the initial entry list, and are joined by a slew of singles stars from both the WTA and ATP tours. The only players in this week's Top 11 of either tour who have not entered are Coco Gauff and Holger Rune. In order of combined singles rankings, the list is as follows: Emma Navarro (USA) and Jannik Sinner (ITA)2. Zheng Qinwen (CHN) and Jack Draper (GBR)3. Elena Rybakina (KAZ) and Taylor Fritz (USA)6. Iga Swiatek (POL) and Casper Ruud (NOR)10. Emma Raducanu (GBR) and Carlos Alcaraz (ESP)12. Belinda Bencic (SUI) and Alexander Zverev (GER)13. Naomi Osaka (JPN) and Nick Kyrgios (AUS) Aside from Errani and Vavassori, the only players on the list to have reached a Grand Slam mixed doubles final to date are Townsend (the 2024 US Open runner-up with Donald Young and the 2025 Roland Garros runner-up with Evan King) and Pegula (the 2023 US Open runner-up with Austin Krajicek). Four teams on the list have previously competed together before. The remaining eight teams will be determined via wild cards and announced at a later date. Defending US Open mixed doubles champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori have entered this year's overhaul of the competition alongside singles stars Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka, Naomi Osaka and Elena Rybakina.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologise for the “unprofessional” comments she made following her loss to her American rival in the final of the French Open. The top-ranked Sabalenka said on Tuesday that her remarks after her loss to Gauff at Roland-Garros were a mistake. In her post-match media address in Paris, the Belarusian had suggested that the American's win was more due to her own errors than Gauff's performance. Sabalenka had been poised for victory after claiming the opening set in a tiebreak, only to watch Gauff orchestrate a stunning 6-7(5) 6-2 6-4 comeback to claim her second Grand Slam title. The 27-year-old made 70 unforced errors in the final and later said at the news conference that Gauff won “not because she played incredible, [but] because I made all of those mistakes” – comments she has since regretted making. “That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka told Eurosport Germany. “I let my emotions get the better of me. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward – not immediately, but recently.” “I never intended to attack her,” Sabalenka added. “I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, had lost to Gauff in the 2023 US Open final, where she also won the first set. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spanish sensation Carlos Alcaraz has declared fellow US Open champion Emma Raducanu will be the boss when they step out together in a revamped and experimental mixed doubles at the grand slam in New York in August. Either way, those pairings are among the 16 star-studded combinations already entered for the reimagined event as US Open organisers wager on a format they believe will make mixed doubles a winner, with the victors pocketing A$1.54 million. A single Tweet was all it took to get the world of tennis talking about an event that can be a side show in majors, with more than two million people having viewed the US Open's initial post about the 16-pair event within 12 hours of the confirmation of entrants. To be played under the contentious Fast 4 format Australian officials deployed a few years back, it will feature eight seeded combinations based on singles rankings and another eight wildcard combinations, which is where Kyrgios would slot with Osaka. Australian star Alex de Minaur and his fiance Katie Boulter, the former English No.1, could be among those to compete as well, with entries for the lucrative 16-pair format closing in late July. People are talking and the timing of the announcement struck an ace, coming not long before dual-Wimbledon champion Alcaraz was about to speak at Queens following an opening round win over Aussie Adam Walton on Tuesday. Given Raducanu is a tabloid dream in the United Kingdom, with her every move covered at length four years after her improbable triumph in New York, it was a certainty her patnering with Alcaraz would get tongues wagging. “She's going to be the boss,” he said, breaking into a smile. Alcaraz said that he was approached by US Open officials to take part and securing the biggest names is clearly important if the tournament, to be run over two days starting just 48 hours after the Cincinnati Open final, is to prove a winner. I think it is going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament,” he said. “I (have known) Emma since a really long time ago (and) I have a really good relationship with her, so it's just going to be interesting. Obviously (both) of us are going to enjoy it. I will try ... to put my doubles skill on it. Mixed doubles and doubles finals tend to be held as an add-on event to the singles finals, though they can draw a crowd. At Roland Garros, organisers open the major court to grounds pass holders for the finals, which boosts attendances and makes for a good atmosphere. But the US Open move will further the revenue earned at what is already a behemoth when it comes to making cash. During a chat with a senior US Open official at Roland Garros earlier this month, there was confidence that the timing and nature of the format would draw big attendances and also significant viewership in the latest gambit to make grand slams three week events. The Australian Open uses charity fundraises and exhibitions to boost attendances during qualifying week. Tickets for the mixed doubles tournament were selling for more than A$100 on Wednesday, but that is no surprise at a tournament where ground passes for the opening Sunday were priced at $423 on one on-sale service. “Seeing the names that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited,” he said. It is worth noting that the announcement comes at a time when the world's top players are pressing grand slam bodies about prize money amid a gulf in what is offered compared to the windfalls made by majors. At Roland Garros, several of the world's top ranked players met with representatives of the grand slam events including Australian Open officials to discuss the prizemoney percentage per tournament revenue disparity. Not everyone is happy, with former Australian Open chief executive Paul McNamee and esteemed coach Sven Groeneveld among them. “Much air play around the US Open mixed doubles entries” he noted on social media. “Have the event by all means, but do not diminish the integrity of a Grand Slam by awarding an official title. Imagine awarding the singles title if you could only use your doubles ranking to enter? Reshaping the event to reserve it for the world's biggest stars would also prove a case of the rich getting even richer, while talented players who use mixed doubles event to stay afloat are left without the chance to earn a decent cheque.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka has given Coco Gauff a written apology for her reaction after the pair's Roland-Garros final earlier this month. Sabalenka initially suggested she had lost the final to Gauff down to her own errors, rather than Gauff's performance. Her apology came after Gauff asked people to give the world number one "a little bit of slack". Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologise for the "unprofessional" comments she made following her loss to her American rival in the final of the French Open. Speaking to Eurosport Germany, the top-ranked Sabalenka said her remarks after her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 loss to Gauff at Roland-Garros this month were a mistake. In her post-match press conference in Paris, Sabalenka had suggested that the result was more due to her own errors than to Gauff's performance. "That was just completely unprofessional of me," Sabalenka said. "I let my emotions get the better of me. Coco Gauff continues a spectacular season for American women at the grand slams, battling from a set down to topple world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open final. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward — not immediately, but recently." Sabalenka hit 37 winners but finished the final with 70 unforced errors — compared to Gauff's 30. "I never intended to attack her," Sabalanka added. "I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. Sabalenka was overcome with emotion in France after losing her second straight grand slam final to start the year. Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff in the 2023 US Open final, where she also won the first set. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me." We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. Sabalenka's apology comes after Gauff said she was "a little bit surprised" by the reaction of the Belarusian superstar. "We both had to play in the wind, we both had to deal with those conditions. I didn't feel great on the court at all. "I went down 4-1 and I thought I was playing the worst tennis of the tournament, but the difference was, I was able to recognise that and find a different way to try and win that match. I do hope people give her a little bit of slack too." Gauff and Sabalenka will both be in action at Wimbledon among the top seeds in the ladies' singles draw.
